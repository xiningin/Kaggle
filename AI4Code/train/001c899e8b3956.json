For tracing trends in popularity of various research topics, no cleaning is strictly necessary, but we can exclude some obviously unnecessary articles by removing the following article types:\nBook Review, Computer Software Review, Announcement, Spotlights, Editor's Page, Roundtable]\n\nSimilarly if a given article title is present in more than a small handful of articles, it is unlikely to be a research article. Removing all articles with titles that occur more than three times in the dataset removes (by quick manual inspection) the vast majority of remaining undesired articles while stripping only a single set of desired articles. This quick procedure elimates just over 10,000 articles (<3% of the dataset) and will be more than sufficient for our purposes.","d28cd364":"# Cleaning:\nOf the more than third of a million articles ever published in these five journals, a number of them are not 'real' scientific articles. Among other article types, these include textbook and software reviews and editorial mastheads.\nLooking briefly at the article types in our data, we see that the vast majority are Articles and Communications. If we look more closely at the Articles (and in fact all of these other categories), a substatial number of them are miscategorized by ACS.","63d056e3":"# Tracing the trend of iron-sulfur clusters:\n\nWe can trace the trending of various chemical topics using regexes to search the titles and abstacts of articles in the dataframe, followed by grouping the articles by year and plotting. I have chosen to look at various terms related to my research.\n\nThe five regexes below are a very minimal set of search terms for iron-sulfur clusters and related topics studied by my former group. The first two search for iron-sulfur and -selenium clusters using synthetic and biological notations respectively. The third is for the related cobalt-sulfur and -selenium clusters. The final two are related to perhaps the most well-known biological iron-sulfur cluster--FeMoco is the cluster contained within the nitrogenase protein.","b0afe950":"# Intro:\nIn this notebook, we combine all journals into the same dataframe, then search the dataframe for terms relevant to iron-sulfur clusters to trace interest in the field since their discovery.","23684b34":"# Searching by author:\nWe can very easily search by author to view papers by a specific author, in this case my graduate school advisor.","7b1fdc7a":"Since their discovery ~50 years ago, research on these clusters have steadily increased. As might be expected, the biggest spike occurs around 1996, the year that abstracts became available in the database.\n\nThe number of articles per year seems to have levelled off in recent years, mirroring the trend in the articles by journal plot above."}}
