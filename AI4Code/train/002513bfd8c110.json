If you are interested in installing and riunning Rapids locally on your own machine, then you should [refer to the followong instructions](https:\/\/rapids.ai\/start.html).\n\nIn order to install Rapids locally we'll be follow the setup that was inmplemented by Chris Deotte in [the following kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/rapids-data-augmentation-mnist-0-985)."}}
