The second kind of graph that is frequently used to depict the data is the bar graph. The bar graphs are used to display counts of values for categorical or a discrete variable.\n\nHere we use a bar graph to display counts of survived and not survived passengers as a bar graph through the *factorplot()* method from Seaborn library.","c90c0ec4":"The method *value_counts()* which is invoked on a specific column of a data frame is another useful method to count the occurrences of individual values for a given feature variable. The parameter *'normalize=True'* can be used to get a percentage of occurrences of individual value in a specified column.","edf198c5":"2. **Sorting Values in a Column**: \nThe method *sort_values()* can be used to sort the values in a dataframe's column. It takes two arguments. The first is the name of a column to be sorted (*by*) and the second is the order of sorting. (*ascending*). Here are a few examples.","9f4d4241":"Plotting a pie chart is somewhat complicated in Python. Here we use the method *subplots()* from matplotlib and draw a pie chart to display value-wise composition for the 'Sex' variable.","8bfabc14":"The scatter plot is used to observe how one variable relates to another variable. The *scatter()* method from Pandas library is used to draw the scatter plot.\n\nThe following examples plot two scatter plots. First is 'Age' vs 'Fare' and the second 'Age' vs 'Survived'.","8460bebf":"The second way of replacing values in a column is through the method *replace()*. Like in the prvious example, we need to define a dictionaory. The newly created dictionary is included as a value and column name as the key in the dictionary to be passed as an argument to the *repalce()* method. \n\nThe following example restores the values  in the 'Sex'  column back to 'male' and 'female' through *repalce()* method. ","16cb3b5b":"4. Grouping columns value-wise:\n\nThe method *groupby()* can be used to group the data instances according to the values of a categorical variable and print the descriptive statistics value-wise.\n\nFor example, the data instances in the Titanic data set are grouped for 'Survived' ( a categorical variable)  and an average 'Age' (a numerical variable) for survived and not survived passengers are calculated.\n","cf52c683":"Another way to visualize the distribution of numeric data is through kernel density plot which displays the probability distribution. The following code segment uses *FacetGrid()* method to plot a KDE plot.","75fe440d":"\n# Exploratory Data Analysis: First Lab Activity for Machine Learning\n\n**Objective:** The main aim of this notebook is to demonstrate the methods used or data analysis and visualization from the Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib library of Python.\n\n\nThe secondary objectives are:\n1. to explain how a dataset is loaded as Pandas data frame,\n2. how the required information is extracted from the data frame, and\n3. how the dataset is visualized through different kinds of graphs.\n\n**Context:** The notebook is created to conduct the lab session for my course on *Introduction to Machine Learning* offered to the Fifth Semester Students of B. Tech. in Computer Engineering program at [Dr Babasshaeb Ambedkar Technological University Lonere India.](http:\/\/dbatu.ac.in) The students learn the basics of Python programming in their Third Semester.\n\nI usually start the lab session of Machine Learning with a programming activity of Exploratory Data Analysis. Hence, this happens to be their first hands-on session for learning Machine Learning. This lab activity is preceded by a few introductory theory sessions on the definition of machine learning, data types from a machine learning point of view, descriptive statistics, and data visualization techniques. Hence I assume the knowledge of these concepts here.\n\n**Dataset** This notebook uses the Titanic Dataset to demonstrate exploratory data analysis with Python. I organizethis notebook in three sections as follows:\n\n1. Dataset initialization\n2.  Querying a Dataset\n3. Dataset Visualization\nThese are the generic steps applicable in any exploratory data analysis activity.\n\n# Dataset initialization:\n\nThe dataset initialization can be divided into two parts. First is importing necessary modules. Here, we import Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn modules.\n\nThe second activity in the data initialization includes loading of the dataset into memory for processing. Here, we are assuming a structured and crossectional dataset. The structured dataset is usually available in CSV (Comma Separated Variables) format. By cross-sectional, I mean data instances are collected over the period of a single duration.\n\n\nPython's Pandas library provides the method *read_csv()* to read a CSV file and to load it as a data frame. The data frame is two-dimensional data structures like the matrix. It can be indexed through non-integer variables also. Further, the data frame method *head()* displays complete information of the first five instances in the dataset which is also referred to as the header\n","f01f26f6":"The *factorplot()* method can take an additional categorical variable through the 'hue' parameter. Here in the following example, we display the genderwise distribution of survived and not-survived passengers.","cdd220f2":"3. **Replacing values in a column:**\n\nSometimes, we need to replace all values in a column. Such situations arise when we want to convert all categorical values into supposing numeric values. Pandas provides two convenient ways to achieve this task. The first is through the application of *map()* method and the second is through the *replace()* method.\n\nThe following example replaces the values 'male' and 'female' in the 'Sex' column with values '0' and '1'.  Here we define a new dictionary with old values of the column as keys(male, female) and new values as the value(0,1)  in the dictionary. Then this dictionaory is passed as an argument to the *map()* method.","213d9acc":"The method *pivot_table()* is the more flexible way of grouping rows. It allows to group rows through a categorical variable and presents the descriptive statistics for multiple numerical variables.","be3525f7":"# Data Visualization\n\nPython provides diverse ways to visualize dataset through libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The objective of this section is to familiarize with different methods of visualization and how different kinds of graphs such as linechart, barchart, histogram, and scatter plot are plotted.\n\nThe first and most straightforward way is to depict a data set through a line graph. The line graph is typically used for numerical and time-series data.\n\nHere we use the *lineplot()* method from Seaborn to plot a graph age vs fare paid. Both are numeric data. In the line plot, two points are joined through lines.\n","54cc56d6":"Another way of grouping data instances or rows is through *croostab()* method. It allows to group rows through multiple categorical variables. \n\nThe following example groups rows by 'Sex' and 'Survived' columns and presents genderwise percentage (normalize =True) of survived and not survived passengers.","f1db1957":"# Querying a dataset or  DataFrame with Pandas \n\nPandas provides several methods to query a particular dataframe. The query methods provided in Pandas are as expressive as statements in any query languages (e.g., SQL) as supported by relational databases. This section illustrates the application of query mechanisms for the given Titanic dataset. \n\n**Projecting columns or feature variables** There are multiple ways to access a particular column or feature variable in Pandas. The first and simplest way is to index the dataframe with the name of the desired column. For example,  *df['Name']*  returns all the values in the 'Name' column as a Pandas's series.  Further, we can invoke the methods such as *head()*, *mean()* and *max()* on the column values returned as series.\n\n","74e6bc45":"More complex queries can be constructed to extract rows or data instances, satisfying a particular condition\u2014for example, printing name of the oldest passenger. Here, we need to first find the largest values for the age and print the data instances satisfying the condition *age == max age*.","824666da":"The second way of projecting columns and instances is to use loc[] and iloc[] methods. The loc[] method accesses columns with column name as indexes. At the same time, iloc[] uses integers as an index which indicate the column position\u2014use of square brackets[] to be noted here.","24724a39":"The descriptive statistics of numeric variables is obtained through the data frame method *describe()*. For each numeric data feature, this method displays the total number of instances (count), mean, standard deviation (std), minimum value (min), first quartile (25%), third quartile (75%) and the maximum value.\n\nThis method is quite useful to get the initial insight into the dataset.\n\nIn case the parameter 'include='object'' is specified, the method *describe()* displays the descriptive statistics of categorical or discrete type of variables. For categorical variables, this method shows information such as a specific number of values for a given categorical variable, the value occurring most of the times in the data set, and it's count.","04add78f":"The next activity is to get the meta-information about the dataset. The attribute *shape* and *columns* provide information about the dimensional size of the dataset and names of features or dataset variables. The method *info()* provides information about feature name, feature type, and whether there are any missing values are present for any of the features.\n","86910c38":"The histograms can be drawn through the *hist()* method from Pandas library. The *hist()* method takes the number of bins as one of the arguments. The histograms are useful to visualize the distribution of numeric of data. Here in this example, we display distribution of age through histograms. \n\nFrom the histograms, it can be easily inferred that the majority of the passengers belong to age group 20-40years."}}
