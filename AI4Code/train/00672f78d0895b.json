It is a derived data type. Strings are immutable. This means that once defined, they cannot be changed. Many Python methods, such as replace(), join(), or split() modify strings. However, they do not modify the original string. They create a copy of a string which they modify and return to the caller.([ressource](https:\/\/zetcode.com\/lang\/python\/strings\/))","a0a6db37":"**<h1> Let's go to the next step and built a complete sentence**","63c63ff3":"\ud83c\udfeb **HOW TO BUILT YOUR OWN SPORT NEWS AND TRENDS?** \ud83c\udfc5\n\n*Beginner project built for my students*\n\n--------------","4d1d3a0b":"**<h1> Different ways to do it:**","4e7b2a22":"**Reminder : Definition of Concatenation**\n\nString Concatenation is the technique of combining two strings.
