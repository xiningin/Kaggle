Loyola obtained 4 wins, even beating Tennesse (3), all of them where teams that during that regular season allowed on average a moderate number of baskets where Loyola was proven to be very good at. During the tournament they received a huge amount of those kind of baskets so it makes me suspicious about them not having previously faced similar offenses like Loyola's. However, when they faced Michigan, a team with a very strong defense in under basket and 3-point shots, things didn't turn out well for the Loyola offense system, scoring just eight dunks\/layups and one 3-point shot.","b3d09203":"Loyola Chicago was seeded 11 in the 2018 tournament, however they managed to get through the South Regional conference bracket reaching the Final Four participation. If you watch this team games one can observe a play that is repeated over and over again. In the offensive end one of the centers does a screen in the top of the 3-pointer line (see below footage). A pick&roll, pick&pop or penetration opportunities arise from there, giving Loyola the opportunity to score an easy layout\/dunk under the basket or a 3-point shot. Seems that rivals struggled to deffend that play, which could be a key of the succesful tournament run.","61e407d9":"<div class=\"h1\">The subtle art of winning March Madness<\/div>","a45e096f":"Distance to the arena is a variable which teams have nothing to do about.

It was some subtle peculiarities that made them progress through the tournament. But these peculiarities appear few times in history, thus few times in the data. This makes predictive model fail to find them. It is after a detailed analysis on specific matchups that one can come up with a stronger prediction based not only on the mentioned regular season performance metrics, but also based on any of a large number of features that predictive models discard.
