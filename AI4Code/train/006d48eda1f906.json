For this competition, we will be mostly matching images based on their local features\n\n2. The visual recognition problem is central to computer vision research. From robotics to information retrieval, many desired applications demand the ability to identify and localize categories, places, and objects\n\n3. A local image feature is a tiny patch in the image that's invariant to image scaling, rotation and change in illumination. \n\n4. A good local feature is like the piece you start with when solving a jigsaw puzzle, except on a much smaller scale. It's the eye of the cat or the corner of the table, not a piece on a blank wall.\n\n**The extracted local features must be:**\n\n1. Repeatable and precise differentiating from similar image\n2. Distinctive to the image, so images with different structure will not have them.\n3. There could be hundreds or thousands of such features in an image. An image matcher algorithm could still work if some of the features are blocked by an object or badly deformed due to change in brightness or exposure. Many local feature algorithms are highly efficient and can be used in real-time applications.\n4.
