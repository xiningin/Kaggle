Split the total training set into two disjoint sets (here train and .holdout )\n\n2. Train several base models on the first part (train)\n\n3. Test these base models on the second part (holdout)\n\n4. Use the predictions from 3) (called out-of-folds predictions) as the inputs, and the correct responses (target variable) as the outputs to train a higher level learner called meta-model.\n\nThe first three steps are done iteratively . If we take for example a 5-fold stacking , we first split the training data into 5 folds. Then we will do 5 iterations. In each iteration, we train every base model on 4 folds and predict on the remaining fold (holdout fold).\n\nSo, we will be sure, after 5 iterations , that the entire data is used to get out-of-folds predictions that we will then use as new feature to train our meta-model in the step 4.\n\nFor the prediction part , We average the predictions of all base models on the test data and used them as meta-features on which, the final prediction is done with the meta-model.","cf101cc0":"**Skewed features**","7343dab9":"* **XGBoost :**","a9b23d70":"* **Fence** : data description says NA means \"no fence\"","2a518f30":"**StackedRegressor**","b2d92dae":"**Box Cox Transformation of (highly) skewed features**\n\n","78e0c790":"* **Exterior1st and Exterior2nd :** Again Both Exterior 1 & 2 have only one missing value.
