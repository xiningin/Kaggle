Do you think it's a good idea that the features contribute to their gradients with different magnitudes caused by their range of values? Why would it be better to have equally valued ranges over all features? If you are not sure: Imagine you would play *hit the pot* and your like to take a fixed size step. In one dimension x you can make very steep steps but in the second dimension y you can only have a weak slope and your step results in low hight differences.

But how to predict the survival of passengers in the test set? \n\n### Deciding survival by threshold\n\nOne simple idea could be to multiply each feature $x_{d}$ with some parameter $w_{d}$ and sum up all terms to obtain a quantity $g$ that helps us to make a decision for one passenger if he or she survived or not: \n\n$$g = x_{1} \\cdot w_{1} + ... + x_{ 7} \\cdot w_{7} = \\sum_{d=1}^{D=7} x_{d} \\cdot w_{d}$$\n\n$$y=\n    \\begin{cases}\n      0, & \\text{if}\\ g > \\tau \\\\\n      1, & \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases} \n$$\n\nNow we would predict that a passenger has not survived if its $g$ is higher than some threshold $\\tau$ and otherwise the passenger survived. By forcing the parameter w to be shared over all passengers in the train set we would gain a general way to calculate the survival of new passengers like those in the test set. But with this approach we are running into problems:\n\n* How shall we set $\\tau$ and the 7 parameter $w_{d}$ to obtain the best predictions in train and test?\n* Finding the best predictions with least errors between prediction and target labels in the train set sounds like an optimization task. Consequently we may need gradients with repsect to parameters w and tau. But how should we do that with our prediction function y? Using a threshold has caused some trouble as the [Heaviside-function](http:\/\/https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heaviside_step_function) we used is not differentiable. \n\nHow can we solve this problem? \n\n### A smooth approximation\n\nAs you might have read in the wikipedia article we could use a smooth approximation of the heaviside function -  the logistic function. Let's go even one step further and take the [sigmoid function](http:\/\/https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sigmoid_function) $\\sigma$ as a special and simple case of the logistic function. Then our prediction function would turn to:\n\n$$ y = \\sigma \\left( \\sum_{d=1}^{D=7} x_{d} \\cdot w_{d} \\right) $$\n\n$$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)}$$\n\nHah, Nice! We get rid of the threshold parameter $\\tau$ and the only thing we are left off is to find optimal parameter w that minimize the errors between our predictions and target values of survival in the train set. Now, let's turn to practice:","0a9ef9a6":"Uff! Take a breather and look closely to what we have found! This is a big treasure trove! The distribution of the contributions to the gradient for the age weight is bimodal and unbalanced, as we have more positive contributions. Consequently the sum results in a high positive gradient for the age weight. In contrast the contributions of the fare seem to be very symmetric but left skewed due to some outliers in the fare distribution:","819695e4":"## Station 7 - Good enough?\n\nNow we have everything together: We can learn, we can compute the loss and make predictions, but how good is our trained model? Has it learned something? To find it out, we will finally implement a score metric. In this case we will use the accuracy score, namely the percentage of correct predictions. All we need is to make predictions based on the weights we have learned given some passengers and their features x. Next we have to make a decision, for example we could say a passenger died or survived by this rule:\n\n$$\\hat{y}=\n    \\begin{cases}\n      1, & \\text{if}\\ y \\geq 0.5 \\\\\n      0, & \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases} \n$$\n\nThen we can compute the accuracy by:\n\n$$ score = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} 1 - |t_{n} - \\hat{y}_{n}| $$\n\nIf we made a wrong prediction we will obtain $|t_{n} - \\hat{y}_{n}| = 1$ and no contribution to the sum.

You have managed the main part of this course: We have derived the loss and the gradient of the loss with respect to parameters. Consequently we can now use this information to minimize the loss and make our model learn. We will do this by using a numerical method, namely gradient descent: \n\nIt's a bit like playing \"Hit The Pot\" in a mountain landscape where the Pot is given by the deepest valley. Imagine you would stand on some hill with eyes covered. You have a spoon in your hand and every time you hit the ground someone tells you where the direction is steepest. Then, you are able to take a step of a fixed size. Afterwards you start again: hit the ground... a voice in the off tells you where to go and you take a step. Finally and hopefully you will end up close to the deepest valley and the change of your height is small each step you take from now on. Perhaps you will oscillate around it somehow as your step is fixed and you jump a bit over the deepest point. But you hit the pot and win a prize! :-) \n\n**It's worth to think about it** - What kind of problems can occur when you play *Hit the Pot* in a mountain landscape?  \n\nIn our case the heigth of the mointain landscape stand for the loss we want to minimize. And of course this problem is not three dimensional. Our landscape has as many dimensions as features. To start our game we chose some inital parameters w - a rondomly chosen point in that loss landscape. In MyClassifier this is already implemented in the __init__. Playing \"hit the pot\" now means that we make a step of fixed size $\\eta$ in the direction of the steepest descent of our loss. We will do this stepwise again and again and hopefully we will end up in the minimum we were looking for. Hence to make our classifier work, we have to implement this concept of gradient descent. For this purpose you will write the update of parameters between two consequtive steps $\\tau$ and $\\tau + 1$ for each parameter $w_{d}$:\n\n$$ w_{d}^{\\tau + 1} = w_{d}^{\\tau} - \\eta \\cdot \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w^{\\tau}_{d}}$$\n\n**Now, it's your turn:**\n\nImplement the gradient method that returns a vector of gradients with d elements that hold the derivatives $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_{d}}$.

If so, I'm glad to tell you that the water in our diving bay will become a bit more turbulent from now on. :-) We have to think about how to measure the error E between the target labels t and our predictions y of the survival of passengers in the train set. A naive approach would be the following: Just take the absolute difference of target and prediction for each passenger $n$ and take the mean of those errors....\n\n$$ E = \\frac{1} {N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} |t_{n} - y_{n}| $$\n\nWell, ... this mean absolute error is not a good idea. We want to minimize this function with respect to our parameter w and the absolute value function is not differentiable at point 0. We can circumvent this by switching to the mean squared difference of targets and predictions. In that case we would work with the so called mean squared error function but unfortunately this is again not a good choice. Why?\n\n$$ E = \\frac{1} {N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} ||t_{n} - y_{n}||^{2}$$\n\nThe mean squared error is a commonly used error metric for problems that have targets that live in a continous space. This is not true in our case. We have only two discrete values, 0 and 1, that stands for \"not survived\" or \"survived\". Consequently we should use some error metric that is related to this discrete nature. But how to do that? We could try to find a distribution that tells us how likely it is that our predictions are close to the targets. Luckily there is a distribution out there - the Bernoulli distribution:\n\n$$ p_{n}(t_{n}) = y_{n}^{t_{n}} \\cdot (1 - y_{n})^{(1-t_{n})} $$\n\nFor each passenger we can calculate how probable it is that our prediction is close to the target.

","dc599f51":"Interestingly some gradients like for the fare and age weights are much stronger than the others. But is this really a surprise? Have a look at the equation we used to calculate the gradients:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial{E}}{\\partial w_{d}} =  \\sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_{n} - t_{n})\\cdot x_{n,d} $$\n\nCan you explain why some gradients are that strong? \n\nOf course, you can: The age and the fare exhibit only positive values. Consequently the only way to balance out the sum towards zero is by opposite signs caused by the residues $y_{n} - t_{n}$. But that's not enough. Terms that balance out should have equal oppositve values that are given by the product of the residues AND the feature values $x_{n,d}$ . To balance out or to obtain small valued gradients we need a distribution of $(y_{n} - t_{n}) \\cdot x_{n,d}$ over all passengers N that is symmetric with mirror axis of zero. Let's have a look at the contributions of the age and the fare:","52d55ef1":"## MyClassifier skeleton\n\nDuring this interactive course you will code all methods we need to build a simple logistic regression model. As you might be new to python programming this tutorial provides a skeleton class that you will complete with your solutions step by step. \n\nEverytime you have finsihed one diving station you must copy your solution and plug it into the appropriate method!","cd36420c":"Nice! Ok, now plugin your loss into the skeleton. ","a1528bf3":"Ok, let's load our packages and read in the data:","1ef142d9":"## Final station\n\nVery cool that you managed so far! You have build your own classifer. Ok, it's still not working as you like but with your own classifier at hand you are now able to code diagnosis tools that will help you to find out what's ill. This way you will not end up playing silly games by trying randomly this and that and staring at the score. ;-) \n\nFinally let's see if our classifier class works as expected. ","6fe6acad":"## Station 3 - cross entropy in the treasure trove\n\nNow we have an expression for the probability of the match between the target t and the prediction y of one passenger. By assuming that the targets were drawn indepentently from the Bernoulli distribution we can multiply all passenger probabilities to obtain the overall probability that the prediction outputs Y matches the targets T:\n\n$$ P(T|X,W) = \\prod_{n=1}^{N} y_{n}^{t_{n}} \\cdot (1 - y_{n})^{(1-t_{n})} $$\n\nThis function is also called likelihood function. Next, we can solve our problem by adjusting the parameters w such that they maximize the probability of matches! Let's try!\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial w_{d}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_{d}} \\prod_{n=1}^{N} y_{n}^{t_{n}} \\cdot (1 - y_{n})^{(1-t_{n})} = 0$$\n\nOh, now we have a problem: Taking the derivative of a product with N factors. :-(\nIf this would be a sum things would become nice and easy. Let's take the logarithm of our probability and maximize that:\n\n$$\\log P =  \\sum_{n=1}^{N} [t_{n} \\log(y_{n}) + (1-t_{n}) \\log(1-y_{n})] = 0$$\n\nThis looks better! Often this log-likelihood function is multiplied by -1 as the result of that is related to the error or loss function: $E = - log P$. If we would have assumed that our targets were drawn from a normal distribution we would have obtained the sum of squared error function similar to our mean squared error above. In our case we used Bernoulli distributions and we end up with the binary cross entropy:  :-)\n\n$$ E = - \\log P = - \\sum_{n=1}^{N} [t_{n} \\log(y_{n}) + (1-t_{n}) \\log(1-y_{n})]  $$\n\nOk, to minimize the cross entropy, we take the gradient with respect to w and set everything to zero. **Try it yourself! **\nYou should end up with:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial{E}}{\\partial w_{d}} =  \\sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_{n} - t_{n})\\cdot x_{n,d} $$\n\nEven if you haven't done the derivation of this equation, it's your turn now:\n"}}
