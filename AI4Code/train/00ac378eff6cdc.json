Here's your coding interview problem for today.\n\nThis problem was asked by Apple.\n\nA fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index. Given a sorted array of distinct elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise, return False.\n\nFor example, given [-6, 0, 2, 40], you should return 2. Given [1, 5, 7, 8], you should return False."}}
