A hacker can use or generate files like this, which may readily be compiled from breaches of sites such as Ashley Madison. Usually passwords are not tried one-by-one against a system's secure server online; instead a hacker might manage to gain access to a shadowed password file protected by a one-way encryption algorithm, then test each entry in a file like this to see whether its encrypted form matches what the server has on record.
