He reached the peak of his career in 2014-2015 season with 48 goals, and 1.4 goals per 90 minutes. Though in recent years his performance starts to decline, his outstanding scoring ability still outperforms many of other forward players. Hope he keeps going as a top star into 2020 and bring glories to Juventus.","32515342":"The histogram is close a normal distribution, but the tails also have a relatively large frequency. This is probably due to Ronaldo's weak performance in his early career and recent years when he is aged.\n","0b21b16f":"That the distribution does not look normal means Ronaldo's ability is not stable across seasons.","497b2461":"This graph shows Ronaldo's goals from 2008-2009 season in Manchester United, then to Real Madrid until 2019-2020 season in Juventus. We can see the peak are made in 2014-2015 season with 48 goals.","a4d171dc":"The regression line fits relatively well considering Ronaldo's declining performance in his recent seasons,\nbut a polynomial fit would better take his early rising years into account.\nHe is trending downward after year 2014, so the slope is downward.\nNot all my error bars reached the fit. Year 2011 and 2014 are his top seasons while 2008 and this year are too poor.","7316c7d4":"This standard deviation tells that average season is about 10.24 points from the mean, which is 30.3 as calculates in HW1.","718fbc90":"The code \"from scipy.optimize import curve_fit\" extract the tool called curve_fit from the scipy.optimize to make a regression line","24ffc729":"Goals per season is not enough to tell the player's performance, but considering him as a forward player, this graph of his goal per 90 minutes is great to show his scoring ability. It also considers the scenario that he might just play a part of the game. Therefore, looking at this graph alone, we can tell Cristiano Ronaldo's peak years is 2014.","a1d1069f":"I chose the limit from 0 to 60 because it does not make sense if the goal can reach negative. The top is 60 is because Ronaldo's max goal did not reach over 50 and with error bar not above 60.","86094810":"The Season Year is marked from 2008-2009 up to 2019-2020 season.\nAs we can see from the graph, Ronaldo, Benzema, and Hazard all performed well in 2011-2012 season. Ronaldo's performance was best when he was at Real Madrid, and started to drop when joined Juventus. Hazard, Bale, Benzema, Modric all have relatively stable performance over the years.\nOne systematic error could be that the number of games the player played. For example, Ronaldo played 38 games in 2014-2015 season and had 48 goals, while he only played 30 games with 31 goals in 2013-2014 season.\nModric's number of goals cannot be marked as inferior to other players. Unlike others who are Forwards, Modric is in Midfielder's position, which means that chances for him to shoot goals are relatively small. However, comparison among all Forward players shows that Ronaldo was more skillful than others in the last ten years.","73d60573":"The printed out Season Number matches the year begins for one season.
