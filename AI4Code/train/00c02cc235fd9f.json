Tensors are basically TensorFlow's version of a Numpy array with a few differences that make them better suited to deep learning. One of the most important is that tensors are compatible with [GPU](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/docs\/efficient-gpu-usage) and [TPU](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/docs\/tpu)) accelerators. TPUs, in fact, are designed specifically for tensor computations.\n\nA model's weights are kept in its `weights` attribute as a list of tensors. Get the weights of the model you defined above. (If you want, you could display the weights with something like: `print(\"Weights\\n{}\\n\\nBias\\n{}\".format(w, b))`).","c6379c9e":"# Introduction #\n\nIn the tutorial we learned about the building blocks of neural networks: *linear units*. We saw that a model of just one linear unit will fit a linear function to a dataset (equivalent to linear regression). In this exercise, you'll build a linear model and get some practice working with models in Keras.\n\nBefore you get started, run the code cell below to set everything up.","39aea2d5":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

When you set the `input_shape` argument, you are telling Keras the dimensions of the array it should expect for each example in the training data. Setting `input_shape=[3]` would create a network accepting vectors of length 3, like `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6]`.)\n \n\n# Optional: Plot the output of an untrained linear model\n \nThe kinds of problems we'll work on through Lesson 5 will be *regression* problems, where the goal is to predict some numeric target. Regression problems are like \"curve-fitting\" problems: we're trying to find a curve that best fits the data. Let's take a look at the \"curve\" produced by a linear model. (You've probably guessed that it's a line!)\n \nWe mentioned that before training a model's weights are set randomly. Run the cell below a few times to see the different lines produced with a random initialization. (There's no coding for this exercise -- it's just a demonstration.)","42a7d8b4":"The *Red Wine Quality* dataset consists of physiochemical measurements from about 1600 Portuguese red wines.  Also included is a quality rating for each wine from blind taste-tests. \n\nFirst, run the next cell to display the first few rows of this dataset."}}
