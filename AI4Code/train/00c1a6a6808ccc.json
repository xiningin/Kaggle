Rohingya Crisis: Shameful Global Response to Genocide and the Assault on Religious Freedom, by Jeremy Barker  August 15, 2018 \n\nOn August 25, 2017, a wave of violence was unleashed against Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine State, Burma. Thousands were killed in brutal fashion and more than 700,000 were displaced. In a new report, the Religious Freedom Institute (RFI) considers the facts of what happened in August 2017 and the broader context of religious freedom violations in Burma. The report also puts forward concrete recommendations on what is to be done.\n\nThe Rohingya are not alone in their endurance of blatant attacks to their rights to religious freedom. Christians among the Kachin, Chin, and the marginalized Naga communities of Burma face are still facing rights restrictions. They are once again seeing targeted military campaigns, in some cases perpetrated by the very same units who targeted the Rohingya.\n\nThese violations of religious freedom and acts of genocide against the Rohingya of Burma cannot go unanswered. The international community, individual governments, and faith leaders and their congregants around the world, must not be silent in the face of such a blatant assault on religious freedom and such a violent act of genocide. https:\/\/www.religiousfreedominstitute.org\/blog\/new-report-the-rohingya-crisis","c886f9bc":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata   @mpwolke","60937e49":"![](https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/57052f155559869b68a4f0e6\/1534355663600-OOGZ9OY9SYS44X73JPHN\/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJanlAjKydPZDDRBEy8QTGN7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0hveExjbswnAj1UrRPScjfAi-WHBb3R4axoAEB7lfybbrcBqLQ3Qt4YGS4XJxXD2Ag\/COVER+-+RFI-Rohingya+Crisis+-+August+2018.jpg?format=500w)https:\/\/www.religiousfreedominstitute.org\/blog\/new-report-the-rohingya-crisis"}}
