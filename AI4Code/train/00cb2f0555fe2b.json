While the actual number of players continues to increase, the number of American-born players has remained constant over the past few decades. An increasing number of players are from Latin America.\n\nIn the past 50 years, the vast majority of players have played for multiple seasons. This is a great improvement over the earlier years of baseball, when in many years, more than 50% of retirees had played for a single season.\n\nThe distribution of players' ages has remained steady over the past 150 years, but the average age of retirees has been increasing due to the fact that more players are remaining past their first and second year.

Surprisingly, in many years, the oldest new major leaguer was over 35 years old. Until 1960, there would occasionally be a 16-year-old in the major leagues. Since after 1960, all players are at least 18 years of age, presumably the laws changed at that time. Since 1979, all players have been at least 19 years old.\n\nMLB retirement age has slowly been increasing. While the overall average age of leaving the major leagues is 29, there is a slight but noticeable upward trend. **Is this due to players having longer careers?**","d9a022fc":"Once we remove players who played for only a year or two, we find that there has been less of an increase in career length than it seemed. Among players who remained in the major leagues for more than two years, the median career length remained constant at 8 years from 1920 until 2000. **What has changed, however, is that fewer players are quitting after a very short time.** Players who make it past their first or second year play 7-9 years on average in professional baseball.","73b05b3f":"Data from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/seanlahman\/the-history-of-baseball, accessed 6\/17\/20","3d1e4c28":"### Dataset overview","b8778df4":"##### Career Length","0a49aa30":"As the boxplot shows, both retired and currently active players have played for a median 4 years.

Since about 1960, 70% of retirees have played for at least 3 years.","7d2014ac":"By 1960, nearly half of retiring players (including one-and-done players) had played for at least 5 years, and 20% had played for over 10 years. 70% of players who make it past two years play for at least 5 years, and 30% play for at least 10 years.","7fef8302":"This dataset contains data dating from 1871 until 2015.\n\nWhile 6 different major leagues have existed, most existed for only one or a few seasons in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

This was two years after the United States' first professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was formed.","6f0187d3":"It makes sense that very few players were born before 1840, as they would be 30 to 50 years old at the time of the Association's founding in 1871.\n\nThe number of players born through the 1890s pretty steadily increases; however, there is a sudden drop at 1900 until the numbers begin to increase again with players born in 1940. **This is likely because of the World Wars and the Great Depression. Many men coming of age around 1917 would have enlisted or been drafted into the army, and likewise with men coming of age around 1941.** It is possible that the spike at 1910 occurred because men born during this decade would have come of age between the two wars.\n\nGiven that the youngest person in the dataset was born in 1995, and the games data goes until 2015, **age 20 is probably the youngest a player can usually get into the major leagues.** The small number of players born in the 90s brings up the question of how old players are, on average, when they make their major leage debut.

The number of players born in Puerto Rico peaked around 1960 and has since been decreasing.\n\n**Most of the recent immigrants are from Latin America.** The main exception is Japan.

Since then, a growing percentage of players have immigrated to the US. About 25% of players born in the 1980s immigrated. Interestingly, although the number of players has been increasing since the 1930s generation, the actual number of American-born players born in the 1980s is similar to the number born 90 years before.\n\n**The number of immigrant players is growing. Where are they coming from?**","9363b233":"We can see that the number of teams fluctuated a lot in the early years of American baseball. Leagues were created at the same time as a spike in the number of teams, and these often existed for a single year. It could be that a group of existing teams were incorporated into the \"major leagues\" for a season. With the exception of 1914-15, there was little change from 1901 until the 1960s, when the number of teams began to grow.\n\nWe see a similar pattern in the number of players over the years.
