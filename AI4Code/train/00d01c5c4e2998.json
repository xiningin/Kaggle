Then, far behind are positive and negative phrases. This (seemingly) makes classification harder, since most phrases are congregated towards the middle\/neutral.\n\nTo train our model, we need to format our data.\n\nSince we are dealing with text, we will first convert everything to lowercase. Then, we will tokenize our text. Currently, we build the tokenizer only on the training data. We could add to the ingredients the testing data, but results may go up or down. Testing is needed to determine whether or not adding the testing data will help. After the tokenization, we also need to pad the rows with zeros.\n\nApart from that, we need to convert the numerical output to categorical.
