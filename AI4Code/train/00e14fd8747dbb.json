That's a long list, so let's break down those terms:\n\n * **function compiler**: Numba compiles Python functions, not entire applications, and not parts of functions.  Numba does not replace your Python interpreter, but is just another Python module that can turn a function into a (usually) faster function. \n * **type-specializing**: Numba speeds up your function by generating a specialized implementation for the specific data types you are using.  Python functions are designed to operate on generic data types, which makes them very flexible, but also very slow.  In practice, you only will call a function with a small number of argument types, so Numba will generate a fast implementation for each set of types.\n * **just-in-time**: Numba translates functions when they are first called.  This ensures the compiler knows what argument types you will be using.  This also allows Numba to be used interactively in a Jupyter notebook just as easily as a traditional application.\n * **numerically-focused**: Currently, Numba is focused on numerical data types, like `int`, `float`, and `complex`.  There is very limited string processing support, and many string use cases are not going to work well on the GPU.  To get best results with Numba, you will likely be using NumPy arrays.","db657b0f":"### Load Imports and Initialize Values","8a911749":"Now we get an exception when Numba tries to compile the function, and if you scroll down to the end of the exception output you will see an error that describes the underlying problem:\n```\n- argument 0: cannot determine Numba type of <class 'dict'>\n```\n\n**Using `nopython` mode is the recommended and best practice way to use `jit` as it leads to the best performance.**\n\nNumba provides another decorator `njit` which is an alias for `jit(nopython=True)`:","9d29b3fc":"That's a pretty large improvement, even including the overhead of copying all the data to and from the GPU.

There are any number of functions however, that do not fit this description. To compile functions for the GPU that are **not** element wise, vectorized functions, we use `numba.cuda.jit`. In the next section of this course we work extensively with `numba.cuda.jit`, but for now, let us demonstrate how to use it to decorate a helper function, to be utilized by a GPU accelerated ufunc, so that you are not required to cram all your logic into a single ufunc defintion.\n\nNotice that `polar_to_cartesian` below does not require a type signature, and also, that it is passed two scalar values, unlike the vectorized ufuncs we have been using (and like `polar_distance` below) which expect NumPy arrays as arguments.\n\nThe argument `device=True` indicates that the decorated function can **only** be called from a function running on the GPU, and not from CPU host code:","d12ce141":"Device arrays can be passed to CUDA functions just like NumPy arrays, but without the copy overhead:","200676b0":"## Introduction to Numba for the GPU with NumPy Universal Functions (ufuncs)\n\nWe will begin our coverage of GPU programming in Numba with how to compile [NumPy Universal functions \\(or ufuncs\\)](https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/numpy-1.15.1\/reference\/ufuncs.html) for the GPU.","9ef8a8f1":"# 1- Introduction to CUDA Python with Numba\n\nThe **[CUDA](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/CUDA)** compute platform enables remarkable application acceleration by enabling developers to execute code in a massively parallel fashion on NVIDA GPUs.\n\n**[Numba](http:\/\/numba.pydata.org\/)** is a just-in-time Python function compiler that exposes a simple interface for accelerating numerically-focused Python functions.

The easiest way to do this in a Jupyter notebook, like the one this session is run in, is to use the [`%timeit` magic function](https:\/\/ipython.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/interactive\/magics.html#magic-timeit).  Let's first measure the speed of the original Python:","f58677f1":"## Course Structure\n\nThis course is divided into **three** main sections:\n\n- _Introduction to CUDA Python with Numba_\n- _Custom CUDA Kernels in Python with Numba_\n- _Multidimensional Grids and Shared Memory for CUDA Python with Numba_\n\nEach section contains a final assessment problem, the successful completion of which will enable you to earn a Certificate of Competency for the course. Each section also contains an appendix with advanced materials for those of you with interest.","ee41f3b5":"## Review of NumPy Universal Functions (ufuncs)\n\nFamiliarity with NumPy ufuncs is a prerequisite of this course, but in case you are unfamiliar with them, or in case it has been a while, here is a very brief introduction. If, at the end of this brief introduction, you don't feel comfortable with the basic NumPy mechanisms for array creation and ufuncs, consider the ~1 hour [NumPy Quickstart Tutorial](https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/numpy\/user\/quickstart.html).\n\nNumPy has the concept of universal functions (\"ufuncs\"), which are functions that can take NumPy arrays of varying dimensions, or scalars, and operate on them element-by-element.\n\nAs an example we'll use the NumPy `add` ufunc to demonstrate the basic ufunc mechanism:","6105852e":"Python's built-in is even faster than Numba! This is because Numba does introduce some overhead to each function call that is larger than the function call overhead of Python itself. Extremely fast functions (like the above one) will be hurt by this. (As an aside, if you call one Numba function from another one, there is very little function overhead, sometimes even zero if the compiler inlines the function into the other one. In short, always benchmark your functions for evidence of speed up.)","81616223":"## Managing GPU Memory\n\nSo far we have used NumPy arrays on the CPU as inputs and outputs to our GPU functions. As a convenience, Numba has been automatically transferring this data to the GPU for us so that it can be operated on by the GPU. With this implicit data transfer Numba, acting conservatively, will automatically transfer the data back to the CPU after processing. As you can imagine, this is a very time intensive operation.\n\nThe [CUDA Best Practices Guide](https:\/\/docs.nvidia.com\/cuda\/cuda-c-best-practices-guide\/index.html) indicates:\n\n> **High Priority**: Minimize data transfer between the host and the device, even if it means running some kernels on the device that do not show performance gains when compared with running them on the host CPU.\n\nWith this in mind, we ought to consider how to prevent this automatic data transfer back to the host so that we can perform additional work on the data, only paying the price of copying it back to the host when we are truly ready.\n\nThe way to do this is to create **CUDA Device Arrays** and pass them to our GPU functions. Device arrays will not be automatically transfered back to the host after processing, and can be reused as we wish on the device before ultimately, and only if necessary, sending them, or parts of them, back to the host.\n\nTo demonstrate, let's create our example addition ufunc again:","e9f982d9":"`Next Cell will show you Error`","da6e25f3":"Wow, the GPU is *a lot slower* than the CPU?? For the time being this is to be expected because we have (deliberately) misused the GPU in several ways in this example. How we have misused the GPU will help clarify what kinds of problems are well-suited for GPU computing, and which are best left to be performed on the CPU:\n\n  * **Our inputs are too small**: the GPU achieves performance through parallelism, operating on thousands of values at once.  Our test inputs have only 4 and 16 integers, respectively.  We need a much larger array to even keep the GPU busy.\n  * **Our calculation is too simple**: Sending a calculation to the GPU involves quite a bit of overhead compared to calling a function on the CPU.  If our calculation does not involve enough math operations (often called \"arithmetic intensity\"), then the GPU will spend most of its time waiting for data to move around.\n  * **We copy the data to and from the GPU**: While in some scenarios, paying the cost of copying data to and from the GPU can be worth it for a single function, often it will be preferred to to run several GPU operations in sequence. In those cases, it makes sense to send data to the GPU and keep it there until all of our processing is complete.\n  * **Our data types are larger than necessary**: Our example uses `int64` when we probably don't need it.  Scalar code using data types that are 32 and 64-bit run basically the same speed on the CPU, and for integer types the difference may not be drastic, but 64-bit floating point data types may have a significant performance cost on the GPU, depending on the GPU type.  Basic arithmetic on 64-bit floats can be anywhere from 2x (Pascal-architecture Tesla) to 24x (Maxwell-architecture GeForce) slower than 32-bit floats. If you are using more modern GPUs (Volta, Turing, Ampere), then this could be far less of a concern.  NumPy defaults to 64-bit data types when creating arrays, so it is important to set the [`dtype`](https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/numpy-1.14.0\/reference\/arrays.dtypes.html) attribute or use the [`ndarray.astype()`](https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/numpy-1.15.0\/reference\/generated\/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) method to pick 32-bit types when you need them.\n  \n  \nGiven the above, let's try an example that is faster on the GPU by performing an operation with much greater arithmetic intensity, on a much larger input, and using a 32-bit data type.\n\n**Please note:** Not all NumPy code will work on the GPU, and, as in the following example, we will need to use the `math` library's `pi` and `exp` instead of NumPy's. Please see [the Numba docs](https:\/\/numba.pydata.org\/numba-doc\/latest\/reference\/numpysupported.html) for extensive coverage of NumPy support on the GPU.","ff5a004a":"In this very first example we will use the `@vectorize` decorator to compile and optimize a ufunc for the **CPU**.","f045e58c":"### Exercise: Use Numba to Compile a Function for the CPU\n\nThe following function uses [the Monte Carlo Method to determine Pi](https:\/\/academo.org\/demos\/estimating-pi-monte-carlo\/) (source code from the [Numba homepage](http:\/\/numba.pydata.org\/)).
