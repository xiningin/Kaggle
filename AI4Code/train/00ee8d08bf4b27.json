But, as you know, the world is actually a three-dimensional globe. So we have to use a method called a **map projection** to render it as a flat surface.  \n\nMap projections can't be 100% accurate.  Each projection distorts the surface of the Earth in some way, while retaining some useful property.  For instance,\n- the *equal-area* projections (like \"Lambert Cylindrical Equal Area\", or \"Africa Albers Equal Area Conic\") preserve area.  This is a good choice, if you'd like to calculate the area of a country or city, for example.\n- the *equidistant* projections (like \"Azimuthal Equidistant projection\") preserve distance.  This would be a good choice for calculating flight distance.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/noBRRNR.png\" width=\"700\">\n<b>List of map projections<\/b> (<a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/2kOHTBs\">Source<\/a>)<br\/><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nWe use a **coordinate reference system (CRS)** to show how the projected points correspond to real locations on Earth.  In this tutorial, you'll learn more about coordinate reference systems, along with how to use them in GeoPandas.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\nTo create your own copy of this notebook (where you can run the code yourself!), <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/5832126\">click here<\/a><\/b>.  \n<\/div>","f39f4db9":"# Re-projecting\n\nRe-projecting refers to the process of changing the CRS.  This is done in GeoPandas with the `to_crs()` method.\n\nWhen plotting multiple GeoDataFrames, it's important that they all use the same CRS.  In the code cell below, we change the CRS of the `facilities` GeoDataFrame to match the CRS of `regions` before plotting it.","67a21d39":"And, you can get the length of a LineString from the `length` attribute.  \n\nOr, you can get the area of a Polygon from the `area` attribute.","dbdc2c2b":"In case the EPSG code is not available in GeoPandas, we can change the CRS with what's known as the \"proj4 string\" of the CRS.  For instance, the proj4 string to convert to latitude\/longitude coordinates is as follows:\n```\n+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n```","f90e8e4a":"# Setting the CRS\n\nWhen we create a GeoDataFrame from a shapefile, the CRS is already imported for us. ","627990dc":"In the code cell above, since the CRS of the `regions` GeoDataFrame is set to EPSG 32630 (a \"Mercator\" projection), the area calculation is slightly less accurate than if we had used an equal-area projection like \"Africa Albers Equal Area Conic\".\n\nBut this yields the area of Ghana as approximately 239585 square kilometers, which is not too far off from [the correct answer](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=area+of+ghana).","dd95f12f":"How do you interpret that?\n\nCoordinate reference systems are referenced by [European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG)](http:\/\/www.epsg.org\/) codes.\n\nThis GeoDataFrame uses [EPSG 32630](https:\/\/epsg.io\/32630), which is more commonly called the \"Mercator\" projection. This projection preserves angles (making it useful for sea navigation) and slightly distorts area. \n\nHowever, when creating a GeoDataFrame from a CSV file, we have to set the CRS.  [EPSG 4326](https:\/\/epsg.io\/4326) corresponds to coordinates in latitude and longitude.","47098d71":"# Your turn\n\nUse what you've learned to **[track bird migration to South America](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/5832146)**.","4d28f6b0":"---\n**[Geospatial Analysis Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/geospatial-analysis)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

For instance, you can get the x- and y-coordinates of a Point from the `x` and `y` attributes, respectively.","cac06777":"In the code cell above, to create a GeoDataFrame from a CSV file, we needed to use both Pandas and GeoPandas:\n- We begin by creating a DataFrame containing columns with latitude and longitude coordinates.\n- To convert it to a GeoDataFrame, we use `gpd.GeoDataFrame()`.  \n- The `gpd.points_from_xy()` function creates `Point` objects from the latitude and longitude columns."}}
