Also, the original D1 feature is cliped, and many groups would not appear in the testing set, overfitting risk is increased (especially if you are using Kfolds as the future can easily predicts the past with this variable).\n\n\n**But** i would use it as a grouping feature (in our example: day 78 can help to identify a specific card). For instance, two cards with the same numbers (card1 to card6) that correspond to different cards can be distinguished thanks to this variable.","5f2cb144":"Again, to make things easier, we'll focus on a subset of the data. The S product category fits the needs of my demonstration.\n\nD1 feature is a Datetime since a particular day, and increases therefore by day.
