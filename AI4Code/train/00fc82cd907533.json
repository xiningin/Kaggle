A file format is a standard way in which information is encoded for storage in a file.\n\n### Why should a data scientist understand different file formats?\n\nUsually, the files you will come across will depend on the application you are building. For example, in an image processing system, you need image files as input and output. So you will mostly see files in jpeg, gif or png format.\n\nAs a data scientist, you need to understand the underlying structure of various file formats, their advantages and dis-advantages. Unless you understand the underlying structure of the data, you will not be able to explore it. Also, at times you need to make decisions about how to store data.\n\nChoosing the optimal file format for storing data can improve the performance of your models in data processing.\n\nSome of the most popular file formats in data science are:\n\n* Comma-separated values (CSV)\n* XLSX\n* ZIP\n* Plain Text (txt)\n* JSON\n* XML\n* HTML\n* Images\n* Hierarchical Data Format\n* PDF\n* DOCX\n* MP3\n* MP4\n\n\n### Spreadsheet File Format:\n\nIn spreadsheet file format, data is stored in cells. Each cell is organized in rows and columns. A column in the spreadsheet file can have different types. For example, a column can be of **string** type, a **date** type or an **integer** type.\n\nSome of the most popular spreadsheet file formats are **Comma Separated Values ( CSV )**, **Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet ( xls )** and **Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet ( xlsx )**.\n\n\n**1. Comma-separated values**\n\nEach line in CSV file represents an observation or commonly called a record. Each record may contain one or more fields which are separated by a comma.\n\n**2. XLSX files**\n\nXLSX is a Microsoft Excel Open XML file format. It also comes under the Spreadsheet file format. It is an XML-based file format created by Microsoft Excel. The XLSX format was introduced with Microsoft Office 2007.\n\nIn XLSX data is organized under the cells and columns in a sheet. Each XLSX file may contain one or more sheets. So a workbook can contain multiple sheets.\n\n**3. XLS files**\n\nXLS files are Microsoft Excel\u2019s workbook files in use between 97-2003. Later Excel versions use the XLSX extension.
