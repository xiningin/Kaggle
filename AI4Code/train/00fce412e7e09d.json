We will use linear regression and then understand how R2 and adjusted R2 differs. This will help to know why adjusted R2 is best suited to select a model with set of features.\n\n### R2:\n* The R2 always increases as more variables are added.\n* The model containing all of the predictors will always the largest R2, since these quantities are related to the training error. Instead, we wish to choose a model with a low test error. R2 is not suitable for selecting the best model among a collection of models with different numbers of predictors.\n\nR2 = 1-RSS\/TSS\n\nwhere TSS = sum(yi \u2212 yhat)^2 is the total sum of squares for the response,\nand TSS = sum(yi \u2212 ybar)^2 is the total sum of squares,\n\n### Adjusted R2:\n* The intuition behind the adjusted R2 is that once all of the correct variables have been included in the model, adding additional noise variables\n* A large value of adjusted R2 indicates a model with a small test error. The model with the largest adjusted R2 will have only correct variables and no noise variables. Unlike the R2 statistic, the adjusted R2 statistic pays a price for the inclusion of unnecessary variables in the model.\n\nAdj R2 = 1-(1-R2)*(n-1)\/(n-p-1)","48f3e5c1":"### Interpretation\n* There are several catgorical features like Sex, Student, Married, Gender\n* Balance is correlated with limit, rating, income\n* There is also multicollinearity. for example, limit and rating are correlated.\n* Valnce is not normally distributed , it is skewed to the left."}}
