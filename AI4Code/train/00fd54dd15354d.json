The chlorotic areas fail to expand fully so that stresses set up by unequal expansion of the lamina cause malformation and distortion. Severely affected leaves are reduced in size, misshapen and twisted, with yello areas separated by areas of normal green colour. The leaf chlorosis may be pale yellow or nearly white, or just discernibly paler than normal. The chlorotic areas are usually clearly demarcated and vary in size from the whole leaflet to small flecks or spots. Leaflets may show a uniform mosaic pattern or the pattern is localised to a few areas which are often at the bases of the leaflets.","d01a4703":"<h2>Basic numbers<h2>","a9d12796":"<h2>Rotate<\/h2>","adb24760":"<h2>Albumentations transformations<\/h2>\n\nPlay with different albumentations transformations and their parameters to choose the most appropriate for the dataset.","4a336043":"The train set is imbalanced.

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as chlorosis. It produces characteristic yellow or necrotic vein banding on leaves which may enlarge and join to form comparatively large yellow or necrotic patches. The yellow patches are more prominent on mature (bottom) leaves than younger ones. The infected leaves do not become distorted in shape as occurs with leaves infected by Cassava mosaic disease. Advanced symptoms on the leaves become an irregular yellow blotchy chlorosis that is most pronounced in the periphery (margins or edge) of lower leaves. "}}
