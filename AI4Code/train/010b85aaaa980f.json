This is called the wavelength and c is the velocity of light.\n* There is one more spacial feature about waves - the elongation y which shows us how far the pendulum (for example) is away from the middle. Furthermore we can define the amplitude $\\hat{y}$ as the maximum of the elongation.\n\n**What is meant now by a low frequency wave?**\n\nA low frequency means a high wavelength. Consequently when we say that we want to eliminate low frequency parts of our data, this means that we want to get rid of the big oscillations with high wavelengths we can see very clearly in our data! ;-) ","d4de4980":"You can see that the waves can cancel each other out or merge to add up their amplitudes. As there are always spacial forces acting on the arms we end up with data showing the waves above.
