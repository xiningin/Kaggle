It is available in **scikit - learn library**. However, it is always better to know how the algorithm actually works rather than relying only on the libraries. In libraries, one might not get an intuitive sense of how the algorithm works in the back end. Understanding the code from scratch would always be a good approach rather than just using the libraries. \nSo, I've coded the entire part without using scikit - learn library for logistic regression.I tried to simplify and use various functions (with the help of **Andrew Ng's Deep Learning specialization**) that are actually the ones that are used in scikit - learn in the back end. \nI've coded this from scratch and the model was able to achieve** 88 percent accuracy** on the testing set that is considered to be quite good for a model coded from stratch. \nLet us now start our journey to understand how this algorithm actually works. Before we dive into the algorithm, it is always good to **visualize the data** at hand and see if there is any relationship between various parameters. \n\n**Part - I**\n\nThis deals with the visualization of various input parameters and understand the data thoroughly. In addition to this, it is also important to discard some other parameters that are not worth much consideration. \n\n**Part - II**\n\nThis deals with the definition of various helper functions that would be later used by the main function at the end of the code. These helper functions would make the execution much simpler and divide the work flow. Therefore, just by looking at the function, one could get to know it's functionality. \n\n**Part - III** \n\nIn this part of the code, we would define the main function that would take various arguments (hyperparameters) used to train the model. The body of this main function contains all the helper functions that we have already defined. \n\n**Part - IV**\n\nThis is the last part of the code. Here, we would define actually run the whole model with **various hyperparameters** and measure the training and the test accuracy. It turns out that the **training accuracy is 85%** (approx) while the** test accuracy is 88%**. We can see clearly from the accuracy in the test set that the model is not suffering from either overfitting (variance) or underfitting (bias) to a large extent. \n\nThis is the outline of the entire code. Feel free to comment in the end if there is any doubt or query. I'd be glad to help!!","b86fa8f1":"This is the final part of the code. Here, you would be testing the model on the test and the training set and pay attention to the accuracy. You would notice that the model was able to produce an accuracy of 85% on the training set and 88 percent on the test set. The graph simply indicates that with the number of iterations on the x-axis, there is a decrease in the cost (error) of the output in its prediction. ","6b4a14de":"Below, we would be dividing the giving input and output values into 2 sets namely the training set and the test set. We use the training set to train the model and tune the hyperparameters so that it would be efficient in the test set. In the test set, we would be measuring the accuracy of the trained model.","32eaa756":"Now that you have executed the code upto this point, it is now time to put the training into practice. You may consider a patient's case where all the input parameters are known as shown in the dataset. Then you can use the **'predict'** function that is present in one of the cells above. You make take the result in some variable and then print it. In order to do the steps above, it is important that you run the code from the beginning so that there wouldn't be some bad errors. \n\nFor those who are new to kaggle who want to run the code, they may click on the blue box in the top right corner called **'Fork'**. This will create a virtual environment for the code to run. Once you click on fork, you would be in the virtual environment with all the code. You just need to select the beginning cell (whether it be markdown or code cell) and press 'Shift + Enter' to run the code from the start. At the end of the code, you may also test your own case and check the outcome. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to post them in the **comment section** below. I'll try to ensure that they are solved in a very short span of time. \n\nIf you like the code, you may **up vote**. You can do this by clicking the button that is on the top right corner. It has a box with a small arrow on top. \nHope you enjoyed looking at the code and understanding it. See you!!!!"}}
