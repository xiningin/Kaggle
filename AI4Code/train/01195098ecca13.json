Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far left of the normal distribution curve) up to +3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far right of the normal distribution curve). In order to use a z-score, you need to know the mean **\u03bc** and also the population standard deviation **\u03c3**.\n\nFor example, knowing that someone\u2019s weight is 150 pounds might be good information, but if you want to compare it to the \u201caverage\u201d person\u2019s weight, looking at a vast table of data can be overwhelming (especially if some weights are recorded in kilograms).

For instance, we use inferential statistics to try to infer from the sample data what the population might think. Or, we use inferential statistics to make judgments of the probability that an observed difference between groups is a dependable one or one that might have happened by chance in this study.
