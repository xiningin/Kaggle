For example, Charizard could belong to both Fire (his type 1) and Flying (his type 2)","9a705fcc":"### Dataset cleaning and filtering <a id=\"3\"><\/a>","859fb0e0":"#### A brief overview of dual types in the dataset <a id=\"10\"><\/a>","77c86400":"## Analysis of attributes per pokemon and type <a id=\"6\"><\/a>\n\nLet's do some analysis of how attributes varry with type.  \nMy first idea was to use a Seaborn Swarmplot since we don't have so much data that it will be overcrowded.","275a01c7":"### Attributes per pokemon and type for last evolution pokemon taking into account their dual type <a id=\"11\"><\/a>\n\nNow what I would like to do is to create a new dataset where each dual type pokemon is represented in both types that it belongs to.","a9426146":"Alright this looks much nicer! The problem with the current dataset is that it includes lower evolution pokemon.  For example Charmander, Charmeleon and Charizard are all included. I would prefer it if only last evolution pokemon where included because the selection is mostly done based on those.  \nLet's try to deal with this problem by webscraping the pokemon evolution tree from the pokemondb website. I am going to break down each step so its more understandable.","9287ab29":"## Data preparation and cleaning <a id=\"1\"><\/a>\nAfter loading the dataframe we should start with some basic exploration of the dataset.","359e8dfe":"## Next steps <a id=\"14\"><\/a>\n\nThis was the first take with this dataset. Possible extensions of the analysis could include:\n* Which type is more rounded and which is more polarised (from the looks of it Fighting!)\n* Pokemon clustering based on their stats! Are there pokemon whose stats indicate that they probably should belong to a different type?\n* Type weaknesses, which types are the more versatile, which types have the most weaknesses etc.\n* Optimal selection, which pokemon to choose in a N pokemon team\n\n### Thats a wrap for now! Thank you for reading through this kernel and I hope you liked it!!","8cc4c3c7":"### Web scraping to improve our dataset <a id=\"7\"><\/a>\n\n*Step 1: Finding the URL*\n\nThe website I chose (granted I could have found an easier one but where is the fun in that) is the pokemondb website which lists the evolutions of all pokemon in this form:\n[![Pika.png](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/qR8yX0qW\/Pika.png)](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/CBxRS3j4)\n","e6da05cc":"*Step 5: Enhancing our existing dataset*\n\nFor the analysis I would like to be able to tell which pokemon are the last evolution of each branch and which pokemon do not have an evolution (and therefore were not included in the list at all). \nFor example: Charmander is the first in the Charmander-Charmeleon-Charizard evolution tree and I would like to exclude him from the analysis. Snorlax on the other hand has no evolution and I would like to include him in the analysis\n\nTherefore, I would like to create 2 lists, one with all the pokemon that belong to an evolution branch and one with pokemon that are the last of an evolution branch.","86f9276f":"Ok this seems kinda odd, the second generation had 251 Pokemon in total if I remember correctly so there have to be overlaps here. Let's see what might the problem be and resolve it.","189eb336":"## Introduction\n\nThis is my first Kaggle kernel, so I decided to start working on something that occupied a lot of my child-teenage years, Pokemon!  \nI wanted to analyse how various pokemon types and attributes compare in Gens 1 and 2 (as these are the ones I actually got to play) with some visuals and in the process I ended up doing some webscraping to enhance a bit the dataset.  \n#### Let's get started!\n","b764b40d":"Overall, the types look more rounded in this view as we have included more pokemon into each type subset.\nWe also managed to make the Dragon type look more down to earth now (Kingdra was added to the mix!).","bfdd2ac1":"*Step 4: Dataset cleaning*\n\nNow that we have extracted the data, we definitely need to do some filtering:\n* Remove all the pokemon that have 'alolan' in their name as these are from newer generations I assume\n* Remove all pokemon with a number higher than 251, as these are again from newer generations\n* Remove all remaining entries that have 1 or less entries from the list","359ae4ac":"## Pokemon attributes and how they relate to each other <a id=\"4\"><\/a>\n\nSince we have 251 pokemon and 6 attributes for each of them I thought I would do a breakdown how they relate to each other.  \nDo pokemon with higher defence have also higher attack? Are fast pokemon also good defensively?  \nTo that end I decided to use a pairgrid from Seaborn. Its quite a customisable grid where you can map different types of plots in the upper triangle, lower triangle and diagonal axes.  \nThe figure produced has three plots:\n* Upper triangle --> Scatter plot for each pokemon with orange indicating legendary pokemon (Seaborn scatterplot)\n* Diagonal --> Kernel density plot for each attribute (Seabon kdplot)\n* Lower triangle --> Scatter plot with a linear regression model fit (Seaborn regplot)","38b49d36":"We are at the end of the process, we have a list of pokemon that belong to an evolution branch and we also have a list of pokemon that are the last evolutions. Let's go ahead and update our initial dataset","02b2059c":"We can observe the following from the two charts above:\n* Flying is the most popular type 2 by far\n* Normal-Flying is the most popular combination, with 4 pairs coming in second with 3 occurences Bug-Flying, Bug-Poison, Grass-Poison and Water-Ice\n* Water as Type 1 has the most pokemon with a second type and also the most variety","02a7abce":"### Attributes per pokemon and type for only last evolution pokemon <a id=\"8\"><\/a>","b254552b":"Turns out I missed Sp.
