Only small group in this field has good salary, yet, their salary is pretty high.\n\nYes, Degree and years of experiences have good influence on salary, which means your degree and years of experiences help you to get some money. But not much money, and also has weak impact. If we put the tresshold of decision parameter to decide, is Degree and years of Experience helping you get money?, at 40,000dollar, so the answer is absolutely not.\n\nTo get better salary (bigger than 40,000 dollar), your degree and years experiences is not help much and not relevant anymore. You have to upgrade your skills and learn new tools, choose difficult and high paid roles.
