For a company to expand its clientele, its growth rate, as measured by the number of new customers, must exceed its churn rate. This rate is generally expressed as a percentage.\n \n \n** Why is churn so important?**\n\nCustomer churn (also known as customer attrition, customer turnover or customer defection) is a term used especially in the world of subscription based businesses to describe loss of customers. For example, if 10 out of 100 subscribers to an Internet service provider (ISP) cancelled their subscriptions, the churn rate for that ISP would be 10%.\n\nChurn is important because it directly affects your service\u2019s profitability. It is common to assume that the profitability of a service is directly related to the growth of its customer base. That might lead business owners to imply that in order to grow their customer base, the rate of acquiring new customers must exceed the churn rate.","649a061a":"### State-wise Voice mail Count","c880037d":"### Churn Ratio Count "}}
