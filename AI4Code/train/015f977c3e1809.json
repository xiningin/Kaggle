And according with the dataset we used, These are some of the conclusions:\n\n* Data scientist is clearly the most wanted rol by companies. To me, this is because the term \"Data scientist\" is broadly use to reffered to some that work with data and what that means for a company do not necessary means for the others.\n\n* Tech giants like Google and Amazon are the ones who have more open roles. Follow by other traditional well known companies.\n\n* London appears as the city with more available jobs, however data shows us that there are plenty of opportunities accross the globe.\n\n#### So, there are many and diverse jobs available, great companies are looking for talent and there are opportunities in many locations. My biggest conclusion is that:\n### It is an exciting time to work in the data science industry!!!","0ef649fb":"If we look the company column closely. The values have a little typo at the beginning. So let's remove it."}}
