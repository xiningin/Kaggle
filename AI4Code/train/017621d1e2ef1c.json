We can look at the percentage of missing values, the correlations of variables with the target, and also the correlation of variables with the other variables. The correlations between variables can show if we have collinear varibles, that is, variables that are highly correlated with one another. Often, we want to remove one in a pair of collinear variables because having both variables would be redundant. We can also use the percentage of missing values to remove features with a substantial majority of values that are not present. __Feature selection__ will be an important focus going forward, because reducing the number of features can help the model learn during training and also generalize better to the testing data. The \"curse of dimensionality\" is the name given to the issues caused by having too many features (too high of a dimension). As the number of variables increases, the number of datapoints needed to learn the relationship between these variables and the target value increases exponentially. \n\nFeature selection is the process of removing variables to help our model to learn and generalize better to the testing set. The objective is to remove useless\/redundant variables while preserving those that are useful. There are a number of tools we can use for this process, but in this notebook we will stick to removing columns with a high percentage of missing values and variables that have a high correlation with one another. Later we can look at using the feature importances returned from models such as the `Gradient Boosting Machine` or `Random Forest` to perform feature selection.","ecbd45ab":"### Aggregated Stats of Bureau Dataframe","7bc31030":"For each of these pairs of highly correlated variables, we only want to remove one of the variables.

We will just need to pass in the data to the function, which does most of the work for us.","eef6cb1b":"## Categorical Variables\n\nNow we move from the numeric columns to the categorical columns. These are discrete string variables, so we cannot just calculate statistics such as mean \nand max which only work with numeric variables. Instead, we will rely on calculating value counts of each category within each categorical variable. As an example, if we have the following dataframe:\n\n| SK_ID_CURR | Loan type |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | home      |\n| 1          | home      |\n| 1          | home      |\n| 1          | credit    |\n| 2          | credit    |\n| 3          | credit    |\n| 3          | cash      |\n| 3          | cash      |\n| 4          | credit    |\n| 4          | home      |\n| 4          | home      |\n\nwe will use this information counting the number of loans in each category for each client. \n\n| SK_ID_CURR | credit count | cash count | home count | total count |\n|------------|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| 1          | 1            | 0          | 3          | 4           |\n| 2          | 1            | 0          | 0          | 1           |\n| 3          | 1            | 2          | 0          | 3           |\n| 4          | 1            | 0          | 2          | 3           |\n\n\nThen we can normalize these value counts by the total number of occurences of that categorical variable for that observation (meaning that the normalized counts must sum to 1.0 for each observation).\n\n| SK_ID_CURR | credit count | cash count | home count | total count | credit count norm | cash count norm | home count norm |\n|------------|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| 1          | 1            | 0          | 3          | 4           | 0.25              | 0               | 0.75            |\n| 2          | 1            | 0          | 0          | 1           | 1.00              | 0               | 0               |\n| 3          | 1            | 2          | 0          | 3           | 0.33              | 0.66            | 0               |\n| 4          | 1            | 0          | 2          | 3           | 0.33              | 0               | 0.66            |\n\nHopefully, encoding the categorical variables this way will allow us to capture the information they contain.

The r-value is not best measure of the \"usefulness\" of a new variable, but it can give a first approximation of whether a variable will be helpful to a machine learning model.

The `agg` function will only calculate the values for the numeric columns where the operation is considered valid.

","d25f7024":"The definition of this column is: \"How many days before current application did client apply for Credit Bureau credit\". My interpretation is this is the number of days that the previous loan was applied for before the application for a loan at Home Credit. Therefore, a larger negative number indicates the loan was further before the current loan application. We see an extremely weak positive relationship between the average of this variable and the target meaning that clients who applied for loans further in the past potentially are more likely to repay loans at Home Credit. With a correlation this weak though, it is just as likely to be noise as a signal. \n\n#### The Multiple Comparisons Problem\n\nWhen we have lots of variables, we expect some of them to be correlated just by pure chance, a [problem known as multiple comparisons](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/the-multiple-comparisons-problem-e5573e8b9578). We can make hundreds of features, and some will turn out to be corelated with the target simply because of random noise in the data. Then, when our model trains, it may overfit to these variables because it thinks they have a relationship with the target in the training set, but this does not necessarily generalize to the test set. There are many considerations that we have to take into account when making features! ","05833c09":"This variable represents the average number of monthly records per loan for each client. For example, if a client had three previous loans with 3, 4, and 5 records in the monthly data, the value of this variable for them would be 4. Based on the distribution, clients with a greater number of average monthly records per loan were more likely to repay their loans with Home Credit. Let's not read too much into this value, but it could indicate that clients who have had more previous credit history are generally more likely to repay a loan.","4a31bbcc":"Well this distribution is all over the place. This variable represents the number of previous loans with a `CREDIT_ACTIVE` value of `Active` divided by the total number of previous loans for a client. The correlation here is so weak that I do not think we should draw any conclusions! ","d55baf05":"## Example: Counts of a client's previous loans\n\nTo illustrate the general process of manual feature engineering, we will first simply get the count of a client's previous loans at other financial institutions. This requires a number of Pandas operations we will make heavy use of throughout the notebook:\n\n* `groupby`: group a dataframe by a column. In this case we will group by the unique client, the `SK_ID_CURR` column\n* `agg`: perform a calculation on the grouped data such as taking the mean of columns. We can either call the function directly (`grouped_df.mean()`) or use the `agg` function together with a list of transforms (`grouped_df.agg([mean, max, min, sum])`)\n* `merge`: match the aggregated statistics to the appropriate client. We need to merge the original training data with the calculated stats on the `SK_ID_CURR` column which will insert `NaN` in any cell for which the client does not have the corresponding statistic\n\nWe also use the (`rename`) function quite a bit specifying the columns to be renamed as a dictionary. This is useful in order to keep track of the new variables we create.\n\nThis might seem like a lot, which is why we'll eventually write a function to do this process for us. Let's take a look at implementing this by hand first. ","25034331":"We can remove these columns from both the training and the testing datasets. We will have to compare performance after removing these variables with performance keeping these variables (the raw csv files we saved earlier).","121453a5":"### Counts of Bureau Dataframe","62b6b00b":"# Results\n\nAfter all that work, we can say that including the extra information did improve performance! The model is definitely not optimized to our data, but we still had a noticeable improvement over the original dataset when using the calculated features. Let's officially summarize the performances:\n\n| __Experiment__ | __Train AUC__ | __Validation AUC__ | __Test AUC__  |\n|------------|-------|------------|-------|\n| __Control__    | 0.815 | 0.760      | 0.745 |\n| __Test One__   | 0.837 | 0.767      | 0.759 |\n| __Test Two__   | 0.826 | 0.765      | 0.753 |\n\n\n(Note that these scores may change from run to run of the notebook. I have not observed that the general ordering changes however.)\n\nAll of our hard work translates to a small improvement of 0.014 ROC AUC over the original testing data. Removing the highly collinear variables slightly decreases performance so we will want to consider a different method for feature selection. Moreover, we can say that some of the features we built are among the most important as judged by the model. \n\nIn a competition such as this, even an improvement of this size is enough to move us up 100s of spots on the leaderboard. By making numerous small improvements such as in this notebook, we can gradually achieve better and better performance. I encourage others to use the results here to make their own improvements, and I will continue to document the steps I take to help others. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nGoing forward, we can now use the functions we developed in this notebook on the other datasets. There are still 4 other data files to use in our model! In the next notebook, we will incorporate the information from these other data files (which contain information on previous loans at Home Credit) into our training data. Then we can build the same model and run more experiments to determine the effect of our feature engineering. There is plenty more work to be done in this competition, and plenty more gains in performance to be had!

The resulting KDE will show any significant differences in the distribution of the variable between people who did not repay their loan (`TARGET == 1`) and the people who did (`TARGET == 0`).

In an earlier notebook, we used only the `application` data in order to build a model. The best model we made from this data achieved a score on the leaderboard around 0.74. In order to better this score, we will have to include more information from the other dataframes. Here, we will look at using information from the `bureau` and `bureau_balance` data. The definitions of these data files are:\n\n* bureau: information about client's previous loans with other financial institutions reported to Home Credit. Each previous loan has its own row.\n* bureau_balance: monthly information about the previous loans. Each month has its own row.\n\nManual feature engineering can be a tedious process (which is why we use automated feature engineering with featuretools!) and often relies on domain expertise. **Since I have limited domain knowledge of loans and what makes a person likely to default, I will instead concentrate of getting as much info as possible into the final training dataframe. The idea is that the model will then pick up on which features are important rather than us having to decide that. Basically, our approach is to make as many features as possible and then give them all to the model to use!** Later, we can perform feature reduction using the feature importances from the model or other techniques such as PCA. \n\nThe process of manual feature engineering will involve plenty of Pandas code, a little patience, and a lot of great practice manipulation data. Even though automated feature engineering tools are starting to be made available, feature engineering will still have to be done using plenty of data wrangling for a little while longer. ","e6fdfd22":"The `sum` columns represent the count of that category for the associated client and the `mean` represents the normalized count. One-hot encoding makes the process of calculating these figures very easy!\n\nWe can use a similar function as before to rename the columns. Again, we have to deal with the multi-level index for the columns. We iterate through the first level (level 0) which is the name of the categorical variable appended with the value of the category (from one-hot encoding). Then we iterate  stats we calculated for each client. We will rename the column with the level 0 name appended with the stat. As an example, the column with `CREDIT_ACTIVE_Active` as level 0 and `sum` as level 1 will become `CREDIT_ACTIVE_Active_count`. ","122bbbc9":"We need to create new names for each of these columns.
