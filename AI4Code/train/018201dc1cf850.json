In this section, another class of process models, Directly-Follows Graphs, are introduced. Directly-Follows graphs are graphs where the nodes represent the events\/activities in the log and directed edges are present between nodes if there is at least a trace in the log where the source event\/activity is followed by the target event\/activity. On top of these directed edges, it is easy to represent metrics like frequency (counting the number of times the source event\/activity is followed by the target event\/activity) and performance (some aggregation, for example, the mean, of time inter-lapsed between the two events\/activities).\n\nFirst, we have to import the log. Subsequently, we can extract the Directly-Follows Graph. In addition, code is provided to visualize the Directly-Follows Graph. This visualization is a colored visualization of the Directly-Follows graph that is decorated with the frequency of activities.\n","d65a8634":"# Quick pm4py hello world\n\nhttps:\/\/pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de\/","e13d244d":"To get a Directly-Follows graph decorated with the performance between the edges, two parameters of the previous code have to be replaced.","3f2a6134":"Example log\n\n```\n<event>\n<string key=\"concept:name\" value=\"reinitiate request\"\/>\n<string key=\"org:resource\" value=\"Sara\"\/>\n<date key=\"time:timestamp\" value=\"2011-01-11T16:18:00.000+01:00\"\/>\n<string key=\"Activity\" value=\"reinitiate request\"\/>\n<string key=\"Resource\" value=\"Sara\"\/>\n<string key=\"Costs\" value=\"200\"\/>\n<\/event>\n```\n\n"}}
