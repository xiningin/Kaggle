the better model in the future.\n\n1. Data is multilingual that is why it's rational to prefer those models that can handle multilingual input data and can take out the semantics not depending on language as we train on english , test on non-english\n2. Classes are unbalanced - which can cause a significant problem for model to converge. That is why, it is necessary to apply some methods to handle it\n3. Validation dataset can be a good reflection of the test dataset, that is why we can rely on metrics computed on it","e71b8ec3":"We see that toxic == 0.5 is quite different from toxic == 1. Although, from examples it can be seen that toxic >= 0.5 are more likely toxic than non-toxic, from my point of view. Of course, it is still questionable which boarder is the best, but I decide to take 0.5. However, to give to the future model the information that originally not all the labels are straight zeros and ones we can apply technique called labels smoothing. The goal of this technique is to force the model to be less confident in its predictions - so to make resulting predicted probabilites closer to 0.5 than to 0 and 1. This can be reached by assigning downsizing labels == 1 and upsizing labels == 0 in training process due to some distribution for example uniform. \n\nHere is the nice guide to label smoothing https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/label-smoothing-making-model-robust-to-incorrect-labels-2fae037ffbd0","ba2fd19e":"These are my following notebooks:\n\n1. https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/vgodie\/first-baseline - there I'm considering different methods to approach the problem and show to set up zero baseline with BERT architecture\n2. https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/vgodie\/class-balancing - there I share my ideas on how to fight unbalanced classes problem\n3. https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/vgodie\/data-encoding - there I show how to make custom preprocessing data for more sophisticated models such as XLM-Roberta, however this notebook can be used as a template for the preprocessing for any transformer model\n4. https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/vgodie\/xlm-roberta - and finally I build and train my best model with all data preparations and techniques discussed in the previous notebook","5cf25534":"From this data we need to decide which parts we can use as toxic, and which as non-toxic for training, as we need labels to be either 0 or 1","f012fb9e":"We have 4 datasets provided:\n\n1) ~224k examples train dataset with english comment and binary target label (either 0 or 1)\n\n2) ~1,87M examples train datset with english commentsand  target label varying berween 0 and 1 - estimation of probability to be target\n\n3) 8k examples validation dataset with data in several non-english languages\n\n4) ~63k examples test data with data in several non-english languages\n\n\nLet's take a more detailed look to each piece of the data","6ef75152":"So we see that there are lots of totaly non-toxic comments and a few probably toxic - approximately the same we've seen in the small datasets - so the problem of unbalanced classes occurs again","53fe6bb2":"Also for training we have larger dataset with comments, though toxicity there is distributed between 0 and 1.","d9f69c14":"In validation dataset we have data in 3 languages: turkish, spanish and italian - approximately the same number of samples for each\n\nClass proportions are simillar to the training data we have, however train data differs from validation significantly because of the language.

And as you can see from my following notebooks - results on validation and test are very close, which is very important for monitoring model quality while training","ebd94fb7":"Although it is not the most enjoyable actitivity, you can get more intuition about what means toxic by reading more comments.

I'm Ivan Lipatov, 3rd year student of Higher School of Economics from Russia. I'm deeply interested in ML and DL topics and recently I've started my way up to the top on Kaggle. At time of posting this notebook I'm taking part in Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification and already have reached quite high results. That is why I decided to post a series of notebooks that show a sequential process of investigation of the competition problem. The aim of my work is not to teach Kaggle grandmasters how to win competitions, but to help those, who are only at the beginning of their Kaggle way, because as I've learned the most difficult part is to start :) \n\n(don't think that next stages of Ml research will be free lunch for you - there will be much work to do, but as far as you plunge into competition spirit it gets much easier to make your way through)"}}
