It is a huge turnaround for the coastal state, which reported the first coronavirus case in India on January 30. The patient was a student who had returned from ground zero of the virus -- Wuhan in China. By February 3, two more students who had returned from Wuhan, and were in home quarantine, tested positive.\n\nBut the spread was largely contained until March 8, when a family of three that returned from Italy to Pathanamthitta, tested positive. Five of their primary contacts were infected, including their elderly parents and a nurse treating them. However, all have recovered and are back home.\n\nA majority of the cases in Kerala are people who returned from abroad - which is around 232.\n\nFrom releasing exhaustive route maps of positive cases, to mobile tracking applications of people in quarantine, to massive mobilisation of police force to enforce the lockdown as well as essential services, Kerala has been shown itself to be firmly in control of the global pandemic. Over 30,000 health workers, including Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) workers intensified their follow-up with families in isolation.\n\nWith Rapid testing and exhaustive route maps kerala was able to do this. Other states have to take this a their workplan and to eradicate corona once in for all.\n","4d42e2c5":"These testing are carried out for primary contacts and possible contacts. ","f03830a7":"From the above plot, it is clear that testing in mass scale is a massive task and is impossible at this time.","631fc73a":"It could been seen that that the age group **under 40 is the most affected** and only 17% of people above 60 are affected. This is against the trend which says elderly people are more at risk of being affected. \n","312209d1":"# Which age groups are affected the most!","c1ab73b7":"# Healthcare capacities in India","26396b23":"As so many date are missing(which is more than 65%), the exact gender-wise density is still not clear.

At the primary level are Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres (PHCs). At the secondary level there are Community Health Centres (CHCs) and smaller Sub-District hospitals. Finally, the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level, which consists of Medical Colleges and District Hospitals. \n\nTertiary level of medical care is required to treat Covid-19 as it is necessary to isolate all the patients ranging from mild to critical symptoms. In most of the Indian states, Distict hospitals and goverment medical colleges are considered for housing patients with this virus.\n\nThe below is the representation of state-wise hospital.","aaed39dc":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n\n    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.\n","9fcc962a":"# Statistical details of COVID-19 in India"}}
