My point here is that agencies that priorize the internal recruitment than external appreciate more they employeers.\n\n**Mean of minimum wage by business title:**\nKnow the minimum expected wage for each business title\n\n**Division Units jobs by agencies:**\nSee how many jobs we have for each division unit, by agency.","825e36b1":"In the table we can see that our racional between External\/Internal jobs almost never pass 0.5, here we have only **Business Integrity Comission** with a rational of 0.6\n\nSo agencies are not priorizing external than internal, or they are equal or we have more internal opportunities than external. This is good."}}
