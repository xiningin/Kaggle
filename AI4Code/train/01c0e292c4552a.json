A couple of ideas that I've seen used a few times are using deeper neural networks with more hidden layers, and one hot encoding the user and item data together into a single input layer.\n\nThat's what you see in this architecture printed out from Keras.\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n> Credit: https:\/\/nipunbatra.github.io\/blog\/2017\/recommend-keras.html\n\nItems are embedded on the left side, and users on the right. Both are flattened, and a dropout layer applied to prevent overfitting, and then they are concatenated together before feeding it all into a deep neural network.\n\nBut it still has the problem of not being able to distinguish between missing ratings and ratings of a value zero.\n\nFundamentally, it models missing ratings as a signal that a user really, really hated a given item, and that's just not an accurate representation of reality.\n\nIn the end, this particular network was unable to outperform matrix factorization on the [ML100K](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/snehal1409\/movielens) dataset. \n\nIn part, it's due to the sparsity of the data, and it's also because 100,000 ratings just isn't anywhere near enough data to train a network as complex as this.\n\nThey actually can work quite well once you have the right tools. It's not hard, however, to implement an autoencoder in TensorFlow that just treats missing ratings as zero values, so let's give it a shot and see for ourselves how well it does.","86392981":"# Preparing data :\n","e586f713":"# Evaluated Algorithm :","c3467c06":"# AutoRec Driver Module\n\nThere's not much to talk about in what it does. It just uses our framework to compare Auto Rec to random recommendations as we've done before.\n\nRun the next cell and it will take several minutes for it to do all of its work as we've set this up to do all of the top end metrics as well as generate some sample top-N recommendations so we can get a more comprehensive picture of how its doing.\n","10cf5d38":"# Evaluator Module :\n\n","be1c4ddf":"We mentioned that [restricted Boltzmann machines](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alirezanematolahy\/recommender-system-with-rbms) were a very early type of neural network and the field of deep learning has evolved considerably since then.\n\nWhat happens if we apply a more contemporary neural network to the problem?\n> Well, as we'll see, it's possible, but not without its challenges.\n\nPeople started using deeper neural networks for recommender systems in 2015,which seems pretty recent but it's a long time in the context of current AI research.\n\nA group from the Australian National University published a paper called AutoRec: [Autoencoders Meet Collaborative Filtering](http:\/\/users.cecs.anu.edu.au\/~akmenon\/papers\/autorec\/autorec-paper.pdf) and they used the topology you see here.","36bba089":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nIt looks a lot more familiar to the sorts of networks covered in [introduction to deep learning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-deep-learning). \n\nYou have three layers:\n1. an input layer on the bottom that contains individual ratings.\n2. a hidden layer. \n3. an output layer that gives us our predictions.\n\nA matrix of weights between the layers is maintained across every instance of this network, as well as a bias node for both the hidden and output layers.\n\nIn the [paper](http:\/\/users.cecs.anu.edu.au\/~akmenon\/papers\/autorec\/autorec-paper.pdf), they trained the network once per item, feeding in ratings from each user for that item in the input layer.\n\nA sigmoid activation function was used on the output.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty straightforward approach, and they reported slightly better results compared to using an [RBM](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alirezanematolahy\/recommender-system-with-rbms).\n\nBut the implementation is a bit different. [RBMs](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alirezanematolahy\/recommender-system-with-rbms) just had separate bias terms for each pass, while here we have a whole separate set of weights to work with too.\nThis sort of architecture also has the benefit of being a lot easier to implement in modern frameworks such as TensorFlow or Keras. But there's still one wrinkle:\n> the sparsity of the data we are working with.\n\nIn the [paper](http:\/\/users.cecs.anu.edu.au\/~akmenon\/papers\/autorec\/autorec-paper.pdf) they briefly mentioned that \"We only consider the contribution of observed ratings.\" So they were careful to process each path through this neural network individually, only propagating information from ratings that actually exist in the training data, and ignoring the contribution from input nodes that correspond to missing data from user-item pairs that weren't rated at all.\nThis is still a tough thing to do in TensorFlow. While TensorFlow does have sparse tensors, there's no simple way to restrict the chain of matrix multiplications and additions needed to implement a neural network to just the input nodes with actual data in them.\n\nAny implementation you'll find of this using TensorFlow or Keras just ignores that problem, and models missing ratings as zeroes. You can still get decent results with enough effort, but it's a very fundamental problem to applying deep learning to recommender systems.\n\n\nThis architecture is referred to as an autoencoder. The act of building up the weights and biases between the input and hidden layer is referred to as encoding the input.\n\nWe are encoding the patterns in the input as a set of weights into that hidden layer.\n\nThen as we reconstruct the output in the weights between the hidden and output layers we are decoding it.\n\nSo the first set of weights is the encoding stage and the second set is the decoding stage.\n\nConceptually, this isn't really any different from what we were doing with [RBMs](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alirezanematolahy\/recommender-system-with-rbms). In an RBM we encoded on the forward pass and decoded on the backward pass.","db9c3139":"# AutoRecAlgorithm Module\n\nThere are a few things that have changed from the [RBM example](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alirezanematolahy\/recommender-system-with-rbms) worth talking about.\nFirst of all, we're not modeling this as a classification problem where each individual rating value between zero and five stars are treated as a different input and output node.\n\nInstead we just normalize our input ratings into the range zero to one and restore them to their original ranges.\n\nSo we don't have to deal with Soft Max and Expectation Values and all that in this example.\n\nAs such our input matrix that passed into our Train function is just a 2D array of ratings between users and items.\n\nBy the way this is different from what was in the [original Auto Rec paper](http:\/\/users.cecs.anu.edu.au\/~akmenon\/papers\/autorec\/autorec-paper.pdf).\n\nThey flipped things so they trained the network on items instead of users. They would feed in all of the ratings by each user for a given item while we're feeding in the ratings for every item for each given user.\n\nAgain, if you want to tinker you might try doing it the other way to see if you get better results.","32e9100a":"# Auto Rec Module\n\nLike our [RBM Example](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alirezanematolahy\/recommender-system-with-rbms), our implementation of using and Auto Encoder for recommendations uses tensorflow and it's structured in much the same way.\n\nAs a reminder, an Auto Encoder is just a 3 layer neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.\n\nLearning the weights between the input and hidden layer is called encoding.\n\nAnd reconstructing predictions with the weights between the hidden layer and the output layer is called decoding.\n\nBut fundamentally, it's just a neural network with one hidden layer.\n\nIn the MakeGraph function things are fundamentally different from the [RBM example](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alirezanematolahy\/recommender-system-with-rbms).\n\nIt's not too complicated. You can see we're setting up the weights for the encoding and decoding here randomly initialized. Those weights are learned and shared for every user we trained the Auto Encoder with. We also set up a set of biases for both layers.\n\nThis is a little bit different from what the original Auto Rec [paper](http:\/\/users.cecs.anu.edu.au\/~akmenon\/papers\/autorec\/autorec-paper.pdf) proposed, they only had a single bias node shared across the entire layer, while we learned biases for each node, which is more in line with modern practices.\n\nNext we set up the layers themselves. Our input layer receives ratings for each item for a given user.\n\nWe then construct our hidden layer by multiplying our input layer with the encoding weights and adding in the encoding bias terms then applying a sigmoid activation function to them.\n\nOur output layer applies the learned decoder weights and biases to what's in the hidden layer and applies the sigmoid activation function to that final result as well.\n\nThis makes up our actual predicted ratings for every item for a given user.\n\nTo measure air, we need to compare those predicted and those are in our original input layer. So we just copy that for use in our loss function.\n\nWe define our loss function of MSE between out predicted and actual ratings and use the RMS Optimizer to minimize that error.\n\nYou might try using more modern optimization functions such as Adam if you want to tinker a bit.\n\nThe Train function kicks it all off in pretty much the same way that we did before with [RBM](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alirezanematolahy\/recommender-system-with-rbms). Let's shift our attention to the AutoRecAlgorithm module.","30099fd7":"# Evaluation Data :\n"}}
