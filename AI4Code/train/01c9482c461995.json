Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking at the time one of the deadliest of a single ship and the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship to date. With much public attention in the aftermath the disaster has since been the material of many artistic works and a founding material of the disaster film genre.\n\nWe are going to disect this dataset to understand this disaster better..............","4257ee14":"Seems like we are missing data in Age , Ticket , Embarked and Cabin columns","d8c7f8fb":"![Titanic](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/33\/Titanic_sinking_gif.gif)","8a822918":"Lot more coming soon , plz upvote","db0efa31":"<h1 style='background:#1E30E9; border:0; color:white'><center>Explaining the Columns<\/center><\/h1> \n\n\n1> **PassengerID** - Unique id assigned to every passenger\n\n\n2> **Survived** - Target variable (0 - if the passenger died , 1 - if the passenger survived)\n\n3> **PClass** - Passenger class (1- Upper Class , 2- Middle Class , 3- Lower Class) - Fun Fact > Class 3 ticket costed around 15 to 40 dollars.\n\n4> **Name** - Passenger Name\n\n5> **Sex** - Gender of the passenger\n\n6> **Age** - Age in years\n\n7> **SibSp** - Number of the passenger's siblings and spouse\n\n8> **Parch** - Number of parents and children for the passenger\n\n9> **Ticket** - The Ticket Number\n\n10> **Fare** - Ticket cost for the passenger (need to confirm my 'Fun Fact')\n\n11> **Cabin** - Passenger's Cabin Number\n\n12> **Embarked** - The port where the Passenger set sail (C, Q and S)"}}
