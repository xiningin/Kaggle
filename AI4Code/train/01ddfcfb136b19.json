The solution may be more and denser housing near urban and suburban cores. \n* Putting in place early warning systems and ensuring each populated area has an evacuation plan to avoid loss of life. \n* Creating defensible space around buildings. \n* Improvements in forest management and use of controlled burns to remove highly flammable material to reduce intensity of wildfires.

Suprisingly, Alameda shows up as a top 10 county, which is unexpected as a good percentage of Alameda is urban\/suburban. However, there are a number of regional parks and grassland areas on the eastern side of the county. \n\nDoes this mean that the highest number of acres burned are in these counties? ","d4968edc":"\nWhile *2017* was the year with the most fires, it did not have the most fatalities - the highest number of deaths occured in *2018*, which is due to the Camp Fire which destroyed the town of Paradise very quickly. \n\nOverall fatality numbers are low for most years thankfully, but the years with the highest incidence of fires (2017-2019) do have the largest number of deaths. ","e9f4bf9d":"##### What does this tell us? \n\nAs suspected, the amount of fires per year increased overall between 2014 and 2017. 2018 and 2019 however, have a drop in the number of fires, though each year still has more incidents than years previous to 2017.\n\nContrary to my hypothesis that the most fires would occur in late summer and early fall when vegetation had the most time to dry out, the most fires occur during the month of July, with the biggest jump between May and June with the ramp up in warmer temperatures. \n\nWhy is this? Due to ongoing drought, what were traditionally thought of as the biggest fire months (September, October), are now being pushed earlier in the calendar. Fire season appears to stretch over 7 months, where those months have around 50 or more fire incidents per month.   \n\nWhile the occurrence of mega-fires remains low compared to the number of fires that occur each year, there is the sign of a trend where larger fires appear more frequently as time passes. ","0408701c":"The counties with the highest frequency of fires do **not** have the most acres burned!\n* Colusa county has the most acres burned of all California counties. It is a mostly rural county with grasslands and wooded area on the western side. \n* Alameda, which had a high frequency of fires, has a low number of acres burned, which most likely reflects its urban\/suburban dominated environment.","e6cc3eaf":"Which years have the most fire incidents?
