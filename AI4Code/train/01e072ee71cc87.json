Looking to the statistical correlation betwen the death and the age, around 0.25, confirms the histogram with a positive correlation.\n\n### Have or don't have anemia does not show any good correlation (around 0.066) to indicate if a patient will or will not have heart failure. The creatinine phosphokinase and diabetes, also do not show a good correlation (around 0.062 and -0.001 respectively). This information is very visual in the histogram and box plots, and is coroborated with de statistical correlation.\n\n### The ejection fraction, in other hand have a negative correlation (around -0.268), so, as it increase the chance of have a heart failure decrease. \n\n### We can see another couple of factors that do not have a good correlation, high blood pressure, and platelets. We have to reinforce that what we are talking about here is about the data, motherless clinically a high blood pressure is an indicator of heart problem, in this dataset it appears to not have a good correlation with the chance of having a death per heart failure.\n\n### The serum creatinine and serum sodium levels are good indicators of the occurrence of death per heart failure. The first has a positive correlation and the second a negative correlation.\n\n### The sex does not appear to have a low correlation with the deaths registered. \n\n### The time shows the best correlation to the death event. But, taking into consideration that in this dataset it was a factor indicating the number of days that a patient was being monitored, this is not a good indicator to take into consideration in a machine learning model. We say that because using this data can induce a trend in the model, so, in further data, the model probably will not work well.\n\n### Assuming what was considered in this initial analysis we will use to create the model only the data with more than 0.1 of correlation. In that case the next section we will handle the data to get only the age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, serum sodium columns.","dad8fec2":"<h1> <center> Heart Failure Prediction<\/center> <\/h1>","c476dc96":"The present work was intended to analyze some data related to people's health. So known that cardiovascular diseases(CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, and heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs, the  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/andrewmvd\/heart-failure-clinical-data\"><strong>Heart Failure Prediction<\/strong><\/a> dataset was chosen.\n\nAssuming most cardiovascular diseases preventeble by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity using population-wide strategies. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk need early detection and management.\n\nIn that way, machine learning models can help to the early risk identifcation. So, in the flolowing sections we will take a look to the data, making a initial analysis and quick visualization. Futher some transformation was made to make the data more presentable to the modeling process. Finaly, a model was created to detect the heart failure. In the end a short conclusion was made, where can be helpful for the strategies taken to prevent the heart failure.\n\nIt is important to remember this is a Notebook to study purposes only.\n\nThis notebook was created by [Matheus Gama Costa](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/matheus-gama-costa-903456a6\/). I hope you find this Notebook useful. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!","ebaa7a8f":"### In the end we have a model that can be really used in further data. That model can be improved with new data to training it and maybe taking another factor, like high blood pressure into account, the optimization will not be done here. \n### In the data analysis, we could see that the age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, serum sodium column were the pieces of information with more correlation due to the death event. So, it is a good thing to do pay attention to that indicators in new patients admitted to the facility, also a regular evaluation in that indicators on the patients already in observation maybe is a good approach to reduce de risk of death.\n### Looking at what we analyzed here, it is very helpful to use computing tools to analyze data in health care especially machine learning tools. So, some approaches like that could be useful in hospitals, nursing homes, life insurance companies, and other health facilities.
