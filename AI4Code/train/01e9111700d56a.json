Next Tasks \/ Datasets <a id=\"task_next\"><\/a>\n\n\n\nQuestions regarding radiology:\n-  I have read some of the articles, I see certain features are considered predictors for IPV: (1) GGO (ground glass opacities), (2) honeycombing, (3) reticulation and (4) traction bronchectasis.\n-  I was looking for a good explanation and examples what they are and how they appear in the HRCT but I did not and I am still in the dark. Does anyone in the team shade light on this?\n\n\nWe have following tasks:\n\n- understanding the data format of datasets we will use for semi supervised model\n\n- write scripts for extracting the data from datasets. they have different structure and root package usually have nested .zip or .gz packages. we need a script for each dataset\n\n- script for uploading dicoms to CoronaWhy dataverse\n\n- write scripts for converting all dicom data into normalized images\n\n- uploading images to CoronaWhy dataverse (i think it's a good idea to store both, raw and preprocessed data)\n\n- let me know if you'd like to help with any of those and if you need any help with it. meanwhile I will work on the same list going from top\n\n\n#### Data exploration and preparations\n\n\n# Datasets for unsupervised training\n\n---\n\n### 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR)\n\nBy China National Center for Bioinformation. **104,009 CT slices from 1,489 patients**.
