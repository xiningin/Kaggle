And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.\n\nHome Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.\n\nWhile Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.","9fc95649":"Observation : This seems to be a class imbalance problem.\nRefer to http:\/\/www.chioka.in\/class-imbalance-problem\/ to get more details.\nThere are far more loans that were repaid on time than loans that were not repaid.","a86f153e":"# Introduction","b89570b5":"Observation : Seems we have 64 columns with NULL value.
