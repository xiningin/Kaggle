For example, Glee's cover of \"Don't Stop Believin'\" does not count as a resurrection because the original song by Journey didn't make the Top 100, only their new version. Getting around this problem is tricky, since grouping track names without regard for the artist lumps generic track names together. Lil Wayne's 2013 track \"Love Me\" wasn't a cover of Justin Bieber's 2009 song. It wasn't a new take on Bobby Hebb's 1966 version either.\n\n### Ten Longest-Running Billboard Chart Legacies\n\n| Track | Artist| First Debut on Top 100 | Last Debut on Top 100 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White Christmas\t| Bing Crosby\t| 1958-12-20\t| 2018-12-29\t|\n| Run Rudolph Run |\tChuck Berry\t| 1958-12-13 |\t2019-01-05 |\n| Jingle Bell Rock\t| Bobby Helms\t| 1958-12-20\t| 2019-12-07\t| \n| The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You)\t| Nat King Cole\t| 1960-12-10\t| 2019-12-14\t| \n| Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree\t| Brenda Lee\t| 1960-12-10\t| 2019-12-07\t|\n| Space Oddity\t| David Bowie\t| 1973-01-27\t| 2016-01-30\t|\n| Bohemian Rhapsody\t| Queen |\t1976-01-03 | 2018-11-17\t|\n| Thriller\t| Michael Jackson |\t1984-02-11\t| 2019-11-09\t|\n| Under Pressure | Queen & David Bowie\t| 1981-11-07\t| 2016-01-30 |\n| Little Red Corvette\t| Prince\t| 1983-02-26 |\t2016-05-07 |","6f245e3d":"However, all these observations are from limited information, since the query only pulls the first and last time a song debuts on the Billboard 100.
