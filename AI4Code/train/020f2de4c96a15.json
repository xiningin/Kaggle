","311131fe":"After plotting the first set of indicators, we have a rough idea of the kind of data we're dealing with. Any Outliers have also been dealt with in this inital data. The first question we may have is why exactly does USA have such high emission values compared to India and China even though all three of them are heavily industrialized. I am writing another notebook on that analysis and will soon update that link here. \n","23cffa87":"### IMPORTANT \nWe have the same number of datapoints ( 55 ) for all three countries for this indicator. However, something you might have noticed is that the number of datapoints is different this time. For CO2 emissions, we have 52 datapoints. For GDP per capita, we have 55 datapoints. This will lead to error in the analysis. Hence, we need to correct that. ","571713f1":"There seems to be a little bit of correlation. ","0c7f6fd5":"#### INDIA","ac0bbbbb":"## Result:- \nWith this, we come to an end of this analysis. We followed a particular methodology and have come to this conclusion. We see that there is a pretty weak correlation between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions in the case of USA i.e. 0.077. However, on the other hand, we have India and China with a correlation coefficient of 0.967 and 0.98 respectively. The first question is obviously - 'Why is there such a relationship?'.\n\nOn a closer look, we can classify India and China as developing nations ( or atleast for the majority of the timeframe) while US would be considered as a developed nation. This clustering obviously plays an important role here. We can say that as developing countries try to build their economies faster, they may produce large quantities of CO2 while developed nations on the other hand become conscious of their surroundings and try to take care of their CO2 emissions so even though they do see a GDP growth, they do not witness a CO2 emission rise. \n\nSome of you may argue that if the above was true then why did USA have higher emissions per capita in the first plots. It is important to note that while USA had higher per capita emissions, it has a much lower population than the other two nations and we need to look at the gross metric tonne production of CO2 instead. \n\nAll of these ideas are important. There are many indicators that were not considered, for example _  energy access and consumption, industrialization level and population growth. While trying to find these implications is important let's not forget that this was not what we were trying to find initially. \n\n**Our goal was to find the relation between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions and the result is:** \n> \"GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita have a weak relationship in the case of developed nations but have a high correlation in the case of developing nations\" \n\n\n","c65afd35":"# Exploring 'World Development Indicators' Dataset and finding the relationship between CO2 emissions per cpaita and GDP per capita for USA, India and China. \n\n> It is an important analysis for countries around the world to understand that their development has an environmental cost and to keep that in mind while planning their robust industrial and urban development projects. \n\nWe will use the following indicators between the years **1960 - 2011**: \n* CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)\n* GDP per capita (constant 2005 US$)\n\nLet's start the analysis! \n","1bb4fcb8":"Our second indicator is **GDP per capita** \nThis time we will not plot the data as we have already done that once.

I will try to do that but so should you and these are the things you could work on. \n* Inculcating more indicators to make the analysis more refined and accurate. \n* Taking more countries in both the clusters. An addition to that would be clustering all the 247 countries into two groups( or more but distinct groups) based on their economic growth and then finding correlation values for all the countries and then drawing conclusions \n* Finding out what is the reason of this result and do comment about that further. \n\nI would request you to write about this work. I want both good and bad reviews to understand where I can improve this project.
