Inspecting the applications\n<p>The output may appear a bit confusing at its first sight, but let's try to figure out the most important features of a credit card application. The features of this dataset have been anonymized to protect the privacy, but <a href=\"http:\/\/rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com\/73039_9946de135c0a49daa7a0a9eda4a67a72.html\">this blog<\/a> gives us a pretty good overview of the probable features. The probable features in a typical credit card application are <code>Gender<\/code>, <code>Age<\/code>, <code>Debt<\/code>, <code>Married<\/code>, <code>BankCustomer<\/code>, <code>EducationLevel<\/code>, <code>Ethnicity<\/code>, <code>YearsEmployed<\/code>, <code>PriorDefault<\/code>, <code>Employed<\/code>, <code>CreditScore<\/code>, <code>DriversLicense<\/code>, <code>Citizen<\/code>, <code>ZipCode<\/code>, <code>Income<\/code> and finally the <code>ApprovalStatus<\/code>. This gives us a pretty good starting point, and we can map these features with respect to the columns in the output.   <\/p>\n<p>As we can see from our first glance at the data, the dataset has a mixture of numerical and non-numerical features. This can be fixed with some preprocessing, but before we do that, let's learn a bit more about the dataset a bit more to see if there are other dataset issues that need to be fixed.<\/p>","4e7c1756":"## 6. Preprocessing the data (part i)\n<p>The missing values are now successfully handled.<\/p>\n<p>There is still some minor but essential data preprocessing needed before we proceed towards building our machine learning model. We are going to divide these remaining preprocessing steps into two main tasks:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Convert the non-numeric data into numeric.<\/li>\n<li>Scale the feature values to a uniform range.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>First, we will be converting all the non-numeric values into numeric ones. We do this because not only it results in a faster computation but also many machine learning models (like XGBoost) (and especially the ones developed using scikit-learn) require the data to be in a strictly numeric format. We will do this by using a technique called <a href=\"http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html\">label encoding<\/a>.<\/p>","5ff85c62":"## 1. Credit card applications\n<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot<\/em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do!<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/assets.datacamp.com\/production\/project_558\/img\/credit_card.jpg\" alt=\"Credit card being held in hand\"><\/p>\n<p>We'll use the <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/credit+approval\">Credit Card Approval dataset<\/a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.<\/li>\n<li>We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.<\/li>\n<li>We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.<\/li>\n<li>After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>First, loading and viewing the dataset. We find that since this data is confidential, the contributor of the dataset has anonymized the feature names.<\/p>","4ad08028":"## 4. Handling the missing values (part ii)\n<p>We replaced all the question marks with NaNs. This is going to help us in the next missing value treatment that we are going to perform.<\/p>\n<p>An important question that gets raised here is <em>why are we giving so much importance to missing values<\/em>? Can't they be just ignored? Ignoring missing values can affect the performance of a machine learning model heavily. While ignoring the missing values our machine learning model may miss out on information about the dataset that may be useful for its training. Then, there are many models which cannot handle missing values implicitly such as LDA. <\/p>\n<p>So, to avoid this problem, we are going to impute the missing values with a strategy called mean imputation.<\/p>","c2dd85e9":"## 7. Preprocessing the data (part ii)\n<p>We have successfully converted all the non-numeric values to numeric ones. <\/p>\n<p>Now, let's try to understand what these scaled values mean in the real world. Let's use <code>CreditScore<\/code> as an example. The creidt score of a person is their creditworthiness based on their credit history. The higher this number, the more financially trustworthy a person is considered to be. So, a <code>CreditScore<\/code> of 1 is the highest since we're rescaling all the values to the range of 0-1.<\/p>\n<p>Also, features like <code>DriversLicense<\/code> and <code>ZipCode<\/code> are not as important as the other features in the dataset for predicting credit card approvals. We should drop them to design our machine learning model with the best set of features. This is often called feature engineering or, more specifically, feature selection.<\/p>","49838adc":"## 10.

But we will also take a look the model's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dataschool.io\/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology\/\">confusion matrix<\/a>. In the case of predicting credit card applications, it is equally important to see if our machine learning model is able to predict the approval status of the applications as denied that originally got denied. If our model is not performing well in this aspect, then it might end up approving the application that should have been approved. The confusion matrix helps us to view our model's performance from these aspects.  <\/p>","5621f8cb":"## 11. Grid searching and making the model perform better\n<p>Our model was pretty good!

There are still some missing values to be imputed for columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 13. All of these columns contain non-numeric data and this why the mean imputation strategy would not work here. This needs a different treatment. <\/p>\n<p>We are going to impute these missing values with the most frequent values as present in the respective columns.

Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set\n<p>Essentially, predicting if a credit card application will be approved or not is a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Statistical_classification\">classification<\/a> task. <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/machine-learning-databases\/credit-screening\/crx.names\">According to UCI<\/a>, our dataset contains more instances that correspond to \"Denied\" status than instances corresponding to \"Approved\" status.
