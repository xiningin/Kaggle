If we find a coding region which has a high degree of similarity to a known protein we can infer that the region likely encodes for a protein with a similar functionality to the known protein. We do this by performing local alignments between each protein contained in the SARS-Cov-1 proteome and each possible coding region identified above. We score each alignment and return the best match. The results are shown in the table below. ","2c6d4d55":"## Identification of Possible Coding Regions\n\nFirst we read in the SARS-Cov-2 DNA sequence. In reality, SARS-COV-2 is a positive-sense single stranded **RNA** virus, but for some reason the data is specified in terms of DNA. The DNA sequence is then transcribed into an RNA sequence simply by replacing Ts representing thymine with Us representing Uracil. In order to translate RNA into possible amino acid sequences, we need to consider that any given strand of RNA can be read in three different ways depending on the position from which translation is started. Therefore, we consider all three reading frames when finding possible coding regions. We do this by sequentially shifting the starting position and translating the resulting reading frame into amino acids. Once each reading frame is translated, possible coding regions are identified as regions between subsequent stop codons and stored in a dataframe for later use. ","d8d22168":"### Example Alignment for P56937 with 91% match","5936555a":"### Results\n\nLet's take a look at some of the highest matching proteins:\n\n* P59637 matched coding-region 8 with a score of .91: According to [UniProt.org](https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/uniprot\/P59637) this protein is an envelope small membrane protein which 'plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly. Acts as a viroporin and self-assembles in host membranes forming pentameric protein-lipid pores that allow ion transport. Also plays a role in the induction of apoptosis (By similarity). Activates the host NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to IL-1beta overproduction.'\n* P59595 matched coding-region 34 with a score of .84: According to [UniProt.org](https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/uniprot\/P59595), thi protein is a nucleoprotein which 'Packages the positive strand viral genome RNA into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) and plays a fundamental role during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and membrane protein M. Plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral RNA transcription as well as viral replication.'\n* P59596 matched coding region 74 with a score of .83: According to [UniProt.org](https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/uniprot\/P59596), this protein is a membrane protein and a 'component of the viral envelope that plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly via its interactions with other viral proteins.'\n* P59635 matched coding region 10 with a score of .77: According to [UniProt.org](https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/uniprot\/P59635), this protein is a 'non-structural protein which is dispensable for virus replication in cell culture'.\n* P0C6U8 matched coding region 15 with a score of .7: According to [UniProt.org](https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/uniprot\/P0C6U8) this protein is a polyprotein with a number of functions. \n* P59594 matched coding region 30 with a score of .65: According to [UniProt.org](https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/uniprot\/P59594), this protein is a spike glycoprotein which 'attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor, initiating the infection (By similarity). Binding to human ACE2 and CLEC4M\/DC-SIGNR receptors and internalization of the virus into the endosomes of the host cell induces conformational changes in the S glycoprotein. Proteolysis by cathepsin CTSL may unmask the fusion peptide of S2 and activate membranes fusion within endosomes.'\n","0022f2b0":"## Conclusion\n\nSince we found several coding regions which exhibited a high degree of similarity to known proteins in the SARS-Cov-1 proteome, we can infer that these coding regions likely encode for proteins having similar functions to those matched.
