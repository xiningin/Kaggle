I've always studied statistics, but I never used here on Kaggle (or anywhere for that matter), so why not start using it right now?\n\n#### Let's see what we need to answer that question.\n1. First we need the given proportions betwen the two groups\n2. Second we need to calculate the difference between the two proportions\n3. Then we need to calculate the confidence interval between the statistic obtained\n\n#### And what would that show us? It would emphasize the activites that are difference between the two groups, which might be just a glorified way of looking into the barplot between the two groups' activities, but hey this is Data Science yo, we are supposed to use statistics in here so wise up.\n\nI'll attempt to make handy functions as I go so that I can answer more questions using this way."}}
