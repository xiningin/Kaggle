But only a few of us know about the genesis of Kaggle and the people behind this 21st-century miracle. Kaggle was founded by Anthony Goldbloom and Ben Hamner.\n\nKaggle got its start in 2010 by offering machine learning competitions and now also offers a public data platform, a cloud-based workbench for data science, and Artificial Intelligence education. Its key personnel were Anthony Goldbloom and Jeremy Howard. Nicholas Gruen was founding chair succeeded by Max Levchin. Equity was raised in 2011 valuing the company at $25 million.\n\nIt is one of the many two-sided platforms that have emerged in recent years. Recently acquired by Google, Kaggle is home to over one million users ranging from computer science Ph.D. holders conducting cutting edge research to absolute beginners. Kaggle is best known for its data science competitions that offer (substantial) cash prizes, but it also serves as an educational tool for autodidacts as well as a place to present one\u2019s portfolio of related work.\n\n## A little of Anthony\u2019s Background\nHe is from Melbourne, Australia. He studied econometrics at Melbourne University. His first job out of college was working at the Australian Treasury, forecasting GDP, inflation and unemployment. He loved playing with data but his biggest frustration was that traditional economic data is small and noisy and so it\u2019s hard to draw interesting findings from.\nStarting Kaggle was really because He wanted to get access to more interesting datasets and problems. Of course it\u2019s a bit ironic because He don\u2019t get the chance to participate.\n\nHis aim was to make Kaggle a vibrant ecosystem of code, data and discussion. If you do data science\/machine learning somewhere else, you start with a blinking cursor and an empty room. At Kaggle, He want us to be able to access great code\/analysis that you can fork, data that we can analyze and join to and discussion that we can learn from. They started with competitions, now Kaggle have Kaggle Kernels and the public data platform.Over time, he want us to be able to use Kaggle for work as well as for learning, credentialing and fun.\n\n## Moments during Kaggle\u2019s \u2018growing up\u2019 where they had to pivot their vision and business model significantly\nEarly on, Kaggle was more a fun project than anything with a grand vision. Kaggle made all it's revenue from machine learning competitions, but that wasn't very profitable: machine learning was very immature and so there wasn\u2019t much market for machine learning competitions. In 2013, Kaggle looked at adding on other business lines that might be more profitable: such as forming expertise in specific industries and building machine learning solutions for that industry. They picked Oil & Gas as their first industry because they had Shell as a customer who wanted to do more with them and they thought the market opportunity was good. When the oil price crashed in late 2014, that industry became more challenging. However the machine learning market was starting to mature, so they could go back to building a strong business around machine learning competitions. They also launched a jobs board, which has been a nice source of revenue for them. Going forward, they\u2019d like to offer other services, including allowing companies to use Kaggle Kernels within their data science teams.\n\n## GOOGLE BOUGHT KAGGLE\nOn 8 March 2017, Google announced that they were acquiring Kaggle. There\u2019s a big battle between the three big cloud players at the moment (AWS, Azure and Google Cloud). One of the differentiators for Google Cloud is to be the best cloud for machine learning: offering TPUs, Tensorflow as a service via Google CloudML Engine etc. Kaggle is the world\u2019s largest machine learning and data science community, so owning Kaggle allows Google Cloud the ability to make these tools available to our community, to get feedback on them as they are launched and to drive adoption. From Kaggle\u2019s perspective, it also works well. It allows them to offer community far more powerful compute\/services.\n\n## 5 million registered users!\nOn July 3rd 2020, Kaggle has crossed another amazing milestone: more than 5 million unique users have now registered on the platform which spans more than 190 countries ranging from those just starting out to many of the world's best known researchers.\n\n![kaggle users.png](attachment:0d2ce536-e363-48a1-9f9d-23209920de06.png)\n\n## Services provided by Kaggle\n- **Competitions:** Competitions was Kaggle's first product. Companies post problems and kagglers compete to build the best algorithm, and win amazing prices.\n- **Kernels:** A cloud-based notebook for data science and machine learning. Allows data scientists to share code and analysis in Python, R and Markdown. \n- **Datasets:** Place to explore, analyze, and share quality data.\n- **Learn:** A platform for AI education in manageable chunks.","2b611f9c":"## Resouces which helped me:\n- kaggle.com\/ashagutlapalli\/evolution-of-kaggle","63885bb2":"### News search interest over time distribution","20c737a8":"### Youtube search interest by region\n","98b09535":"### News search interest over region distribution"}}
