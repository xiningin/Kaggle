Your answer will be marked correct after saving this file.  \n\nNote: When using the `to_csv()` method, supply only the name of the file (e.g., `\"my_file.csv\"`).  This saves the file at the filepath `\"\/kaggle\/working\/my_file.csv\"`.","bb395217":"In this exercise, you'll apply what you learned in the **Character encodings** tutorial.\n\n# Setup\n\nThe questions below will give you feedback on your work. Run the following cell to set up the feedback system.","700f3cfc":"**This notebook is an exercise in the [Data Cleaning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/data-cleaning) course.

Can you read in all the files with their original encodings and them save them out as UTF-8 files?\n\nIf you have a file that's in UTF-8 but has just a couple of weird-looking characters in it, you can try out the [ftfy module](https:\/\/ftfy.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/#) and see if it helps. \n\n# Keep going\n\nIn the final lesson, learn how to [**clean up inconsistent text entries**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/inconsistent-data-entry) in your dataset.","45f96a08":"# 2) Reading in files with encoding problems\n\nUse the code cell below to read in this file at path `\"..\/input\/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us\/PoliceKillingsUS.csv\"`.  \n\nFigure out what the correct encoding should be and read in the file to a DataFrame `police_killings`.","a6b33584":"# Get our environment set up\n\nThe first thing we'll need to do is load in the libraries we'll be using.","42b04248":"# 1) What are encodings?\n\nYou're working with a dataset composed of bytes.

To get credit for finishing this question, you'll need to run `q2.check()` and get a result of **Correct**.","95e4b7f5":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
