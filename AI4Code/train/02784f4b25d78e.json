Bidirectional LSTM is also a good way so make the model stronger. But this may vary for different data sets. **Applying both LSTM and GRU together gave even better results.** ","f465b55d":"Now, even though RNNs are quite powerful, they suffer from  **Vanishing gradient problem ** which hinders them from using long term information, like they are good for storing memory 3-4 instances of past iterations but larger number of instances don't provide good results so we don't just use regular RNNs. Instead, we use a better variation of RNNs: **Long Short Term Networks(LSTM).**\n\n### What is Vanishing Gradient problem?\nVanishing gradient problem is a difficulty found in training artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. In such methods, each of the neural network's weights receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. The problem is that in some cases, the gradient will be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing its value. In the worst case, this may completely stop the neural network from further training. As one example of the problem cause, traditional activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent function have gradients in the range (0, 1), and backpropagation computes gradients by the chain rule. This has the effect of multiplying n of these small numbers to compute gradients of the \"front\" layers in an n-layer network, meaning that the gradient (error signal) decreases exponentially with n while the front layers train very slowly.\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vanishing_gradient_problem)\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1460\/1*FWy4STsp8k0M5Yd8LifG_Q.png\">\n\nSource: [Medium](https:\/\/medium.com\/@anishsingh20\/the-vanishing-gradient-problem-48ae7f501257)","8036f0ae":"Truth be told.

It's not known, which is better: GRU or LSTM becuase they have comparable performances. GRUs are easier to train than LSTMs.\n\n## Gated Recurrent Units\nIn simple words, the GRU unit does not have to use a memory unit to control the flow of information like the LSTM unit. It can directly makes use of the all hidden states without any control. GRUs have fewer parameters and thus may train a bit faster or need less data to generalize. But, with large data, the LSTMs with higher expressiveness may lead to better results.\n\nThey are almost similar to LSTMs except that they have two gates: reset gate and update gate. Reset gate determines how to combine new input to previous memory and update gate determines how much of the previous state to keep. Update gate in GRU is what input gate and forget gate were in LSTM. We don't have the second non linearity in GRU before calculating the outpu, .neither they have the output gate.\n\nSource: [Quora](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Whats-the-difference-between-LSTM-and-GRU-Why-are-GRU-efficient-to-train)\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdnpythonmachinelearning.azureedge.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/GRU.png?x31195\">","f134f732":"### And now we get to the code...\nI will use LSTMs for predicting the price of stocks of IBM for the year 2017","7f59f786":"The current version version uses a dense GRU network with 100 units as opposed to the GRU network with 50 units in previous version","bf1af9d6":"## Working of gates in LSTMs\nFirst, LSTM cell takes the previous memory state C<sub>t-1<\/sub> and does element wise multiplication with forget gate (f) to decide if  present memory state C<sub>t<\/sub>.

This is why the error is so low. Strong models can bring similar results like above models for sequences too but they require more than just data which has previous values. In case of stocks, we need to know the sentiments of the market, the movement of other stocks and a lot more. So, don't expect a remotely accurate plot. The error will be great and the best I can do is generate the trend similar to the test set.\n\nI will use GRU model for predictions. You can try this using LSTMs also.

A RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell is responsible for \"remembering\" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word \"memory\" in LSTM. Each of the three gates can be thought of as a \"conventional\" artificial neuron, as in a multi-layer (or feedforward) neural network: that is, they compute an activation (using an activation function) of a weighted sum. Intuitively, they can be thought as regulators of the flow of values that goes through the connections of the LSTM; hence the denotation \"gate\". There are connections between these gates and the cell.\n\nThe expression long short-term refers to the fact that LSTM is a model for the short-term memory which can last for a long period of time. An LSTM is well-suited to classify, process and predict time series given time lags of unknown size and duration between important events. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and vanishing gradient problem when training traditional RNNs.\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Long_short-term_memory)\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1600\/0*LyfY3Mow9eCYlj7o.\">\n\nSource: [Medium](https:\/\/codeburst.io\/generating-text-using-an-lstm-network-no-libraries-2dff88a3968)\n\nThe best LSTM explanation on internet: https:\/\/medium.com\/deep-math-machine-learning-ai\/chapter-10-1-deepnlp-lstm-long-short-term-memory-networks-with-math-21477f8e4235\n\nRefer above link for deeper insights."}}
