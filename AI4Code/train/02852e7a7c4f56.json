We don't always get a perfect straight line, because remember we have sampled it from a real distribution. As we increase the number of samples more and more, the line created from the points will be straighter.     \n\nAlso, you can notice x-axis represents Theoretical Quantiles which means it's values are spaced to represent the different quantiles of given\/known distribution (in our case here, its Normal Disribution) and y-axis is Ordered Values which **represent** the quantiles for the given unknown sample set and red line is the line they should follow. ","98822499":"**NOOOOOO !!!!!**\n\nThe reason behind is the math, which I don't wanna talk right now.\n\nWe can also compare two known samples. Let's take Normal Distribution and Gamma Distribution.","5c92dacb":"As you can see it totally looks like the cute bell curve everyone talks about. :)","4ba80962":"As expected, this is not a straight line. Since, these two distributions are different so their Q-Q plot will not be straight line.\n\nLet's take one more example of comparing Exponential Distribution with Pareto distribution.","e6d9291b":"# Quantile-Quantile or QQ Plot :\nQuantile-Quantile or in short Q-Q plot, in simple terms is method to compare two distributions.\nIn a more formal terms, it is a technique to compare whether two sets of sample points are from  or they follow same distributions. \n\nHowever we normally use it to check whether a sample of data points follow a particular distribution. So in this scenario, one distribution is fixed and we know what it is, what it's properties are and we compare the other or unknown sample with it. If the unknown sample of dataset follow given distribution, we will have a scatter plot, where data points will be in a straight line y = x.\n\nThe data points are quantile values of each distribution. The idea is to plot the quantile  values of two distributions\/samples and see, if they make a straight line or not. If the quantiles of two sample sets are similar or in a better case, identical then sample set is from the same distribution. In better words, **if the distributions are identical, then the quantiles should be approximately equal.**\n\nDo note, that the known distribution need not to be only Normal Distribution, it can be any known distribution like, Exponential Distribution, Weibull Distribution, Binomial Distribution etc.\n\n\nLet's have some python code, to understand it better.\n\n","1f2a0e10":"Let's plot Q-Q plot for these data points against the normal distribution. We should definitely get a straight line."}}
