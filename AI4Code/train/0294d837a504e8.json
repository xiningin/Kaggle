Mainstream, midage and young singles and couples are also more likely to pay more per packet of chips. This is indicative of impulse buying behaviour.\n\nWe\u2019ve also found that Mainstream young singles and couples are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips\ncompared to the rest of the population.\nThe Category Manager may want to increase the category\u2019s performance by off-locating some Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segmentswhere young singles and couples frequent more often to increase visibilty and impulse behaviour.\n\nQuantium can help the Category Manager with recommendations of where these segments are and further help them with measuring the impact of the changed placement. \n","5b98dc73":"There are various Brand names here that are duplicated , for example RRD is same as RED, SNBTS is SUNBITE etc. We need to replace them.","531e188d":"Lift value is less than 1 for both association properties for Young Singles\/Couple Mainstream mebership in terms of relationships between various package sizes or brands.
