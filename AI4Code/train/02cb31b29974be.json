It lets you use what is called a *context manager*. You can often see it being used for opening documents, e.g.\n\n```python\nwith open('data.txt') as f:\n    print(f.read())\n```\n\nBasically, you can use a variable (in this case, `f`, which stands for file) in a constrained scope, as well as perform actions before and after the `with` code block is executed. For example, the built-in function `open()` will automatically perform a `f.close()` after you are done using it. [This tutorial](https:\/\/jeffknupp.com\/blog\/2016\/03\/07\/python-with-context-managers\/) goes more in-depth about how this works, and show how to build your own context manager.\n\nSo how does `tf.Session()` work then? According to the [official docs](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/Session), the following two examples are equivalent:\n\n```python\n# Using the `close()` method.\nsess = tf.Session()\nsess.run(...)\nsess.close()\n\n# Using the context manager.\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    sess.run(...)\n```\n\nThis means you can either create a context in which `sess` is active, or simply initialize `sess` and close it when you are done with all your Tensorflow computation. In our code, we use the second method:\n\n```python\ninit_ops = [tf.global_variables_initializer(), tf.tables_initializer()]\nsess = tf.Session()\nsess.run(init_ops)\n```\n\nIf you are confused about why we have those `init_ops` and need to run them before using `sess` for inference, check out this [StackOverflow thread](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/44433438\/understanding-tf-global-variables-initializer). The [official docs section on variable initialization](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/guide\/variables#initializing_variables) also gives a straightforward explanation:\n> Before you can use a variable, it must be initialized. If you are programming in the low-level TensorFlow API (that is, you are explicitly creating your own graphs and sessions), you must explicitly initialize the variables. Most high-level frameworks such as [...] Keras automatically initialize variables for you before training a model. \n> \n> Explicit initialization is otherwise useful because it allows you not to rerun potentially expensive initializers when reloading a model from a checkpoint as well as allowing determinism when randomly-initialized variables are shared in a distributed setting.\n> \n> To initialize all trainable variables in one go, before training starts, call tf.global_variables_initializer(). This function returns a single operation responsible for initializing all variables in the tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES collection. Running this operation initializes all variables.\n\nAs for `tf.tables_initializer()`, [this thread](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/54540018\/what-does-tensorflows-tables-initializer-do) briefly explains why you need to use it, and the [official docs has a guide](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/guide\/low_level_intro) showing `tf.tables_initializer()` being used in a simple example. For our purpose, think of it as being needed for initializing this particular type of graph, **and that it needs to be run after we load our model from TF Hub, or else you will run into a `FailedPreconditionError`.**\n\nLet's go back to `tf.Graph().as_default()`. The [Tensorflow docs on `tf.Graph()`](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/Graph) says:\n\n> [A] typical usage involves the `tf.Graph.as_default` context manager, which overrides the current default graph for the lifetime of the context:\n\n```python\ng = tf.Graph()\nwith g.as_default():\n    # Define operations and tensors in `g`.\n    c = tf.constant(30.0)\n    assert c.graph is g\n```\n\nThey also note:\n\n> This method should be used if you want to create multiple graphs in the same process. For convenience, a global default graph is provided, and all ops will be added to this graph if you do not create a new graph explicitly.\n\nSince we are using a notebook, it is good practice to call `as_default()`, since we might want to create other `tf.Graph` later on.\n\nOne last thing you might have noticed: we are not closing `sess` anywhere. This is because we will need to use the same session later to perform the inference on the entire test set.","cf101259":"# Introduction to Tensorflow Hub for Object Detection (with SSD+MobileNetV2)\n\nThe purpose of this kernel is to walk you through the process of downloading a pre-trained TF model from the Tensorflow Hub, building a Tensorflow graph and performing off-the-shelf predictions.

The images are very diverse and often contain complex scenes with several objects (8 per image on average; visualizer). \n\nFor our implementation, it is important to note those following points:\n* This model does NOT support fine-tuning.\n* The model does NOT support batching, so the input has to be **ONE** image of shape `(1, height, width, 3)`.\n* It is recommended to run this module on GPU to get acceptable inference times.\n* The model is loaded directly from Tensorflow Hub, so this code might not work offline.","de639f60":"# Utility Functions\n\nIn this section, we define a few functions that will be used for processing images and formatting the output prediction.
