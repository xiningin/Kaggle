Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n","8702482b":"#### observations\n1. Pclass and Fare has the highest correlation (-0.55). First class passengers usually pay higher fare. Although some of the other class pasessengers may paid higher fares as well. We can use Pclass as one of the feature to fill in the missing Fare.\n2. SibSp and Parch have high correlation (0.41). Naturally passengers whose have children themselves have spouses.","d90fbc8f":"All features appears normal except the Fare column. The maximum possible fare is above 500 dollars but 75% of the passengers paid around 31 dollars and the standard deviation is 49 dollars. Those whose paid above 500 dollars are outliers.","5f2b4828":"There are definitely missing ages and cabin in both the training and testing dataset. I am going to propose my own method for extrapolating the missing values. This approach will be discussed in the later section. As for the single missing Fare and the two missing Embarked, I am going to fix them manually.","6ef517bc":"#### observations\n\n1. The first class passengers have the highest chance of survival. But even among the first class passengers, deads show up almost at every price range except above 500 dollars. Those first class whose paid between 60-300 dollars also has a comparative good chance to survive.\n2. The third class passengers have the lowerest chance of survival. Again no surprise.\n3. The second class passenger have roughly 50%\/50% chance of survival.\n4. Those whose paid less than 10 dollars have the lowest chance of survival regardless of class.","0f571068":"#### Sex & Age Diagram\nIn term of social context, both sex and age are base attributes related to every indivdiual.

Surprisingly this is not a good factor to determine the survivability.\n2. Passengers whose paid expensive fares do not guarantee survival.
