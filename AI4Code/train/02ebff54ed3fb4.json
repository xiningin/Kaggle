This field tells us about the type to which a Pokemon belongs to.\n\n2. **Type 2**: Some Pokemons can be of dual types, that is, they can have more than one type. This field tells us about the second type of the Pokemon in question.\n\n3. **Generation**: Pokemon is a long running series, that is why it was divided across multiple generations. Our dataset has data about 6 of them. This field tells us what generation a Pokemon belongs to.\n\n4. **Legendary**: There are a few legendary Pokemons in the franchise which have special powers as compared to others.

Moreover, majority of data is close to the mean values, which implies that **the standard deviation is small** (as curve is steep).\n\nWe can also infer that that the mean values for all these numerical variables is pretty close to one another and the curves (distribution) is also very similar, implying that these values do not require scaling to affect accuracy as much (if not neccessary for the model used) as they are lying in the same neighbourhood.
