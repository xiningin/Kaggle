VA can be caused by several acids, but the primary source is Acetic Acid and is the result of bacteriological infection through oxidation during winemaking. In quantities of 0.2 to 0.4 g\/L, volatile acidity does not affect a wine's quality. It is clear from the analysis that extreme volatile acidity levels can be pursued as a characteristic that affects the quality of the wine.This is because, extreme volatile acidity signifies a serious faultin wine, and can be referred to as volatile.

At a certain level, residual sugar may help a sharp, acidic wine to taste mellower and also make a plain wine more flavorsome. Some everyday wines are made by simply adding sweeteners, such as preserved grape juice to dry wines before bottling to make them more palatable. However, residual sugar can also be a dangerous enemy to the stability of a still wine because it may trigger re-fermentation in the bottle.

According to <a href=\"https:\/\/winefolly.com\/wine-basics-beginners-guide\/\">wine folly <\/a>there are over 1,300 wine grape varieties used in commercial production but only about 100 of these varieties make up 75% of the world's vineyards. Wine is an alcoholic drink that is made up of fermented grapes. If you have come across wine then you will notice that wine has also their types. There are red wines, white wines this was because of different varieties of grapes.<\/font>\n    <p> More details about varieties <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pariscityvision.com\/en\/gastronomy\/winery-tours-wine-tasting\/types-of-wine-reds-roses-whites\">Click Here <\/a><\/p>\n\n    \n ![5731.jpg](attachment:0dcf4497-7fa7-4da9-9025-43dffea2b7d5.jpg)\n\n","82420031":"<font size=\"4\"> Citric acid is one of the less commonly found acids in wine. This acid is a weak organic compound that is commonly found in large quantities in citrus fruits like oranges and limes. Even though the quantity of citric acid found in grapes is small, it still makes up 5% of the total acid content in the fruit. Citric acid is most used as an acid supplement during the fermentation process to help winemakers boost the acidity of their wine especially grapes grown in warmer climates. <\/font>\n\n<font size=\"4\">Adding citric acid will give the wine \u201cfreshness\u201d.

For example, it acts as an enzyme inhibitor in musts to prevent the juice from browning. As a microbiological control agent, sulfur dioxide is added to the winemaking process to prevent oxidation in the finished product. Sulfur dioxide can be found in wine in its free forms, SO2 (gas) and bisulfite ion (HSO3\u2013), or bound to compounds that incorporate a carbonyl group, such as acetaldehyde. Free forms of SO2 are pH and temperature-dependent, and because of the acidic nature of wines, SO2 is usually present and measured as bisulfate ions (HSO3\u2013). Results are reported as SO2. The European Union established a maximum permitted level of total SO2 in wine varying from 150 to 500 mg\/L, which is dependent upon the sugar level of the product. This analysis has shown that the total sulfur dioxide has a maximum of 289 mg\/L in high quality wines.

Also, consumers have stated that a high-quality wine should not contain an\nexcess of residual sugars. This means a very sweet wine is not a feature of a high-quality wine.

In fact, acids impact the sourness or tartness which is a fundamental feature of the wine. The most abundant of these acids arise in the grapes themselves and carry over into the wine. However, there are also some acids that arise as a result of the fermentation process.<a href=\"https:\/\/weiqiweng.github.io\/files\/wayfair_interview_presentation.pdf\"> (Nierman, 2004)<\/a> <\/font>\n","a56f03ad":"<font size=\"4\"><u>Volatile Acidity<\/u> <\/font>"}}
