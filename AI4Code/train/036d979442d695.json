But with that, we cannot accurately predict or tell whether a passenger will survive or die.

Still the chances for survival is low here, that is because many passengers from Pclass3 around **81%** didn't survive. \n\n4)Port Q had almost 95% of the passengers were from Pclass3.","3a663409":"As we had seen earlier, the Age feature has **177** null values.

The survival rate for **Pclass3 is very low**. For **women**, the chance of survival from **Pclass1** is almost 1 and is high too for those from **Pclass2**.   **Money Wins!!!**. \n\n**Age:** Children less than 5-10 years do have a high chance of survival. Passengers between age group 15 to 35 died a lot.\n\n**Embarked:** This is a very interesting feature. **The chances of survival at C looks to be better than even though the majority of Pclass1 passengers got up at S.** Passengers at Q were all from **Pclass3**. \n\n**Parch+SibSp:** Having 1-2 siblings,spouse on board or 1-3 Parents shows a greater chance of probablity rather than being alone or having a large family travelling with you.","25728a77":"The accuracy of a model is not the only factor that determines the robustness of the classifier. Let's say that a classifier is trained over a training data and tested over the test data and it scores an accuracy of 90%.\n\nNow this seems to be very good accuracy for a classifier, but can we confirm that it will be 90% for all the new test sets that come over??. The answer is **No**, because we can't determine which all instances will the classifier will use to train itself. As the training and testing data changes, the accuracy will also change. It may increase or decrease. This is known as **model variance**.\n\nTo overcome this and get a generalized model,we use **Cross Validation**.\n\n\n# Cross Validation\n\nMany a times, the data is imbalanced, i.e there may be a high number of class1 instances but less number of other class instances. Thus we should train and test our algorithm on each and every instance of the dataset. Then we can take an average of all the noted accuracies over the dataset. \n\n1)The K-Fold Cross Validation works by first dividing the dataset into k-subsets.\n\n2)Let's say we divide the dataset into (k=5) parts. We reserve 1 part for testing and train the algorithm over the 4 parts.\n\n3)We continue the process by changing the testing part in each iteration and training the algorithm over the other parts. The accuracies and errors are then averaged to get a average accuracy of the algorithm.\n\nThis is called K-Fold Cross Validation.\n\n4)An algorithm may underfit over a dataset for some training data and sometimes also overfit the data for other training set. Thus with cross-validation, we can achieve a generalised model.","f5e787f3":"### Random Forests","2797998d":"We use **FactorPlot** in this case, because they make the seperation of categorical values easy.\n\nLooking at the **CrossTab** and the **FactorPlot**, we can easily infer that survival for **Women from Pclass1** is about **95-96%**, as only 3 out of 94 Women from Pclass1 died. \n\nIt is evident that irrespective of Pclass, Women were given first priority while rescue. Even Men from Pclass1 have a very low survival rate.\n\nLooks like Pclass is also an important feature. Lets analyse other features.","8d980e7c":"Clearly, as the Fare_cat increases, the survival chances increases. This feature may become an important feature during modeling along with the Sex.\n\n## Converting String Values into Numeric\n\nSince we cannot pass strings to a machine learning model, we need to convert features loke Sex, Embarked, etc into numeric values.","9b380663":"Now the accuracy for the KNN model changes as we change the values for **n_neighbours** attribute.

For this we will use **pandas.qcut**.\n\nSo what **qcut** does is it splits or arranges the values according the number of bins we have passed. So if we pass for 5 bins, it will arrange the values equally spaced into 5 seperate bins or value ranges.","8213356e":"The Women and Child first policy thus holds true irrespective of the class.","158c7b40":"### Interpreting The Heatmap\n\nThe first thing to note is that only the numeric features are compared as it is obvious that we cannot correlate between alphabets or strings. Before understanding the plot, let us see what exactly correlation is.\n\n**POSITIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to increase in feature B, then they are positively correlated**. A value **1 means perfect positive correlation**.\n\n**NEGATIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated**. A value **-1 means perfect negative correlation**.\n\nNow lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as **MultiColinearity** as both of them contains almost the same information.\n\nSo do you think we should use both of them as **one of them is redundant**. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n\nNow from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated. The highest correlation is between **SibSp and Parch i.e 0.41**. So we can carry on with all features.","518ac4fd":"The lowest fare is **0.0**. Wow!! a free luxorious ride.

Here we can have a relative sort in the variable.\n\n**Ordinal Features in the dataset: PClass**\n\n### Continous Feature:\nA feature is said to be continous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the features column.\n\n**Continous Features in the dataset: Age**","676c2656":"### Observations:\n\n1)The survival chances are almost 1 for women for Pclass1 and Pclass2 irrespective of the Pclass.\n\n2)Port S looks to be very unlucky for Pclass3 Passenegers as the survival rate for both men and women is very low.**(Money Matters)**\n\n3)Port Q looks looks to be unlukiest for Men, as almost all were from Pclass 3.\n","e2ad9d75":"## Part1: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)","0d4771de":"### K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)","4a821512":"People say **Money Can't Buy Everything**.
