such a way that some operations can be performed on qualitative variables and others on quantitative variables.\r\n\r\nWe only need *df_c* for one purpose - to perform operations on quality variables,

database because of outliers is a bad idea. We really shouldn't be doing this.\r\n\r\nThe models for the two cases are slightly different. I would say about 10% on average. Which means that laboriously checking assumptions, eliminating outliers, removing a highly correlated variable, etc. produced a poor end result.\r\n\r\nOf course, it should be noted that in our decimated database, about 51% of cases had a diseased liver, and our accuracy is 61% in this model. Using this model, we slightly improve our assessment of whether a patient has a diseased liver or not, compared to assuming that all patients have the disease.\r\nFor the entire database, patients with diseased liver make up about 72% of the cases, and our model has a accuracy of 70%, so just looking at this rate, you could say that whether we use the model or assume that everyone has the disease...it doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nThe next step in further analysis should be to convert those variables with a lot of outliers into qualitative variables. Then applying the solution method to the strongly unbalanced classes.","591a7977":"Our database unfortunately has many outliers. A lot of them had a high value, so a single procedure didn't give a very good result. \r\nTherefore, we will create a loop that will repeat the procedure a certain number of times.\r\n\r\n*Keep in mind that the written function will not make any changes to the database if there are no outliers left in the database.*","5aff8edb":"# Loading data and packages","1dd71a68":"## Comparison of results","5a96e687":"As we can see by removing the outliers we have accidentally solved the problem of strongly unbalanced classes.\r\n\r\nAt the very end, all that is left is to trim the main database based on the removed outliers.","5ebb3f77":"Kurtosis is a measure of outliers. The higher its value, the more likely there are outliers in the database. \r\nThe lower the value, the more the results are clustered around the mean.\r\n\r\nIn our case, five variables exceed the safe threshold of $K=|3|$, of which Aspartate and Alamine very strongly.
