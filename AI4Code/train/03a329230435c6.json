Depth can be scaled up as well as scaled down by adding\/removing layers respectively. For example, ResNets can be scaled up from ResNet-50 to ResNet-200 as well as they can be scaled down from ResNet-50 to ResNet-18.   \n  \nBut why depth scaling? The intuition is that a deeper network can capture richer and more complex features, and generalizes well on new tasks.  \n  \n*Fair enough. Well, let\u2019s make our network 1000 layers deep then? We don\u2019t mind adding extra layers if we have the resources and a chance to improve on this task.*  \n  \nEasier said than done! Theoretically, with more layers, the network performance should improve but practically it doesn\u2019t follow.

The network layers\/blocks are as shown below:  \n\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*OpvSpqMP61IO_9cp4mAXnA.png)\n  \nThe MBConv block is nothing fancy but an Inverted Residual Block (used in MobileNetV2) with a Squeeze and Excite block injected sometimes.  \n      \nNow we have the base network, we can search for optimal values for our scaling parameters. If you revisit the equation, you will quickly realize that we have a total of four parameters to search for: `\u03b1`, `\u03b2`, `\u03b3`, and `\u03d5`.   \n      \nIn order to make the search space smaller and making the search operation less costly, the search for these parameters can be completed in two steps.  \n    \n1) Fix `\u03d5 =1`, assuming that twice more resources are available, and do a small grid search for `\u03b1`, `\u03b2`, and `\u03b3`. For baseline network B0, it turned out the optimal values are `\u03b1 =1.2`, `\u03b2 = 1.1`, and `\u03b3 = 1.15` such that `\u03b1 * \u03b2\u00b2 * \u03b3\u00b2 \u2248 2`  \n    \n2) Now fix `\u03b1`, `\u03b2`, and `\u03b3` as constants (with values found in above step) and experiment with different values of `\u03d5`. The different values of `\u03d5` produce EfficientNets `B1-B7`.\n\n ---","cc907ad7":"## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Near<\/span>**","f11869fc":"This part of the notebook has been referred from [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/heyytanay\/train-baseline-torch-lightning-gpu-tpu-w-b\/notebook)","67a36ac1":"<h1><center>More Plots and Models coming soon!<\/center><\/h1>\n                                                      \n<center><img src = \"https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/5f8fae_7581e21a24a1483085024f88b0949a9d~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_934,h_379,al_c,q_90\/5f8fae_7581e21a24a1483085024f88b0949a9d~mv2.jpg\" width = \"750\" height = \"500\"\/><\/center> ","f3971709":"## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Quantile-Quantile plot of Pawpularity distribution<\/span>**","bf68d1ce":"---","07c4be42":"> ### **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Goal of Competition<\/span>**\n> In this competition, your task is to predict engagement with a pet's profile based on the photograph for that profile.

One measure of width, for example, is the number of channels in a Conv layer whereas Resolution is simply the image resolution that is being passed to a CNN.  \n3) **Resolution**     \n  \nThe figure below(from the paper itself) will give you a clear idea of what scaling means across different dimensions.

Also, FLOPS of a regular convolution op is almost proportional to `d`, `w\u00b2`, `r\u00b2`, i.e. doubling the depth will double the FLOPS while doubling width or resolution increases FLOPS almost by four times. Hence, in order to make sure that the total FLOPS don\u2019t exceed `2^\u03d5`, the constraint applied is that `(\u03b1 * \u03b2\u00b2 * \u03b3\u00b2) \u2248 2`\n    \n ---","31566743":"## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Info<\/span>**","1bb1e3e9":"## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Pawpularity = 70<\/span>**","1de4c1f5":"## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Human<\/span>**","ac610c90":"## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Face<\/span>**","31850dcf":"## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Pawpularity = 10<\/span>**","70db0294":"## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Dataset Size<\/span>**","f70dc0b6":"<h1><center>Pawpular : InDepth EDA + Understanding + Model + W&B<\/center><\/h1>\n                                                      \n<center><img src = \"https:\/\/www.petfinder.my\/images\/logo-575x100.png\" width = \"750\" height = \"500\"\/><\/center>                                                                                               ","2d595bbc":"<a id=\"wandb-dashboard\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"list-group\" id=\"list-tab\" role=\"tablist\">\n<h2 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" style='background:orange; border:0; color:white' role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\"><center>WandB Dashboard<\/center><\/h2>","5921d18f":"<a id=\"global-config\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"list-group\" id=\"list-tab\" role=\"tablist\">\n<h2 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" style='background:orange; border:0; color:white' role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\"><center>Global Config<\/center><\/h2>","5e7dc65f":"<a id=\"efficientnet-model-and-understanding\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"list-group\" id=\"list-tab\" role=\"tablist\">\n<h2 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" style='background:orange; border:0; color:white' role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\"><center>Efficientnet Model and Understanding<\/center><\/h2>"}}
