Because of this, for a few cases I couldn't cleanly calculate the length of a title reign by simply subtracting the difference between when one fighter began his\/her reign and when the next champion began theirs.  In some cases, like in the Lightweight division, the championship was vacant for a number of years! So, in this messy bit coming up, I had to manually adjust for many of these inconsistencies.  I'm not proud to say the amount of time I spent researching all of these to build them into this analysis...","14acfd3f":"# UFC Women's Championship Lineages\nWomen haven't been fighting in the UFC as long as men have and, until recently, the competition in the women's divisions wasn't as equal. As a result, there haven't been as many champions for women as there have been for men. ","d3a59d94":"The flyweight division is a relatively new one and was absolutely dominated by Demetrious Johnson with a whopping 11 consecutive title defenses. But we are now in the era of triple-C, Henry Cejudo, who is currently also the champion of the Bantamweight division as well.  The bantamweight division hasn't really had any overly dominant champions since its introduction to the UFC.    \n\nThe featherweight division was really run by Jose Aldo for a long time until Conor McGregor famously beat him in 13 seconds.    \n\nThe lightweight division is interesting because its title was vacant for about 4 years between 2002 and 2006!    \n\nIn the mid-range weight classes, there were two clearly historically dominant championship reigns: Georges St-Pierre's second championship reign in the welterweight division lasted 2,064 days and Anderson Silva's title reign in the middleweight division lasted 2,457 days! These are the number 1 and number 3 longest title reigns of all time.    \n\nMoving on to the light heavyweight division, this is clearly Jon Jones' world. He had the longest reign of all time, and the most consecutive title defenses in that division. And one could argue that if he didn't have to vacate his title twice (!), he would by far have the most dominant reign in the division, and perhaps the longest reign of all time across all divisions.    \n\nFinally, the heavyweight division is a bunch of killers, and that is clear from how short a typical title reign is and how much turnover there has been in the champion lineage. Stipe Miocic set the record for heavyweight title defenses, and he only successfully defended it three times! Compare that to Demetrious Johnson in the flyweight division who defended his belt a record 11 times.  ","365944fa":"## Some last steps before plotting the lineages\nI am going to create two separate Gantt plots, one for men's divisions and one for women's divisions. I am going to color the bars of the plots in a way that reflects the number of times a fighter successfully defended the title. In order to make this comparable across weight classes, I will transform the number of defenses by normalizing them within each weight class.\n","510096f3":"# UFC Men's Championship Lineages","7455eb6b":"Here we see that for the Strawweight division, Joanna Jedrzejczyk absolutely has been the most dominant champion, having the most title defenses and a reign of nearly three years.    \n\nFor flyweights, Valentina Shevchenko is the dominant champ, but there have only been two. But the way she is fighting, she could be the champ in that division for a long time.    \n\nThe bantamweight division is interesting, because there is truly a Ronda Rousey era and Amanda Nunes era. Misha Tate and Holly Holm had ***very*** short title reigns.    \n\nFinally, the featherweight division is the smallest women's division, and many people believe it was basically created for Cris Cyborg to compete in the UFC. As a result, she has had the longest title reign, but it looks like Amandas Nunes will be pretty hard to remove as the current title holder, so I suspect she will eventually have the longest reign and most defenses of any women's featherweight. ","856c1f6e":"## Calculating Length of Title Reign\nNow that I have a full set of records for each title, I need to calculate the length of each specific title reign. This required identifying distinct title reigns, even when they were for the same fighter. So, for example, Georges St-Pierre had one title reign where he lost the title to Matt Serra, and then won the title again later. These are two distinct title reigns for the same fighter that need to be included in the lineage. Once I have identified these, I will only keep one row per title reign. Whenever the title was vacant, I drop those rows from the dataframe. This simply will make the plots later on look better.","89f2023f":"# Getting Data for Title Fights\nSince I am only interested in following the lineage of titles, I will restrict the dataframe to only include title bouts that were not a part of a tournament, The Ultimate Fighter series, or interim title bouts. Then, I am going to identify the weight classes and genders for each fight type, create dictionaries linking those two with the full name of the fight type, and then create new columns by mapping those dictionaries to the fight type in the dataframe. Then, I will sort the dataframe according to weight class and date.","b28e140f":"# Introduction\nIn this notebook I am going to construct the lineage of UFC champions for all of the existing weight classes. Starting out, it seemed like it would be very straightforward, but there ended up being many details that had to be adjusted in the data because, for example, sometimes fighters vacate their titles or are forced to give them up because of a positive drug test.  Also, because the data was last collected in June 2019, some additional champions had to be added to the data as well. So, I apologize in advance for some of the messy stuff in the middle of this kernel, but there was no way to avoid it.","ed6964c3":"# Conclusion\nThanks for sticking with me through this. Hope you enjoyed the lineage plots. It took me a long time to figure out how to make these plots and fine tune them, but I think they tell a nice, self-contained history of the UFC.  Hope you enjoyed it! "}}
