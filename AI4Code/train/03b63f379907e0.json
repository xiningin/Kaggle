I check the dc_films.","adfbd6d3":"Both Marvel and DC have been the competitive rivals in comics and released as comic books and cartoons. However, Marvel films have been more popular than DC films, as Marvel films have received higher ratings than DC films in general. Especially, the president of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, has invested more time on developing scripts and Marvel Universe. By this, Marvel films have well structured storyline and led this to receive more positive ratings from the audience. \n\nIn this analysis, I will try to solve the underlying questions that I've had:\n\n1. Which entity (or universe) has received higher average IMDb ratings?\n2. If the movie has higher IMDb rating, does it mean that it will lead to higher gross?\n3. What is the relationship between IMDb rating and Rotten Tomato rating?","ad70b496":"Once I've renamed the column, I just got rid of 'index' column, as I don't really need it.\nThen, I've checked to see if there are some missing values.","543ecee9":"Before we analyze, I've browsed dataset named 'mdc.csv.'

Yet, does it mean that higher IMDb rating leads to higher gross? Let's find out!"}}
