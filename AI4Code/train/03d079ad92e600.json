Sign in*\n\nGoogle Colab is a jupyter environment and has TPU, GPU to help you on your machine learning project. It is free but it has some restrictions. Like it will automatically shut down after 12-hour-running. Get a google account and you can easily sign into colab.\ngo to your google drive and click \"new-more-google colabotary\"\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VnKm26l.png)\n\n*2. Use GPU*\n\nThen you will see a jupyter notebook. The best of colab is GPU, so use GPU as much as you can!\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ygC91Et.png)\nAfter clicking the \"change runtime type\" button, you can choose GPU and also TPU if you want.\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Ew4f151.png)\n\n*3. Import your files*\n\nI'll just explain the easiest way.\nFirst, import your drive.","92ddc002":"**The First one-Google Cloud**\n\n>Google cloud is really generous! If you have a google account, you can get 300 dollars for free and create a [instance](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/compute\/docs\/instances\/). The following is the detailed process of creating a instance in google cloud.\n\n*1. sign up*\n\ngoogle \"google cloud\" and visit its official website:\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xlTllyb.png)\nclick get started for free and use your google account to sign up\nThen it will ask you for your credit card account to symbolically take away one dollar from you. After that, you can enjoy your google cloud!\n\n*2. create an instance*\n\nTo see the complete introduction of instance, learn from the [docs](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/compute\/docs\/) and [videos](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/googlecloud). For kagglers, we need a virtual machine (VM) with big memory space, so we will use the VM Instance service.\nclick the button and create a new project\n![project](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XyaR91B.png)\nchoose VM Instance from computer engine\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7S9udCl.png)\nthen we go into the edit interface.First, name your instance. Second, choose your region. Third, choose your machine type.\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Wn2lON5.png)\nI chose general purpose and 8v cpu, 52GB memory.You can view the detailed information [here](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/compute\/docs\/machine-types).\nAs we know, GPU is extremely fast for catboost and xgboost, so if you want to have GPU, click the \" CPU platform and GPU\" link below.\nNow it's time to choose our operation system image. If you know how to use Ubuntu, strongly recommend Ubuntu, because you only need \"pip install xgboost\" to install xgboost. However, I don't know it at all, so I chose windows 2008 R2,which I was quite familiar with.\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oTmupt6.png)\nThen just choose what I chose.\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tCC5nn6.png)\nnow you have an instance!\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sqrD5SR.png)\n\n*3. set static external IP and firewall rules*\n\nthe external IP address is dynamic by default, so we have to change the type from Ephemeral to Static\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sLTVjjj.png)\nnow click on the \"Firewall Rules\" below \"External IP addresses\" and create firewall rule,you can specify your port number.\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/8cIxxWg.png)\n\n*4. start the instance and install the coding environment*\n\nFinally! It's time to use your instance!\nMy connect method is RDP, if your method is SSH, you can see the instructions [here](https:\/\/medium.com\/towards-data-science\/running-jupyter-notebook-in-google-cloud-platform-in-15-min-61e16da34d52).\nReset your password and download the RDP file. \n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lQhjYtL.png)\nThe RDP file is for remote desktop connection, clear instruction is [here](https:\/\/filext.com\/file-extension\/RDP). Lucky that we don't have to set anything because it contains all the information. \nstart your instance\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2ZSjmcP.png)\nJust click the RDP file and connect your instance remotely!\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Kf0W9tI.png)\nThe first connection need password, the later ones don't. When you connect succefully(remember to close the VPN), you can see a interface telling you \" preparing for your desktop\".\nThis is my desktop, but at the beginning it was not that pretty. The icons were very small.Besides, it didn't have google chorme, annaconda and jupyter! So download them just in the way you did on your own PC.\n[](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZMqFaus.png)\n\n*5. save your \"money\"*\nAlthough we didn't pay too much on this, we still have to be enconomy. Stop your instance as soon as you don't need it!","49fe1d92":"Then your files will be loaded. \nAbove are my review on infrustructures. Next kernel I will write something about EDA.","2696c961":"> This is the first time I take part in a kaggle competiion and write a kaggle notebook. Up to now, my best takeaway is \"learn from others\". Before this competition, I organized a small project which used the data of Prosper from kaggle when I was in my sophomore year.At that time we only ran a random forest model in R, not knowing xgboost or lightgbm or cross validation. Now from the discussions and notebooks of kaggle, I see people generously sharing their codes and methods, which really helped me a lot.\n\n>The competition has been in progress for a month, so I want to write some reviews on my competition.\n\n>The dataset is huge so we have to build solid infrastructure. The first review is about how to prepare for the competition.\nAs we know, kaggle offers a platform but there are some other free and convinient computing platform.","81a14628":"Then you'll see output like this, just click the link and allow colab to access:\n\"Go to this URL in a browser: https:\/\/accounts.google.com\/...\n\nEnter your authorization code:\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nMounted at \/content\/drive\/\"\n\nAfter authorization, click the \">\" to open the left pane \n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hlrTRhy.png)\nThen click \"file\".
