With the exception of Guam, all states had an intersection between the rates of people who smokes everyday, and people who used to smoke. As the the number of people who smokes everyday decreases, the number of former smokers increases. Based on the graphs, it is hard to predict if the number of daily smokers are decreasing every year, but if it does, the number of former smokers and possibly the number of occasional smokers will increase. Additionally, people who never smoked never decreased throughout the years.\n\nThe line graphs of each state that has the lowest average tobacco consumption, has particular patterns that can be followed except that the rates of people who smokes daily, and former smokers are generally lower compared to the states that has the highest average tobacco consumption. The visible changes that can be seen from the graphs is similar to the changes discussed above.","b9e4742b":"The first horizontal bar graph shows the ten states with the highest average daily smoking consumption. With Nevada being the 10th and Kentucky being the 1st, the highest daily smoking states ranges from 19 to 25. The second horizontal bar graphs shows the top ten states with the lowest average daily smoking consumption. With Virgin Islands being the 1st and Maryland being the 10th the lowest daily smoking states ranges from 5 to 15. Ultimately, it can be assumed that the number of non-smokers per state is higher than the people who smokes, or used to smoke.\n","8704fe68":"#1.
