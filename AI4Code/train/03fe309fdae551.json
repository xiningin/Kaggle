A histogram is used to showcase a graphical presentation that represents the data in the form of frequency, whereas a bar chart is also a graphical representation of data and the information that is used for the comparison of two categories.\n\n2. A bar chart is used in summarizing categorical data, a histogram uses a bar of different heights, it is similar to the bar chart in many terms but the histogram groups the numbers into the ranges while representing the data.","c1736445":"Q1) Out of 100 people with different blood types: 30 of them have 'A' type, 24 people have 'B' type, 8 people have 'AB' type and 38 people have 'O' type."}}
