That swab goes into a tube and is sent to a lab. Some large hospitals have on-site molecular test labs, but most samples are sent to outside laboratories for processing. More on that later.\n\nThat transit time usually runs about 24 hours, but it could be longer, depending on how far the hospital is from the processing laboratory. Once at the lab, the specimen is processed, which means lab workers extract the virus's RNA, the molecule that helps regulate genes. \"That step of cleaning \u2014 the RNA extraction step \u2014 is one limiting factor,\" says Cathie Klapperich, vice chair of the department of biomedical engineering at Boston University. \"Only the very biggest labs have automated ways of extracting RNA from a sample and doing it quickly.\"\n\nAfter the RNA is extracted, technicians also must carefully mix special chemicals with each sample and run those combinations in a machine for analysis, a process called polymerase chain reaction, which can detect whether the sample is positive or negative for COVID.\n\n\"Typically, a PCR test takes six hours from start to finish to complete,\" says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. Some labs have larger staffs and more machines, so they can process more tests at a time than others. But even for those labs, as demand grows, so does the backlog.\n\nCapacity is expanding, but not fast enough Initially, only a few public health labs and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention processed COVID-19 tests. Problems with the first CDC test kits also led to delays. Now the CDC has a better kit, and 94 public health labs across the country do COVID-19 testing, says Wroblewski. But those labs can't possibly do all that's needed. In normal times, their main function is regular public health surveillance \u2014 detecting more common threats such as outbreaks of measles or monitoring seasonal influenza \u2014 \"but not to do diagnostic testing of the magnitude that is required in this response,\" she says.\n\n\"A chief medical officer on the East Coast said that, up until two days ago, on average, it was taking 72 hours to get results,\" says Susan Van Meter, executive director of AdvaMedDx, a division of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a device and diagnostics industry trade group. \"That will get better as our member companies come on the market.\" Even so, supply is not keeping up with demand, Roche CEO Severin Schwan told CNBC on Monday. Roche won the first approval from the FDA for a test kit under emergency rules, and it has delivered more than 400,000 kits so far. \"Demand continues to be much higher than supply,\" Schwan told CNBC. \"So we are glad that overall capacity is increasing, but the reality is that broad-based testing is not yet possible.","62dfce2b":"# The affected Clinial Trials for the top Biotech Companies:","9de4153e":"<h3> Breakdown of COVID-19 Death Cases in South Korea <\/h3>\n\nThe following is the dataset that shows the deaths in South Korea by diseases that the patients had suffered.

The count of blood components <\/H3>\n\nPatients tested positive for COVID-19 show significantly lower levels of platelets, leukocytes and eosinophils. We can also observe lower levels of calcium and magnesium, but significantly higher concentrations of ferritin, in comparison to patients tested negative for COVID-19.\n\nThe decrease in white blood cells (leukocytes) can either be a direct result of the COVID-19 infection or other pre-existing conditions. This decrease lowers patient immunity against COVID-19 and other infections in general. Additionally, electrolytes and minerals such as potassium, magnesium and zinc play a critical role in maintaining vitality, repairing cell damage, as well as immunity.\n\n<H3> 2. The Associations <\/H3>\n\nBy extracting clinical data from the literature, we can examine the abnormalities in blood tests in patients diagnosed with cancer and patients testing positive for COVID-19. Blood test results for multiple minerals were extracted for patients with lung cancer and compared with levels seen in COVID-19 patients. [1,2]\n\nBecause the clinical data available for patients tested for COVID-19 is normalised, measurements retrieved for cancer patients were also normalised using blood concentration in control groups as the mean. The published data has reported the mean and standard deviation of the measurements instead of idividual readings, we use these metrics to simulate mineral concentrations in cancer patients assuming a normal distribution. The measurements retrieved from studies were for Magnesium, Ferritin and Zinc in both cancer patients as well as control groups.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/3WgqNGV\/2.png\" alt=\"2\" border=\"0\">","e032d965":"<H3> Analysis of Electrolyte Abnormalities <\/h3>\n\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/gTjCb0X\/4.png\" alt=\"4\" border=\"0\">\n\nPatients diagnosed with lung cancer show a wide distribution of ferritin levels, however, it peaks around +0.5 standard deviation unites which is similar to the peak of ferritin levels of patients tested positive for COVID-19.

Trillium is expecting enrollment in the two studies to slow or pause altogether as \"many clinical sites are putting enrollment of new patients on hold.\" The affected drugs, TTI-621 and TTI-622, are the only two Trillium has in human testing.\n\n\n<h4> 16. Fate Therapeutics <\/h4>  Disease: Cancer  \nAction: Delayed enrollment. Fate said the timelines for many of its ongoing trials will be impaced by \"potential delays or disruptions in patient enrollment and site initiation.\" The drugmaker didn't say which studies will likely be affected, though.\n\n<h4> 17. Novocure <\/h4>  Disease: Cancer  \nAction: Delayed enrollment and completion of several studies. Novocure didn't provide specifics, but said the pandemic will delay the timing of enrollment and completion of its trials \"by multiple quarters.\" The biotech currently has six studies ongoing.\n\n<h4> 18. BioNTech <\/h4>  Disease: Cancer, rare and infectious diseases  \nDrug: Eight experimental candidates  \nAction: Postponed start of several trials. BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine efforts have moved to the forefront during the pandemic. But the outbreak has led to delays for several of its other programs for cancer, rare diseases, and influenza.\n\n<h4> 19. CytomX Therapeutics <\/h4>  Disease: Breast cancer and melanoma  \nDrug: CX-2009 and CX-072  \nAction: Paused new patient enrollment and new site activation; terminated trial. CytomX intends to resume the study of breast cancer drug CX-2009 as soon as possible. But COVID-19 has led CytomX to end its combination study of CX-072 and the immunotherapy Yervoy in melanoma. It will invest resources elsewhere.\n\n\n<h4> 20. Synlogic <\/h4>  Two clinical trials  \nDisease: Phenylketonuria and cancer  \nDrug: SYNB1618, SYNB1891  \nAction: Delayed enrollment in two clinical trials. Synlogic doesn't expect to enroll patients in a planned Phase 2 trial of its PKU drug SYNB1618 until \"it is safe for patients to enter clinical trial sites.\" Its Phase 1 study of cancer drug SYNB1891 is already underway, but it'll be tough to recruit new patients for the trial, which makes it less likely that Synlogic will report data this year.\n\n<h4> 21. Moderna <\/h4>   Disease: Rare diseases, cancer and infectious diseases  \nDrug: mRNA-3704, mRNA-3927, mRNA-1653 and mRNA-1944  \nAction: Paused new patient enrollment in several clinical trials. The pandemic has affected several of Moderna's trials. Enrollment in four studies has been suspended, and other ongoing trials may be disrupted because of recruitment delays or problems getting patients their next dose on time during the outbreak.\n","483d8ccd":"# Let's Wrangle the Web\n\nThe following details are the best to describe and answer the problem statement asked for this question under the UNCOVER COVID-19 Challenge.

Therefore, it makes sense to search for a potential BIOMARKER that could rapidly and effectively identify severe cases early. Clinical samples from 28 cases of COVID-19 (8 severe cases, 20 mild cases) in Zunyi District from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were collected and otherwise statistically analysed for biochemical markers. \n\nSerum urea, creatinine (CREA) and cystatin C (CysC) concentrations in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.001), and there were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). \n\nSerum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including urea, CREA, CysC, which reflect glomerular filtration function, may have some significance as potential indicators for the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and to distinguish it from mild COVID-19. Glomerular filtration function injury in severe COVID-19 patients should also be considered by clinicians.","c0382eb9":"# Analysis 2 : What is the incident of COVID-19 Infections in Cancer Patients? \n\nNot much detail on COVID-19 Specific association with certain diseases like cancer is available publically.
