Vad\u00e1sz & \u00c8. Dem\u00e9ny  -Pneumonologie volume 151, pages151\u2013159(1974)\n\nUsing the yearly standard data supply and data of some representative epidemiological investigations, the present authors studied the impact of the BCG vaccination program on tuberculosis in children during the last 20 years in Hungary.\n\nConsidering the incidence of active tuberculosis among vaccinated and unvaccinated children according to age as well as the rate of vaccination in the various age groups, authors point out that: \n\nThe BCG vaccination program proved to be effective during the entire period of investigation;\n\nPrevalence of bacillary TB had a marked influence on the incidence of the disease, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated children;\n\nThe impact of the BCG-vaccination program on the problem of childhood tuberculosis had been determined by the percentage of those vaccinated; \n\nAnd finally  the relatively high frequency of disease in the higher age groups (15 to 19-year-olds) indicates that the TB problem still exists and continuation of the various TB control methods is therefore  justified.https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/BF02097162","4b879b0b":"#Hungary Covid-19. August 24 - 09:15 AM: Number of infections increases to 5,191\n\nThe number of confirmed people infected with the coronavirus in Hungary now stands at 5,191. In compulsory home quarantine:7,917. Recovered: 3,695. Deceased: 613.\n\nThe total number of active COVID-19 cases is 883. The results show that 35 percent of those infected, 60 percent of the deceased, and 43 percent of those recovered live in Budapest. There are currently 59 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus, nine of whom are on ventilators.\n\nAugust 24 - 09:03 AM: Chief Security Advisor: Stricter border controls will keep the coronavirus out\n\nHungary's chief security advisor said imposing border controls is the most effective way to prevent the import of the novel coronavirus from abroad.\n\nGyorgy Bakondi told public news channel M1 that the epidemic is worsening across Europe, including countries close to Hungary and this forces the government to tighten border restrictions from September.\n\nBakondi said these measures will not be new to the public, noting that similar restrictions were imposed during the height of the epidemic in the spring. \u201cThe important thing is for Hungarians to be aware that such a plan is in the works and for them to arrange their trips in a way that they comply with tightened border controls which could create difficult situations when one is leaving or entering the country,\u201d \n\nThe government will do everything in its power to keep the virus outside the country and prevent its import from abroad either by Hungarians or foreigners, he added. To this end, border controls, screenings and quarantine rules must be tightened and the government must review its classification of countries according to the prevalence of Covid-19. http:\/\/abouthungary.hu\/news-in-brief\/coronavirus-heres-the-latest\/","8437b18a":"#I think my Tweet World is Mute.

Findings provide chance to study pathogens from a time before antibiotics. \n\nBritish scientists have recovered tuberculosis DNA from a 200 year-old Hungarian mummy. University of Warwick researchers have recovered tuberculosis (TB) genomes from the lung tissue of the mummy using a technique known as metagenomics.\n\nScientists have previously performed molecular analyses of a chest sample taken from the mummy and deduced that her death was the result of TB. https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-2373218\/Could-tuberculosis-DNA-recovered-200-year-old-mummy-provide-doctors-new-ways-treat-disease.html\n\n![](https:\/\/media.springernature.com\/lw685\/springer-static\/image\/art%3A10.1038%2Fncomms7717\/MediaObjects\/41467_2015_Article_BFncomms7717_Fig1_HTML.jpg?as=webp)(a) Location of V\u00e1c, Hungary.
