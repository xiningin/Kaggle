Conclusions","20d5a616":"Happiness score depends on each region with different shapes of distributions and relations within variables.\nAs we see in pair plot show earlier, we have a positive correlation between these variables. It is also happening in each regions except Sub-Saharan Africa region.\nData has been researched via different aspects by using varied tools and arguments. Even though, data set gives us a clear understanding of correlations between variables, Happiness Score is explained by %78 percentage considering PCA scores.\nConsidering PCA results, we can say that due to the high correlations between variables effects PCA score so first values are enough to see relations between considered factors and Happiness Score.\nBy following the results, we see on this study, we can advise to extend variables and the number of participants to have an accurate understanding on Happiness Score. Happiness score has a high relation between Family, Economy GPD Capita and Health Life Expectancy.\n","3d7fc356":"### 4-b) Checking last versions of each data sets "}}
