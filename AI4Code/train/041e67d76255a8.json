We can also see that the majority of Marvel films recevied a 6.5-7.5 rating while DC films received around a 7.5 rating more than any other number.","4144389c":"## Let's compare the total gross per year for each company","874f0abf":"Observations:\n\nThere seems to be a correlation between the ratings and box office gross, especially when it comes to Marvel films. We can look further into this by using Pearson Correlation Coefficients","72d5c17b":"## How are the IMDB ratings distributed?","d4ec61ce":"Observations:\n\nFrom these tables, we can see that Marvel has a stronger relationship between the Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office gross, while DC has a stronger relationship with between the IMDB ratings and box office gross.","9834e0bf":"# Marvel & DC Live-Action Films Analysis by Ammar Altalibi\n\nUses MARVEL vs. DC - IMDB & ROTTEN TOMATOES dataset from Kaggle\n\nLink to dataset: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jcraggy\/marvel-vs-dc-imdb-rotten-tomatoes\n\n\nThis is my exploratory data analysis of Marvel vs DC live action films. I decided to compare the 2 companies based on ratings and profits, and included my thoughts and observations underneath each graph.","a69aceb7":"### Conclusions\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude the following:\n\n1. Marvel has been producing more films than DC for the last few years, and is producing films at an increasing rate\n2. On average, Marvel films perform better both critically and financially\n3. IMDB ratings seems to be a better indicator for gross performance for DC films, but Rotten Tomatoes is a better indicator for Marvel films.\n\nFurther analysis could find insights that support these conclusions further, or even contradict it. There are still many more methods of analysis that could be done, such as sentiment analysis for the critic consensus, and predictive modelling for gross revenue when given the rating. Thank you for reading!","87442e32":"## Is there a relationship between the ratings and the box office gross?","c8817fbd":"Observations:\n\nWe can see that Marvel has made a bigger profit than DC nearly every year. DC's profits are also relatively consistent, while Marvel has been slowly increasing over the last 10 years. Could this be because Marvel has been increasing the number of films each year?","cdd5d00c":"Observations:\n\nOn average, it seems that DC is able to compete with Marvel in terms of box office gross. If DC can increase the number of films released each year, then they could theoretically make as much profit as Marvel does.","5c5d1513":"Observations:\n\nNow we can see that Marvel is in fact increasing the number of films released for the last few years, which can explain its exponential growth in revenue. This means that taking the average box office gross would be more appropriate when comparing DC to Marvel."}}
