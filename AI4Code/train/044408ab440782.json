Home learning environments and social reproduction during school closures in Ireland\n\nAuthors: Gretta Mohan, Eamonn Carroll, Selina McCoy, Ciar\u00e1n Mac Domhnaill & Georgiana Mihut\n\nIrish Educational Studies  -Volume 40, 2021 - Issue 2: COVID-19 and Education: Positioning the Pandemic; Facing the Future. \n\n\"This paper presents research on the resources and supports available for students to engage with learning in their home environments. Evidence from a nationally representative survey comprising one third of second-level school leaders, conducted during the first school closures in 2020, shows that attendance and engagement appears to be influenced by the educational level of parents\/guardians.\"\n\n\"More than three quarters of school leaders reported school attendance worsened during the closures period. Reduced student engagement across the whole school was reported by 70% of schools, and 65% reported negative effects on engagement for Junior Certificate students and over half reported such among Leaving Certificate students.\"\n\n\"Where the classroom presents a (roughly) equal learning environment for all students, the HLE was characterised by the largely unique experience of every household. Families had differential access to suitable devices and broadband, and varying degrees of appropriate space shared between different numbers of children and, where they were working from home, parents as well.\"\n\n\"Parental support became even more important in the absence of normal school structures to encourage or enforce student attendance and engagement. The long-term benefits of remaining engaged became more intangible for those struggling from day to day.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/03323315.2021.1915841\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/03323315.2021.1915841","45d81d23":"#Senegal","3dc93b25":"#Somalia"}}
