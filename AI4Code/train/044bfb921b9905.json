Its concentration decreases the more a grape ripens. Malic Acid provides a strong link to wines tasting \u2018flat\u2019 if there is not enough. If there is too much the wine will taste \u2018sour\u2019. It is vital that the levels of malic acid are monitored during the fermentation process.\n\n- **Ash =** Ash determination is an obligatory analysis for certified wines to be placed on the market. It is defined as all the inorganic matter remaining after igniting the residue left from the evaporation of must or wine\n\n- **Ash_Alcanity =** The alkalinity of the ash is defined as the sum of cations, other than the ammonium ion, combined with the organic acids in the wine\n\n- **Magnesium =** Magnesium cations are present in wine as a result of soil nutrient uptake in the vineyard.\n\n- **Total_Phenols =** The phenolic content in wine refers to the phenolic compounds\u2014natural phenol and polyphenols\u2014in wine, which include a large group of several hundred chemical compounds that affect the taste, color and mouthfeel of wine. \n\n- **Flavonoids =** Flavonoids are the main polyphenols present in red wine by weight, and constitute about 80 to 90% of total polyphenols\n\n- **Nonflavanoid_Phenols =** Non-flavonoid phenolics include several subclasses of importance to wine, in particular the hydroxycinnamates, stilbenes, and benzoic acids.\n\n- **Proanthocyanins =** Proanthocyanidins are the principal polyphenols in red wine that are under research to assess risk of coronary heart disease and lower overall mortality. With tannins, they also influence the aroma, flavor, mouth-feel and astringency of red wines.\n\n- **Color_Intensity =** A simple measure of how dark the wine is using a summation of absorbance measurements in the violet, green and red areas of the visible spectrum\n\n- **Proline =** Proline is typically the most abundant amino acid present in grape juice and wine.","31532d52":"# Preprocessing","6436124b":"- If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical\n- If the skewness is between -1 and \u2013 0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the data are moderately skewed\n- If the skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, the data are highly skewed\n\nwe don't need any skewness process ","e658d9d3":"# EDA","3e17da4d":"# Modelling","021b5eb8":"**Inertia** measures how well a dataset was clustered by K-Means. It is calculated by measuring the distance between each data point and its centroid, squaring this distance, and summing these squares across one cluster.\n\nA good model is one with low inertia AND a low number of clusters (K). However, this is a tradeoff because as K increases, inertia decreases.\n\nTo find the optimal K for a dataset, use the Elbow method; find the point where the decrease in inertia begins to slow.
