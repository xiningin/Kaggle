Before offcially starting the internship, I want to find out what people usually do in their data-related roles. By summarizing the answers to Q9 - Select any activities that make up an important part of your role at work, the following table was produced listing the data-related tasks of the surveyees in a descending order of popularity. It turns out that analyzing and understanding data to influence product or business decisions is the most common task, as expected. What comes second is building prototypes to explore applying machine learning to new areasis, which reflects the overall active to explore attitude of the NZ businesses toward Machine Learning, in accordance with the observation made from the previous question. The next three common tasks, namely buildinng and\/or running a machine learning service that operationally improves my product or workflows, experimentation and iteration to improve existing ML models, and building and\/or running the data infrastructure that my business uses for storing, analyzing, and operationalizing data, sound more like routine tasks of running ML software bought from other companies and maintaining company databases, etc.","a4029c36":"With the impression left on me from job search, the companies that recruite data scientists\/engineers\/analysts are composed of both startups, big firms, and government sectors. I may get to learn if this impression is correct by studying the answers to question 6: What is the size of the company where you are employed? Among the 51 responses, the largest proportion (12 people) is empployed by companies with fewer than 50 employees. These are probably startups and growing companies. What comes next is companies with 50-249 employees (2nd highest) and 250-999 employees (4th highest), which may be banks, automotive corporations, property management agencies, and so on. There are also quite a few employed by companies with 1000-9999 employees (3rd highest). These are possibly public sectors, universities and multinational companies. According to the New Zealand AI forum report in 2018[1], these are indeed active appliers of artificial intelligence in New Zealand.\n\n[1] Artificial Intelligence Shaping a Future New Zealand.

Those between 20,000 to 40,000 USD may be contractors or casual workers. A graduate or junior position in this industry usually earns between 40,000 to 60,000 USD. An intermediate position 60,000 to 80,000 USD. A senior position 80,000 to 100,000 USD. People at management level may earn more than 100,000 USD per year.

Some are more senior, and a few may not have a full-time job.","8d9406f3":"Since I am based in Auckland, I'd like to look at the New Zealand data first. Luckily, there are 51 responses from New Zealand so it is not categorized as 'others' in the country list. New Zealand is a small country with fewer than 5 million population.

The bar chart below shows the number of responses per million population for these five countries. The number of responses per million population reflects somewhat the scale of the data science industry in a country. Having the median number of responses per million population among the five countries, New Zealand's data science industry is slightly more developed than Denmark and Norway, but far less developed than Ireland and Singapore.

For small companies with 0-49 employees, 1-2 is the most frequent size of the data team. Some (perhaps data driven tech companies) have a larger team of 5-9 people. For companies with 50-249 employees, 1-4 is still the most common data team size. For larger companies (250-9999 employees), teams with 20+ people begin to occur, while the majority still have a team size of 1-9 people. Surprisingly, the companies with more than 10000 employees only have 0-4 individuals responsible for data science workloads based on this survey. These results suggest that data science is still not a commonly used tool for most of the businesses in New Zealand. The answers to Q8 - Does your current employer incorporate machine learning methods into their business? also confirm this observation. Most of the businesses are just exploring ML or have recently started using ML.","9a128708":"### 1.3 Size of data science team","6a4e415e":"### 2.1 Learning platforms","302878db":"## 1.

It's an ideal place to learn at a self-controlled pace without the trouble to travel to a campus or stick to fixed timetables. When I checked out its website, I found that most degrees were offered by renowned universites and as a result, cost a lot. That's the main reason why I personally didn't choose this platform to start my data science learning journey. The second most popular learning source is university courses. More and more universities are providing data science related degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. But what dominates in data science learning is still online resources - and I'm surprised by the variety of these sources. Personally, I'm learning with Udacity and Codecademy. Codecademy is not listed here, but it's an affordable learning platform for total beginners.

The most common title is Product\/Project Manager, which accounts for 25.5% among all reported job titles. People with this title are more likely to adopt data science and machine learning as a new approach to their work. Other common job titles include Data Scientist (15.7%), Business Analyst (11.8%), and Data Engineer (9.8%). These are indeed quite common positions to be found when searching data science on job sites. Interestingly, quite a number of surveyees reported themselves as not employed (13.7%) or other (11.8%). According to the 'other_text_responses.csv' file, the people who chose other didn't specify what other means. Those who classied themselves as not employed may be people like me: university or higher degree graduates who are seeking to change their major, stay-at-home moms, young entrepreneurs, and so on. "}}
