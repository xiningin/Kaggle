Most songs were provided by Post Malone and XXXTENTACION (6 each).","67502b50":"- `id`: Spotify URI of the song\n- `name`: Name of the song\n- `artists`: Artist(s) of the song\n- `danceability`: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n- `energy`: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\n- `key`: The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C\u266f\/D\u266d, 2 = D, and so on.\n- `loudness`: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\n- `mode`: Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n- `speechiness`: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\n- `acousticness`: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\n- `instrumentalness`: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. \"Ooh\" and \"aah\" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \"vocal\". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\n- `liveness`: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n- `valence`: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n- `tempo`: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n- `duration_ms`: The duration of the track in milliseconds.\n- `time_signature`: An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).","1913994c":"What can be explored about the name of the song?\n- Length of the song name in characters\n - **Answer**: Mostly ranging from 1 to ~15 characters. \n- Length of the song name in words\n - **Answer**: Mostly songs with 1-2-3 words in their name.\n- Presence of `\"feat.\"` \u2013 we can calculate how many co-op songs make it to the top, for example. Because as we can see in the data, each song is corresponding to single artist. However, the song may be a collaboration, as denoted by the `\"feat.\"` mark in the title\n - **Answer**: Most of the songs are not collabs.","6a2b1796":"It is interesting to see that high danceability doesn't necessarily mean high energy.","7d7d3060":"<font size=\"4\">_Audio features of top Spotify songs_<\/font>","ca6b8f47":"Well, obivously, the more acoustic a song is, the less energy it has, and the more quiet it gets.","f921a0fe":"TODO: Finish the analysis.","ab109622":"### Importing The Tools","24ac3159":"It doesn't seem so. But acoustic songs are definitely much more quiet than non-acoustic ones.","88aba44d":"### Data Description","30cbeb01":"This doesn't tell us much. Maybe there is an interesting correlation, though.","1a65662b":"#### `acousticness`","ef74fa98":"#### `mode`","34a9cb61":"Let's write a function that clears the song names from `<feat.>` and `<with>` words and extracts useful information \u2013 either the original song title, or its length in words, or the name of a collaborator.","7329e12e":"It is interesting, because the count does not include the collabs. So what needs to be done is to count artists in the `collaborator` column and add the numbers to the respected artists in the above Series. I am pretty sure that Cardi B has several collabs, which technically means she is also responsible for the song; however, she has only 1 count in the overall counts.","0987ba60":"Well, it doesn't seem that people like acoustic songs thet much, really. ","5cc63afa":"The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.","10f61b32":"Energy distribution doesn't really tell that much \u2013 well, it seems a song has to be danceable and quite energetic, in order to become popular. I am interested, however, is there a correlation between danceability and energy? Can a danceable song be not-energetic?","0c40bf0a":"#### `duration_ms`","389bd174":"Let's see if all acoustic songs are written in a common key (who knows?)","b99f894d":"Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.","76f95496":"Let's add a hue on whether a certain point on the jointplot corresponds to a song that is made by most popular artists.","d4ac1ea6":"The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C\u266f\/D\u266d, 2 = D, and so on.","a929bede":"We have to correct songs number 21, 46, 47, 84, 98.","a12c55e4":"#### `energy`","25f47fb4":"#### `tempo`","1a3c75f9":"This is interesting \u2013 looks like it is more possible to have a sad or angry song... Neutral at best.","d9b72adb":"It can be seen that most of the songs are quite danceable (value being bigger than 0.5). "}}
