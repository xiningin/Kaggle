If the busssiness decides to continue to invest in Social Media ads, i would suggest that the they do it only with Mega Influencers.","b8f7ae82":"## Import data","37570cfb":"### Right now, we can see that the TV budget is the bigger of the three, being the social media the lowest budget the company has.","1a2eb958":"# Metrics\n","3d2cc50a":"## Libraries","30801b0f":"### Variables Definition\n\n##### TV promotion budget (in million)\n##### Social Media promotion budget (in million)\n##### Radio promotion budget (in million)\n##### Influencer: Whether the promotion collaborate with Mega, Macro, Nano, Micro influencer\n##### Sales (in million)","b3bce268":"### Using dummy variables will help me doing the regression."}}
