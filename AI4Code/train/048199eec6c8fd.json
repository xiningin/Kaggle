The Prophet Forecasting Model\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at how Prophet works. In its essence, this library utilizes the [additive regression model](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Additive_model) $y(t)$ comprising the following components:\n\n$$y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \\epsilon_{t},$$\n\nwhere:\n* Trend $g(t)$ models non-periodic changes.\n* Seasonality $s(t)$ represents periodic changes.\n* Holidays component $h(t)$ contributes information about holidays and events.\n\nBelow, we will consider some important properties of these model components.","2ecbbb51":"### 3.6 Visualization\n\nLet's create our own visualization of the model built by Prophet. It will comprise the actual values, forecast and confidence intervals.\n\nFirst, we will plot the data for a shorter period of time to make the data points easier to distinguish. Second, we will show the model performance only for the period that we predicted, that is the last 30 days. It seems that these two measures should give us a more legible plot.\n\nThird, we will use `Plotly` to make our chart interactive, which is great for exploring.\n\nWe will define a custom helper function `show_forecast` and call it (for more on how it works please refer to the comments in the code and the [documentation](https:\/\/plot.ly\/python\/)):","73514736":"First, we prepare our dataset by setting its index:","5635a001":"- Official [Prophet repository](https:\/\/github.com\/facebookincubator\/prophet) on GitHub.\n- Official [Prophet documentation](https:\/\/facebookincubator.github.io\/prophet\/docs\/quick_start.html).\n- Sean J.

Hyndman, George Athanasopoulos [\"Forecasting: principles and practice\"](https:\/\/www.otexts.org\/fpp) \u2013 a very good online book about time series forecasting.","d86803f4":"This downsampled chart proves to be somewhat better for an analyst's perception.\n\nOne of the most useful functions that `Plotly` provides is the ability to quickly dive into different periods of timeline in order to better understand the data and find visual clues about possbile trends, periodic and irregular effects. \n\nFor example, zooming-in on a couple of consecutive years shows us time points corresponding to Christmas holidays, which greatly influence human behaviors.\n\nNow, we're going to omit the first few years of observations, up to 2015. First, they won't contribute much into the forecast quality in 2017. Second, these first years, having very low number of posts per day, are likely to increase noise in our predictions, as the model would be forced to fit this abnormal historical data along with more relevant and indicative data from the recent years.","6f27906d":"Let's look closer at how the forcasting quality was measured in the article. To do this, we will need the formula of Mean Absolute Percentage Error.\n\nLet $y_{i}$ be the *actual (historical) value* and $\\hat{y}_{i}$ be the *forecast value* given by our model.\n\nThen $e_{i} = y_{i} - \\hat{y}_{i}$ is the *forecast error* and $p_{i} =\\frac{\\displaystyle e_{i}}{\\displaystyle y_{i}}$ is the *relative forecast error*.\n\nWe define\n\n$$MAPE = mean\\big(\\left |p_{i} \\right |\\big)$$\n\nMAPE is widely used as a measure of prediction accuracy because it expresses error as a percentage and thus can be used in model evaluations on different datasets.\n\nIn addition, when evaluating a forecasting algorithm, it may prove useful to calculate [MAE (Mean Absolute Error)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mean_absolute_error) in order to have a picture of errors in absolute numbers. Using previously defined components, its equation will be\n\n$$MAE = mean\\big(\\left |e_{i}\\right |\\big)$$","6ce3e761":"We are also going to define a helper function that we will use to gauge the quality of our forecasting with MAPE and MAE error measures:","a7c4899e":"We can see that this dataframe contains all the information we need except for the historical values. We need to join the `forecast` object with the actual values `y` from the original dataset `df`. For this we will define a helper function that we will reuse later:","efebc664":"At this point, we need to revert the Box\u2013Cox transformation with our inverse function and the known value of $\\lambda$:","c947393e":"As a result, the relative error of our forecast (MAPE) is about 22.72%, and on average our model is wrong by 70.45 posts (MAE).","7d466571":"To sum up, from visual analysis we can see that our dataset is non-stationary with a prominent growing trend. It also demonstrates weekly and yearly seasonality and a number of abnormal days in each year.","3e5887a4":"A few words about the algorithms that Prophet was compared with. Most of them are quite simple and often are used as a baseline for other models:\n* `naive` is a simplistic forecasting approach where we predict all future values relying solely on the observation at the last available point of time.\n* `snaive` (seasonal naive) is a model that makes constant predictions taking into account information about seasonality. For instance, in the case of weekly seasonal data for each future Monday, we would predict the value from the last Monday, and for all future Tuesdays we would use the value from the last Tuesday and so on.\n* `mean` uses the averaged value of data as a forecast.\n* `arima` stands for *Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average*, see [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) for details.\n* `ets` stands for *Exponential Smoothing*, see [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exponential_smoothing) for more.","06e65390":"### Holidays and Events\n\nThe component $h(t)$ represents predictable abnormal days of the year including those on irregular schedules, e.g., Black Fridays.\n\nTo utilize this feature, the analyst needs to provide a custom list of events.","a3e6f5b2":"Let's convert our dataframe to the format required by Prophet:","9ed45a5d":"## 4. Box-Cox Transformation","33fc4ea2":"### Error\n\nThe error term $\\epsilon(t)$ represents information that was not reflected in the model. Usually it is modeled as normally distributed noise.","538028fe":"Let's try and plot our dataset *as is*:","102d057d":"High-frequency data can be rather difficult to analyze. Even with the ability to zoom in provided by `Plotly`, it is hard to infer anything meaningful from this chart apart from the prominent upward and accelerating trend.\n\nTo reduce the noise, we will resample the post counts down to weekly bins. Besides *binning*, other possible techniques of noise reduction include [Moving-Average Smoothing](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moving_average) and [Exponential Smoothing](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exponential_smoothing), among others.\n\nWe save our downsampled dataframe in a separate variable because further in this practice we will work only with daily series:","a452077b":"### 3.5 Forecast quality evaluation","24999b72":"The authors of the library generally advise to make predictions based on at least several months, ideally, more than a year of historical data. Luckily, in our case we have more than a couple of years of data to fit the model.\n\nTo measure the quality of our forecast, we need to split our dataset into the *historical part*, which is the first and biggest slice of our data, and the *prediction part*, which will be located at the end of the timeline. We will remove the last month from the dataset in order to use it later as a prediction target:","039fe375":"At first glance, the prediction of the mean values by our model seems to be sensible. The high value of MAPE that we got above may be explained by the fact that the model failed to catch on to increasing peak-to-peak amplitude of weakly seasonality.\n\nAlso, we can conclude from the graph above that many of the actual values lie outside the confidence interval. Prophet may not be suitable for time series with unstable variance, at least when the default settings are used. We will try to fix this by applying a transform to our data.","3b366125":"### 3.3 Exploratory visual analysis\n\nAs always, it may be helpful and instructive to look at a graphical representation of your data.\n\nWe will create a time series plot for the whole time range. Displaying data over such a long period of time can give clues about seasonality and conspicuous abnormal deviations.\n\nFirst, we import and initialize the `Plotly` library, which allows creating beautiful interactive plots:","1634ddac":"### Seasonality\n\nThe seasonal component $s(t)$ provides a flexible model of periodic changes due to weekly and yearly seasonality.\n\nWeekly seasonal data is modeled with dummy variables. Six new variables are added: `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`, which take values 0 or 1 depending on the day of the week. The feature `sunday` is not added because it would be a linear combination of the other days of the week, and this fact would have an adverse effect on the model.\n\nYearly seasonality model in Prophet relies on Fourier series.\n\nSince [version 0.2](https:\/\/github.com\/facebook\/prophet) you can also use *sub-daily time series* and make *sub-daily forecasts* as well as employ the new *daily seasonality* feature.","13a756eb":"## 5. Summary","0f1743e8":"So, we can definitely state an increase in the quality of the model.\n\nFinally, let's plot our previous performance with the latest results side-by-side.

The only definitive conclusion that we can draw here is that the model treated many of the data points as outliers.\n\nThe second function `Prophet.plot_components` might be much more useful in our case. It allows us to observe different components of the model separately: trend, yearly and weekly seasonality. In addition, if you supply information about holidays and events to your model, they will also be shown in this plot.\n\nLet's try it out:","3563f933":"Let's apply this function to our last forecast:","42cded40":"We create a new `Prophet` model and repeat the fit-predict cycle that we have already done above:","e093d7ca":"Then, we apply the function `stats.boxcox` from `Scipy`, which applies the Box\u2013Cox transformation.

It is represented in the form of the [logistic growth model](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Logistic_function):\n\n$$g(t) = \\frac{C}{1+e^{-k(t - m)}},$$\n\nwhere:\n* $C$ is the carrying capacity (that is the curve's maximum value).\n* $k$ is the growth rate (which represents \"the steepness\" of the curve).\n* $m$ is an offset parameter.\n\nThis logistic equation allows modelling non-linear growth with saturation, that is when the growth rate of a value decreases with its growth. One of the typical examples would be representing the growth of the audience of an application or a website.\n\nActually, $C$ and $k$ are not necessarily constants and may vary over time. Prophet supports both automatic and manual tuning of their variability. The library can itself choose optimal points of trend changes by fitting the supplied historical data. \n\nAlso, Prophet allows analysts to manually set changepoints of the growth rate and capacity values at different points in time. For instance, analysts may have insights about dates of past releases that prominently influenced some key product indicators.\n\nThe second trend model is a simple *Piecewise Linear Model* with a constant rate of growth. It is best suited for problems without saturating growth.","77632da8":"In the resulting dataframe you can see many columns characterizing the prediction, including trend and seasonality components as well as their confidence intervals. The forecast itself is stored in the `yhat` column.\n\nThe Prophet library has its own built-in tools for visualization that enable us to quickly evaluate the result.\n\nFirst, there is a method called `Prophet.plot` that plots all the points from the forecast:","56bbe9d3":"As you can see from the trend graph, Prophet did a good job by fitting the accelerated growth of new posts at the end of 2016. The graph of weekly seasonality leads to the conclusion that usually there are less new posts on Saturdays and Sundays than on the other days of the week. In the yearly seasonality graph there is a prominent dip on Christmas Day.","78f7e216":"## 1. Introduction\n\nAccording to the [article](https:\/\/research.fb.com\/prophet-forecasting-at-scale\/) on Facebook Research, Prophet was initially developed for the purpose of creating high quality business forecasts. This library tries to address the following difficulties common to many business time series:\n- Seasonal effects caused by human behavior: weekly, monthly and yearly cycles, dips and peaks on public holidays.\n- Changes in trend due to new products and market events.\n- Outliers.\n\nThe authors claim that, even with the default settings, in many cases, their library produces forecasts as accurate as those delivered by experienced analysts.\n\nMoreover, Prophet has a number of intuitive and easily interpretable customizations that allow gradually improving the quality of the forecasting model. What is especially important, these paramaters are quite comprehensible even for non-experts in time series analysis, which is a field of data science requiring certain skill and experience.\n\nBy the way, the original article is called \"Forecasting at Scale\", but it is not about the scale in the \"usual\" sense, that is addressing computational and infrastructure problems of a large number of working programs. According to the authors, Prophet should scale well in the following 3 areas:\n- Accessibility to a wide audience of analysts, possibly without profound expertise in time series.\n- Applicability to a wide range of distinct forecasting problems.\n- Automated performance estimation of a large number of forecasts including flagging of potential problems for their subsequent inspection by the analyst.","3880ddff":"In this practice, we are interested in the number of posts **a day**. But at this moment all our data is divided into irregular time intervals that are less than a day. This is called a *sub-daily time series*. To see it, let's print out the first 3 rows:","cd349012":"# <center>Topic 9. Time series analysis in Python<\/center>\n## <center>Part 2.

Taylor and Benjamin Letham.\n\nThe authors also compared their library with several other methods for time series forecasting. They used [Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mean_absolute_percentage_error) as a measure of prediction accuracy. In this research, Prophet has shown substantially lower forecasting error than the other models.","90577646":"Finally, we plot the result:","7639814c":"Next, we need to convert `published` to the datetime format because by default `pandas` treats this field as string-valued.","07e3e4b4":"So far we have used Prophet with the default settings and the original data. We will leave the parameters of the model alone. But despite this we still have some room for improvement. In this section, we will apply the [Box\u2013Cox transformation](http:\/\/onlinestatbook.com\/2\/transformations\/box-cox.html) to our original series. Let's see where it will lead us.\n\nA few words about this transformation. This is a monotonic data transformation that can be used to stabilize variance. We will use the one-parameter Box\u2013Cox transformation, which is defined by the following expression:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n  boxcox^{(\\lambda)}(y_{i}) = \\begin{cases}\n    \\frac{\\displaystyle y_{i}^{\\lambda} - 1}{\\displaystyle \\lambda} &, \\text{if $\\lambda \\neq 0$}.\\\\\n    ln(y_{i}) &, \\text{if $\\lambda = 0$}.\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nWe will need to implement the inverse of this function in order to be able to restore the original data scale. It is easy to see that the inverse is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n  invboxcox^{(\\lambda)}(y_{i}) = \\begin{cases}\n    e^{\\left (\\frac{\\displaystyle ln(\\lambda y_{i} + 1)}{\\displaystyle \\lambda} \\right )} &, \\text{if $\\lambda \\neq 0$}.\\\\\n    e^{y_{i}} &, \\text{if $\\lambda = 0$}.\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding function in Python is implemented as follows:","c8049eb6":"Let's use our function:","c55bf5cb":"We also define a helper function, which will plot our dataframes throughout the article:","8a7e8cd4":"Let's evaluate the quality of the algorithm by calculating the error metrics for the last 30 days that we predicted.

We have also done some hands-on practice in time series prediction.\n\nAs we have seen, the Prophet library does not make wonders, and its predictions out-of-box are not [ideal](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization). It is still up to the data scientist to explore the forecast results, tune model parameters and transform data when necessary.\n\nHowever, this library is user-friendly and easily customizable. The sole ability to take into account abnormal days that are known to the analyst beforehand might make a difference in some cases.\n\nAll in all, the Prophet library is worth being a part of your analytical toolbox."}}
