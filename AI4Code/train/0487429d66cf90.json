Given a function defined by a set of parameters, gradient descent starts with an initial set of parameter values and iteratively moves toward a set of parameter values that minimize the function. This iterative minimization is achieved by taking steps in the negative direction of the function gradient.\n\nHere is gradient descent implemented in [PyTorch](https:\/\/pytorch.org).","d8de187f":"Suppose we believe a = (-1.0,1.0) then we can compute y_hat which is our prediction and then compute our error."}}
