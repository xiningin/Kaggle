Key Note\n\nAs a beginner in data science, I had tough time understanding the plots. Most of us do not have strong foundation in stats and for those who do, we sometimes tend to forget the interpretation of various plots. Plots are major part of EDA mainly because plots help us:\n* Better visualize data\n* Gives us a bird-eye of whole data\n* Gives us general idea of summary statistics\n* Help us plot and anlayse various features (Both univariate and multivariate)\n\nThis is the initial commit of the notebook and I will add more plots, tips and their interpretations as I come across new techniques of visualizing them.","c520ef60":"This is notebook is part of snippet series that I am documenting to for my own references on daily basis. I am keeping them public,so that other beginners can refer to them as well. I hope you find it useful.\n\nUpdate: Added Box plots","6a151a5c":"# 2. Interpretting Plots \n\nWe will go through some most commonly used plots and as we move down, I will add more advanced and less used graphs.\n\nSince almost everyone has explored titanic survival dataset, I prefer to use the same as it is much easier to understand and almost every new bie is fimiliar with it.","c53d1e3b":"## 2.2. Scatter Plots\n\nScatterplots are useful for interpreting trends in statistical data. \n\nKey points to keep in mind:\n\n* Each observation (or point) in a scatterplot has two coordinates; the first corresponds to the first piece of data in the pair (that\u2019s the X coordinate; the amount that you go left or right). The second coordinate corresponds to the second piece of data in the pair (that\u2019s the Y-coordinate; the amount that you go up or down). The point representing that observation is placed at the intersection of the two coordinates.\n* If the data show an uphill pattern as you move from left to right, this indicates a positive relationship between X and Y. As the X-values increase (move right), the Y-values tend to increase (move up).\n* If the data show a downhill pattern as you move from left to right, this indicates a negative relationship between X and Y. As the X-values increase (move right) the Y-values tend to decrease (move down).\n* If the data don\u2019t seem to resemble any kind of pattern (even a vague one), then no relationship exists between X and Y.\n* Note: Scatterplots show possible associations or relationships between two variables. However, just because your graph or chart shows something is going on, it doesn\u2019t mean that a cause-and-effect relationship exists. So a liner relationship dooesnot mean increase in one variable cause increase in other\n","9d5a2ece":"Thee the median lines and IQR are almost the same, but outliers are present.","eda09343":"Note: Different articles online were referrenced for this notebook","06d725b6":"From the above graph we can interpret that people in Pclass=1 have more age in both cases of survival","b522c0b9":"A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number summary (\u201cminimum\u201d, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and \u201cmaximum\u201d). \n\nIt can tell you about: \n* Outliers in the data and what their values are. \n* If your data is symmetrical, \n* How tightly your data is grouped, and if and how your data is skewed.\n\nLets undestand it with diagram:\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nDescription of terms mentioned:\n\n* Median (Q2\/50th Percentile): the middle value of the dataset.\n* First quartile (Q1\/25th Percentile): the middle number between the smallest number (not the \u201cminimum\u201d) and the median of the dataset.\n* Third quartile (Q3\/75th Percentile): the middle value between the median and the highest value (not the \u201cmaximum\u201d) of the dataset.\n* Interquartile range (IQR): 25th to the 75th percentile.\n* Whiskers (shown in blue)\n* Outliers (shown as green circles)\n* \u201cmaximum\u201d: Q3 + 1.5*IQR\n* \u201cminimum\u201d: Q1 -1.5*IQR\n\nKey Points to look for:\n* Median Line:\n    * When the median is in the middle of the box, and the whiskers are about the same on both sides of the box, then the distribution is symmetric.\n    * When the median is closer to the bottom of the box, and if the whisker is shorter on the lower end of the box, then the distribution is positively skewed (skewed right).\n    * When the median is closer to the top of the box, and if the whisker is shorter on the upper end of the box, then the distribution is negatively skewed (skewed left)\n* Outliers that are represented as dots seperately\n\nComparing two box plots:\n* Compare the respective medians of each box plot. If the median line of a box plot lies outside of the box of a comparison box plot, then there is likely to be a difference between the two groups.\n* Compare the interquartile ranges (that is, the box lengths), to examine how the data is dispersed between each sample. The longer the box the more dispersed the data. The smaller the less dispersed the data.","59550efc":"This bar plot (count plot) has actual count of deaths and survival associated with it","995e1f54":"## (to add more)","a4904131":"Here we do not have a clear relationship between Age and Fare. This can be further investigated by calculating coefficient matrix and Person's correlation coefficient (which comes out ot be 0.11 i.e very little positive relationship)","0623e6c5":"## 2.1. Bar Plots\n\nThis is the most common plot you will come across while analyzing and comparing fetaures.\n\nSome basic things to keep in mind while interpretting bar graphs are:\n\n* Check for the difference in height\n* Compare groups within groups (when you use divide one bar into subcategories\n* Sometimes Y-axis will indicate actual count (sns.countplot()) and while other times the categorical variable can be mapped as a probability\n* In histograms (similar to bar graphs) Y-axis is fixed as the frequency of occurance.\n* The small vertical lines on each bar are error bars. Error bars are graphical representations of the variability of data and used on graphs to indicate the error or uncertainty in a reported measurement. They give a general idea of how precise a measurement is, or conversely, how far from the reported value the true (error free) value might be.","8f488cbd":"## 2.3. Box Plots"}}
