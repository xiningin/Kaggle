We removed unnecessary data from the dataset. Lot of apartments are available in manhattan compared to any other place and bronx has less apartments and more single rooms. Apartments cost way more than single rooms. Manhattan and brooklyn has costlier rooms and apartments. The availability of rooms is very less in manhattan and brooklyn and you can find room any day in bronx. There are lot of housing options in manhattan.","136ef655":"# Data visualization for Classification \nIn this kernel we are focusing on data preprocessing and data visualisation of New York City Airbnb Open Data\nAirbnb listings and metrics in NYC, NY, USA (2019)for Classification.\n\n### Data\n\nSince 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019. This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions.<br>\n\nThis data contains 16 columns, 47905 unique values(samples).  Imported all necessary files and libraries, We removed unnecessary data from the datset like last review, reviews per month and host name as they donot support the data required.
