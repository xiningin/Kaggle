We can see the that activity of brain when mediatating it pulsates in a slow manner while increasing in some point and stays constant with a low increasing rate on other cases.\n2. On the other hand the activity of brain while thinking constantly grows with trom and some time the activity reaches maximum and then gets down for a gerater ttime, it pulstaes too but in a greater manner than while meditating.","c6229f76":"This chart has been produced in MS paint for understanding the curves deeper.","f41ab803":"The sheer peaks of the meditation activity curve shows diflection of thought humans have \n\nThe blunt peaks of the thinking activity curve shows that thinking is an elongated work of brain. \nThat also indicates latency of work of brain after heavy thinking.","02bc5490":"Similarly we can see that pulsating peaks are allover resembles each other that means it pulsates in a very stable manner.\nIt can be a **individual** feature or **special character**.","6762ec12":"# Further analysis:","bd8ae1e5":"You can visit my other works at [kaggle notebooks](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sagnik1511\/notebooks)  or in [github repositories](https:\/\/github.com\/sagnik1511?tab=repositories)  .

The whole data graph shows that the **baseline activity** is reached after a quick time lapse.\n2. Then the curve stays same for a great time and pulsates in it's constant wavelength .\n3. Near 95000th observation there is another secondary rise which can show the highest level of mental stability achieved after meditating for some time.\n4. These rise takes a while to reach it's maximal activity zone.","313b3001":"This scatterplot shows that activity of brain increaes when it is time for thinking. The maxima of the head of the data is much more lower than the maxima of the tail of the data.","3bbafc3b":"As we have huge amount of data we can make further check.\n\nWe can merge different parts of data and find out if there is an anomaly.","264d5852":"# UPVOTE if yoy lik this kernel.  :)","5b38af98":"But in full visualization we can see that the pulsation actually increases and the sheer maximas are produced. Still the mid baseline activity is primarily achieved which shows that thinking broadens the activities from a working brain condition whereas meditation takes it to another level.","51244090":"We can see that when starting to meditating the activity of brain reaches an optimum value and then start pulsating in a regular manner.\n*The increaing curve* in **blue** is visible clearly.","810c93ec":"In this dataset we are having the data from the FP-2 to F4.
