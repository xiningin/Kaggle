ranking of Chile: Confirmed:13 \/ Deaths:20 \/ Recovered:10 \/ pop_rate_confirmed:6 \/ pop_rate_deaths:18\n\nSituation : The nuber of confirmed people is dramatically increase\n\nThe largest daily cases : 6,754 (06\/12\/20)\n\n# **The goverment measures**\nChile had opted selective quarantine strategy which is concentrated in the high infection areas for preventing COVID-19 pandemic. \nThey are testing daily 14,000 cases and already done 200,000, it is highest rate along the countries in Latin America.\n\nThe government tried to control the infection by lockdown of metropolitan area, it worked effectively and the confirmed number was not rapidly increased until April.\nOne month later, the government recognized the negative impacts on their economy and education and once lifted lockdown in May. After that, the number of confirmed cases dramatically increased and the government implement lockdown on metropolitan area again from May 15th. But they couldn\u2019t stop the overshooting.\n\nChile has another reason for their difficulty to prevent the infection caused by environmental problem. They faced serious drought this year and the rainfall is one quarter of the average season. The people cannot be supplied enough water to wash their hands.\n\nChile's death rate is 1.7%, this value is one-third of Brazil. They are still trying to control the infection by confirming cases by high test rate for preventing medical collapse. Once medical collapse has occurred, the death rate is booming rapidly.\n\n\nI think lockdown is effective measure for controlling infection of COVID, but it should be done in the early stage. Chile succeeded to control the situation by lockdown in early stage, but the government couldn\u2019t continue the measure until completely ceasing the infection. As the result of lifted lockdown, the government is now facing difficulties to control the situation. Once overshoot has happened, any measure such as lockdown is not prevent thr outbreak. Recent increasing rate of infection in Chile is similar to Brazil which is most critical country in South America. Brazil government prioritized their economy and did not take any preventing measures.\n","30fe7885":"# How about we make an interactive chart?\n","d0301045":"Note : This 'df' is actually a cumulative information.\n","86d1c25b":"# Analyzing Brazil's situation","d934c000":"# This is exercise 6\nI chose Chile in this homework.\n","92c195d4":"# Reference\nPopulation data\/\/United Nations,World Population Prospects 2019,https:\/\/population.un.org\/wpp\/Download\/Standard\/Population\/\n\nThe straitstimes: 'Total' lockdown for Chile capital after coronavirus spike,https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/world\/americas\/total-lockdown-for-chile-capital-after-coronavirus-spike\n\nREUTERS: Chile\u00b4s Pinera declares 90-day state of catastrophe over coronavirus outbreak,https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-health-coronavirus-chile-idUSKBN2152D9\n\nAFP:\u300c\u30d4\u30fc\u30af\u8d8a\u3048\u300d\u4e00\u8ee2\u3001\u30c1\u30ea\u3067\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u611f\u67d3\u6025\u62e1\u5927 \u9996\u90fd\u570f\u3092\u5b8c\u5168\u5c01\u9396,https:\/\/www.afpbb.com\/articles\/-\/3283240\n\nyahoo news:\u624b\u304c\u6d17\u3048\u306a\u3044...\u5927\u5e72\u3070\u3064\u306e\u5357\u7c73\u30c1\u30ea\u306b\u300c\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u300d\u306e\u8105\u5a01,https:\/\/news.yahoo.co.jp\/byline\/morisayaka\/20200409-00172195\/\n"}}
