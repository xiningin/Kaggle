We can also see that it is true for both men and women that older age groups have a higher incidence of suicide. \n\n## Is there a relationship between suicide rates and income?\n\nFor a given year, we can create a scatter plot with income on the X axis, suicide rate per capita on the Y axis and plot each country as  a single point, to see if there is a pattern. We could also change the size of each point to represent in nominal terms now many suicides happen in that country."}}
