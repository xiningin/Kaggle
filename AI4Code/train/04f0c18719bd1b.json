The experience gained by Research gives us a key advantage in our admission process along with the research itself.","848453cb":"The Graph Clearly Visualizes that Research helps in achieving a Upper Hand when applying to a Good University. Chances for admissions increase if we have done research , if we meet required criterias. The graph also shows the mindset of Universities to accept Students with research experience predominantly as the University Rating Increase","1e50b848":"## A 3D Visualization Of Admissions.\nThe Below Graph plots University Rating , CGPA and Chances of Admit to show a clearer picture of Admissions. We also include Colour as a Fourth Dimension which represents whether the student has research experience or not.","7bd776b2":"## The First 5 Rows Of The Dataset is shown Below","456838df":"## Letter Of Recommendation\n\nLetter of Recommandation is a letter provided by our superiors which lists our advantages and disadvantages and why they think the university to give an admission to the student. Some persons who are eligible to provide LORs include your Professors , Managers ,etc.\n\n*In The Below Graph We visualize the Impact Research Has in getting a Good LOR by plotting the percentage of students who have Research Experience Verses The Rating of thier Letter Of Recommendation.*","d42996d3":"It Can Be Noticed that Research has a slight relationship with all the the attributes. The most correlated pairs are CGPA and Chances Of Admit , GRE and TOEFL . This Correlation could mislead one to believe Research is not as important as CGPA as research is represented by a binary value in this dataset, we would make a fair case to vouch for Research.","40962e35":"Ihe Infuence of Research is clearly visible with the increasing quality of Statement of Purpose. A Theory to support this would the time we spend writing our research papers directly helps us in writing good SOPs. Another hypothesis is that the interest of the Student to continue research after admission may serve as a factor for the improvement in quality of SOP.","c32c413e":"It Could Be Noted that as the Rating of the LOR Increases the percentage of Students involved in research work increases. We could Infer two different hypothesis from this graph.\n1. Students Who Do not Do Research Recieve a Poorer LOR Than a Student who has Research Experience\n2. Poor Students who Generally are Not Recommended by Superiors generally do not do research.","510d314c":"Count of students performing research is greatest at 8 CGPA which might suggest that the student's CGPA might have been affected due to dillution of concentration into both research and academics. Thus Research might have a negative impact on your CGPA but does it damage your chances to study in a world class university?","2d8d317e":"## Statement Of Purpose\n\nStatement Of Purpose is the purpose of the student to apply for addmission for a specific course at a particular university. It is generally an essay which states why the student is willing to join in that programme what are his future plans once he joins the programme , why this university over another , etc. Statement of purpose is one of the key factors which decides your admission, write a top notch SOP is a skill :)\nThe Below Graph shows the percentage of Students with Research Experience verses the quality of thier SOP.","b651b42e":"## CGPA\nCGPA is the 10 point alternative to the 4 point GPA system followed in the United States. It is the measure of how well you had performed in your academics during your Undergraduate Studies. The Pie Chart Below Visualizes the count of students who have done research corresponding to thier CGPA . Here CGPA is divided into 10 bins seperated by 1.0 . The real values of CGPA starts from 6.0 in the dataset.","fbb2fabe":"# **Impact Of Research In Graduate Admissions**\n\nGetting admission in The World's Top Universities is a dream many students have. United States in one of the hot locations for further studies owing to its universities ranking among the best in the world. Getting an admission in a top college is neither easy nor has a defined path. Every Individual who is admitted would have a unique and distinct profile. Although it is proven that various factors such as GRE, English Tests, CGPA ,LOR , SOP combinedly help in one achieving a good admission, a factor which influences admissions both directly and indirectly is often overlooked... Research is one factor which really influences your admissions and we would prove it using data from the [Graduation Admissions Dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mohansacharya\/graduate-admissions) available on Kaggle.","d7b08761":"The Graduation Admissions Dataset has 8 columns:\n* GRE Score - The GRE Score Obtained By the Student\n* TOEFL Score - The TOEFL Score Obtained By the Student\n* University Rating - The Rating (out of 5) of the University the student applied to\n* SOP - Statement of Purpose Of the Student Rated out of 5\n* LOR - Letter Of Recommandations Submitted By the Student Rated Out Of 5\n* CGPA - The CGPA of Student during his Undergraduate Programme\n* Research - A Binary Value which specifies if the Student has Research Experience.\n* Chance of Admit - The probability of the Student being admitted into the University.","9a62a86a":"## Correlation Of Attributes\n\nCorrelation is one metric used to find how two attributes are related to each other. Co Relation values ranges from -1 to +1. Value closer to -1 implies that both attributes are negatively correlated - both attributes grows in opposite directions. A value close to +1 implies that the the attributes are positvely correlated - both grows in the smae direction. A value closer to 0 implies both attributes are unrelated to each other. Below is a HeatMap Representation of the Correlation Matrix."}}
