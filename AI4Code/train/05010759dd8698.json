collaboration. University campuses in the worst hit countries have shut down, with many others expected to follow. Some of those affected, including the University of Bologna, Italy, have responded by digitising their teaching programmes, moving classes and exams online to alleviate the educational impact.

They are already vulnerable to infection because of their underlying illness and often immunosuppressed status, and are at increased risk of developing severe complications from the virus, including intensive care unit admission or even death. Moreover, for those who develop COVID-19, treatment of the disease will be prioritised, and further cancer therapy could be delayed, although such decisions must be made on a patient-by-patient basis and not based only on the early small reports published in the first few weeks of the pandemic. https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1470204520301753","76cfae2e":" The cancer patient actually has an advantage over others: he is more educated from the point of view of hygiene measures.
