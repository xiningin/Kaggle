The highest number of participants is from India, followed by US participants.\n\nI was really hoping to find a higher number of engineering disciplines represented in the data. With the emergence of big data and equipment automation, there has been debate about the prevalance of classical engineering jobs (especially in manufacturing) in the future. There is a lot of emphasis on incoming engineers - no matter which discipline - to start developing programming skills. \n\nSince this survey question was multiple choice, it only allowed participants to choose from pre-defined engineering disciplines and the rest probably just got lumped into the 'other' category! Sad, because it would have been nice to see the skillset of folks switching over from non-programming heavy disciplines like process, manufacturing, industrial or mechanical engineering. \n\nStill, I feel that there is value in visualizing the responses from this subset, as it may help narrow down the most in demand skills.","c814284a":"Most common machine learning libraries used in the industry include scikit learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch and Keras","68d98dd6":"# Big Data and Business Intelligence tools","866f8cfa":"Figures 4 & 5 show that the most popular visualization\/plotting libraries are matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and ggplot.

In this notebook, I will zoom in on the responses from people around the globe who are working engineering jobs. My goal is to have the insights available from this notebook as a resource for any engineer making a career switch towards data science or alternativley, towards a more data centric engineering role.\n\nEngineering is a broad discipline. And being an engineer can mean anything from fixing the hardware on a factory tool to creating the most sophisticated algorithm for predicting the long term effects of global warming. Putting the differences aside though, engineering in a nutshell is all about being curious, asking questions and working to find answers to those questions. And this is where Data Science and Engineering intersect. \n\nI invite you to take a deep dive into the key skills that may be useful for landing or acing a data centric engineering role in the industry or even better - put you on a path for making your work 'indistiguishable from magic.'\n","0c65508d":"Most common machine learning algorithms used in the industry include linear or logistic regressions, decision tress and neural networks.","5afb0d2d":"# Popular Programming Languages and Libraries","8ab32ea5":"That is all for now. The key takeaways from this analysis, atleast for now are:\n* Master python - if you want to only master one programming language, this is 'the language'. \n* Relational database structures are widely utilized in industry, and mastery in SQL will definitely aid in navigating these structures.\n* The comaprison among various company sizes and production applications of machine learning shows that although bigger companies have mature ML models that have been in production for many years now, statrups and smaller companies have recently started catching up and more and more models have been put into production in last 2 years.\n* Although machine learning models are being used in production in the industry, the automated ML products still remain under utilized. This may be due to a lack of trust, ethical issues, product quality or a combination of these factors.\n* MySQL and pgSQL are the most commonly used big data products by engineers\n* For business intelligence tools, MS Power BI and Tableau are strong contenders for skills that one may want to add to their portfolio.
