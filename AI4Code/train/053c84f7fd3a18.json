region of Western Europe occupies 70% of of the top 10 list of countries with the hightest literacy rates, with 6 of these countries having a 100% literacy rate. \n\nConsider: what allows for such wonderful literacy rates in this region?","2dd0d03a":"**LITERACY IN CIRCLES**","2d1cf4b8":"There are 18 countries in the dataset with missing values for our independent attribute of interest: literacy.\nThese countries will be excluded from our visualizations. \n\n*Note: The country of Western Sahara is missing all the data of interest for our exploration.*  ","cd3f56ae":"For this exploration of literacy, we will be exploring the influence literacy has on infant mortality rates, the birthrate, the deathrate, the number of phones per 1000 people, and the GDP per capita amongst different countries in various regions of the globe.  ","62f6e836":"**Countries with the Lowest Literacy Rates**\n\nIn terms of literacy, the bottom 10 ranking countries represents 4.41% of all 227 countries listed in the dataset. However of the 10 lowest literacy rankings, countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region account for 80% of this list. \n\nConsider: what obstacles exist in nations of this region where literacy struggles to thrive to create upward postive social changes?   \n\nIn this dataset, the countries with the lowest rates of literacy (lower than 40%) are Niger, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Afghanistan and Somalia. All these countries reside in the Sub-Sahara Africa region with the exception of Afghanistan. ","6e32ab6b":"**Infant Mortality Rate over Literacy**\n\nPlotting the IMR (per 1000 births) over literacy, there is an apparent negative correlation relationship. \nCountries with higher IMR also seem to have lower literacy rates and conversely, countries with higher literacy rates experience lower rates of infant mortality. \nThe influence of literacy on a country's IMR is greatly impactful when we consider the population sizes of these nations and what influence improving literacy lends to the well-being of that country's future. For example, consider India, with the world's second largest population and approximately 60% literacy rate with an IMR of 56.29, in comparison to China with the world's largest population and literacy rate of 90.9 and IMR of 24.18.\n\nAlso to give thought to are countries with high IMRs and low literacy rates. What obstacles (conflict, famine, healthcare etc.) are present in the populations of these regions that are adversly affecting literacy and as a result perhaps influencing IMRs?

Perhaps literacy in combination with a host of other factors (healthcare accessibility, sanitation and community resources etc.) can lower deathrates in a population.

It seems that as a country increases their literacy rate, the birthrate experiences a reduction. What does this mean? One suggestion is perhaps populations are able to be more literate being freed of parental responsibilities. Consider China with the largest population, literacy rate of 90.9% and birthrate of 13.25, which had been given a policy restricting birthrate. Did this policy lend to the improving the literacy rate in later years? In comparison, the United States which did not experience such implementations has a strong literacy rate of 97% with a low birthrate of 14.14.\nLiteracy increases critical thinking and perhaps this results in delaying the creation of families due to work commitments. \n\nThe top 5 countries in the dataset with the lowest birthrate all have literacy rates over 93.5% (Hong Kong rate). Interesting to think about is how the impact of affairs between Hong Kong and China may translate to the country's literacy rates in the years ahead, with or without birthrate experiencing change.

","efb8ca50":"**Countries with the highest Deathrates**\n\n*Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho, Angola and Libera. ","bb977240":"**GDP over Literacy**\n\nLastly, plotting GDP per capita over Literacy illustrates a positive correlation relationship. Countries with higher rates of literacy benefit with a higher GDP per capita numbers. \nA clear illustration of this is Luxembourg, which has the highest literacy rate achievable of 100%, while also capturing the highest GDP per capita in the dataset. \n\nIn fact, the top 5 highest GDP per capita countries, all have literacy rates of 97% or more.","4e385452":"**Countries with least phones (per 1000 people)**\n\n*Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Niger, Central African Republic and Liberia (also listed in top 5 IMR countries). *","5c52ecd2":"**Phones over Literacy**\n\nPlotting phones (per 1000 people) over literacy, a positive relationship is evident as countries with higher rates of literacy also have more phones. \nThe region of Sub-Saharan Africa is most impacted with lowest literacy rates and least phones in the population. Niger which has the lowest literacy rate in the dataset of 17.6, also has 1.9 phones per 1000 people, or the third lowest of all countries in the dataset. Conversely, Monaco of Western Europe with a literacy rate of 99%, has 1035.6 phones per 1000 people, indicating that everyone owns a phone. \nDoes this suggest that countries with higher literacy rates cause more phone purchases in the population? No, we cannot infer such causation, however it is evident that a positive correlation coincides between these two attributes. We must consider a host of other factors such as GDP per capita, disposable income and telecommunications infrastructure also influencing the phone purchases of a country's population. \n\nNote: *metadata beyond phones per 1000 people is unavailable in the dataset, therefore we don't know if this is exclusively mobile phones or a combination of landlines and cellular.* \n\n","160cf436":"**Lowest IMR countries**\n\n*Singapore, Sweden, Hong Kong, Japan and Iceland.* "}}
