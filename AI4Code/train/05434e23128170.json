More population in a city means more Sale orders. This is general pattern like any other ecommerce domain.This patterns remain the same in Books case too.\n2. Almost 89% valued customers of Gufhtugu publisers used COD(Cash on delivery). This show that we are still in early phase of ecommerce.\n3. For every 100 orders that are placed almost 6.5 orders are returned. That is way too much when we analyze delivery cost to Book Price ratio. Return can be because of 2 reasons .\n    * Delivered a book that wasa not ordered (Ecommerce Staff Mistake)\n    * Immature Behaviour of customer.(Customer Fault)\n4. Best Selling books are of Technology Genre for this ecommerce site.\n5. Best months for marketing are 11th,12th and 1st month. These are the months when usually people set goals. Or we can say that weather plays an important role in the behaiour of customers , because in our case cities with most sales have average temperature more that 30C.\n6. Best days for promoting our books are Friday, saturday and Sunday.\n7. While 7Pm to 11pm is the best time when our expected customers are on internet. **DO MARKET AT THAT TIME.**","77234aaa":"![datawilltalk.jpg](attachment:datawilltalk.jpg)","495f0bd8":"   \n## How i am Listening this data:\n\nThis data is extracted from an Ecommerce (Books) website Database.
