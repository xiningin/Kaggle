What has been published concerning research and development and evaluation efforts of vaccines and therapeutics?\n\n**COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics (3\/18\/2020):**\n> Researchers are searching for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19. There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Further research should be directed toward the study of SARS-CoV-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis.\n\n**Research and Development on Therapeutic Agents and Vaccines for COVID-19 and Related Human Coronavirus Diseases (3\/12\/2020):**\n> The abundance of publications and the rapid publication rate associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus-related disease outbreak, as illustrated in this report, are indicative of the intense effort by research institutes and pharmaceutical industries to address both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic routes useful for treating current and future coronavirus outbreaks. Long-term drug development goals for the pharmaceutical industry include identification of inhibitors aimed at the replication or infection processes associated with SARS-CoV-2 or other related coronaviruses, as well as the symptomatic results of their infections leading to severe disease and\/or death. A concerted effort to develop effective drugs and vaccines against existing and potential future coronavirus infections and other highly pathogenic virus outbreaks is necessary to reduce overwhelming impacts on human life and worldwide healthcare systems.\n\n# Effectiveness of drugs being developed and tried to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\n**Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019-New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A Review and Perspective (3\/15\/2020):**\n> Providing complementary and alternative treatments are still urgently needed for the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, experiences in TCM is certainly worth learning. It is encouraging that the controlled clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV were conducted and reported. Hopefully, current clinical study to evaluate the effect of TCM on COVID-19 will use more strict protocols, concealment of allocation, and double-blinding, in order to ensure the compliance of international acceptable standards. Experiment study may be able to elucidate the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.\n\n**COVID-19 infection and rheumatoid arthritis: Faraway, so close! (3\/20\/2020):**\n> Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently included in the treatment protocol for the management of COVID-19 infections and might be useful to prevent or mitigate the course of infection in patients with RA taking them as csDMARDs. The use of IL-6 inhibitors as tocilizumab or sarilumab seems to be promising for the management of most critical cases of interstitial pneumonia complicated by CRS, but the identification of definite criteria to discriminate patients to be treated with these compounds is still under debate. Finally, although baricitinib has the potential to affect SARS-CoV2 penetration into pulmonary epithelial cells, major concerns remain about the inhibition of IFNs activity which could be detrimental in the course of viral infection.\n\n\n# Clinical and bench trials to investigate less common viral inhibitors against COVID-19 such as naproxen, clarithromycin, and minocyclinethat that may exert effects on viral replication.\n\n**Unrevealing sequence and structural features of novel coronavirus using in silico approaches: The main protease as molecular target. (3\/17\/2020):**\n> The starting therapeutic scheme could include remdesivir, with the disadvantage of its intravenous administration, and HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as Lopinavir or Saquinavir. Nevertheless, more pre-clinical and clinical data are required to support the development of new therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Other antivirals have been evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 as the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, a nucleotide analog (currently in clinical trials against Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2), alone or in combination with chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosome acidification, with interesting results (Wang et al., 2020; de Wit et al., 2020) . Therefore, proposing a combinatory therapy against SARS-CoV-2 could be a feasible approach.\n\n**Remdesivir, lopinavir, emetine, and homoharringtonine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro (4\/3\/2020):**\n> We confirm the antiviral activity of four compounds that have been reported to inhibit other coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. There is an urgent research need to identify optimal dose combination of effective compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 virus for better clinical benefit. Our results suggest that combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration against SARS-CoV-2 under the maximal therapeutic plasma concentration.\n\n# Methods evaluating potential complication of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients.\n\n**Safety and immunogenicity of a virus-like particle pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine in a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of adults in Mexico (10\/13\/2011):**\n> A large multicenter case-control study, based on medical practice-based active surveillance for medically attended culture-confirmed H1N1 pandemic influenza-like illness (ILI) in multiple European countries, in all ages using multi- Table 4 Immune response as measured by the microneutralization assay (MN). Adjuvanted vaccines achieved up to 100% vaccine efficacy in children [29] , but were accompanied by high rates of fever and local side effects. Extensive deployment of licensed vaccines during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic occurred and the immunogenicity results were also robust [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . In support of this objective, additional clinical trials are in development to evaluate influenza vaccine candidate antigens manufactured using Sf9\/baculovirus VLP technology.\n\n# Exploration of use of best animal models and their predictive value for a human vaccine.\n\n**Modeling pathogenesis of emergent and pre-emergent human coronaviruses in mice (7\/24\/2018):**\n> Regardless of how effective models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are for studying pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions, there are drawbacks related to mouse-adapted and transgenic mouse models that alter susceptibility and pathogenesis to hCoVs. The mouse tools instituted for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV constitute a versatile preclinical platform for addressing global pathogen preparedness, a directive of the World Health Organization. Screening in genetically diverse mouse populations may yield mouse models with a range of clinically relevant phenotypes that more closely reflect the plethora of respiratory disease outcomes observed in the human population.\n\n# Capabilities to discover a therapeutic (not vaccine) for the disease, and clinical effectiveness studies to discover therapeutics, to include antiviral agents.\n\n**Nucleoside analogues for the treatment of coronavirus infections (4\/30\/2019):**\n> Adequately controlled prospective studies like MIRACLE are urgently needed to assess efficacy of candidate CoV drugs. A multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial (MIR-ACLE: NCT02845843) is currently in progress to determine the efficacy of combining the immunomodulator IFNb1b with lopinavir-ritonavir, a protease inhibitor cocktail used to treat HIV that also inhibits MERS-CoV in vitro.\n\n**COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics (3\/18\/2020):**\n> Although research is in progress to improve prevention, treatment, and control of COVID-19, the documented clinical data on different therapeutic approaches for CoVs are scarce. There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Further research should be directed toward the study of SARS-CoV-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis.\n\n# Alternative models to aid decision makers in determining how to prioritize and distribute scarce, newly proven therapeutics as production ramps up. This could include identifying approaches for expanding production capacity to ensure equitable and timely distribution to populations in need.\n\n**The Role of Augmented Intelligence (AI) in Detecting and Preventing the Spread of Novel Coronavirus (2\/4\/2020):**\n> It is critical to the global health of all humankind for the scientific community to embrace AI and leverage its power in securing our collective future. AI may be applied to treatment records in order to more quickly home in on the most effective treatment regimens as different approaches are attempted and documented. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks.\n\n**Health Systems' \"Surge Capacity\"\u009d: State of the Art and Priorities for Future Research (3\/1\/2013):**\n> Work is, however, needed to generate robust conceptual and analytical frameworks, along with innovations in data collection and methodological approaches. Any general conceptual and\/or analytical model will need to incorporate geographical, temporal, and social contingencies in the outcomes, so that surge and surge capacity scenarios derive from, and inform, real-world events. Despite the disproportionately high occurrence of surge-generating events in low-and middle-income countries, and their considerably heightened vulnerability to such events, the research on surge capacity to date has focused largely on high-income countries, principally the United States.\n\n**Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand (3\/30\/2020):**\n> However, model results show that for these to be successful requires the ability to reduce transmission to a level where the effective reproduction number Rc is close to or below 1. Mitigation strategies, which aim to allow the epidemic to go ahead at a controlled rate, keep demand on healthcare systems under capacity, and deliver herd immunity, are a tempting approach for the control of Covid-19. Small uncertainties in case trajectories could lead to drastically overshooting hospital and ICU capacity.\n\n# Efforts targeted at a universal coronavirus vaccine.\n\n**Custom-made vaccines at speed(6\/15\/2003):**\n> A concept called reverse genetics has recently enabled researchers at the St Jude Children's Research Hospital (http:\/\/www.stjude.org) to construct an experimental vaccine against H5N1, a potential pandemic influenza strain, in less than a month. A similar approach could be used to develop vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\n# Efforts to develop animal models and standardize challenge studies\n\n**COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics (3\/18\/2020):**\n> Although research is in progress to improve prevention, treatment, and control of COVID-19, the documented clinical data on different therapeutic approaches for CoVs are scarce. Further research should be directed toward the study of SARS-CoV-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis. There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19.\n\n**SARS Coronavirus Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Treatment Design (7\/22\/2009):**\n> Thus, current models of SARS-CoV pathogenesis can be employed to study the many difficult problems associated with the development of effective therapies for emerging pathogens, and future studies may provide the solutions that will prepare us for future SARS-CoV emergence or the emergence of yet unknown viral pathogens. Due to the ever-increasing human population, increasing wild-life habitat destruction for human inhabitation, the demand for exotic animals for food, and the inability of humans to control or successfully track zoonotic diseases in wild animal populations, the emergence of novel viral pathogens from zoonotic pools will continue to threaten human global public health. As SARS-CoV vaccines must provide broad protection against the larger zoonotic pool, successful vaccine strategies may provide a template for developing broadly reactive vaccines against other emerging viruses, like filoviruses, Nipah virus, NL63, HKU1, and avian influenza viruses.\n\n# Efforts to develop prophylaxis clinical studies and prioritize in healthcare workers\n\n**COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics (3\/18\/2020):**\n> Although research is in progress to improve prevention, treatment, and control of COVID-19, the documented clinical data on different therapeutic approaches for CoVs are scarce. Further research should be directed toward the study of SARS-CoV-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis. There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19.\n\n**An evidence-based framework for priority clinical research questions for COVID-19 (3\/31\/2020):**\n> If health care facilities around the world collect standardised patient data and quickly share it, it is likely that these core clinical research questions can be answered in real-time to inform clinical practices for COVID-19. Based on a 2018 systematic review of SARS and MERS common clinical research questions, we provide a summary of the state of current clinical knowledge for the COVID-19, demonstrate what clinical research gaps still need to be filled, and provide recommendations on study designs. Thanks to lessons learned from SARS and MERS, the international public health and research community has been able to rapidly respond to the emergence of this novel coronavirus. Many of the identified gaps, such as viral pathogenesis, clinical characterisation, infection prevention, and candidate therapeutics overlap with gaps identified the WHO' s R&D Blueprint research roadmap.\n\n# Approaches to evaluate risk for enhanced disease after vaccination\n\n**COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics (3\/18\/2020):**\n> In the present article, we analyzed over 700 scientific publications on diagnostic approaches for dengue, West Nile, SARS, chikungunya, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika and Yellow Fever regarding their relevance for using alternative samples like saliva and urine for their versatility for virus diagnostic. The use of non-invasive samples offers a suitable alternative for improving the diagnostic performance and significantly reduces the risk for medical personal and patients for routine diagnostic and during an outbreak situation. The advantage of using non-invasive samples for the diagnostic has to be seriously analyzed and investigated before implementing in the routine diagnostics.\n\n\n# Assays to evaluate vaccine immune response and process development for vaccines, alongside suitable animal models [in conjunction with therapeutics]\n\n**COVID-19, an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics (3\/18\/2020):**\n> Researchers are searching for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19. Further research should be directed toward the study of SARS-CoV-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis. There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19.","48dca1a1":"# Filtering only COVID-19 related papers  - metadata abstracts & body paragraphs","47e197ba":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","23b6cb2c":"# Regex to filter out non-covid content:"}}
