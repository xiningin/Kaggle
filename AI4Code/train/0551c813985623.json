Data Preparation\nIn this section the libraries which are going to be used and  the dataset is imported","c56cf8da":"There are many different Integrated Development Environments but jupyter is the preferred one followed by visual studio code. Though other IDEs also have a considerable number of users.","6bc14a2b":"Now the next question arises whether theres a difference in annual compensation between people having a masters degree and people having a bachelors degree and if so by how much.","115c21e1":"Out of 21k people that took the survey 15k people use python on a daily basis. They account for around 75% of the total number of people that took the survey. SQL and R are the next most used languages on a daily basis after python with 7.5k and 4.2k people respectively.","4c30e6c0":"Linear and Logistic regression came out on top with more than 10k users followed by random forest. CNN and gradient boosting were also one of the top picks by the community followed after regression and random forest.","bd19b6c4":"Education level does not affect the use of of analysing tools as both bachelors and masters degree holders have similar numbers.","9c9f6f5f":"Here we will get an overview of the dataset like the number of people, their gender, education level or from which country they are.","783acc46":"People who took the survey often prefer to use local developtment environments like RStudio and JupyterLab. The number of people that use basic statistical software like excel and google sheets is also quite high.","32d08465":"So a majority of bachelors that is more than 40% are currently students and for masters it is more than 20%. People with a masters degree are employed as a data scientist whereas people with a bachelors degree are working as software engineers. We can see that people with a masters degree are generally preferred for the role of data scientist as there are double the number of data scientists that hold a masters degree over a bachelors degree. ","afb9c9ac":"Now the next question arises how much experience do they have in using machine learning methods.","f44ed1e9":"Here we can see alot of similarities in both the graphs. A huge number of people are working in smaller sized companies consisting of 0 to 49 employees. The number of people working for larger companies that is 10k plus people is also quite high.","662449d2":"## 1. Introduction\n","e1083f17":"Scikit-learn is the most commonly used machine learning framework followed by tensorflow and keras which are mainly used for deep learning just like pytorch.","2d067a70":"The highest number of people participating in this survey are from India at around 5.5k followed by the united states of America with 2.2k participants. The rest of the countries include Brazil, Japan, Russia, UK, Nigeria, China and Germany. A majority of the participants are either from Asia or America.","2632b07b":"A majority can be seen in people with experience between 1 or less than 1 to 5 years. They account for 50% of the people that took the survey. A lot of the younger generations are interested in data science and have just started out their career in the field.","23d0f2d7":"Almsot 50% of bachelors have less than 1 year experience with machine leaning methods whereas 33% of masters have less than 1 year of experience with machine learning methods. But the number of masters with experience between 1-3 years is higher than people with a bachelors degree. \nA similar trend is seen that people with masters degree have a higher experience as compared to bachelors.","fe3d5b6a":"## Overview","95130e29":"# Preferred Tools"}}
