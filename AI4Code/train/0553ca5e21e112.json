The idea is to fit 200 classifiers, each using only one of the features, and then combining the predictions using Bayes' rule as in Naive Bayes methods. I've previously experimented by using kernel density estimates to obtain the individual classifiers as in Chris Deotte's kernel [here](http:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/modified-naive-bayes-santander-0-899), but achieved better results when the individual classifiers where gradient boosted trees. Enjoy!","4bed888e":"Finally, here is the prediction plot for var_108. The spike in the middle is nicely recognized.","cd5d69cb":"One could of course try to tune the LGBM parameters for each feature individually, but that's just too tedious. So I prayed that the same parameters work for every feature as long as I allow the number of number of trees to vary for each feature. The following function estimates the optimal number of rounds for each feature.","156978be":"Next, we implement our LGB Naive Bayes classifier.","0e063d42":"It is important that the metric used for the early stopping is the binary logloss (or something similar) and not the AUC score! For many features, the probability function to predict seem to be monotonic. That is, the larger the value of that feature the more likely that the class value is 1 (or 0). In these cases, **any** monotonic predictor will have the same (and best possible) AUC score, since all induce the same ranking of the observations. But a random monotonic function is not good for anything, since it is crucial for Naive Bayes is to estimate the individual conditional probabilities as accurately as possible.","42ef3e27":"Creating submission:","9aec8992":"As we can see, the optimal number of rounds varies greatly. \n\nThere are features that require quite a long training. For example, it seems that the distibution of var_108 has a sharp spike somewhere at the middle and that takes a long time to take into account. (See the end of this notebook for a figure.) The kernel density estimate in Chris's [kernel](http:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/modified-naive-bayes-santander-0-899) does seem to see this spike very well, so this might illustrate why this version of Naive Bayes performs slightly better.\n\nInterestingly, there are also features where the optimal number of trees is less then 10, indicating that those features might be very weak predictors (or perhaps that the chosen LGBM parameters just don't work well for those features).","f883bdab":"Performing 5-fold CV."}}
