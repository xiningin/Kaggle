However, for punctuation count, Upper and Lowercase Ratio it is surpassed by HP Lovecraft and Mary Shelley, respectively. It could mean that HP Lovecraft has a tendency for shorter sentences or more commas or semmi-colons than the other two. Regarding the Upper and Lower case ratio, it could be that Mary Shelley contains more characters or places that require Upper case when compared to EAP and HP.\n* All, but the word_density plot, presents a positive skewed distribution, meaning outliers will present higher values than the mean\n\nNow, let's visualise the outliers with a box-plot:","6793bbb6":"We validate the models using a K-Fold strategy.

Here, we are using AFINN-en-165. Basically, for every word of the samples, a value is assigned. After evaluating all the words of a sample, the final result has a positive or negative score, indicating the author intent. \n\nClearly, this is a simplistic approach to evaluate the authors ideas.

This author seems obsessed with the word **upon**, as we saw in the previous plot\n* The vertical and horizontal patterns are words that are used by one author and are either 0 or a very low value for the other author. \n* Words that have a lower total count (bright colour) seem to be the ones that are more particular for each author, i.e points that are further from the red line, and present a high value in only one of the axis","7891e09a":">I have also tried using TF.IDF to transform the data and train the models.

Conclusion\n\nAs final remarks, it was quite surprising that Logistic Regression and Naive-Bayes have outperformed the LGBM model. Perhaps more effort into the hyperparameter optimisation could improve the LGBM model, but I am not sure if it would overcome the results for NB. As most Data Science problems, great improvements can be achieved by better understanding the data and where the model is finding difficulties. \n\nAs the next step, it would be advised to individually analyse the samples our model are mislabelling and see if there are any hints. Perhaps, shorter samples are more challenging or specific words could be removed to improve our model. In addition, other steps of the text preprocessing (such as removing symbols and punctuation) could be harming the prediction performance. Balancing the samples could be beneficial to increase the prediction performance for MWS and HPL.\n\n## I hope you enjoyed this notebook as it is my initial insight into NLP.
