Although you can save Excel files as CSV from within Excel and then load it into Python with the functions we covered above, pandas is capable of loading data directly from Excel file formats.\n\nTo load data from Excel, you can use the \"xlrd\" module. This module comes with the Python Anaconda distribution. If you don't have it installed, you can get it by opening a command console and running \"pip install xlrd\" (without quotes).\n\nLoad data from an Excel file to a DataFrame with pd.read_excel(), supplying the file path and the name of the worksheet you want to load:","3e4f3d4a":"Reading data into pandas DataFrames is often the first step when conducting data analysis in Python. The pandas package comes equipped with several data reading and writing functions that let you read data directly from common file formats like comma separated values files (CSV) and Microsoft Excel files.

To load a data set, you either need to put the file in your working directory, change your working directory to the folder containing the data or supply the data file's file path to the data reading function.\n\nYou can change your working directory by supplying a new file path in quotes to the os.chdir() function:","0b052b33":"Data is commonly stored in simple flat text files consisting of values delimited(separated) by a special character like a comma (CSV) or tab (TSV).\n\nYou can read CSV files into a pandas DataFrame using the pandas function pd.read_csv():","2d9a7d1e":"The pandas library makes it easy to read data into DataFrames and export it back into common data formats like CSV files. While there are many data fromats that we did not cover in this lesson, as the most popular programming language for data science, Python has functions available in packages to read just about any data format you might encounter.\n\nNow that we know how to load data into Python we're almost ready to start doing data analysis, but before we do, we need to learn some basic Python programming constructs and how to write our own functions.","ff10d4fa":"Before we can jump into reading and writing data, we need to learn a little bit about Python's working directory and file paths. When you launch Python, it starts in a default location in your computer's file system (or the remote computer you are using) known as the working directory. You can check your current working directory by importing the os module and then using os.getcwd():","b319618d":"Notice that the Kaggle input folder contains \"titanic\" and \"draft2015\".

Data analysis often begins with getting data from the web and loading it into Python. Websites that offer data for download usually let you download it as CSV, TSV or excel files. Perhaps the easiest way load web data, is to simply download data to your hard drive and then use the functions we discussed earlier to load it into a DataFrame.\n\nIf you are running Python locally, reading from the clipboard is another quick and dirty option for reading web data and other tabular data. To read data from the clipboard, highlight the data you want to copy and use the appropriate copy function on your keyboard (typically control+C) as if you were going to copy and paste the data. Next, use the pd.read_clipboard() function with the appropriate separator to load the data into a pandas DataFrame. Since we are using Kaggle's kernel environment for this guide we will not be reading from the clipboard.\n\nPandas also comes with a read_html() function to read data directly from web pages. To use read_html() you need the HTML5lib package. Install it by opening a command console and running \"pip install HTLM5lib\" (without quotes). Note that HTML can have all sorts of nested structures and formatting quirks, which makes parsing it to extract data troublesome. The read_html() function does its best to draw out tabular data in web pages, but the results aren't always perfect. Again, since we are using the Kaggle kernel environment for this guide, we won't be using read_html() as it does not seem to play well with Kaggle's notebook environment. When it comes to using outside data on Kaggle, your best bet is to download the data to your local machine and then upload it to Kaggle as a dataset that you can add to your project.\n\nData comes in all sorts of formats other than the ones we've discussed here. The pandas library has several other data reading functions to work with data in other common formats, like json, SAS and stata files and SQL databases.\n"}}
