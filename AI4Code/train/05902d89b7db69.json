Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.\n\nInitially I am dropping the features **'Channel'** and  **'Region'** in the analysis \u2014 with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.","3aacb608":"Index 61 (1) Previous assessment: Supermarket because it has well above the mean of all of the products offering all kind of products having sufficient stocks of each. Model assessment: Cafe\/ Restaurants\n\nIndex 149 (0) Previous assessment: Supplier\/Wholesale market due to sufficiently high stock of fresh Model assessment: Supplier\/Wholesale market Comments: This does seem to agree with the original prediction. I interpreted a predominance of Fresh as a characteristic of Supplier\/Wholesale market, and the model seems to suggest this too.\n\nIndex 379 (1) Previous assessment: cafe due to good stock of milk and more than average stock of grocery (snacks,coffee,tea etc.) while other items have very low stocks than their average values.

I interpreted a predominance of Milk + Grocery as a characteristic of Cafe\/Restaurant, and the model seems to suggest this too.","15dd8ff0":"# Data Recovery \n\nEach cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the averages of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to the average customer of that segment. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.","6fb31568":"The model has resulted into two main customer types - Cluster 0 'supplier\/wholesale market' and Cluster 1 'restaurants\/cafes' .\n\nIt is likely that customers from Cluster 1 who serve lots of fresh food are going to want 5-day weeks in order to keep food as fresh as possible\n\nCluster 0 could be more flexible - they buy a more wide variety of perishable and non-perishable goods so do not necessarily need a daily delivery.\n\nWith this in mind, the Company could run A\/B tests and generalize.Company can take a subset of data points close to the cluster centers to act as representative of their respective clusters, change the delivery frequency on half of the points in the subsets for each cluster, and see how those customers react in comparison to the other customers in their cluster who still have the old delivery frequency. Based on this, company can predict how all customers in each cluster would react to the change in delivery frequency.","e832f8f7":"# Visualizing a Biplot\u00b6\n\nA biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case Dimension 1 and Dimension 2). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.","c5d4da50":"**Advantages of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering algorithm** <br>\n\n1. If the model is having some hidden, not observable parameters, then we should use GMM. This is because, GMM assign a probability to each point to belong to certain cluster, instead of assigning a flag that the point belongs to certain cluster as in the classical k-Means.\n\n2. GMM produce non-convex clusters, which can be controlled with the variance of the distribution. In fact, k-Means is a special case of GMM, such that the probability of a one point to belong to a certain cluster is 1, and all other probabilities are 0, and the variance is 1, which is a reason why k-Means produces only spherical clusters.\n\n3. GMM allows for mixed membership of points to clusters. In kmeans, a point belongs to one and only one cluster, whereas in GMM a point belongs to each cluster to a different degree. The degree is based on the probability of the point being generated from each cluster\u2019s (multivariate) normal distribution, with cluster center as the distribution\u2019s mean and cluster covariance as its covariance. Depending on the task, mixed membership may be more appropriate (e.g. news articles can belong to multiple topic clusters) or not (e.g. organisms can belong to only one species).","38273b0a":"# Dimensionality Reduction\n\nWhen using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data \u2014 in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the cumulative explained variance ratio is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.\n","4833ebd3":"# Clustering","efd196a6":"The R^2 score obtained is 0.7287.

That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.","f53e2647":"# Visualizing Feature Distribution","fbfb453b":"First 2 Principal components:\n\n1. **1st PC:** 44.30%\n2. **2nd PC:** 26.38% <br>\n\n   **Total:** 70.68%\n\nFirst 4 components:\n\n1. **1st PC:** 44.30%\n2. **2nd PC:** 26.38%\n3. **3rd PC:** 12.31%\n4. **4th PC:** 10.12%<br>\n\n**Total: 93.11%**\n\nEach component represents different sections of customer spending\n\n1. **first dimension** represents a wide variety of the featureset.

When the number of clusters is not known a priori, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data \u2014 if any. However, we can quantify the \"goodness\" of a clustering by calculating each data point's silhouette coefficient. The silhouette coefficient for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the mean silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.","d6eac6a6":"In this section, we will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others.
