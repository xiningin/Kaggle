Right now, the City has embedded Career Path charts in PDF files.  A DAG is a special data structure that is more efficient than PDF images.  It looks like a family-tree.\n\n#### Challenges\n\nConvert the Career Path images from the PDF files to a DAG.  Unfortunately, the Career Paths were not designed using high contrast colors.  A dark orange box with black text means the position is only open to City employees.  A blue box with black text means new hires can also apply.\n\n#### Solution\n\nRather than attempting to develop custom PDF parser for legacy PDFs, I took a novel approach.  I used on open-source, optical character recognition tool that is supported by Google.  It is called, [Tesseract](https:\/\/github.com\/tesseract-ocr\/tesseract).  Using a neural network, Tesseract can read the chart and output a raw text file.  Unfortunately, Tesseract cannot read the text through the dark colors.  So, I stripped the color from the chart.  Then, I wrote a script that converts this raw text into a DAG.  I attached this DAG to the Job Bulletin CSV file.  I even added a column called NEXT_PROMOTION for each JOB_CLASS_TITLE.\n\nThere's a bit more work to do but here is a proof of concept using the Public Relations Career Path:","56b50622":"#### Considerations\n\nThe raw text processor works well for simple charts.  More work is needed to gather data for complex charts as shown in the Accounting example.  And there must be a way to tell which jobs are open to new-hires.  I think the arrows in the DAG should be pointing upwards.\n","286967c5":"#### Sample code to view the DAG using Graphviz\n\n```\ngraph = {}\npriorNode = 1\nfor node in nodes:\n    if node[0] != priorNode:\n        graph[str(priorNode)] = [str(node[0])]\n    priorNode = node[0]\n\nprint(\"\\n\")\n#print(graph)\n\ndef generate_edges(graph):\n    edges = []\n    for node in graph:\n        for neighbour in graph[node]:\n            edges.append((node, neighbour))\n    return edges\n\ndef find_isolated_nodes(graph):\n    \"\"\" returns a list of isolated nodes. \"\"\"\n    isolated = []\n    for node in graph:\n        if not graph[node]:\n            isolated += node\n    return isolated\n\ndef create_graph(graph,edges,nodes):\n    a = []\n    dot = Digraph(format='png')\n    for node in nodes:\n        dot.node(node[0], node[1])\n    for edge in edges:\n        dot.edge(edge[0][0], edge[1][0])\n    dot.render('..\/output\/dag.gv',view=True)\n    \ncreate_graph(graph,edges,nodes)\n```","0594dd75":"#### Preprocessing to get input text\n\nFor this submission, I chose to focus on one goal:  reading text from charts and creating a DAG.  I converted the Public_Relations_Specialist.pdf into PR.png and cropped the image.  You don't have to crop the image but it was convenient for this example.
