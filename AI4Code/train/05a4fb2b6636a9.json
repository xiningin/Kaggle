In this notebook we'll explore how we can use neural networks to create cellular automata. We'll start with Conway's Game of Life, and then move on to see if we can replicate his results using learned cellular automata.

If our model has learned correctly, we should see the glider travel across the grid.","b969a78c":"## Model\n\nWe'll use a very simple model to recreate the rules of GOL. The first layer pads the edges of the grid by sampling the values from the opposite side. The rest of the layers consists of first a 3x3 convolutional layer, which samples the \"neighborhood\" around each cell, followed by 2 1x1 convolutional layers, which effectively act as fully connected layers for each neighborhood sample. The output of the model is the same as the input, a channel of values representing dead cells, and a channel of values representing alive cells, this allows the output to be repeatedly fed back into the input, peforming one transition each time. This model is inspired in part by [(Gilpin, 2018)](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1809.02942).","caa3d3f4":"Looks like it works!

We'll start out by creating our input $x$, 10 different random 32x32 grids, then performing one transition step to get our output, $y$. I chose to keep the train set relitively small to reflect the nature of the ARC challenge."}}
