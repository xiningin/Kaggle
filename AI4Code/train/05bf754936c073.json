For example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word's presence is attributable to one of the document's topics. LDA is an example of a topic model.[4] Simply saying, just like pizza and toppings, in terms of topic modelling, the composites are documents and the parts are words and\/or phrases(phrases n words in length are referred to as n-grams).\n\n\n> If you view the number of topics as a number of clusters and the probabilities as the proportion of cluster membership, then using LDA is a way of soft-clustering composites and parts. Similar to k-Means clustering, each instance can only belong to one specific cluster but LDA allows a fuzzy membership. It adds more nuances.

So the two methods can use interchangeably. \n#### The advantage of LDA is it return you the topics automately while KMeans clustering required manually check the top words cloud.\n#### However, the clustering method give you the exact papers for each cluster.\n\n#### To compare LDA topic modeling with the WordCloud method, see code of the clustering method on GitHub \nhttps:\/\/github.com\/lj89\/CORD19\/blob\/master\/Polymerase_subset_find_topic_for_groups_after_clustering2.ipynb\n\n\n#### Additional, I shoud add protein and proteins, sequence and sequences, etc, to CONTRACTION_MAP"}}
