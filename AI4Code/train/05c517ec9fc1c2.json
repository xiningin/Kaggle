Which counties seem to need less\/more equipment based on the growth of the COVID-19 cases?\n* Make use of the geographic information. Can we see the pandemic moving to the neighbor counties\/states? Do some neighbor counties\/states have enough ressources (hospital beds, icu beds) to help out others? In other words: County XY has 0 hospital bed potential but the neighbours could help, county ZZ has a bigger potential but all the neighbours are at their limits. \n\n\n","8c4967df":"# Which populations of clinicians and patients require protective equipment?\nThis notebook is designed to help answer this question.
