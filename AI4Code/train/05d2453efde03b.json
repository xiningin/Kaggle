Each person has 181 different face images which captured in different pose angles from -90 to +90 degree (5,430 = 30 * 181). <br\/>The file name format is as follows:\n\/FacePix\/P(D).jpg <br\/>\nwhere P is the person index and can be in range(1, 30) and D is pose angle and can be in range (-90, +90). For Example \/FacePix\/20(-45).jpg represents the file name  of 20'th person's face image in pose -45 degrees.\nIn the next code cell, the \"get_image(person,pose)\" method simply gets the person number and pose angle as inputs and returns the related face image.\n<br\/><br\/>\n** All face images are cropped manually and resized to 60x51 and converted to GrayScale.**<br\/>\n** You can access to the original FacePix dataset here (and for more info):** https:\/\/cubic.asu.edu\/content\/facepix-database"}}
