Bans on traveling across provinces, entering and exiting the country were implemented. There were only 43 new cases on the day that the quarantine was declared. On March 18, the measures were tightened into a next step by setting a curfew from 8 pm to 5 am. However the situation did not get better even after the all the measures. On March 26, new daily cases reached 100 cases before which it started to increase rapidly and reached a peak on May 30 with 14000 daily new cases. It is said tobe because of people's behavior on not respecting the laws to make the spread worse.\n\nIn general, daily infected people in Peru increased over time with some fluctuation until now. The fluctuation is probably from the number of test that is conducted or the update system. For now (June 12), Peru ranks in 13th in the world considering from confrimed case on June 12. Even though right now the number of daily cases decreases from the highest point, it is still considered high at around 5000 cases per day and there is still no sign of it decreasing.
