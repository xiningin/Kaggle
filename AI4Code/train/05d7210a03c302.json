Inside your body there are 60,000 miles of blood vessels.\n* A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying your heart with blood and oxygen becomes blocked.\n* Fatty deposits build up over time, forming plaques in your heart's arteries. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form and block your arteries, causing a heart attack.","9b0abf30":"# Import dataset","890ccbd0":"Great no missing values","8eacde90":"# Correlation matrix:"}}
