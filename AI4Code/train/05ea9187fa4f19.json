However, different assets exhibit different price scales, so that the their returns are not readily comparable. We can solve this problem by computing the percentage change in price instead, also known as the return. This return coincides with the percentage change in our invested capital.\n\nReturns are widely used in finance, however log returns are preferred for mathematical modelling of time series, as they are additive across time. Also, while regular returns cannot go below -100%, log returns are not bounded.\n\nTo compute the log return, we can simply take the logarithm of the ratio between two consecutive prices. The first row will have an empty return as the previous value is unknown, therefore the empty return data point will be dropped.","f81a9c93":"We can see that each row of the data set has the trading data for an asset, at a given minute timestamp, described in detail below. ","39cee5d4":"\n## Forecasting returns\n\nA fundamental task in financial modeling is predicting how prices will behave in the near future. Using the time-series of historical prices as training data, we want to predict if prices will go up or down, and by how much, namely the asset *returns*.\n\nIn this competition, Kagglers are challenged to build machine learning models to predict the returns of 14 popular cryptocurrencies, in the time scale of minutes to hours. You will have access to millions of rows of minute-by-minute cryptocurrency trading data, with which you'll design your forecasting models for all 14 assets simultaneously. Your predictions will be evaluated by how much they correlate with real market data collected during the three-month evaluation period after the competition has closed. \n\nCryptocurrency returns prediction remains an open and extremely challenging forecasting task. This is a fascinating problem domain for the ML community given the extreme volatility of the assets, the non-stationary nature of the data, the market and meme manipulation, the correlation between assets and the very fast changing market conditions. We hope you find it as fascinating as we do! \n","a1d4ca42":"Note the high but variable correlation between the assets. Here we can see that there is some changing dynamics over time, and this would be critical for this time series challenge, that is, how to perform forecasts in a highly non-stationary environment.\n\nA stationary behaviour of a system or a process is characterized by non-changing statistical properties over time such as the mean, variance and autocorrelation. On the other hand, a non-stationary behaviour is characterized by a continuous change of statistical properties over time. Stationarity is important because many useful analytical tools and statistical tests and models rely on it.\n\nWe can also check the correlation between all assets visualizing the correlation matrix. Note how some assets have much higher pairwise correlation than others.","25bcb747":"## Preparing the data for building predictive models\n\nAs we will train linear regression parameters, we need to separate training and test sets. To do so, we will compute X and y and split this data into train and test splits. Note that the test split represents a later part of the data, as it is commonly done in time series. ","ef998d12":"## The Cryptocurrency Market\n\nFirst, a quick introduction to the crypto world. Cryptocurrencies have become an extremely popular and volatile market, delivering massive returns (as well as losses) to investors. Thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created with a few major ones that many of you will have heard of including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) or Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nCryptocurrencies are traded extensively across crypto-exchanges, with an average volume of $41 billion traded daily over the last year, according to CryptoCompare (as of 25th July 2021). \n\nChanges in prices between different cryptocurrencies are highly interconnected. For example, Bitcoin has historically been a major driver of price changes across cryptocurrencies but other coins also impact the market.  \n","5876ab8b":"# G-Research Crypto forecasting competition\n\nIn the [G-Research Crypto forecasting competition](link), participants have the challenge to predict  price returns across a bundle of major cryptocurrencies. To facilitate your participation, we have created this tutorial notebook covering some relevant concepts for the crypto forecasting challenge.\n\nThe notebook presents an introduction to crypto forecasting, describing the structure and elements of the dataset, some relevant statistical properties, as well as building a couple of ML baseline models and providing an example code submission.\n\n","b87af896":"## Load the training set","30531c4a":"## Candlestick charts\n\nThe trading data format is an aggregated form of market data including for Open, High, Low and Close. We can visualize this data through the commonly used candlestick bar chart, which allows traders to perform technical analysis on intraday values. The bar's body length represents the price range between the open and close of that day's trading. When the bar is red, it means the close was lower than the open, and green otherwise. These are also referred to as bullish and bearish candlesticks. The wicks above and below the bars show the high and low prices of that interval's trading.","049d3f01":"# Dataset description\n\nNow, let's dive into the data! We start by loading the competition's dataset and inspecting its basic properties. ","49b47cf6":"Notice that there are many gaps in the data.

","8b560425":"## Prediction targets and evaluation","57baf105":"This forecasting competition aims to predict returns in the near future for prices $P^a$, for each asset $a$. For each row in the dataset, we include the target for prediction, `Target`. `Target` is derived from log returns ($R^a$) over 15 minutes.\n\n$$R^a(t) = log (P^a(t+16)\\ \/\\ P^a(t+1))$$\n\nCrypto asset returns are highly correlated, following to a large extend the overall crypto market. As we want to test your ability to predict returns for individual assets, we perform a linear residualization, removing the market signal from individual asset returns when creating the target. In more detail, if $M(t)$ is the weighted average market returns, the target is:\n\n$$M(t) = \\frac{\\sum_a w^a R^a(t)}{\\sum_a w^a}  \\\\\n\\beta^a = \\frac{\\langle M \\cdot R^a \\rangle}{\\langle M^2 \\rangle} \\\\\n\\text{Target}^a(t) = R^a(t) - \\beta^a M(t)$$\n\nwhere the bracket $\\langle .\\rangle$ represent the rolling average over time (3750 minute windows), and same asset weights $w^a$ used for the evaluation metric.\n\nSome rows have null values for targets due to missing values in future prices. Rows with nulls in the test set ground truth are ignored for scoring purposes.\n\nIn the competition, your predictions will be evaluated on a weighted version of the Pearson correlation coefficient, with weights given by the `Weight` column in the Asset Details file.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will simplify things and use correlation (without weights) for evaluation, and consider only two assets, BTC and ETH.","ef7a8bc6":"We now standardize the input data.

Timestamps in this dataset are multiple of 60, indicating minute-by-minute data.\n*   **Asset_ID**: The asset ID corresponding to one of the crytocurrencies (e.g. `Asset_ID = 1` for Bitcoin). The mapping from `Asset_ID` to crypto asset is contained in `asset_details.csv`.\n*   **Count**: Total number of trades in the time interval (last minute).\n*   **Open**:\tOpening price of the time interval (in USD).\n*   **High**:\tHighest price reached during time interval (in USD).\n*   **Low**: Lowest price reached during time interval (in USD).\n*   **Close**:\tClosing price of the time interval (in USD).\n*   **Volume**:\tQuantity of asset bought or sold, displayed in base currency USD.\n*   **VWAP**: The average price of the asset over the time interval, weighted by volume. VWAP is an aggregated form of trade data.\n*   **Target**: Residual log-returns for the asset over a 15 minute horizon. \n\nThe first two columns define the time and asset indexes for this data row. The 6 middle columns are feature columns with the trading data for this asset and minute in time. The last column is the prediction target, which we will get to later in more detail.\n\nWe also view the asset information, including the list of all assets, the `Asset_ID` to asset mapping, and the weight of each asset used to weigh their relative importance in the evaluation metric.","6f9bcef4":"We can visualize a slice of the Bitcoin prices using the `plotly` library.
