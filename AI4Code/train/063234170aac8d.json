Answer to all this is \"**Handcalcs**\" Library","abff126f":"# Math Calculations in Python\n\nMath calculations are basic in Data Science. But hard to explain or understand sometimes.\n\nBut Why?\n\n1. Instead of direct numbers, variables are used. So, mentally we need to substitute variable values, to calculate and verify the result.\n2. Methods will be called for complex operations or greek symbols as string, say 'sqrt' method or 'pi' symbol. But, we are habitat of writing those using symbols. So, for us, we mentally replace 'sqrt' with its symbol '\u221a' or 'Alpha' as '\u03b1'. \n3. Expression format is much different than how we are habitat of writing same expressions on Paper.","21f1b41c":"Done.
