With so many modules to learn, I would start learning from the basic, and then expand more in python scientific computing.\n\nToday I just want to use some of the basic functionalities that I learned in using numpy, pandas and matplotlib, to make a complete data analysis.","5f1d906a":"Of all the teams, Los Angeles Lakers obviously won the POTW the most, followed by teams like Miami Heat, San Antonio Spurs and Cleveland Cavaliers."}}
