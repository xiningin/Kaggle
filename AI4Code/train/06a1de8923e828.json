Any significant deviations would imply the distribution is skewed.\n\n\n**Bottom Right**: The Correlogram, aka, ACF plot shows the residual errors are not autocorrelated. Any autocorrelation would imply that there is some pattern in the residual errors which are not explained in the model. So you will need to look for more X\u2019s (predictors) to the model.\n\n\nOverall, it seems to be a good fit. Let\u2019s start forecasting the stock prices.\n\n\nNext, create an ARIMA model with provided optimal parameters p, d and q.","58fa76ce":"Also, a given time series is thought to consist of three systematic components including level, trend, seasonality, and one non-systematic component called noise.\n\nThese components are defined as follows:\n\n1. **Level**: The average value in the series.\n\n2. **Trend**: The increasing or decreasing value in the series.\n\n3. **Seasonality**: The repeating short-term cycle in the series.\n\n4. **Noise**: The random variation in the series.\n\nFirst, we need to check if a series is stationary or not because time series analysis only works with stationary data.\n\n\n**ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test**\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller test is one of the most popular statistical tests. It can be used to determine the presence of unit root in the series, and hence help us understand if the series is stationary or not. The null and alternate hypothesis of this test is:\n\n\n**Null Hypothesis**: The series has a unit root (value of a =1)\n\n\n**Alternate Hypothesis**: The series has no unit root.\n\n\nIf we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we can say that the series is non-stationary. This means that the series can be linear or difference stationary.\n\n\nIf both mean and standard deviation are flat lines(constant mean and constant variance), the series becomes stationary.\n\n\n**So let's check for stationarity:","0a007e7c":"We see that the p-value is greater than 0.05 so we cannot reject the Null hypothesis. Also, the test statistics is greater than the critical values. so the data is non-stationary.\n\n\nIn order to perform a time series analysis, we may need to separate seasonality and trend from our series. The resultant series will become stationary through this process.\n\n\nSo let us separate Trend and Seasonality from the time series.","e13cb3d4":"### Around 2.5% MAPE implies the model is about 97.5% accurate in predicting the next 15 observations.\n","9c7f2aeb":"### Load all the required libraries","3f51184f":"#### Auto ARIMA: Automatically discover the optimal order for an ARIMA model.\n\n\nThe auto_arima function seeks to identify the most optimal parameters for an ARIMA model, and returns a fitted ARIMA model. This function is based on the commonly-used R function, **forecast::auto.arima**.\n\n\nThe **auro_arima** function works by conducting differencing tests (i.e., **Kwiatkowski\u2013Phillips\u2013Schmidt\u2013Shin, Augmented Dickey-Fuller or Phillips\u2013Perron**) to determine the order of differencing, d, and then fitting models within ranges of defined start_p, max_p, start_q, max_q ranges.
