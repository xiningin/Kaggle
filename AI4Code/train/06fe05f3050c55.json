And not just in dollars, but in environmental impact.\n\nThankfully, significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions. The question is, are the improvements working? That\u2019s where you come in. Under pay-for-performance financing, the building owner makes payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption and what they would have used without any retrofits. The latter values have to come from a model. Current methods of estimation are fragmented and do not scale well. Some assume a specific meter type or don\u2019t work with different building types.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.","f44050f4":"> Note: The `meter_reading` column is in log-scale above. The outputs of meter type `2` are much higher than the rest, so it's easier to see patterns in log-scale.\n\nIn the plot above, we can see that the meter type is obviously an important feature. In addition, clearly the `meter_reading` has plenty of seasonality. The most evident examples of seasonality here are based on time of day and day of week and that seasonality is different for different meter types.\n\nFor example, notice that meter `0` is clearly affected by weekend vs. weekday dynamics more so than other meter types. There are probably also monthly seasonal effects based on heating needs being different in winter vs. summer, although that's not visible in the graph above. To see that aspect of seasonality look at the plot below.","4f6c501a":"# Evaluating the model on the test data","e27fd369":"Presumably there are plenty of moments where the various buildings are just not in use and it doesn't matter how hot or cold it is outside. So we should ignore the low `meter_reading` data points. Also, we'll stick to using log-space for meter readings because we've decided that the strong correlation between `square_feet` and `meter_reading` in log-log space is useful for us.\n\nIt doesn't look like there's a very clear relationship between the 2 variables. The shape is mostly a blob, but there are density differences in the blob. When split across primary_use, we start to see some patterns for some of the primary usages, but nothing that's very clear. So might be okay to keep the variable in, but I'm not expecting much from it.\n\n### Relationship between `dew_temperature` and `meter_reading`","84016db7":"# Prepare training data\n\nWe established earlier that there is value in dealing with the meter_reading in log-space. So we'll do that transformation here as well.","91ccc4ce":"## Train\/test split methodology\n\nThe training dataset ranges from `2016-01-01 00:00:00` to `2016-12-31 23:00:00` and the test dataset ranges from `2017-01-01 00:00:00` to `2018-12-31 23:00:00`.\n\nSo if we split the data for our own train\/validation routine, we should also split the data with non-overlapping timestamps. One way to think about it is that the model should learn the day-to-day changes in energy consumption from the seasonality and weather features and not from knowing the changes in energy consumption for the same timestamps for other buildings in the same site.","6070b9af":"One of the problems here is that the columns `year_built` and `floor_count` have plenty of null values. For now, I'm planning to leave them as is. Lightgbm can handle null values, so we'll rely on that for now. \n\nIt would be interesting to see how both `square_feet`, `primary_use` and `year_built` influence `energy_consumption`","6b2db568":"It's interesting that there doesn't seem to be much of a linear relationship between `square_feet` and the `meter_reading`. What's more interesting is that the relationship is more evident in log-log space.","ca090f15":"Input data is available on the file system in `..\/input\/ashrae-energy-prediction`. Let's just list it first.","eef352fa":"# Merge all the dataframes\n\nBefore we do the analysis of the relationship of the various weather parameters to the meter reading, it might be beneficial to merge the dataframes, so we can get ahead of this expensive operation.","f2049ea0":"### Relationship between `air_temperature` and `meter_reading`","28bbf8e2":"This whole thing also looks very similar to `air_temperature`. Perhaps worth keeping this in as well, but low expectations.","8fa457ed":"## Feature generation: `building_metadata.csv`\n\nFor now, we definitely want to encode the 2 categorical variables: `year_built` and `primary_use`. We also want to log-transform the `square_feet` column because of our previous analysis.","daeeed05":"# Description of files\n\n(pasted from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/ashrae-energy-prediction\/data)\n\n### train.csv\n* `building_id` - Foreign key for the building metadata.\n* `meter` - The meter id code.

We do so within the context of each `site_id`.","f8c76d32":"As you can see, the `weather_train_idx` index has a length larger than that of `weather_train_df`. This implies that there are gaps in the weather information. Let's expand the `weather_train_df` dataframe to account for those gaps first.","15834649":"Of course there are plenty of columns in the `merged_train_df` dataframe that are not required for the actual modeling.
