This is the way we keep it in this chapter of our tutorial, but it can be the other way around as well, i.e. rows for predicted classes and columns for actual classes. The name confusion matrix reflects the fact that it makes it easy for us to see what kind of confusions occur in our classification algorithms. For example the algorithms should have predicted a sample as ci because the actual class is ci, but the algorithm came out with cj.
