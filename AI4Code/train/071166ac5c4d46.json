Also it can help to understand features nature (power-series distribution or standard or something else). Histogram can help us find some values that aren't similar to each other - outliers.\nIt is convenient to plot histograms using *plot* method of Pandas DataFrame with option *kind='hist'*.\n\n**Example.** Let's plot the histogram of teenager's height distribution.
