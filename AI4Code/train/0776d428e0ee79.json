The NGS files however, each can contain up to 9 million rows. In that case we need to reduce the amount of memory they take up. In this kernel I will show you how to do this in an easy way.\n\nThe NGS datasets contains player position, speed and direction data for each player during the entire course of the play. The NGS dataset is the only dataset that contains Timeas a variable. ","ce405ca3":"## Final Steps\n\n1. We can turn Season_Year into a category with the values 0 and 1 to save more memory. The feature only contains the values 2016 and 2017.\n2. We can delete the NANs in GSISD and then turn it into an integer. \n3. We can save this as a feather file, which is much faster to load. But we might have to define the data types again after loading.","1bbbedb4":"By 'downcasting' the numeric features we have almost halved the memory consumption. However, not all data types are correct yet. \n1. From the data disctionary we know that **Event** is text and should be data type 'object'. \n2. And **Time** is obviously datetime. It's faster though importing it as 'string' and then converting it.\n3. We can also go a step further with **SeasonYear**. The feature only contains two values: 2016 and 2017. If we changed that to 0 and 1, then we can reduce the data type further from int16 to int8, saving more memory. \n4. **GSISID** is only an integer and not a float. However, there are NANs in the data, which prevent us from converting this straight away.\n\nNow let's define the data types and then upload the NGS files.","db021c1c":"* NGS-2016-pre.csv\n* NGS-2016-reg-wk1-6.csv\n* NGS-2016-reg-wk7-12.csv\n* NGS-2016-reg-wk13-17.csv\n* NGS-2016-post.csv\n\n\n* NGS-2017-pre.csv\n* NGS-2017-reg-wk1-6.csv\n* NGS-2017-reg-wk7-12.csv\n* NGS-2017-reg-wk13-17.csv\n* NGS-2017-post.csv","0ab670e6":"All NGS file have the same structure, which means we can load them individually and concatenate them afterwards.
