These tokens will be treated as semantic features, particularly after stemming.

We break up this effort into multiple steps in order to speed up testing and making changes. This also uses less memory and is less likely to time out.  There are many parameters we could attempt to optimize.  However, due to processing constraints we limit ourselves to the number of topics and the number of features (word or bigrams).\n\nA topic model learns a topic-feature matrix of abstract topics and features (word or ngrams) and a document-topic matrix of documents and topics, from a document-feature matrix of documents and features. From this factorization we achieve statistical feature vectors for each topic and topic vectors for each document in the training corpus. We can then find topic vectors for the questions we would like to ask the corpus of documents. We will use the closest matching documents in the CORD-19 dataset in an attempt to answer the task questions. LDA assumes a Dirichlet prior on topic-feature and document-topic distributions. In other words it assumes each topic is defined by and small collection of words or ngrams and that each documnent consists of a small number of topics.\n\nThe advantage of trying to find some configurations of LDA training parameters with better coherence scores is that the resulting topic model might perform better under this tasks queries than they would from random parameter selection.  However, coherence is not a human measure (involving humans would be expensive and negate the benifit of first step automation) and we only varied a select few parameters (there are more parameter that could impact human perception of the results).\n\nWe will be relying on paper titles and PIDs as answers to the task's queries.  The papers have the advantage of being written by humans (rather than a generated summary) and therefore is assumed to be understandable.  However, it is up to the person asking the question to then go to the referenced papers and determine if their question is answered.","b0d2f7db":"# Definitions for query topic vectors and ranking \n**Topic distribution:**\nThis definition takes a provided string, tokenizes it with the provided dictionary (either word or bigram based), and then returns a topic distribution vector using a provided LDA topic model.\n**Print top 3 matches:**\nthis takes a query in the form of a topic distribution and a gensim similarity matrix designed to efficiently calculate cosine similarities and then creates a ranked list of indices for the matches.  The indices are used along with a provided dictionary of the raw data in order to print the title and abstract of the top three matching papers.","643e73ac":"# Definitions for \"Try LDA Parameters\" kernel\nIn this portion of our effort to tune some of the LDA parameters, we will try configurations of several hyperparameters.  The parameters we will vary are: ngram (1 or 2), number of features (words or bigrams) in the feature distribution vectors of the topics, and number of topics to factor for when creating the LDA model (topic-feature matrix).\n\n**Create Dictionary:**\nThis is the definition for creating a dictionary for our corpus. Number of features (word stems of ngrams) will be the variable optimized for using this function.\n\n**Create term frequency corpus:**\nDefinition for creating the corpus from the dictionary and documents.\n\n**Try model configuration:**\nDefinition to train a LDA Model and the compute the coherence score.\n\n**Loop through number of topics:**  Given a set ngram (1 or 2) and feature length, loop through number of topics given the start, stop, and step bounds.  For each n_topics build an LDA topic model, calculate coherence, and return coherence list.\n\n**Objective function for differential evolution optimization:**\nOriginally we wanted to use differential evolution to optimize LDA parameters.  However, we were unable to use this technique because each mumber of the population requires compute and memory resources to evaluate the objective function. \n\nDifferential evolution uses a population to try many different parameters, removes the poor performing population members, makes combinations of the more successfull population members, performs some mutations, and then repeats until some stopping condintion (number of evolutions, or no improvement after a given number of steps).  In this way it hopes to achieve good non-linear optimization.  Differential evolution is similar to genetic algorithms, but skips the chromosome string encoding and acts directly on the variables.   We would need to reserve extra compute resources for this technique.  Note that we need to define a vector of tuples for the bounds, and that some parameters need to be converted to to int (uint) because this scipy function works with floats only.","969a8f0b":"# \"Immune response and immunity\"","65e26b0c":"# \"Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person\"","973db8af":"# \"Implementation of diagnostics and products to improve clinical processes\"","f01cbadb":"# \"Effectiveness of movement control strategies to prevent secondary transmission in health care and community settings\"","c1c95100":"# Specific Questions\nThese are the specific bullet points to be addressed in this task","d72eca61":"# Broad questions\nWe will start will the broad scope questions for this task.","8d60f028":"# \"Persistence and stability on a multitude of substrates and sources (e.g., nasal discharge, sputum, urine, fecal matter, blood).\"","7780659b":"# \"Tools and studies to monitor phenotypic change and potential adaptation of the virus\"","7454079d":"# Try LDA Parameters steps\nCode available in the public kernel that produced the \"try-lda-parameters\" input.\nTry ngrams (1 and 2), number of features, and number of topics\n1.
