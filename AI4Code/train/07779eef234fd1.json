We can also observe a similar spike around 1985 to 1993. In fact, Argentina had suffered a great depression from 1974 - 1990, just before the onset of 1998 - 2002 great depression. \n\nOn a similar note, Brazil suffered the *Samba Effect* where the Brazilian real (currency) dropped nearly 35% in 1999. There was a fear of a South American financial crisis as many South American countries were heavily dependent on industrial exports from Brazil. The Brazilian government subsequently adopted an austerity program, and the economy slowly recovered over the years, culminating in a surge in 2010. The immigration data reflect these events.","5fa855fc":"# Exploring Datasets with *pandas* and Matplotlib<a id=\"0\"><\/a>\n\nToolkits: The course heavily relies on [*pandas*](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/) and [**Numpy**](http:\/\/www.numpy.org\/) for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous \/ next residence both for foreigners and nationals. In this lab, we will focus on the Canadian Immigration data.","d723443d":"Step 2: Generate the bubble plots.","6b6adbdc":"Notice how the scatter plot does not connect the datapoints together.

We will pass in `kind = 'pie'` keyword, along with the following additional parameters:\n- `autopct` -  is a string or function used to label the wedges with their numeric value. The label will be placed inside the wedge. If it is a format string, the label will be `fmt%pct`.\n- `startangle` - rotates the start of the pie chart by angle degrees counterclockwise from the x-axis.\n- `shadow` - Draws a shadow beneath the pie (to give a 3D feel).","25603e02":"But I want to fit a line.

You are most likely already familiar with pie charts as it is widely used in business and media. We can create pie charts in Matplotlib by passing in the `kind=pie` keyword.\n\nLet's use a pie chart to explore the proportion (percentage) of new immigrants grouped by continents for the entire time period from 1980 to 2013.

Therefore we will:\n    - multiply weights by 2000 to scale it up on the graph, and,\n    - add 10 to compensate for the min value (which has a 0 weight and therefore scale with x2000).","e506511e":"## Introduction\n\nIn this session, we continue exploring the Matplotlib library.

For example, we might want to perform a side by side comparison of the box plot with the line plot of China and India's immigration.\n\nTo visualize multiple plots together, we can create a **`figure`** (overall canvas) and divide it into **`subplots`**, each containing a plot. With **subplots**, we usually work with the **artist layer** instead of the **scripting layer**. \n\nTypical syntax is : <br>\n```python\n    fig = plt.figure() # create figure\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(nrows, ncols, plot_number) # create subplots\n```\nWhere\n- `nrows` and `ncols` are used to notionally split the figure into (`nrows` \\* `ncols`) sub-axes,  \n- `plot_number` is used to identify the particular subplot that this function is to create within the notional grid. `plot_number` starts at 1, increments across rows first and has a maximum of `nrows` * `ncols` as shown below.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/ibm.box.com\/shared\/static\/03rhrfcealyoi83tigscovgglfchfyor.png\" width=500 align=\"center\">","06c9922b":"So let's try to plot a linear line of best fit, and use it to  predict the number of immigrants in 2015.\n\nStep 1: Get the equation of line of best fit.

While the datapoints are connected together by a line in a line plot, they are not connected in a scatter plot. The data in a scatter plot is considered to express a trend. With further analysis using tools like regression, we can mathematically calculate this relationship and use it to predict trends outside the dataset.\n\nLet's start by exploring the following:\n\nUsing a `scatter plot`, let's visualize the trend of total immigrantion to Canada (all countries combined) for the years 1980 - 2013.","b44fe9db":"Clean up data.
