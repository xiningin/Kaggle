additional molecular features, such as dipole moments, magnetic shielding, mulliken charges and potential energy, which have information only for train and not for test datasets. \n\nSo, in order to use such attributes we would have to first create models from the training molecules and infer values for each test molecule.\n\n### Dealing With Molecules\n\nThe problem is that estimating properties relative to the position of the atoms in the molecule, it is useless to deal only with 1, 2 or 3 atoms, because they are often influenced by several (or all) neighboring atoms of a molecule.   \nThus, the ideal model must consider the entire molecular structure.   \nThe competition files provide the xyz positions of each atom, but using all the positions of all the atoms in a machine learning model can be a very difficult task.   \nTo overcome this problem, the concept of fingerprint of the molecule arises, where the molecular structure can be represented by an array, calculated from the spatial relationship (in three dimensions) between atoms in the molecule. Based on this, in theory you can create models for any molecular property based on the spatial structure.    \nThe most famous technique for defining molecular fingerprint is **Morgan**'s fingerprinting, for more information see the paper:    \n*Morgan, H. L. The Generation of a Unique Machine Description for Chemical Structures - A Technique Developed at Chemical Abstracts Service. J. Chem. Doc. 1965, 5: 107-112.*   \nThe process of creating the molecule's fingerprint is complex because it takes into account the entire 3D structure of the molecule, including the identity of the atoms, the type of chemical bonds, the degree of hybridization, conformation, relative angles, and so on.\nFor this task we will use the incredible DEEPCHEM library, which abstracts most of the complexity and requires only a few lines of code.\n\n### Main goal\nThe main purpose of this kernel is to teach how to use the Stanford DeepChem library to use the additional molecular features in this competition. No knowledge of chemistry is needed, just pure python !!\nIn this kernel we will use the potential energy data as an example, however the same concept can be applied to the other files provided.\n\n> **If you want to see only the DEEPCHEM library application, you can skip the introduction and preprocessing and go straight to the title: Deepchem to provide the potential energy, at the end of this kernel.**","13f48a4b":"R2 Score obtained was not bad for a first model and the small dataset used, of course you can test with other models and parameters to improve it.","53303c17":"## Deepchem to provide the potential energy","6c8e8215":"### Instaling packages, libraries, and so on...","0c14e6cb":"As we said earlier, the same concept can be applied to the other files provided, such as **dipole moments, mulliken charges**, and so on.\n\n**So, if you find it useful and liked this code what do you think of giving me an upvote?

The files of the molecules supplied by Kaggle are in xyz formats.   \nSo we will modify them. This transformation will be in 3 steps:\n1. Convert XYZ to MOL format.\n2. Transform MOL to SMILES format.\n3. Create a csv file.\n\n## Read molecules in RDKit using XYZ2MOL package\n### XYZ file format\nThe XYZ file format is a chemical file format. Normally XYZ format specifies the molecule geometry by giving the number of atoms with Cartesian coordinates that will be read on the first line, a comment on the second, and the lines of atomic coordinates in the following lines.[1] The file format is used in computational chemistry programs for importing and exporting geometries. The units are generally in \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms.(https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/XYZ_file_format)    \nNormally, we find in a XYZ file:  \n-First line: total number of atoms (optional)  \n-Second line: molecule name or comment (optional)  \n-All other lines: element symbol or atomic number, x, y, and z coordinates, separated by spaces, tabs, or commas  \nExample:    \nglucose from 2gbp     \nC  35.884  30.895  49.120   \nC  36.177  29.853  50.124    \nC  37.296  30.296  51.074    \nC  38.553  30.400  50.259     \nC  38.357  31.290  49.044     \nC  39.559  31.209  48.082     \nO  34.968  30.340  48.234  \nO  34.923  29.775  50.910  \nO  37.441  29.265  52.113  \nO  39.572  30.954  51.086  \nO  37.155  30.858  48.364  \nO  39.261  32.018  46.920\n\n### Mol file format\nAn MDL Molfile is a file format for holding information about the atoms, bonds, connectivity and coordinates of a molecule.(https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chemical_table_file)  \n\n### xyz2mol\nThis is a library that converts an xyz file to an RDKit mol object.

(https:\/\/github.com\/jensengroup\/xyz2mol)  \n\n### Smiles Format\nThe simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings. SMILES strings can be imported by most molecule editors for conversion back into two-dimensional drawings or three-dimensional models of the molecules.(https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system)    \nIn terms of a graph-based computational procedure, SMILES is a string obtained by printing the symbol nodes encountered in a depth-first tree traversal of a chemical graph. The chemical graph is first trimmed to remove hydrogen atoms and cycles are broken to turn it into a spanning tree. Where cycles have been broken, numeric suffix labels are included to indicate the connected nodes. Parentheses are used to indicate points of branching on the tree.(https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system, http:\/\/opensmiles.org)    \nA wide variety of SMILES strings are acceptable as input. For example, all of the following represent ethanol:   \n\nCCO\t\nOCC\t\nC(O)C\t\n[CH3][CH2][OH]\t\n[H][C]([H])([H])C([H])([H])[O][H]\t\n\n### RDKit\nRDKit is a collection of cheminformatics and machine-learning software written in C++ and Python, created by Greg Landrum.(https:\/\/github.com\/rdkit\/rdkit)     \nIt is an amazing library for chemistry, computational biology and bioinformatics studies involving python programming.\nWe use it to convert mol format to Smiles format.","b76f8ef8":"## Prepare dataframe for using with DeepChem library","93b63979":"#### Create smiles format from molecules","e3f60542":"After the aforementioned featurization, we will create our potential energy model.
