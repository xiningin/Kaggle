Amount is correlated with isFraud(Target Variable).\n\nThere is not much relation between the features, so we need to understand where the relationship between them depends on the type of transaction and amount.

From the hypothesis, **isFraud** is the indicator which indicates the **actual fraud transactions** whereas **isFlaggedFraud** is what the system prevents the transaction due to **some thresholds** being triggered. From the above heatmap we can see that there is some relation between other columns and isFlaggedFraud thus there must be relation between isFraud.","edb4a3b0":"## Conclusion","6b7ef422":"The graph above shows that **TRANSFER** and **CASH_OUT** are two most used mode of transaction and we can see that **TRANSFER** and **CASH_OUT** are also the only way in which fraud happen. **Thus we will focus on this type of transactions**.","6ce9e795":"## Data Cleaning","a826627b":"The plot above clearly shows the **need** for a system which can be **fast** and **reliable** to mark the transaction which is fraud.

Some data exploration can be helpful to check for the relation between features.","e154e9cf":"## Introduction \n----\nThis notebook contains Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Machine Learning Model for fraud detection. Fraud detection is valuable to many industries including the **banking-financial sectors, insurance, law enforcement, government agencies**, and many more. \n\nIn recent years we have seen a huge increase in Fraud attempts, making fraud detection important as well as challenging. Despite countless efforts and human supervision, **hundreds of millions** are lost due to **fraud**. Fraud can happen using various methods ie, stolen credit cards, misleading accounting, phishing emails, etc. Due to small cases in large population detection of fraud is important as well as challenging.\n\n**Data mining** and **machine learning** help to foresee and **rapidly distinguish fraud** and make **quick move** to limit costs. Using data mining tools, a huge number of transactions can be looked to spot pattern and distinguish fraud transactions.\n\n----\n\n\n**Note: To enable complete interactive demo, please install other requirment.**","ce639032":"## Data Exploration\n","18437b42":"**Average precision score is 0.7687.**","9c354df8":"The provided data has the financial transaction data as well as the target variable **isFraud**, which is the actual fraud status of the transaction and **isFlaggedFraud** is the indicator which the simulation is used to flag the transaction using some **threshold value**."}}
