This also, in a way, presents the overall mood of a particular location in relation to the topic at hand.","ea78dbba":"We can see that United States has the most amount of unverified users. India on the other hand has fair amount of verified users. Does this say anything about the fake news narrative which often propogates media these days especially in the US? *Food for thought*","051f43f0":"Following the same hypothesis of verified accounts and user followers.

The number of followers keep descreasing with the increase in the number of followers. So to put it simply, majority of the twitter users have followers in the range upto 2000.","dd493220":"Lets see how the data looks like and the shape of the dataset.","2fbbaa7a":"The tweets were made from 26920 unique places. Could that really be the place ? Seems unlikely. Considering the internet connectivity and access to social media platforms like twitter, this number looks fairly exaggerated. Assuming, each location only mentions the COUNTRY the tweet was made from, having these many countries doesn't make sense.

This will prove convenient while aggregating values with respect to dates.","bd6c5272":"In this section, we will see how the account verification status of the user making the tweet relates to the location. This will help us to understand what country\/location has been making most of the tweets and how many of them are verified.

Let us continue the exploration","084ba859":"We can observe some periodicity in terms of peaks and troughs of interest shown by people in terms of number of tweets made. Given the bulk of hashtags made in relation to COVID19, it would be safe to assume that majority of the tweets would have been made in relation the same topic. However, we can confirm this hypothesis during multivariate analysis. We can see that 25th July has the highest number of tweets and August 7th has the least number of tweets. This was the period where WHO and other major health institutions were discovering new symptoms and behviour of this deadly virus. Follwed by new preventive measures etc. This would have subsequently spiked people's interests and hence the spikes in the number of tweets. ","d65fc6ba":"The boxplot for `user_friends` shows similar properties to that of `user_followers`. The distribution looks extremely right skewed with IQR roughly ranging between 100+ to 1.7K. let us do the same operations to this column as well to see the effects of limiting the number of user friends.","d640b9d0":"# Introduction\n\n\"*Fake news spreads 6 times faster on Social Media*\". A line from the recent Netflix special \"*The Social Dilemma*\" that caught my attention. The social media, the likes of Twitter,Facebook etc, has a fair share of opinionated, silent consumers, trolls, objective individuals, hate mongerers and the list never ends. The recent outbreak of coronovirus (COVID19) has led us to witness the most unprecedented of times. While, the world was grappling with these turbulent times of a pandemic, Twitterati tweeted away with news, facts, myths, opinions,etc. This notebook is an attempt to understand the various aspects of these tweets. The Notebook also attempts to explore the hypothesis of genuinity and the legitimacy of these tweets by understanding various parameters like User location, Verified users, number of followers, friends, favorites, number of retweets and several other parameters.\n\n<hr \/>","8d4ef438":"We can see that most of the verified users make use of Twitter Web App and Tweet Deck(which is generally made use by users having multiple twitter accounts. eg. Media houses, etc.). Additionally, Twitter for Android is used as the source by most of the unverified accounts. ","0cf4a40d":"But, is it totally cleaned ? If not all the hastags, atleast the COVID related hastags ? The answer is NO. we can still see duplicate counts and entries for the same covid19 hashtag. We need to minimise this repition and bring it down to a smaller number of varying versions of the COVID hashtag.

Also what's interesting to note is that there are 7 times as many **unverified** accounts as verified accounts putting out information\/opinion during the pandemic season. This should potentially raise concerns on the legitimacy of the information contained in these tweets as most of the information is emanating from unverified sources.","d0912e77":"### Analyzing numerical columns in the dataset\n\n","166bea18":"We will just be seeing the variation and distribution of the top 10 sources for better understanding and convenience.","7aae4044":"We perform the same actions for the remaining 2 numerical columns `user_friends` and `user_favourites`","938ad346":"Let us perform time series analysis and understand the trends with respect to the duration of the tweets made.\n\nThe `date` column is of object datatype.

","aba01c82":"In this section we will see how the relationship between the verified user and user followers has changed with time. ","b09c4869":"The IQR does shift a bit more towards the right. However, the overall distribution still looks heavily right skewed with many outliers considering the fence values and IQR values. However in this case, there are too many values outside the deemed area to be termed as outliers. These values can add extra value to the analysis. We keep them as it is for now.

It has website URL's, country names, state names belonging to the same country, which otherwise would not be considered a unique location if we are only considering the country as the unique location. However, we will only be using the top few locations to understand the distribution of tweet `user_location`.","58b5ec93":"With this, the EDA of the tweets made during the pandemic comes to an end. We have explored fairly the relationships and discussed various aspects. we have seen how information spreads and how the different variables play their part in spreading the information. This wasnt the cleanest of data. We have done very basic and preliminary cleaning for the sake of EDA and a more detailed cleaning exercise needs to be carried out on the dataset in order to perform unsupervised learning on them in order to find more patterns and trends.","9fee5262":"We can see a similar pattern here as well.

Unverified users have around 1800 user favorites with a total of 156k retweets. However, the verified users have 1500 user favorites with a meagre 23K retweets only. we can see why fake information tends to propogate faster(this is totally made under the assumption that unverified accounts generally make disinformed posts).
