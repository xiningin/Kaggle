This was expected as these columns refer to very similar things.\n\nIn this case, I am going to examine further the variables that are affecting the price. From the heatmap above none of the numerical values seem to have a high correlation with the proce. Therefore, the next step will will to understand whether the price is affected by the categorical values (neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room_type). However, before that I want to see what the expected valiability of the price is."}}
