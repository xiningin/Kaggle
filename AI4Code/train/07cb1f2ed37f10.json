I also found it very interesting just how many different games were released for the Nintendo DS console (over 2100 games!) with some being released around 2014, despite the console originally releasing in 2004. \n\nNintendo outselling its competitors globally was no surprise, but it was interesting seeing just out much it's able to outsell the others was fascinating. As a fan of Nintendo games since I was a child, I can't wait to see just how far Nintendo can progress in the upcoming years.
