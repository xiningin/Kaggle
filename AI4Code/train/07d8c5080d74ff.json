First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also lets you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n\n# More practice!\n___\n\nDo any other columns in this dataframe have inconsistent data entry?

(Can you believe it's already been five days??) Today, we're going to learn how to clean up inconsistent text entries. To get started, click the blue \"Fork Notebook\" button in the upper, right hand corner. This will create a private copy of this notebook that you can edit and play with. Once you're finished with the exercises, you can choose to make your notebook public to share with others. :)\n\n> **Your turn!** As we work through this notebook, you'll see some notebook cells (a block of either code or text) that has \"Your Turn!\" written in it. These are exercises for you to do to help cement your understanding of the concepts we're talking about. Once you've written the code to answer a specific question, you can run the code by clicking inside the cell (box with code in it) with the code you want to run and then hit CTRL + ENTER (CMD + ENTER on a Mac). You can also click in a cell and then click on the right \"play\" arrow to the left of the code. If you want to run all the code in your notebook, you can use the double, \"fast forward\" arrows at the bottom of the notebook editor.\n\nHere's what we're going to do today:\n\n* [Get our environment set up](#Get-our-environment-set-up)\n* [Do some preliminary text pre-processing](#Do-some-preliminary-text-pre-processing)\n* [Use fuzzy matching to correct inconsistent data entry](#Use-fuzzy-matching-to-correct-inconsistent-data-entry)\n\n\nLet's get started!","2d896200":"We can see that two of the items in the cities are very close to \"d.i khan\": \"d. i khan\" and \"d.i khan\". We can also see the \"d.g khan\", which is a seperate city, has a ratio of 88. Since we don't want to replace \"d.g khan\" with \"d.i khan\", let's replace all rows in our City column that have a ratio of > 90 with \"d. i khan\". \n\nTo do this, I'm going to write a function. (It's a good idea to write a general purpose function you can reuse if you think you might have to do a specific task more than once or twice. This keeps you from having to copy and paste code too often, which saves time and can help prevent mistakes.)","5c540669":"Just looking at this, I can see some problems due to inconsistent data entry: 'Lahore' and 'Lahore ', for example, or 'Lakki Marwat' and 'Lakki marwat'.\n\nThe first thing I'm going to do is make everything lower case (I can change it back at the end if I like) and remove any white spaces at the beginning and end of cells. Inconsistencies in capitalizations and trailing white spaces are very common in text data and you can fix a good 80% of your text data entry inconsistencies by doing this.","2087d307":"It does look like there are some remaining inconsistencies: 'd. i khan' and 'd.i khan' should probably be the same. (I [looked it up](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_most_populous_cities_in_Pakistan) and 'd.g khan' is a seperate city, so I shouldn't combine those.) \n\nI'm going to use the [fuzzywuzzy](https:\/\/github.com\/seatgeek\/fuzzywuzzy) package to help identify which string are closest to each other. This dataset is small enough that we could probably could correct errors by hand, but that approach doesn't scale well. (Would you want to correct a thousand errors by hand? What about ten thousand? Automating things as early as possible is generally a good idea. Plus, it\u2019s fun! :)\n\n> **Fuzzy matching:** The process of automatically finding text strings that are very similar to the target string. In general, a string is considered \"closer\" to another one the fewer characters you'd need to change if you were transforming one string into another. So \"apple\" and \"snapple\" are two changes away from each other (add \"s\" and \"n\") while \"in\" and \"on\" and one change away (rplace \"i\" with \"o\"). You won't always be able to rely on fuzzy matching 100%, but it will usually end up saving you at least a little time.\n\nFuzzywuzzy returns a ratio given two strings. The closer the ratio is to 100, the smaller the edit distance between the two strings. Here, we're going to get the ten strings from our list of cities that have the closest distance to \"d.i khan\".","1ad23b52":"Next we're going to tackle more difficult inconsistencies.","96307b72":"# Use fuzzy matching to correct inconsistent data entry\n___\n\nAlright, let's take another look at the city column and see if there's any more data cleaning we need to do."}}
