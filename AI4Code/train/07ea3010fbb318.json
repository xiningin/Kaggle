We use the cosine similarity score since it is independent of magnitude and is relatively easy and fast to calculate (especially when used in conjunction with TF-IDF scores, which will be explained later). Mathematically, it is defined as follows :\n\n![](https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dyd911kmh\/image\/upload\/f_auto,q_auto:best\/v1590782185\/cos_aalkpq.png)\n\nSince you have used the TF-IDF vectorizer, calculating the dot product between each vector will directly give you the cosine similarity score. Therefore, you will use sklearn's linear_kernel() instead of cosine_similarities() since it is faster.","ecb32351":"**Let\u2019s start coding up our own Movie recommendation system**","72e759f6":"# **Introduction**\n**What is a Recommendation System?**\n\nSimply put a Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict the \u201crating\u201d or \u201cpreference\u201d of a user towards a domain-specific item or item. In our case, this domain-specific item is a movie, therefore the main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/editor.analyticsvidhya.com\/uploads\/88506recommendation%20system.png)\n\n\n**Content-Based Filtering** \n\nsuggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person likes a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. And to recommend that, it will make use of the user's past item metadata. A good example could be YouTube, where based on your history, it suggests you new videos that you could potentially watch."}}
