once boarded the ferry between Mauritania and Senegal through the Rosso border crossing will grow when it reopens, one of the few active points of entry (POEs) between the two countries. \n\n\u201cIn normal circumstances we saw about 100 crossings a day, mainly Mauritanians and Senegalese joining their families or going to work,\u201d one border officer said.\n\n\u201cBut, with the travel restrictions in response to COVID-19, and fewer crossings available, between 200 and 350 people were crossing here every day before it was closed. People wanted to go home or leave Senegal, which has recorded cases of COVID-19.\u201d \n\nThe impact of the pandemic is being felt in communities from the banks of the Senegal River in this vast desert nation in northwest Africa, to the border country in Southeast Asia. Here, and in a dozen other points around the globe, IOM is applying decades of experience in border management and migration health to empower local authorities, residents and migrants to address and mitigate the spread of the virus and prepare for the future.https:\/\/www.africanews.com\/2020\/04\/01\/coronavirus-mauritania-holding-the-line-border-officials-mobilize-against-covid-19-with-international-organization-for-migrations-iom-support\/ ","39c9ed55":"#Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs\n\nThe first confirmed COVID-19 was registered in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania on 13 March 2020. As of 30 June, 4,363 confirmed cases were registered, including 1,280 recoveries and 129 deaths. On June 15, the Ministerial Committee in charge of the fight against the coronavirus decided on to adopt a new health strategy based on intensified screening. The deployment of the community watch and surveillance system was carried out by the Ministries of Health and Youth. From now on, 1,175 young people cover the 47 health areas in Nouakchott.\n\nIn accordance with the INFORM COVID-19 Risk Index, Mauritania shows high health and humanitarian impacts risks from COVID-19 that could overwhelm current national response capacity, and therefore lead to a need for additional international assistance.

For some, but not all vaccines, a defined threshold of specific antibody levels has been correlated with protection. However, this does not definitively tell us if a person is fully protected against disease. If good immune memory has been established, a large rise in antibody levels occurs following a booster dose of vaccine.https:\/\/www.immune.org.nz\/vaccines\/efficiency-effectiveness#:~:text=Vaccine%20efficacy%20and%20effectiveness%20are,use%20in%20the%20general%20population.","c8355279":"#No vaccine is 100% effective.\n\nTo make vaccines safer than the disease, the bacteria or virus is killed or weakened (attenuated). For reasons related to the individual, not all vaccinated persons develop immunity. Most routine childhood vaccines are effective for 85% to 95% of recipients. Second, in a country such as the United States the people who have been vaccinated vastly outnumber those who have not.\nhttps:\/\/www.who.int\/vaccine_safety\/initiative\/detection\/immunization_misconceptions\/en\/index2.html#:~:text=First%2C%20no%20vaccine%20is%20100,%25%20to%2095%25%20of%20recipients.","7d8b88b7":"#Statistics\n\nTotal population (2016)\t4,301,000\n\nGross national income per capita (PPP international $, 2013)\t2,850\n\nLife expectancy at birth m\/f (years, 2016)\t63\/65\n\nProbability of dying under five (per 1 000 live births, 2018)\t76\n\nProbability of dying between 15 and 60 years m\/f (per 1 000 population, 2016)\t224\/181\n\nTotal expenditure on health per capita (Intl $, 2014)\t148\n\nTotal expenditure on health as per cent of GDP (2014) 3.8","9d41dbd5":"#Duration of immunity provided by vaccines\n\nThe duration of immunity varies with different diseases and different vaccines. Lifelong immunity is not always provided by either natural infection (getting the disease) or vaccination. The recommended timing of vaccine doses aims to achieve the best immune protection to cover the period in life when vulnerability to the disease is highest.\n\nMany vaccines used today are relatively new and data concerning the length of time that they give protection is continually being updated.For many diseases immunity wanes following natural infection.\n\nThe duration of immunity provided by vaccines varies depending on a range of factors, particularly the vaccine itself. Live vaccines generally induce longer lived immunity than sub unit vaccines. Sub unit vaccines frequently require primary courses and boosters. Polysaccharide vaccines do not generate long-lived memory cells.\n\nIf the interval between doses is too short the duration of immunity can be affected. \u2013 Hence minimum intervals are required. In the very young and very old the duration of immunity can be limited. https:\/\/www.immune.org.nz\/vaccines\/efficiency-effectiveness#:~:text=Vaccine%20efficacy%20and%20effectiveness%20are,use%20in%20the%20general%20population.","09066664":"#Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness\n\nVaccine efficacy and effectiveness are measures that compare the rates of disease between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Efficacy is measured in controlled clinical trials, whereas effectiveness is measured once the vaccine is approved for use in the general population. From these we can identify the proportion of vaccinated people we would expect to be protected by the vaccine.\n\nHerd immunity (also called community immunity) is an important mechanism by which the larger community is protected. For some diseases, if enough people are immune then transmission of the disease is reduced or eliminated. This is particularly so for diseases such as rubella and pneumococcal disease. High vaccine coverage must be maintained in order to prevent the disease re-entering the population.\n\nNo vaccine is 100% effective, a small percentage of people are not protected after vaccination and for others the protection may wane over time. Also, some people are unable to be vaccinated due to certain conditions such as immune suppression. Maintaining immunity in those around these people protects them from disease.https:\/\/www.immune.org.nz\/vaccines\/efficiency-effectiveness#:~:text=Vaccine%20efficacy%20and%20effectiveness%20are,use%20in%20the%20general%20population.","cfdf862c":"#Code from Kshitij Mohan https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kshitijmohan\/wine-recommendation-system-based-on-bert\/comments"}}
