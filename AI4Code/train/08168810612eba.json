We infer that Students have a higher need for financing due to student loans and have generally lower personal income (which will be seen later in the analysis). Moreover, we could presume that students tend to have less control over their finances and their financial flexibility may be lower. ","68923f4f":"Income is negatively related to balance which could be interpreted in the sense that the higher the Income, the lower the need to access loans. \n\nStudent has an expected positive impact. Similarly, these results are consistent with Age.

This assumption was made as a result of the Cards variable which refers to the number of credit cards owned by a person and has only one associated Balance figure.\n* The Balance is calculated as the highest amount incurred on a credit card in a given month. For example if a cardholder spends \\$400, \\$500, and \\$600 over the course of three months, and each month pays the balance in full, the average balance will be recorded as \\$500 (i.e. any preliminary balances before the maximum are not taken into account, neither is the final balance of zero).","c390f8ef":"> ## Logistic Regression \n\nIn order to determine the factors that influence whether a card owner is an active credit card user, a logistic regression can be fit.

This will be investigated at a later point in the analysis. \n\nThe Student variable should be closely examined at this point.","5981773f":"> ## Interactions Between Predictors\n\nAn interaction term could be considered between Income and Rating. This stems from the assumption that there could be a synergy between Income and Rating; that individuals with increased levels of Income and high credit Rating will have a higher level of financial control and stability.","7be85e65":"The interaction between Gender and Cards is significant with a high coefficient, which demonstrates that Females who own more Cards have on average higher Balance. In this dataset we make the assumption that the Balance is recorded per person and not per credit card, implying that the balance recorded is calculated as an average across all the cards belonging to the same individual. While owning more credit Cards suggests in itself higher financing needs (perhaps the multiple cards offer different benefits), the relation with Gender is worth noting. We should also mention the fact that Gender in isolation has a negative impact on Balance, suggesting that females, in general, have less credit card debt, except when that individual also owns multiple Cards.

As previously stated, non-active users could be individuals who make use of other credit cards, yet we do not have access to such data. ","48af4227":"Based on the correlation matrix, Balance appears correlated with Limit, Rating, and moderately correlated with Income. In addition, Limit and Rating are highly correlated with each other, and they both have a relationship with Income. \n\nHowever, this matrix does not confirm whether the correlation coefficients are statistically significant, hence further investigation is necessary.","a413abde":"> ## Project Goal\n\nThe goal of this exercise is to analyze a dataset consisting of information from 400 credit card holders and to comprehend which factors influence the Credit Card Balance of a cardholder and to predict the average Balance of a given individual. Such an exercise could be conducted as part of a customer analysis within a credit card company. The results of the analysis could determine which customers present a risk of credit default, or what the expected consumer behavior of prospective customers will be. In addition, combining the credit Balance data with information such as credit Limit can assist in calculating the credit utilization of a card, information which feeds into a cardholder's credit Rating.   \n\nFor this goal, a multivariable regression analysis will be undertaken. The exercise will begin with an exploratory data analysis of the dataset, followed by feature selection and regression analysis, including linear and logistic regression. Lastly, the regression model created will be employed to simulate a new dataset and predict the credit Balance of cardholders given their demographic information. ","9a9968e4":"> ## Non-linear Relationships","81859e27":"The model has a superior fit for the Active customers dataset. This points to the hypothesis that perhaps the non-active customers are driven by some reason other than the ones present in our variables. Since they rarely make use of their credit card, it is difficult to draw conclusions. Perhaps they, in fact, have credit card debt, yet we do not have the relevant data, potentially their credit card is provided by a different company. An alternative explanation could be that the card owners maintain a zero-balance card in order to decrease their credit utilization and boost their credit rating, assuming they also own a positive balance credit card elsewhere. \n\nWe could exclude the variables which yield a high p-value from the model. Nevertheless, these variables could have an interaction with other variables and might still be significant.\n\nWe continue by fitting a model with only the variables that proved significant, yet as part of the analysis, we will return to examining the other variables. ","2162a3f2":"Now all the variables are significant, but the R-squared has, in fact, decreased. \n\nThe potential relationships among these 4 variables should be analyzed.","40b38398":"Lastly, the model can be utilized in order to predict the credit card Balance of future customers given their demographic information. For this purpose, a dataset has been generated.","352bc0b0":"Similarly, credit Rating is a highly accurate predictor of Balance. This could suggest that individuals with high Rating are more willing to incur credit debt as they are confident that they will be able to pay off the balance. Nevertheless, Rating is a complex variable, related to other predictors such as Income. ","af9d9646":"As expected, we notice a positive relationship between Income and Rating. This could be explained by the fact that credit Rating is a score assigned to individuals based on their creditworthiness, including the level of personal Income. \n\nFurthermore, as we predicted earlier, Students display lower values of Income compared to non-Students. \n\nSurprisingly, in this dataset, the Income does not Increase with Age, and the Age of Students compared to non-Students does not differ significantly. This observation could lead us to be concerned about the data quality or to seek further attributes of this population to conduct additional investigation. Nonetheless, given the simulated nature of this dataset additional inquiries are not feasible, yet it is worth noting that on a different population, we expect a stronger relationship among Age, Student, and Income. \n\nWe will now closer examine Balance and Income for Students and non-Students. Since we are interested in how Balance behaves, we will only take into account non-zero Balances.","a76d2c4b":"We observe a positive relationship between Balance and Income for non-Students, however, in the case of Students, changes in Income do not impact their average credit card Balance. A further step would be to fit a regression model on non-Students only and observe Balance. For Students, the line appears to behave differently in 3 sections, so perhaps a Spline model might be appropriate. However, the sample size of Students is not large enough (no. of observations = 40) for the results to add significant value to the overall analysis.\n\nAn interesting observation is that the regression analysis showed that Income was negatively related to Balance, yet this figure appears to show a positive relationship. We should verify whether the relationship is in fact non-linear.","56628df7":"> ## Describing the target of inference","ff69221f":"Limit and Rating are highly correlated, introducing multi-colinearity in the model. More specifically, Rating as an antecedent of Limit is more meaningful for the model because it also drives Limit levels for card owners. Therefore, if one of the two should be removed to fix collinearity issues, Limit has a lower priority for the model. Finally, it is pertinent to note that both Limit and Rating are complex measures, subsuming a range of other factors, among which several already present in the model, such as Education or Income. \n\nFor clarity, the analysis will focus less on Rating and Limit, and more on those measures representing more direct indicators of credit profiling. \n\nWe will now examine the categorical variables and their relationship to balance.

Additionally, while Income has a negative impact on Balance, Income squared has a slightly positive impact. We expect Balance to have a negative slope initially, and a positive one at higher levels of Income. We can plot this relationship.","0a1fcade":"After visually examining the predictors and their relationship with Balance, regression models can be fit using those predictors. feature selection will be used to determine which combination of variables best predicts credit card Balance. \n\nGiven the choice of 9 predictors, the initial model could include all of them. Yet, as previously noted, due to potential collinearity issues, Limit will be eliminated. \n\nThe Ordinary Least Square algorithm is used to create the linear regression model.","94239e19":"After investigating polynomial relationships and interaction among terms, the last part of the analysis will focus on finding the best model and using it to predict credit card Balance for a generated sample of individuals. The purpose of this exercise is to employ the model and make inferences on the target variable, given a set of predictors. In other words, if an individual applies for a credit card, this model will predict an average credit card balance given the demographic factors (i.e. Income, Age, Rating). The information can be further utilized to estimate the risk of credit default or other customer behavior indicators of the given card owner. \n\nFor this part of the analysis, we will focus separately on the active and non-active samples of the population. \n\nThe best performing model so far on the entire sample included a polynomial relationship between Income and Balance and an interaction term between Income and Rating. ","5915715d":"We continue by examining Gender and number of credit Cards.","25e9b0a2":"In the case of the active user population, neither non-linear relationships nor interaction among variables displayed low p-values. Nevertheless, other variables might explain the variance in Balance, such as Limit or Cards.","e69d6ffc":"While neither Married nor Age by themselves are significant, the interaction term is. This reveals the fact that individuals with higher values for Age who are also Married have lower credit card Balances pointing to higher financial prudence or risk aversion. We can visualize this relationship.","516cf36d":"Student appears to be the only predictor to influence the distribution of Balance. To verify, the same relationships can be analyzed on the active-only sample of the population. ","e2705647":"Interestingly, while education did not appear significant at first, it does interact with Income, with a positive effect. Moreover, in this model Education itself seems marginally significant, meaning that the longer the time spent in education, the lower the Balance and the more financially cautious an individual is. Yet the effect reverses at high levels of Income and Education were highly educated high earning individuals appear to have higher needs for financing.  \n\nLet us consider further interactions, such as the one between Married and Age.","eda13223":"It can be noticed that a large portion of the sample consists of Zero Balance Cards. Therefore there are 2 potential questions that can be answered:\n* Does an individual have a positive average credit card Balance? \n* If yes, what is the magnitude of the average Balance?\n\nThis is an important distinction because, if the average credit card Balance for a given individual is zero, we conclude that the person does not make use of that credit card. As a credit card company, we may be interested in knowing the average balance across our frequent users (for instance, to identify those at risk of default), and the zero Balances may skew our results. \n\nWe can create an additional data frame which only contains the observations with a positive Balance. ","952e8c04":"Credit Limit appears to be a strong predictor for credit card Balance. This is an expected finding since we assume that a card owner is not allowed to have a Balance that exceeds their Limit. Consequently, this relationship simply articulates that, the higher the credit Limit, the greater the credit card expenses are for a given individual, and hence the insightfulness of this relationship is debatable.
