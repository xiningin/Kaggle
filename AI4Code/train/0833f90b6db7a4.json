Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that act as filters along the lymph fluid channels.\nAs lymph fluid leaves the breast and eventually goes back into the bloodstream, the lymph nodes try to catch and trap cancer\ncells before they reach other parts of the body. Having cancer cells in the lymph nodes under your arm suggests an increased \nrisk of the cancer spreading.In our data it is axillary nodes detected(0\u201352).","fbc10408":"# Exploratory Data Analysis\n* Univariate analysis --> PDF, CDF, Boxplot, ViolinPlot\n* Bivariate Analysis -->Pair Plot, Scatter Plot\n* Multivariate Analysis--> Contours","69e8ea94":"Dataset contains no null values.","25fedb80":"# UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS-","6c07c059":"# BIVARIATE ANALYSIS-","ee08277a":"# Checking for the Null Values-","a96bc9be":"# CONCLUSIONS-","b17c4122":"# THANKS FOR GOING THROUGH THIS NOTEBOOK.","5397f523":"# Steps to perform EDA-\n* Load the data\n* Read the dataset\n* Analyse","c6c428b1":"* Data is heavily imabalanced so we need to perform upsampling for modeling\n* Data is not linearly seperable.\n* Women between age 30-83 are suffering from breast Cancer.\n* Maximum women are suffering from cancer at the age of 52 and 54.\n* Likelyhood of women suffering from the cancer is decreasing after women Cross the age 72.","a9dcd218":"# OBSERVATIONS-","c05c2ae6":"Observations-\nPatient Age & Axil_nodes are two important factors to decide whether the patient will survive for more than 5 years or not.\nWe can use line\/If else statement to define.\nif Axil_nodes<=5:\n     print('Patient is likely to survive')","ba2f7a94":"\n* Patient's Age & auxilary nodes are two important factors to decide whether the patient will survive or not.\n* A patient is likely to survive if her auxilary nodes  is below 5.\n* As the auxilary nodes  increases the probability of women surviving becomes low.\n* There are negligible chances of women to survive if its auxilary nodes  is above 25.\n* Women is more likely to die in the age between 45-55.","ac811353":"Observation-\n* Mostly women are suffering from cancer at the age of 52.\n* Trend is decreasing after Women Cross the age of 72\nwomen between age 30-83 suffering from breast Cancer.\n* Dataset is unbalanced."}}
