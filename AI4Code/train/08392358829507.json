According to the BBC, the fall surge might be the result of over-optimistic messaging during the summer. [1] For example, the government ran the Eat Out to Help Out campaign in August, which offered restaurant goers a 50% meal discount on Mondays through Wednesdays and promoted eating out. [2]  The spike in the winter was likely due to the spread of a more infectious variant of the disease. [3]\n\n\n**UK's lockdowns**\n\nThe UK has implemented and experienced 7 phases of COVID-19 response since March 2020. Lockdowns have been imposed in Phase 1 (late March to June 2020), Phase 4 (November 2020), and Phase 6 (Marh 2021 to now). [4]  The UK is currently in Phase 7, which is meant to be the phase exiting out of the lockdown that started in Phase 6. In this phase, the government has used a step system where the restrictions are relaxed step by step. The country has moved on to step three on May 17, which means indoor hospitality venues like restaurants can now open, and more. [5]\n\n**UK's vaccination**\n\nThe UK's vaccine rollout has been mostly successful, with more than a third of the population fully vaccinated, as shown in Section 4. The UK has approved three types of vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna. The UK's vaccines are made in the UK (AstraZeneca), the Netherlands (AstraZeneca), India (AstraZeneca), Belgium (Pfizer), Switzerland (Moderna), and Spain (Moderna). [6]","37886937":"#### 6.
