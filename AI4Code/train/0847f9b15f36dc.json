In this kernel we just tried basic things, I am sure with these data visualization and feature selection methods, you can easily ecxeed the % 95 accuracy. Maybe you can use other classification methods.\n### I hope you enjoy in this kernel\n## If you have any question or advise, I will be apreciate to listen them ...","13b691cc":"* Okey, now we have features but **what does they mean** or actually **how much do we need to know about these features**. ?\n* The answer is that we do not need to know meaning of these features; however, in order to imagine in our mind, we should know something like variance, standart deviation, number of sample (count) or max min values.\n* These types of information help us to understand about what is going on data. For example , the question is appeared in my mind the **area_mean** feature's max value is 2500 and **smoothness_mean** features' max 0.16340. Therefore **do we need standirdization or normalization before visualization, feature selection, feature extraction or classificaiton?** The answer is **yes** and **no**...not surprising ha :) Anyway lets go step by step and start with visualization.

They are exactly similar with previous (selectkBest) method. Therefore we do not need to calculate accuracy again. Shortly, we can say that we make good features selection with rfe and selectkBest methods. However as you can see there is a problem, okey I except we find best 5 features with two different methods and these features are same but why it is **5**. Maybe if we use best 2 or best 15 features we will have better accuracy.
