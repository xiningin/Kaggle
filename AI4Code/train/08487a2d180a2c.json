understood a lot by referring to some kernels and following their way of solving a problem.I'm grateful for what I've learnt and ready to start solving problems.\nSo, take a look at my first kernel and let me know how did you find it,what else I can do to improve my analysing skills and some suggestions to make it better.\n\nThanks!*"}}
