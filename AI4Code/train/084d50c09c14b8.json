Session Length will lead to an increase in $25.981550 in Yearly Amount Spent, and similarly for the other features\n\nSo as Time on App is a much more significant factor than Time on Website, the company has a choice: they could either focus all the attention into the App as that is what is bringing the most money in, or they could focus on the Website as it is performing so poorly!\n","27f54916":"\n# Step 5: Evaluate and Validate the Model \n\nEvaluation metrics are a measure of how good a model performs and how well it approximates the relationship. Let us look at MSE, MAE, and RMSE.\n\n***Mean Squared Error (MSE)***\n\nThe most common metric for regression tasks is MSE. It has a convex shape. It is the average of the squared difference between the predicted and actual value. Since it is differentiable and has a convex shape, it is easier to optimize.\n\nMSE penalizes large errors. \n\n\n\n***Mean Absolute Error (MAE)***\n\nThis is simply the average of the absolute difference between the target value and the value predicted by the model. Not preferred in cases where outliers are prominent. \n\n\nMAE does not penalize large errors.\n\n***Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)***\n\nIt is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are; RMSE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit. Root mean square error is commonly used in climatology, forecasting, and regression analysis to verify experimental results.\n","ec85fe2d":"**Import required libraries**","ce1e8563":"\n# Step 3: Splitting the Data\n\nLet's split the data into training and testing data.

Coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship between a predictor variable and the response variable.\n\n* A positive sign indicates that as the predictor variable(y )increases, the response variable(X) also increases.\n* A negative sign indicates that as the predictor variable(y) increases, the response variable(x) decreases.","b7652c0b":"**Meet and Greet Data**\n\nThis is the meet and greet step.
