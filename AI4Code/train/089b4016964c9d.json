Designation and Grade plots are exactly the same, explaining the grades of the designation.\n\n2. Sales executives leave the job most, followed by sr. sales executive : \n    for this the reason can be as follows:\n    1. Sales Executives and Sr. Sales executives are at employee grade, they are not at a managerial post. \n    2. Both of these grades are maybe in search of an opportunity providing some manegerial work.\n    3. As we go towards more managerial part of the company, attrition amount decreases.\n    \n3. Gender wise attrition is widely unbalanced, 5.5% Females and 94.5% males leave the job:\n    Some reasons for this can be as follows:\n    1. Maybe there is a very unbalanced gender ratio among the people working in the company.\n    2. Or Females are more prone to work in an organisation without changing it, i.e. they crave for stability of job.\n\n4. Educatin wise attrition is widely unbalanced too, 94.5% B.Tech, 5.5% MBA Graduates\n    Some reasons for it can be as follows:\n    1. MBA Graduates usually go to the manegerial jobs, i.e. the jobs with higher manegerial grades, and as their attrition is low, thus MBA grads are less prone to attrition.\n    2. B tech graduates, are freshers, they seek for growth and opportunity, which they get when the make a switch, thus, they opt for more attrition.\n\n5. Last Rating wise attrition shows that the people who were rated good according to their work, are more prone to attrition.\n    Reasons for it can be as follows:\n    1. Those who are rated good, are more prone to make a switch as they consider themselves suitable for a better position.\n    2. But the ones who are exceptionally rated 5 i.e. best are less prone to attrition, reason can be that they have started liking their job, thus are great at work and having good ratings.\n6. Marital Status does not give a good insight of the matter, we have to dig deep into it for better insights\n7. Zone wise distribution, gives a good insight of attrition, stating that South Zone constitutes to 30.6% of attrition, followed by North zone, constituting, 22% of total attrition. Thus for finding the reason behind we have to dig deep into it\n8. Remarks column indicated that, 'issues with manager' is the reason given by most for attrition, followed by 'lack of growth' which was intuitive as many who left the job, were rated 4\/5 thus being capable they would search for better position which was might not have been possible in the past situation when the were employees.","3e297679":"> Engagement Score (% Satisfaction)","54cf8be7":"# Exploratory Data Analysis","423f3ed6":"Removing duplicacy from columns ","333ac87e":"From above screen, it is clear that we are having following columns as categorical\n\n**Designation, \n Grade,\n Location,\n Gender,\n Education,\n Last Rating,\n Martial Status,\n Zone,\n Remarks**","5f6c3548":"> Feature: Grade"}}
