Elo aimed to reduce marketting that is irrelevant to members and offer them custom-tailored promotions, thereby providing an enjoyable experience and beneficial service. To that end, Elo launched a Kaggle competition, enlisting the Kaggle community's help, to produce a machine learning model that can find signal between trasaction data and loyalty. Such a model will help Elo gauge customer loyalty and how promotional strategies affect it.\n\n**The data provided is simulated and fictitious.

The aribtrary features were not very useful as they did not provide much signal in predicting loyalty scores.\n\n**test data** table contained the same arbitrary features as **train data** and card_id but did not contain loyalty scores.\n\n**historical transactions** contained details on purchases made by all the cardholders in the dataset. Details included purchase amount, merchant category, etc. Every card_id had atleaset 3 months of records.\n\n**new merchant transactions** contained transaction data from new merchants the cardholder had not yet purchased from in the historical transaction data. Every card_id had upto two months of new merchant data after a reference date (which differed for each card_id).\n\n**merchants** contained details on merchants seen in **historical transactions** and **new merchant transactions**\n\n\nThe data was heavily anonymized. Non-numerical data such as city of purchase and merchant category were reassigned with arbitrary value so it is difficult to connect real world knowledge and find insights.\n\n\n\n","5aae70d8":"### Linear Regression <a class='anchor' id='linear-regression'><\/a>","36d332a9":"## Feature Engineering<a class='anchor' id='feature-engineering'><\/a>","19c99240":"There are 201,917 card ids in the training data set.\n\nThere are 123,623 card ids in the test data.
