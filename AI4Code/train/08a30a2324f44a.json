It seems the PassengerId column is intended to be the row index so I will change it accordingly.\n\nSurvived would be better represented as a 'bool' type as we have only two possible values for the column: True (1) or False (0).","d127edee":"Along with correcting the spellings in the CSV file, I went ahead and made the following changes:\n<ul>\n<li>Deleted ANNE ROOSIPOLD and LEA OTS from the CSV file. They are not even present in the original dataset, which leads me to believe that while they were recorded in the crew list, they were not actually present onboard the ship when it sank.<\/li>\n<li>Added JURI AAVIK, SIRJE KANTER, and SUSANNE PUNDI to the CSV file. They are listed as crewmembers in the original dataset but were not present in the Estline crew list. I checked the <i>Estonia disaster<\/i> blog and they were either off-duty or trainees, and were not recorded in the Estline crew list. Going forward, I am including the off-duty crewmembers as part of the total crew count.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","c75b21f6":"Now when I search by index 712, I am given PassengerId 712.","83a49063":"So after correcting the spellings to match the original dataset, who's left? I will use my function I created earlier to merge the 'passenger_df_crew' dataframe with the corrected CSV file.","fd1e97d9":"<a id='intro'><\/a>\n## Introduction\n\nIn the early morning of September 28, 1994 just shortly after midnight, the seafaring vessel <i>MS Estonia<\/i> sank into the Baltic Sea amidst poor weather conditions. Passengers scrambled to the deck for their only chance at survival, but ultimately many met their fate trapped in the cabins as the ship capsized. Out of the 989 people (of which 803 were listed as passengers) onboard the ship, there were 852 deaths and 137 survivors.\n\nIn this analysis, I will be exploring the correlation between surviving the disaster (dependent variable) in relation to the person's age, gender and whether they were a crewmember or passenger (independent variables).\n\nWas age a factor in survival? Did a greater proportion of crewmembers survive the disaster than passengers? These questions I will attempt to answer with my analysis. This dataset was provided by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/christianlillelund\/passenger-list-for-the-estonia-ferry-disaster\">Christian Lillelund at Kaggle<\/a>.","96a4e7c7":"With those crew list changes made, what does the count look like now?","993622ad":"Next, I want to add the column Fullname to 'passenger_df' in order to make the comparison and merge with 'crew_df' easier.","45898353":"Next, I need to filter the dataset to display only people categorized as 'C' for 'Crewmember'. I placed the filtered results in a new dataframe called 'passenger_df_crew'.\n\nI also defined a new function to filter out dataframe rows by category and return the filtered dataframe.","68ba3e1f":"As expected, when I use index 711, I am given PassengerId 712.","886b2db9":"<a id='crewcorrect'><\/a>\n### Crew List Correction","e254036a":"The mean age is about 34.01 years old. Median is 32 years old. The modal ages are 21, 23, and 43, with 8 survivors each. The youngest survivor age is 12 years old while the oldest is 67 years old.","83524f69":"The passengers are differentiated by the Category column with the possible values 'C' (Crewmember) or 'P' (Passenger).","4895b262":"There is an almost even distribution of male and female amongst both categories, with Passengers leaning more male (52%) than female (48%) and Crewmembers leaning more female (55%) than male (45%). Next I will determine the total distribution of deceased and survivors by Category.","aabcbce3":"First I will create a histogram based on the total distribution of ages, along with some measures of central tendency. I defined the function to keep my histogram style consistent and I am able to set the upper and lower values for the x and y-axis by plugging in the parameters of the function.","447919fa":"We can see that there are 193 crewmembers and 796 passengers on the list. Hold on, didn't I say there were 803 people categorized as passengers in the introduction?\n\nAs it turns out, several sources have conflicting reports on the amount of crewmembers onboard the ship when it sank. This is due to the fact that some crewmembers onboard the ship were either off-duty or just not accounted for, so therefore they were not recorded in the crew list.\n\nThe Joint Accident Investigation Commission of Estonia, Finland, and Sweden released a report in December 1997 that stated there was 186 crewmembers onboard. <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20040626020651\/http:\/\/www.onnettomuustutkinta.fi\/estonia\/chapt04.html#2\">Link<\/a>\n\nEstline, the shipping company that owned the MS Estonia at the time of the sinking, made available the official crew list of the MS Estonia. The list recorded the names of 187 crewmembers and their respective job titles. <a href=\"https:\/\/estline.ee\/en\/munsterroll-crewlist\">Link<\/a>\n\nBesides the official crew list by Estline, I could not locate many other lists detailing the individuals who were part of the crew at the time of the sinking. I stumbled upon a Blogger blog <i>Estonia disaster<\/i> by user \"passante\", which had a crew list that seemed consistent with the official Estline crew list. It also had the job titles listed in English and gave additional context on whether the crewmember was actually off-duty at the time. This list states there were 189 crewmembers onboard. <a href=\"http:\/\/estoniadisaster1994.blogspot.com\/2017\/02\/estonia-crew-list.html\">Link<\/a>\n\nI will have to compare the dataset with the Estline provided crew list and perhaps crosscheck it with the Blogger list as well, then make adjustments to the categorization of the passengers accordingly. I will also add a Fullname column containing the combined first and last names of the passengers to make comparison easier.","59b54585":"To start answering this question, let's look at the distribution of crewmembers and passengers onboard the ship. I created a function row_count to assist with counting rows filtered by column value, and another function find_prop to find the rounded proportion of one value out of the total.","19c05360":"<a id='wrangling'><\/a>\n## Data Wrangling\n\n### General Properties","07ef9879":"<a id='conclusions'><\/a>\n## Conclusions\n\nI found that the average age of the 137 survivors was 34.01 years old, while the average age of the 852 deceased was 46.27 years old. There were no survivors under 12 years old, and none older than 67 years old. There was a downward trend in survivors as age increased in a normal distribution of ages. A greater proportion of crewmembers survived, with 22% of the crew and only 12% of passengers surviving. Furthermore, a greater proportion of males survived in both categories, with 34% of male crewmembers and 19% of male passengers surviving. Only 12% of female crewmembers and 4% of female passengers survived.\n\nMy shortcomings included lack of knowledge of individuals who were able to board the lifeboats\/liferafts deployed to increase chance of survival, and the exact location of individuals and their cabins at the time of the disaster. Since the ship was listing on the starboard side, the individual's cabin being on the port or starboard side could have affected the chances of escaping.","2770cd31":"From the histogram we can see a normal distribution of ages, with the mean age being about 44.58. The median age was 44, which means half of the passengers were older than 44. The youngest passenger was less than a year old, while the oldest passenger was 87 years old. The modal ages are 21 and 45, which means 27 passengers were 21 and 27 passengers were 45.","7cbe2b95":"The mean age is about 46.27 years old. Median is 46.5 years old. The modal ages are 49 and 67 with 24 victims each.

Now we can see the original dataset's spelling of 'PETER TYYR' reflect in my corrected CSV file.","91eb07a8":"Now I want to filter all of the rows that contain NaN for any of the columns. NaN values in the 'Firstname_y' and 'Lastname_y' columns tell me that these are values not found in the CSV file I created but are present in the original dataset.

Additionally I further broke down this distribution of passengers and crewmembers by gender for their respective categories. Since I am filtering rows to meet two criteria, I defined function adv_row_count which just adds a second set of parameters to accommodate the second criteria. I also defined function output_stats to save myself a lot of copy-pasting to output the total counts and proportions.
