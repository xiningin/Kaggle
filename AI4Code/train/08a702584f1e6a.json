Therefore \"any\" should be sum or maximum of probability of 5 types of IH (less than 1) and it isn't needed for training our model.\n\nRather than that, when we train our model to predict whether an image includes IH(and what type is it), we need \"normal\" label which means the image doesn't includes any types of IH.
