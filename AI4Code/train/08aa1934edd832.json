Both the methods work the same and give the same results. \n2. It clearly indicates that despite Family being the most common category, the most installs are for **Communication** and **Social**. ","d24c0a8c":"The 2 tables above give a brief summary of the dataset. \nWe can see the different columns: category, rating, size, installs, etc. \nIt is also evident that only the rating column is numerical since it is the only one with mean values.  \nThe 'top' row in the second table indicates the most common values, which I will dwelve into more later. \nOverall, the factors that seem important to me in terms of its relation to the number of installs are as follows:\n* Category\n* Rating\n* Type: Free or Paid\n* Content Rating\n* Price","3b917d01":"Well, that was a lot of unnecessary code there. To make it simpler, I tried to just sort the data in groups by Cateogry.  I managed to cut down multiple lines of code to just **one** line.","b98615d2":"Above code displays the unique values in the dataset for the installs column. The things to notice are:\n1. The data type is **object**. This needs to be changed to int. *Why?* To create charts and graphs, one field needs to be numerical. \n2. The factors that make it an object type are:\n     * '+' character at the end of every value\n     *  ',' character in each value, separting every 3 digits\n    \nWhat do we do now? We remove the extra characters by just replacing them with nothing. Once we do that, we declare the column astype(int) to convert it to integer.  ","7069721d":"**Ta-Da! **\n\n![Victory Dance](https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/9wcu6Tr1ecmxa\/giphy.gif)\n\nWe have successfully managed to get an *overview* of the factors. \n\nFurther I want to continue to explore the **correlation** of the factors and possibly **apply machine learning** to predict the installs based on these factors. \n\nThis has been my first attempt, and I am hoping to better this analysis and improve the charts in the future! \n\n","e292924e":"![Celebrations](https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3o6EhYpHUWjYmLN8rK\/giphy.gif)\n\n**Voila!** \n\nWe have a clean dataset now. \nWhat do we do now?\nLet's start with making our dependent variable ready. Why is it not ready you may ask? Well, I'll show you how!","58309403":"**Step 1: Understanding the data **\n\nBefore jumping to conclusions and just randomly making graphs it is crucial to first understand the data. This process involves identifying the columns of the table and the kind of respective entries.","d340efdd":"So, obviously. It is evident that Free apps are more popular than the Paid apps. Despite the ratio being about 1:100. \n\nStill, it would be interesting to know how much people tend to pay for the app. Based on the graph, they commonly pay upto **$6.99**. ","3ea61ffa":"**Step 2:  Preprocessing - Cleaning the dataset**\n\nCleaning the dataset effectively is the most crucial step in understanding the data. \nClean data makes analysis more reliable and effective. \nThe first step towards cleaning data is to remove duplicate entries. The summary indicates that the number of unique apps were 9660 while the total entries are 10841. This shows duplication in the dataset which will hinder the reliability of the data. \n","416d0726":"What do we understand from this?\n\nAs indicated in the beginning, the **family** category is the most common category on the app store. \n\nThis does not indicate that it is most preferred by customers. To identify that, I wanted to check out which category has the most likes and which category has the most average likes. \n\nTo do that, there were 2 ways. One is well, ineffecient and involves writing more code but it was a step to learning and the second was just grouping!\n\nSo, for the first method:\n1. Create a DataFrame: Category Name and Total Installs\n2. Loop through each unique category \n3. Filter to get results of just that category\n4. Calculate the sum of installs for those\n5. Make a graph. ","13b97975":"See? Now we have nicely removed the extra characters and are ready to start understanding other variables and their relation to the number of installs.\n**Are you ready for that?**\n\nLet's start with understanding the categories.","b374e121":"Another important factor, is well money. Obviously! Do people pay for the apps? And if they do, then to what extent do they pay? \nThis is possibly an important factor for both: user and developer. It helps to identify how much the developer could earn too. ","068b9de5":"Now that the duplicate entries have been removed, it's time to remove all the empty entries as well. This will give us a clean dataset with ***unique*** and ***complete*** data. ","7ad1edd3":"Finally, it's time to understand the Content Rating of the Apps. This indicates the basic user base as well. The graph shows that the most mean installs is for **Teen**, Content Rating. The other top mean installs are for **Everyone 10+** and **Everyone**","8557c68e":"Moving onto the next factor: **Rating**\n\nAs you would normally expect, higher the ratings, higher the installs. Weirdly the stats show otherwise. It appears that the mean installs are highest of apps with ratings of **4.3** and **4.5**\n\nTo a certain extent this could indicate that a lose corelation between the 2 variables.","afa8ce56":"**Google Play Store: identify the factors affecting the number of installs of an app**\n\nGoogle Play Store has countless apps, about 2.6 million as of December 2018. I am into Mobile Development and this dataset peeked my interest. I needed to identify the factors that lead to higher installs. Isn't that the main goal of any developer? To reach a larger audience? \n\nFor me, technology is a way to reach people, connect with them, provide them with solutions and make daily life simpler and better. \n\n> Marketing without data, is like driving with your eyes closed - Dan Zarella\n\nThis dataset can allow one to understand the data and drive in the right direction, towards the customers. Giving them what they want. \n\n**So let's get started!**\n\n![Get Started](https:\/\/media1.tenor.com\/images\/7dcc0b5a2c64d741b6edd12a88738cf9\/tenor.gif?itemid=4767352)"}}
