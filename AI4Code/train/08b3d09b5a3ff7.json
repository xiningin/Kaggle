Now this command returns the number of distinct values of the target variable.","5acbc0d4":"    Code Descriptions\n    * data.info() - information on datatype, total number of non-null values of each columns\/features and total memory usage\n    * data.describe() - descriptive statistics\n    * data.head() - first 5 rows of the data","5ec3cb85":"Now we have constructed a model to classify whether the given species is setosa or not with 100% accuracy!\n\n**kudos!** \n\n**We have built a model based on decision tree classification.**\n\nWhat we have done here is:\n\n* We have set the threshold based on 150 data.\n* We classified the 150 data based on the threshold. \n\nThis is like answering book back questions. You need to predict those data that has not appeared before. Thats why we have to split the entire data set into two and make use of one to train and other to evaluate. This is an introduction to machine learning and i would come with a new notebook 'Machine learning with Iris' very soon.\n\nYou can also try finding threshold of Petal width and classify whether the species is setosa or not.\n\nWe would here visualize the results of the model\n"}}
