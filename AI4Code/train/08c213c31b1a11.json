Financial market is a dynamic world where investors, speculators, traders, hedgers understand the market by different strategies and use the opportunities to make profit. They may use fundamental, technical analysis, sentimental analysis,etc. to place their bet. As data is growing, many professionals use data to understand and analyse previous trends and predict the future prices to book profit.\n\n**Competition Description:** The dataset provided contains set of features, **feature_{0...129}**,representing real stock market data. \nEach row in the dataset represents a trading opportunity, for which we will be predicting an action value: 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. \nEach trade has an associated weight and resp, which together represents a return on the trade. \nIn the training set, **train.csv**, you are provided a **resp** value, as well as several other **resp_{1,2,3,4}** values that represent returns over different time horizons.\n\nIn **Test set** we don't have **resp** value, and other **resp_{1,2,3,4}** data, so we have to use only **feature_{0...129}** to make prediction.\n\nTrades with **weight = 0** were intentionally included in the dataset for completeness, although such trades **will not** contribute towards the scoring evaluation. So we will ignore it.\n\n**XGBoost Classification** is used here with hyperparamter tuning. Please go through the notebook, I have tried to explain every step.
