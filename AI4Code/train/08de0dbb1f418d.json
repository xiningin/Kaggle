Now discrete sample is something which is not continuous. Discrete meaning a seperate entity. So each sample data with some numerical value which will be a real number, but independent from each other.\n\nSo there are two popular function which gives the probabilistic values of the discrete sample data.\n* PMF (Probability Mass Function): \nPMF is the probability distribution for a discrete random variable. It's a function that assigns a probability for specific discrete values.\n* CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function):\nCDF gives probability of the sample data which is less than or equal to the random variable ","1b497f40":"* Distibution\n    * Poisson Distribution : \nPoisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution which is used when multiple number of events occurr during some given time intervals.\n    * Bernoulli and binomial distributions :\nA Bernouilli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a Bernouilli trial \u2014 a random experiment that has only two outcomes i.e \u201cSuccess\u201d or \u201cFailure\u201d. \n    * Multinoulli and multinomial distributions :\nIt's a discrete probability distribution of the outcomes from a multinomial experiment. It is generalization of the binomial distribution.The multinomial distribution is used to find probabilities in experiments where there are more than two outcomes\n    * Discrete uniform distribution \nIt's a discrete uniform distribution, also known as the \"equally likely outcomes\" distribution. It's symmetric probability distribution wherein a finite number of values are equally likely to be observed; every one of n values has equal probability 1\/n.","93cdfa5d":"# Probabiliy Functions\n1.
