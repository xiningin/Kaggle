In research, you discover that these birds typically spend the summer breeding season in the eastern United States, and then migrate to South America for the winter.  But since this bird is under threat of endangerment, you'd like to take a closer look at the locations that these birds are more likely to visit.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qQcS0KM.png\" width=\"1000\"><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nThere are several [protected areas](https:\/\/www.iucn.org\/theme\/protected-areas\/about) in South America, which operate under special regulations to ensure that species that migrate (or live) there have the best opportunity to thrive.  You'd like to know if purple martins tend to visit these areas.  To answer this question, you'll use some recently collected data that tracks the year-round location of eleven different birds.\n\nBefore you get started, run the code cell below to set everything up.","c40d5114":"### 4) Where does each bird start and end its journey?

It uses the `LineString()` method to create a LineString object from a list of Point objects.\n- `start_gdf` contains the starting points for each bird.","54753842":"### 5) Where are the protected areas in South America? (Part 1)\n\nIt looks like all of the birds end up somewhere in South America.  But are they going to protected areas?\n\nIn the next code cell, we will create a GeoDataFrame `protected_areas` containing the locations of all of the protected areas in South America.  The corresponding shapefile is located at filepath `protected_filepath`."}}
