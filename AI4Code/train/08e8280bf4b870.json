Bunch objects are sometimes used as an output for functions and methods. They extend dictionaries by enabling values to be accessed by key, `bunch[\"value_key\"]`, or by an attribute, `bunch.value_key`.\n\n> [**DataFrame**](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.DataFrame.html)\n: Two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data. Data structure also contains labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like container for Series objects. The primary pandas data structure.","34574e6e":"#### Dimensions\n\nThe ***DataFrame*** is **bi-dimensional** and has :\n- **568 rows**\n- **31 columns**\n\n#### Code explained\n\n> **`data.shape`**\n: `data`, our DataFrame, has an attribute named \"shape\".

But what is the difference between those two terms?\n\n> **Normalization**\n: Scale a variable to have a values between 0 and 1.\n\n> **Standardization**\n: Have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. \n","1c9c8c4e":"![beginner](https:\/\/img.shields.io\/badge\/Level-Beginner-darkgreen.svg)","ac383df2":"#### Correlation\nAnother good practice is to see if among the variables there are some that are linear combinations of others. If some variables are highly correlated it might negatively affect our model! So the solution in this case is delete them of the features for the model.\n\n#### Code explained\n> `data.corr()`\n: Our DataFrame `data` has a method `corr` which returns a DataFrame representing the correlations between variables.\n\n#### Vocabulary\n\n> **variable** | **feature**\n: Most of the time you might see the words *variable* and *feature* being used in datascience. Those words are representing the same entity, that is for instance the column of a DataFrame. ","24520e83":"#### Code explained\n\n> `sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold` \n: This cross-validation object is a variation of KFold that returns stratified folds. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class.\n\n> `sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline`\n: Construct a `Pipeline` from the given estimators. This is a shorthand for the Pipeline constructor; it does not require, and does not permit, naming the estimators. Instead, their names will be set to the lowercase of their types automatically.","27d3bc33":"> The maximum and the minimum are between 0 and 1 so the data has been normalized.","5ee9bafb":"The code block above shows some basics descriptive statistics about our features, the method `describe` of DataFrame is used to do that.\n\n#### Code explained\n> `data.describe()`\n:\nGenerate descriptive statistics.\nDescriptive statistics include those that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a dataset\u2019s distribution, excluding NaN values.\nAnalyzes both numeric and object series, as well as DataFrame column sets of mixed data types.

Hopefully the data does not have any missing values here so we don't have to do that!\n\n#### Code explained\n> **`data.isna().sum().sum()`**\n: `data.isna()` returns a DataFrame of boolean values where it contains `False` if the values is not missing otherwise `True`. Then `data.isna().sum()` returns a Series where each values represent the quantity of missing values in the corresponding column, computed by adding 0 if the values is `False` otherwise 1. Finally `data.isna().sum().sum()` is just the sum of the values in `data.isna().sum()`.\n\n#### Vocabulary\n> [**Series**](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.Series.html)\n: One-dimensional ndarray with axis labels (including time series). Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object supports both integer- and label-based indexing and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index. Statistical methods from ndarray have been overridden to automatically exclude missing data (currently represented as NaN). Operations between Series (+, -, \/, , *) align values based on their associated index values\u2013 they need not be the same length. The result index will be the sorted union of the two indexes.","029a3edc":"Well now let's get into the real deal!
