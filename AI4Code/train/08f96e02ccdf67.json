Volatility will be measured as follows:\n\nWe will compute the log returns over all consecutive book updates and we define the **realized volatility, $\\sigma$,** as the squared root of the sum of squared log returns.\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{t}r_{t-1, t}^2}\n$$\nWhere we use **WAP** as price of the stock to compute log returns.\n\nWe want to keep definitions as simple and clear as possible, so that Kagglers without financial knowledge will not be penalized.

This is definitely the most intuitive way, however **price differences** are not always comparable across stocks. For example, let's assume that we have invested $\\$$1000 dollars in both stock A and stock B and that stock A moves from $\\$$100 to $\\$$102 and stock B moves from $\\$$10 to $\\$$11. We had a total of 10 shares of A ($\\$1000 \\ \/ \\ \\$100 = 10$) which led to a profit of $10 \\cdot (\\$102 - \\$100) = \\$20$ and a total of 100 shares of B that yielded \\$100. So the price increase was larger for stock **A**, although the move was proportionally much larger for stock B.\n\nWe can solve the above problem by dividing the move by the starting price of the stock, effectively computing the percentage change in price, also known as the **stock return**. In our example, the return for stock A was $\\frac{\\$102 - \\$100 }{\\$100} = 2\\%$, while for stock B it was $\\frac{\\$11 - \\$10 }{\\$10} = 10\\%$. The stock return coincides with the percentage change in our invested capital.\n\nReturns are widely used in finance, however **log returns** are preferred whenever some mathematical modelling is required. Calling $S_t$ the price of the stock $S$ at time $t$, we can define the log return between $t_1$ and $t_2$ as:\n$$\nr_{t_1, t_2} = \\log \\left( \\frac{S_{t_2}}{S_{t_1}} \\right)\n$$\nUsually, we look at log returns over fixed time intervals, so with 10-minute log return we mean $r_t = r_{t - 10 min, t}$.\n\nLog returns present several advantages, for example:\n- they are additive across time $r_{t_1, t_2} + r_{t_2, t_3} = r_{t_1, t_3}$\n- regular returns cannot go below -100%, while log returns are not bounded","9b9a48fe":"# Order book\nThe term order book refers to an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level.

Therefore, sometimes when someone wants to do a trade in a stock, they check the order book and find someone with counter-interest to trade with. \n\nFor example, imagine you want to buy 20 shares of a stock A when you have the order book in the previous paragraph. Then you need to find some people who are willing to trade against you by selling 20 shares or more in total. You check the **offer** side of the book starting from the lowest price: there are 221 shares of selling interest on the level of 148.

A fair book-based valuation must take two factors into account: the level and the size of orders.
