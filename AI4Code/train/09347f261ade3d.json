This process is called **training** or **fitting**.\n\nMost datasets will not be well-represented by a line.  We could use a more complicated function, such as $g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c + \\sin d$.  Now we have 4 parameters to learn: $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.  This function is more flexible than $f(x) = ax + b$ and will be able to accurately model more datasets.\n\nNeural networks take this to an extreme, and are infinitely flexible.  They often have thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of parameters.  However the core idea is the same as above.  The neural network is a function, and we will learn the best parameters for modeling our data.","04764911":"The numpy `expand_dims` method lets us convert the 1-dimensional array `c` into a 2-dimensional array (although one of those dimensions has value 1).","fededfa5":"A **function** takes inputs and returns outputs.

The above function $f$ is $ax + b$, with parameters a and b set to $a=3$ and $b=5$.\n\nMachine learning is often about learning the best values for those parameters.  For instance, suppose we have the data points on the chart below.  What values should we choose for $a$ and $b$?","e214a5b6":"The good news is that modern machine learning can be distilled down to a couple of key techniques that are of very wide applicability.
