It consists the columns Like\n* State name\n* District name\n* Population\n* Male\n* Female\n* SC\n* ST\n* Age\n* Education etc.\n\nThe Analysis is basically divide into 3 parts:-\n\n###  1.) Exploring Dataset\n In this Part the main focus is given over Exploring datasets and getting the metadata out of it.\n ###### Observations\n * number of rows(640)\n * number of columns(118)\n * Describing the various arithematic calculations\n * Getting basic info about the dataset like its RangeIndex, Column, dtype, memoryusage\n \n \n### 2.) Filtering Dataset\nIn this part, the dataset is filtered and is converted into the form that can be used for the main Analysis Part\n###### Steps Included\n* Extracting the required column from the Dataset and Exclusing the Unwanted columns\n* Changing the names of the Columns which were in the dodgy format or were incompatible for the analysis\n* Making it reliable for futher Analysis\n\n### 3.) Analysis and Visualization\nIn this part, the main Analysis takes place in the form of some Questions and it's answer in the form of visualization\n###### Questions.\n* Which are the 10 most populated States\/Uts of India?\n* Which are the top 5 least populated States\/Uts?\n* What is the Percentage of men and women in the country Population?\n* What is the weight of different religions in the country?\n* Which are the Top 10 States\/Uts with highest literacy rate?\n* Is there any relation between literacy rate and population rate?\n* What is the Education level wise_distribution in Country?\n* What is the Age-wise Population distribution?\n* What is the count of Scheduled Casts & Scheduled Tribes in the country?\n\n###### Observations\n1. Uttar Pradesh is the most populated State among all the States\/Uts in India\n2. Lakshdweed is the least populated union territory among all the States\/Uts \n3. The Percentage of men in the country is 57.47% approximately and that of women is 49.52% approx\n4. The Highest Population in the country is of Hindus and the lowest is of Jains\n5. Kerala has the Highest literacy rate among all the States\/Uts\n6. There is relation belween literacy rate and population rate, as the literacy rate goes high the Population rate goes down\n7. Approx 2 crores of the  population have gained the Primary education but Only 0.75 crores of Population is educated till higher education\n8. Youths have the highest population in the country among all age groups\n9. The population of Scheduled Tribes(STs) in the country is approx. 10.5 crores and that of Scheduled Casts(SCs) is approx. 20 crores \n\n\n### Source of Dataset\nKaggles: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/danofer\/india-census?select=india-districts-census-2011.csv\n\n\n**The Data is subjected to keep changing time to time**","c11d1bed":"* Kerela has the highest literacy rate among all the states","51f37dfc":"### Q4 What is the weight  of different religions in the country?","38dd9cf2":"## Filtering ","8add5f10":"#                                        Census of India(2011)","b9f1b25b":"# SUMMARY","d32235ea":"* The graph denotes that almost all the place where literacy rate is high there population rate is low","ff3ae34d":"##### Correcting column names and making new dataframes for analysis","d28646e5":"### Q5 Which are the Top 10 states\/Uts with highest literacy rate?","70e41881":"* Among all the states and union territories in India, Lakshdweep is the least populated with less then 1 lakh population","54355501":"* Out of total population Youths have the highest popultion in India ","de5791f7":"* Highest population in the country is of Hindus and lowest is of Jains","0ecce546":"### Q7 What is the Education level wise_distribution in Country?","f6e854d9":"### Q8 What is the Age-wise Population distribution?","c6249f59":"### Q1 Which are the 10 most populated states\/Uts of India?","5d6c2564":"### Q6 Is there any relation between literacy rate and population rate?","2e495004":"##### Comments\n* Uttar pradesh is the state with highest of 20.42 crore as per last census occured in 2011\n* Gujrat is on the 10th number of top list with a population of a approx 6.5 crores","a23ac57d":"## Exploring Dataset","fe84fb23":"### Dataset\n**The datset used here is the *Last census of India* that took place in 2011**","d1249c68":"### Q2 Which are the  5 least populated states?","f0b5ee46":"### Q9 What is the count of Scheduled Casts & Scheduled Tribes in the country?","83e9c62e":"* Only 0.75 crores of Population is educated till higher education\n* Approx 2 crores have gained the Primary education"}}
