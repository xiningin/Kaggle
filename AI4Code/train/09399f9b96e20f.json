Introduced in 1972 as a sequence of five digits, it was expanded to eight digits in 1992 to allow for more precise localization. The standard format is \"nnnnn-nnn\" (the original five digits, an hyphen, and the new three digits).\n\n**CEP:** 12.345-678\n\nMost cities with population around 100,000 and above have a CEP assigned to every public place and to some high-occupancy private spaces, like major commercial buildings and large residential condos. Small towns are assigned a general 5-digit code followed by the suffix -000. \n\n* the first part is composed by 5 digits that represent Region, Subregion, Sector, Subsector and Subsector Splitter.\n* the second part contain 3 digits, separated by an hyphen from the first, and it represents the Distribution Identifiers.\n\nMore info about how CEP works may be found at the [Correios website](https:\/\/www.correios.com.br\/a-a-z\/cep-codigo-de-enderecamento-postal).\n\nLets look at the geolocation dataset provided by Olist and try to understand how CEP works geographically.","c2396c59":"## Zip Codes in Brazil\nFinally plotting the coordinates on a map. We see there is a relationship between the zip code prefix and the location of that zip code. They start in Sao Paulo, with prefix 01001, and then increase counterclockwise finishing in Rio Grande do Sul (south of Brazil), with prefix 99990.","4ca32493":"## Does customers from small towns buy more items on a single order?\nLets check the average item quantity per order to see if customers that are further out of large cities buy in bulk.","68b14293":"## Abrangence of zip code digits\nWhat does every digit in the zip code means? Lets zee how it behave, from 1 to 5 digits.\n\n**Zip codes starting with 2 are all from Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Esp\u00edrito Santo (ES) States**","6b4b27da":"Lets look to delivery times at a state level. We filtered only orders from Parana state (PR). It is possible to see that larger cities have lower average delivery times than the smaller ones.","67c47275":"Apparently that hypothesis is false. Looks like that customers from large cities buy more products per order. But there isn't a clear geographical pattern that would allow us to draw any further conclusion.","2733594f":"## Zip Codes in States\nLets look at the state of Sao Paulo (SP) to see how zip code prefixes works in a regional level. We see that:\n* zip code prefixes in Sao Paulo state ranges from 01001 to 19990\n* zip codes starting with 0 are in the Sao Paulo metro region\n* zip codes starting with 1 are in the interior of the state","271f59f5":"Then we treat the latitute and longitude coordinates and transform then to Mercator x\/y Coordinates."}}
