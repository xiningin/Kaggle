One way to fix this is to effectively create more data, through *data augmentation*. This refers to randomly changing the images in ways that shouldn't impact their interpretation, such as horizontal flipping, zooming, and rotating.\n\nWe can do this by passing `aug_tfms` (*augmentation transforms*) to `tfms_from_model`, with a list of functions to apply that randomly change the image however we wish. For photos that are largely taken from the side (e.g. most photos of dogs and cats, as opposed to photos taken from the top down, such as satellite imagery) we can use the pre-defined list of functions `transforms_side_on`. We can also specify random zooming of images up to specified scale by adding the `max_zoom` parameter.","426e93d3":"What is that `cycle_len` parameter? What we've done here is used a technique called *stochastic gradient descent with restarts (SGDR)*, a variant of *learning rate annealing*, which gradually decreases the learning rate as training progresses. This is helpful because as we get closer to the optimal weights, we want to take smaller steps.\n\nHowever, we may find ourselves in a part of the weight space that isn't very resilient - that is, small changes to the weights may result in big changes to the loss. We want to encourage our model to find parts of the weight space that are both accurate and stable. Therefore, from time to time we increase the learning rate (this is the 'restarts' in 'SGDR'), which will force the model to jump to a different part of the weight space if the current area is \"spikey\". Here's a picture of how that might look if we reset the learning rates 3 times (in this paper they call it a \"cyclic LR schedule\"):\n\n<img src=\"images\/sgdr.png\" width=\"80%\">\n(From the paper [Snapshot Ensembles](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1704.00109)).\n\nThe number of epochs between resetting the learning rate is set by `cycle_len`, and the number of times this happens is refered to as the *number of cycles*, and is what we're actually passing as the 2nd parameter to `fit()`.

Exercise: play with `preds` to get a lower loss for this example. \n\n**Example:** Here is an example on how to compute the loss for one example of binary classification problem. Suppose for an image x with label 1 and your model gives it a prediction of 0.9. For this case the loss should be small because our model is predicting a label $1$ with high probability.\n\n`loss = -log(0.9) = 0.10`\n\nNow suppose x has label 0 but our model is predicting 0.9.

We're going to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to allow our computer to see - something that is only possible thanks to deep learning.","dc81909d":"Now that we have a good final layer trained, we can try fine-tuning the other layers. To tell the learner that we want to unfreeze the remaining layers, just call (surprise surprise!) `unfreeze()`.","663fa2dc":"We need a <b>path<\/b> that points to the dataset. In this path we will also store temporary data and final results. `ImageClassifierData.from_names_and_array` takes in the names of the image files as well as an array of ground-truth labels and creates a dataset ready for training.","5b472dc8":"Since we've got a pretty good model at this point, we might want to save it so we can load it again later without training it from scratch."}}
