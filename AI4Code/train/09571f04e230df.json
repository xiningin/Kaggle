By calling `dir(graph)`, you find three methods that seem like they'll be useful: `.set_title()`, `.set_ylim()`, and `.set_ylabel()`. \n\nUse these methods to complete the function `prettify_graph` according to Jimmy's requests.

One thing we might want to do with this type is overload the comparison operators like `>` and `<=` so that we could use them to check whether one hand beats another. e.g. it'd be cool if we could do this:\n\n```python\n>>> hand1 = BlackjackHand(['K', 'A'])\n>>> hand2 = BlackjackHand(['7', '10', 'A'])\n>>> hand1 > hand2\nTrue\n```\n\nWell, we're not going to do all that in this question (defining custom classes is a bit beyond the scope of these lessons), but the code we're asking you to write in the function below is very similar to what we'd have to write if we were defining our own `BlackjackHand` class.
