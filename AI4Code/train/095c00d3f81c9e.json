I knew nothing about coding but it sounded serious. Then there was a TedTalk by Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code. There was a clear urge: It was more than just fewer women working, it was about setting social expectations on women to dream bigger. \n\nA few years later, I sit here with the question: \"What are the odds of a 27-yr-old Asian women with a business undergraduate degree becoming a self-taught data scientist?\" \n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/XzqG9G6\/non-tech-woman-in-tech.png\" alt=\"non-tech-woman-in-tech\" width=\"80%\"><br\/>\nKaggle's 2018 ML & DS Survey Challenge collected data from the responses of the 23,859 participants from 147 different regions.
