Let's look at probability theory in order to undersdant the mislead with good performance.\n\nIf we had equally distributed number of species in our dataset, then probability to 'guess' correct one woul be 1\/7. In contrast, we have different values of species, totatl comprising of 159 species. So for guessing 'Perch' probability will be 56\/159, and other species 35\/159, 20\/159, 17\/159,14\/159, 11\/159 and 6\/159. Quite small number of species in order to have precise demonstration of Logistic Regression. In addition, having several distinc features such as weight, length etc. probability to find correct kind will significantly increase. One way to show high potential is having larger number of species.\n\nIf there is an error in my process, please note about that, because I am beginner and every advice will increase my experience!\n\nThank you!","c2936d55":"# Basic Operations","a6b332e9":"# Logistic Regression\n\nI will use Logistic Regression for classification, and further predicting kind of fish according to its weight, vertical, diagonal and corss lengths, height and width."}}
