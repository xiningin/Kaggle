So it\u2019s no surprise she is trying to exploit the Coronavirus pandemic to push abortion funding again.\nAs The Daily Caller reports: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to include a potential way to guarantee federal funding for abortion into the coronavirus economic stimulus plan, according to multiple senior White House officials.\nSpeaking to the Daily Caller, those officials alleged that while negotiating the stimulus with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi tried to lobby for \u201cseveral\u201d provisions that stalled bipartisan commitment to the effort. One was a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.\nLifeNews depends on the support of readers like you to combat the pro-abortion media. Please donate now.\n\u201cA New mandatory funding stream that does not have Hyde protections would be unprecedented,\u201d one White House official explained. \u201cUnder the guise of protecting people, Speaker Pelosi is working to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent covering abortion\u2014which is not only backwards, but goes against historical norms.\u201d\nA second White House official referred to the provision as a \u201cslush fund\u201d and yet another questioned \u201cwhat the Hyde Amendment and abortion have to do with protecting Americans from coronavirus?\u201d\nAmericans should insist to their members of Congress that we need a clean bill that provides aggressive action to help patients and spur the economy. Killing babies with our tax dollars is not the answer to the coronavirus and the situation should not be exploited for political gain.\n\"\"\"\n\ntrue1 = \"\"\"\nPrice spikes, however, would cause demand to wither and some expensive avocados might be leftover, and stores might try to ration avocados, he added.\n\"Exactly what the retail strategy would be in this case, I\u2019m not sure. But we would have vastly fewer avocados,\" Sumner said.\nJust how fast avocados would disappear, if at all, would depend on whether the Trump administration enacts a full or partial border closure. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC he\u2019s looking for ways to keep some commerce flowing.\n\"We are looking at different options, particularly if you can keep those freight lanes, the truck lanes, open,\" he said this week.  \nBen Holtz owns Rocky H Ranch, a 70-acre family-run avocado farm in northern San Diego County. He agreed avocados would run out within weeks.\n\"Mexico is the big player today. California is not. You shut down the border and California can\u2019t produce to meet the demand,\" Holtz said. \"There will be people without their guacamole.\"\nWhile Mexico\u2019s avocado harvest is year-round, California\u2019s is limited to April through July. Growers in the state have picked only about 3 percent of what\u2019s expected to be a much smaller crop of about 175 million pounds this year, Holtz said. A heat wave last summer reduced the crop size.\nCalifornia\u2019s avocado harvest has averaged approximately 300 million pounds in recent years, according to data from the California Avocado Commission. By contrast, the U.S. has imported more than 1.5 billion pounds of avocados from Mexico annually. Representatives from the commission did not respond to requests for this article.\nAltogether, the U.S. received 43 percent of its fruit and vegetable imports from Mexico in 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nAlso affecting this year\u2019s avocado supply, a California avocado company in March recalled shipments to six states last month after fears the fruit might be contaminated with a bacterium that can cause health risks.\nUntil the early 2000s, California was the nation\u2019s leading supplier of avocados, Holtz said. Mexico gradually overtook the state and now dominates sales in the U.S.\n\"It\u2019s a very big possibility,\" Holtz said of avocado shortages. \"Three weeks would dry up the Mexican inventory. California alone consumes more avocados than are grown in our state. Cold storage supply chain is basically three weeks or less of inventory. Most of the time it\u2019s seven days.\"\nA spokeswoman for the California Restaurant Association said \"we haven\u2019t heard concerns from restaurants, it doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t worried.\" A national grocers association said it will \"continue to closely monitor any developments\" at the border, but did not have information about the potential impact on avocados.\n\"\"\"\n\ntest(fake1)\ntest(true1)\n\n","39b3f7b1":"## Now for the fun part\nI will split the data into three sets: training, validation and testing sets","fb8ab73d":"## Now I will test the accuracy of the model on the test set","b80c6d0b":"Now I will put both of the dataset into the same dataframe to use it more easily","9292b337":"I am going to freeze all the pretrained portion of the network and add a new section at the end of the network","51b47d1b":"I will then add a column to each of the dataset telling if the row is fake new or not","1b3c685c":"I find it weird that the accuracy is so high.
