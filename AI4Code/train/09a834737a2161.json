They are very sensitive to initial conditions and especially in this case because while the initial condition can be only 1 infected person, we are solving the ODE system with a susceptile (group S) population size of sometimes 50M+ people, and so the data we see so far is only a very recent evolution that has only reached a small portion of the total population, and given only a few weeks of more data we may start to see some very different dynamics.\n\nThe model, while considering intervention, does not account for many other significant factors such as (sub)population demographics, population densities in different areas, how populations move in reaction to intervention announcement, health resources (ICU beds, ventilators), how temperatures and local conditions can affect the spread, the list goes on.\n","c8e1e8a7":"# Model Fit","c9691054":"### DISCLAIMER: \nFirst as this is a fairly recent outbreak, there is still very little data available (as of March 25 of writing this).

As new data comes in regarding viral characteristics we can start to form some prior distributions over the parameters.\n\nIn terms of a likelihood function, we can assume that the variance of the confirmed cases errors to some extent varies over time, which may be slightly more realtistic than assuming the variance is constant because one might expect that as the nuber of cases grows, then the so does the margin of error, etc. In other words, if we consider some error with respect to cumulative cases $(\\epsilon_t=C_t^{real}-C_t(\\Theta))$, where $C_t$ is the solution to the ODE parameterized by $\\Theta=(T_F,T_R,T_I,p_F,p_R,\\rho, L,k)$, we can impose a Gaussian error model of the form\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\epsilon_t \\overset{iid}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N} \\left(0, \\sigma_{t}^2 \\right)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nIf we consider instead $\\sigma_{t}^2 = \\frac{1}{2 w_t}$ then we have\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\epsilon_t \\overset{iid}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N} \\left(0, \\frac{1}{2 w_t} \\right)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nIt turns out that maximizing this likelihood is equivalent to minimizing a weigthed sum of squared error loss function where $w_t$ is some weight assigned to each error at time $t$ (which is similar to what was done when fitting the model above already).\n\nIf we have some prior distribution such that $\\Theta \\sim \\pi(\\Theta)$ then we can sample $\\Theta$ from the posterior distribution where\n\n\\begin{align}\n    p(\\Theta | \\mathcal{D}) \\propto L(\\Theta | \\mathcal{D})\\pi(\\Theta)\n\\end{align}\n\nExpanding on this we would have a posterior that we sample of the form \n\n\\begin{align}\n    p(\\Theta | \\mathcal{D}) \\propto \\prod_{t} e^{-w_t\\left( C_t^{real}-C_t(\\Theta) \\right)^2} \\pi(\\Theta)\n\\end{align}\n\n\nFrom an optimization perspective, this would be equivalent to minimizing the negative log-posterior\n\n\\begin{align}\n    min_{\\Theta} \\quad -p(\\Theta | \\mathcal{D}) = \\sum_{t}w_t \\left(C_t^{real}-C_t(\\Theta) \\right)^2 -nlog \\pi(\\Theta) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n","ad3b5408":"# Simulation\n\nHere we will look at what the evolution of SEIRD will look like under intervention.

It considers four main groups: Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (S, E, I, R). It is an extension of the SIR model in that the exposed group has come into contact with an infectious member but have not yet become infectious themselves, thereby considering the realistic assumption that the disease has some incubation period. If we consider $S_t,E_t,I_t,R_t$ to be the number of members of these respective groups at any time $t$, the evolution of these four groups can be modeled with the following set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):\n\n\\begin{align}\n&\\frac{dS_t}{dt} =-\\alpha S_t I_t \\label{eq1}\\tag{1} \\\\\n&\\frac{dE_t}{dt} =\\alpha S_t I_t -\\beta E_t \\label{eq2}\\tag{2} \\\\\n&\\frac{dI_t}{dt} = \\beta E_t - \\gamma I_t \\label{eq3}\\tag{3} \\\\\n&\\frac{dR_t}{dt} =\\gamma I_t \\label{eq4}\\tag{4}\\\\\n&N = S_t + E_t + I_t + R_t \\label{eq5}\\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere each equation explains the change in size of each group per unit time as they transition from one to another over time; the transitions through the states are strictly forward $(S \\to E \\to I \\to R)$. Note that group $R$ includes both recoveries and fatalities together.\n\nThis model assumes a fixed population size $N$ with no immigration, no disease intervention, that natural birth and death rates are equal, and of course the most strict assumption that all members are uniformly well mixed.\n\nFor further reading:\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model\n\n\n## Parameter interpretations\n\n## $\\alpha$\n\nIn equation $(1)$ $\\alpha$ describes the rate at which susceptible members become truly exposed per unit time. $\\alpha$ from $(1)$ can be expanded further as a function of a few things. If we consider:\n\n$r$ is the average number of people that an infectious person comes into contact with during infection\n<br>\n$\\frac{S}{N}$ is the percentage of the population currently susceptible\n<br>\n$\\rho$ is the probability that the disease is transmitted from an infectious member to a susceptible member given that they contacted\n<br>\n$T$ is the average time it takes for an infectious member to transition into the $R$ group\n\nIt follows that given $I_t$ infectious members and $S_t$ members currently susceptible, we would expect the number of suseptible members becoming exposed per unit time to be\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{\\rho \\times r \\times \\frac{S_t}{N} \\times I_t}{T}\n\\end{align}\n\nwhich implies that\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\alpha=\\frac{\\rho r}{N T}\n\\end{align}\n\nTo implement disease intervention we can consider $r$ no longer to be constant, but some decay function overtime described above, $r_t$. In particular we consider the Hill decay function as contributed by datasaurus. But we can also modify it to ensure that number of contacts will never be reduced to 0 as that is unrealistic for humans.\n\n\\begin{align}\n    r(t;k,L)=r_0 \\left( \\frac{c}{1+(\\frac{t}{L})^k} +1-c \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\nWe now have a time dependent $\\alpha$\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\alpha_t = \\frac{\\rho \\times r_t }{NT}\n\\end{align}\n\nIn this notebook we will fix $k=2.5$ and $L=25$ and $c=1$ strictly for illustration because this is what seemed to work in a lot of cases with the data so far.\n","7059f645":"Just an observation that the parameter corresponding to $\\frac{p_F}{T_F}=0.0037784$. This may be in line with some current estimates that mortality rates can be as high as $5 \\%$ and incubation time is 14 days $(0.05\/14 = 0.0035714)$. Much more analysis must be done to estimate uncertainties in these parameters from the data. Also keep in mind that both the numerator and denominator here can change substantially across countries (different countries implement different interventions and have different medical resources, population demographics, etc) so I am very open to this similarity being just chance.","a82a6aaa":"# Define Extended Model","4712574a":"# Vizualize","929a5ae7":"One of the key things to notice is that the effects of any measure will show a lag, and this is partly due to the incubation period of the disease. At the time when lockdown is implemented, total number of infectious people was less than 200 while those who were exposed and incubating the virus was already well over 200, this is why we see the confirmed cases continue to increase for some time after intervention. \n\nIn the first scenario with no intervention, we can see that the system had reached equilibrium well before day 100, in other words the entire population became infectious at some point. With intervention, we see that equilibrium has not yet been reached as the rates of transmission have significantly reduced. In fact, after 500 days there will be a portion of the population that never became exposed at all!!!","c1084f31":"## Credits\n\nFirst and foremost, thank you to the following kernels provided by **datasaurus** and **Patrick Sanchez** for motivating the study of SEIR models and providing useful functionalities (I'm trying to learn how to properly tag these users as this is my first kaggle notebook)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/saga21\/covid-global-forecast-sir-model-ml-regressions\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anjum48\/seir-model-with-intervention\n\n\n**The first** extension I want to provide from the previous notebooks are a detailed explanation of the ODE parameters. While this notebook only obtains point-wise estimates of the model parameters as motivated by the above notebooks, understanding the parameters in detail will help in formulating a Bayesian model as the next step. As more data comes in, both times series and medical statistics related to the virus, it would be interesting to see how much insight we can get when modeling the ODE parameters with some suitable prior distributions and obtain histograms rather than point estimates. In such a Bayesian model we have the flexibility to also consider grouping parameters geographically, as neighbouring countries may take similar measures due to governmental\/social similarities. **(Bayes model discussed at the end).**\n\n**The second** extension is to split $R$ into two groups (details in parameters section). Since we are very interested in the total confirmed cases and fatalities, we can divide the R group into two mutually exclusive groups: Recovered (R) and Deceased (D).
