Negligible at best.* There is nonzero slope on the fitted regression line, but the scatterplot itself shows no apparent linear relation.","6bd287f8":"# Introduction\n\nThis notebook will visualize the distribution of extroverts around the world by age, gender, and other demographics available in the dataset. Lightweight and for fun.\n\nEnjoy!","b73176b7":"# Participant demographics\n\nAge shows no effect to extraversion. Gender also shows no clearly visible effect.\n\nIt is visible that the extraversion scores for introverts are centered near -0.5; for extroverts are centered near 1.5; and for people identifying as neither are centered around 0.75, **not 0**. In addition, the extraversion score ranges from -2.5 to +3 -- the midpoint is +0.25. For me, there is a compelling argument to put the boundary between extrovert and introvert on `extraversion_score` == 0.5 rather than 0.\n\nLet's assume that 0.5 is the soft threshold on extro-introvert boundary. There are considerable number of people that self-identifies as introvert yet has extraversion score > 0.5 -- and vice versa.\n\nThe more interesting part is how even *more* people are introverts rather than extroverts. Unfortunately, there is no assurance that the survey is representative of the real world, so inferring that \"world population is more introvert than extrovert\" can be somewhat a stretch.","36ca4c50":"# How to know if someone's an extrovert?\n\nI have established in https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rayhanlahdji\/extracting-extrovertness-from-survey-answers that we can use **factor analysis** to extract the common hidden factors that motivate the survey answers. The first common factor is \"extraversion score\", which is what exactly we need to visualize extroverts around the world!\n\nAs a bonus, we later get to compare subject's extraversion score to their own perception of self. (Is it true that people identifying as extrovert is likely to have higher extraversion score, i.e. answering the surveys like an extrovert?)"}}
