Rational responses to fear can evolve into social\nstigma, as seen in non-endemic populations such as Chinatown in New York (Depoux\net al. 2007). This stigma has also been observed in other outbreaks such as the\n1993 US Hantavirus outbreak termed \"Navajo disease\". Fear and blame has been\nassociated with lack of information and perceived loss of control. Cultural\nconstructions of diease and merginalization within communities should be looked\ninto further.\n\nA study about the swine flu describes panic during the early stages of the swine\nflu pandemic, which turned out to be less impactful as the current pandemic\n(Srinivasan 2009). It noted that levels of anxiety shift with the time-length\nexposure of risk, and the most used source of information came from the internet\nrather than the healthcare sector. It notes that the public can become apathetic\nto panic.\n\nTransportation research in regards to post-disaster evactuation and temporary\nresettlement formulates logistical models with panic-induced psychological\npenalties (Hu 2014). A similar modeling approach may be useful during a\ntransition to a post-quarantine\/pre-vaccination economy. \n\nThere are efforts of measuring the spread of information over the internet.\nVirality of information via social media can be characterized by a diffusion\nprocess, in the same way that physical viruses are modeled. This can be used to\nmeasure a social response during a disease outbreak (Fast et al., 2015). Boolean\nsearches of Twitter posts have been used to increase situational awareness\nduring Superstorm Sandy (Smith et al., 2014). Public attention of the Ebola\noutbreak in West Africa was measured in China and correlated between blogs and\nmedia news (Liu et al. 2016). \n\nSocial media can spread information quickly. An editorial notes that\n\"misinformation on Coronavirus may be the most contagious thing about it\"\n(Depoux 2020). An article by the Lancet highlights the response of verified key\ninformation as a critical need during the pandemic (Lancet 2020). There seems to\nbe an established literature on rumor responses, such as in Taiwan via increased\nmedia scrutiny and transparency (Hsu 2014). In the case of rumors of radiation\ncontaminated food in South Korea, only refutation was found to be effective in\nreducing rumor beliefs among three strategies (Paek 2019). Additionally,\ninformation seeking behavior has been studied in the context fo rumors around\nthe MERS outbreak (Lee 2018).\n\n## References\n\n* Depoux, A., Martin, S., Karafillakis, E., Bsd, R.

These are relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic, which draws similarities to other zoonotic diseases such as the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 pandemics. The guidelines cover the following:\n\n* Balancing rights, interests, and values\n* Evidence base for public health measures\n* Transparency, public engagement and social mobilization\n* Information, education, and communication\n* Resource constraints\n\nA review of several CDC-sponsored meetings explores these considerations with regional and cultural perspectives. (Lor et al., 2016) The driving prompt is as follows:\n\n_Prior to this meeting, a close friend explains that he does not understand why ethical issues are important in a pandemic response.  What  experience,  either  yours  or  someone  else\u2019s  would you share to illustrate the significance and importance of public health ethics in a pandemic response_\n\nThe following regions were involved:\n\nRegion | Organizations | Location | Date\n-|-|-|-\nAfrica | WHO, AFENET | Kampala, Uganda | 2008-08-11 to 2008-08-15\nAsia | TEPHINET, SAFETYNET | Hanoi, Vietnam | 2010-03-22 to 2010-03-25\nLatin America | TEPHINET | Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic | 2011-07-27 to 2011-07-29\nEastern Mediterranean | TEPHINET, EMPHNET | Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt | 2011-12-05 to 2011-12-06\n\nThe ethical standards discussed involved the following:\n\n* Transparency and Public Engagement\n* Allocation of Scarce Resources\n* Social Distancing\n* Obligations to and of Health Care Workers\n* International Collaboration\n\nSocioeconomic, geographical, and cultural differences between regions and countries affect the response to issues. Some key takeaways include the wide acceptance of transparency and inclusiveness for ethical decision-making, and a noted effectiveness of focusing on procedural ethics (shared values and fair procedures) to combat the common health threat of a global pandemic.\n\nAn ethical framework proposed by Kass (2005) for evaluating public health and avian influenza pandemic preparedness captures the multifaceted nature of balancing the complex nature of pandemic preparation and response. The practical nature of the framework strives to reduce burden while respecting autonomy of individuals and communities. She states that public health burdens fall under three major types:\n\n* Risks to privacy and confidentiality\n* Risks to liberty and self-determination\n* Risks to justice\n\nThe risks outlined above are not isolated to public health. In particular, privacy and confidentiality are freedoms that could erode as the technology to perform surveillance at a massive scale evolves. There is some precedent for thinking about these issues. There is discussion on genomics around data sharing, management of incidental findings, and practices for obtaining informed consent (Geller 2014). The idea of preventative forensic screenings by Lombroso can provide strategies for balancing the risk-benefit of invasive surveillance (Munthe 2015). And finally, there are lessons to be learned from the cyber intelligence community around information sharing and organizational structures (Smith 2016).\n\nRecent news highlights efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, and may provide case studies for the ethical issues surrounding privacy in the context of technology.\n\n* Mozur, P., Zhong, R., & Krolik, A.

There has been considerable pressure to those working in the medical profession, and conflicting responsibilities to themselves, their families, their patients. This is discussed in (Ruderman 2006). Resource constraints force healthcare workers to make life and death decisions. An example of such decision is allocating a scarce supply of ventilators to a surge of new patients. Emergency care can be viewed from an ethical perspective (Aacharya 2011) which are summed in the following areas.\n\n* Respect for Autonomy\n* Nonmaleficence\n    * Do no harm.\n* Beneficence\n    * One ought to prevent evil or harm.\n    * One ought to remove evil or harm.\n    * One ought to do or promote good.\n* Justice\n    * Allocation decisions must be made fairly.\n    \nThe production of vaccines also requires a careful balance. While it may be tempting to point toward promising drugs as cure-alls, there is a process that must be followed. The ethics of an Ebola virus therapy trial is discussed in (Kombe 1982).\n\nThe current state of affairs also outlines the dilemma of many small businesses\nthat may suffer greatly during an economic downturn. As stringent physical\ndistancing measures start to relax, employers will need to plan for the\ncontinuity of businesses. The perspective from optometry (Hom 2007) outlines\nsome of the ethical considerations for employers.\n\n\n## References\n\n* Aacharya, R. P., Gastmans, C., & Denier, Y. (2011).

Indeed, HCPs \u2013 both in clinical care and in public health \u2013 were severely tested by SARS. Unprecedented demands were placed on their skills and expertise, and their personal commitment to their profession was severely tried.\n\n(Ruderman et al. 2006).\n\nFirst, it is known that many medical workers will get some form of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a \nstudy of 102 medical professionals exposed to avian flu patients from Anhui Province in China, 20% exhibited symptoms \nof PTSD (Tang 2016). A study of the Toronto SARS outbreak estimated that a high degree of distress was expeienced \nby 29-35% of healtcare workers (Maunder 2004).\n\nThe impacts on hospital workers in the Toronto SARS outbreak is broken down as follows:\n\n* Groups of healthcare workers\n    * Those who were in contact with SARS patients\n    * By professional discipline\n    * Workers who are parents\n* Mediating factors\n    * Social isolation because of transmission potential\n    * Stigma due to racism or public perception\n    * Unusual degree of scrutiny from various sources\n    * Job stress e.g. unfamiliar tasks\n* Individual traits that contribute to stress (e.g. attachment insecurity)\n* Cumulatative effect of multiple factors\n\nIn a study of a Taiwanese survey of stressors while caring for SARS patients (N=26), the following were the top stressors (Lee 2005).\n\n1. Worry about being negligent and endangering coworkers (92.6%)\n2. Frequent modification of infection control procedures (92.3%)\n3. Uncertainty about when the epidemic will be under control (92.3%)\n\nThe top measures to reduce stress included:\n\n1. Psychiatric services\n2. Encouragement among coworkers\n3. Hospital providing nutriments\n\nAdditionally, workers had their own coping strategies:\n\n1. Taking protective measures\n2. Actively aquiring more knowledge about SARS\n3. Engaging in health-promoting behaviors\n\nThese three tables could be used to search for deeper exploration into the topic.\n\nExisting personal protective equiptment should be donned effectively to maximize protection of workers and to ration supplies. Colored paints can be used to evaluate the effectivess of PPE (Eiras et al. 2017). Workers should expect mild skin irritation from n95 masks and googles, and to be careful when applying topical ointments. Full face respirators and face shields should also be considered (Kantor 2020).\n\n## References\n\n* Aacharya, R. P., Gastmans, C., & Denier, Y. (2011).

See the [task submission page\nin the CORD-19 research\nchallenge](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/tasks?taskId=563)\nfor more backgorund.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe tasks in this notebook are tackled in a manually driven way. I am not a subject expert, but \nam interested in learning about the ethics of a pandemic. There are difficult choices that need to be made by people\nand governments around the world that can\nbe tackled in a principled and reasoned way. For example, in overwhelmed hospitals, who should recieve scarce resources?\nWhen is it okay to relax non-medical interventions and allow people to begin resuming their everyday lives?\n\nI've gathered a list of references while researching the various tasks. For each reference, I collect a \ndigital object identifier (DOI) and assign it a tag related to the task. Then I assign a score between 1\nand 3 to reflect my confidence of the relevance to the task. Refer to the following tables for defintions.\n\n`tag` | summarized title\n-|-\n`principles` | Ethical principles and standards relevant to COVID-19\n`practice` | Ethics in practice\n`outreach` | Ethics outreach\n`organization` | Integrating social sciences within WHO\n`quality` | Qualitative frameworks for evaluating public health measures\n`risk` | Burdens and needs of care providers\n`perception` | Underlying drivers of fear, anxiety, and stigma\n\n`relevanceScore` | meaning\n-|-\n1 | weak relevance\n2 | relevance\n3 | strong relevant\n\nFor each DOI or other identifier, I query Semantic Scholar and record the results. I use the number of times\na paper has been cited as a rough indicator for quality. \n\nI may include a summary directly answering the question in the task. I try my best to choose \nhigh quality or relevant papers from my search in the summaries. My exploration of papers primarily \noccured on https:\/\/covid.curiosity.ai. Thank you Curiosity for putting together a great search engine.\n\nWhile the process here has been wholly manual, I've gained some familiarity with the existing\nresearch across many disciplines with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future work could include \nautomatically surfacing relevant papers by topic and citations in a semi-supervised\nfashion, with qualitative surveys of the ranking results as (noisy) labeled data.","19c6e1a7":"\n# Ethics outreach\n\n> Efforts to support sustained education, access, and capacity building in the area of ethics"}}
