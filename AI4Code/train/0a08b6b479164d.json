Conclusions\n\nIn summary, this EDA shows:\n\nCrimes rates are low between 1-8 in the morning, and gradually rise throughout the day, peaking around 6 pm. There is some variation across days of the week, with Friday having the highest crime rate and Sunday having the lowest. The month also seems to have some influence, with the winter months of February-April having the lowest crime rates, and the summer\/early fall months of June-October having the highest crime rates. There is also a spike in crime rates in the month of January.\n\nThe most frequent \"crime\" in Boston are Motor Vehicle Accidents while the second most are Larcenies. Guns are mostly used in Aggravated Assault followed by Homicides. Most of the crime happens in Roxbury numerically, However to consider population parameter, Mattapan has the highest density. \n\nFinally, because UCR Part one is declared as the most serious crimes types, I find valuable to analyse this type more closely;","0732cdd3":"Even if the numbers do not have any meaning, it can be said that all variables seems to be correct.

Secondly, UCR_PART has only 90 missing values but, it shows that offence part and it means that this column related to all other offence columns. However, the others does not have any missing value. So these 90 lines must examine closely.\n    \n1. Thirdly, DISTRICT,REPORTING_AREA, STREET, Lat, Long and Location are all related to crime location, however while REPORTING_AREA and Location have no missing value, the others have different number of missing values.
