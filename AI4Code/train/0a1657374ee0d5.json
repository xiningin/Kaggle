From Figure 5, we can see that most defaulted cases appears in the upper part of the scatter plots. The upper part represent customers whose bank balance is relatively large compared to their annual salary, meaning they may have taken on larger debt in proportion with their salary than they should. This is consistent with a reality-based observation: if one take on debt more than they can afford, they are more likely to default.\n2. In Figure 5, the bigger markers - representing unemployed customer - gather in the left side of the chart. This indicates that most unemployed customers have a lower range of annual salary. Despite the lower salary range, their bank balance distribution is similar to the employed group. Therefore we can deduce that, compared to the employed group, there is a higher proportion of unemployed customers borrowing more than they should. Therefore, statistically unemployed customer is more likely to default. This hypothesis is also supported by Figure 2, where we can see the Unemployed customer group has a higher default mean of IQR.\n\nOverall we can see that a tree-based algorithm or support vector machine will do well in this problem.","f929cce4":"# Evaluate","8c2765a4":"**Compare learning curve using accuracy as the metrics**","761c3095":"**Plot learning curve of Gradient Boosting Classifier and Random Forest Classifier, against SVM**","57432d54":"# 2.
