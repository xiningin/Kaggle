Therefore we will have to define our own churn definition and move on to the modelling.\n\nChurn rate works well for subscription-based products or ones that have regular nature of interactions like Netflix subscription. It\u2019s clear that customer has churned at the moment when he cancels or misses the next planned payment.\n\nWhen we know which customers have churned we can ask them for reasons and prioritize fixes for them. But for not regular, transactional products churn rate is hard to measure since we don\u2019t know which customers are churned and which are dormant.\n\nA generally accepted retail churn rate is between five to sevent percent per year. Less than five percent is a great goal, but a churn rate over ten percent is cause for concern. Even as you acquire more customers, your business can't grow unless you have a greater volume of incoming customers than outgoing ones.\n\nSatisfying existing customers is actually more profitable than obtaining new ones. **It costs five times more to obtain a new customer than it does to retain an existing customer**. Decreasing your churn rate by five percent increases profits up to 125%.\n\nLet's define transactional churn:\n\n**A customer will be considered as churned if not purchased from a store 2 weeks or more.**\n\n2 weeks out threshold is chosen as it splits households around 85%\/15% No Churn\/Churn.","ec8a4ed3":"Change NaN or None\/Unknown values to zero for the columns of \"number of received campaigns\", \"kid category\" and the \"number of redeems\"","f0c65bb4":"#### Average number of store visits per household within two years is:","87e00afc":"### Each Campaign Duration\nLet's calculate and visualise how long each campaign lasted within two years period:\n\nCampaign No:15 lasts the longest with a staggering 160 days figure, where other campaigns are fairly close to each other ranging from 30 to 70 days\nAverage campaign duration is 37 days (median)","937580fe":"Correlation between the stores with high number of churner customers and the Target (isChurned) are calculated and displayed in the barchart below:","14a95e43":"Let's see how our features interact with the target variable.
