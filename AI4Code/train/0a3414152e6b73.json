Sweetviz is an automated EDA library which helps data scientists with beautiful and introductory visualizations.\n\nLet's have a look at the Sweetviz!!!","370ee34f":"Sweetviz has 3 main functions which are analyze, compare and compare_intra. I will introduce you analyze and compare functions which are crucial features of Sweetviz!\n\nLet's start with analyze function!","a41f450b":"# **Some last words**\n\nSweetviz helps us for quick analysis of target characteristics, training vs testing data, and other such data characterization tasks. It contains a lot of information for all the attributes. Also, it\u2019s easy to understand and is prepared in just 3 lines of code.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!"}}
