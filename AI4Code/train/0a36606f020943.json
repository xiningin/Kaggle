It is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence(AI)** that uses **Natural Language Processing(NLP)** to transform unstructured text data into normalized and structured data that can be used for Machine Learning model. \n\nTextual data also has huge business values such as companies can use the data to help profile customers and understand their needs.\n\n## NLP Pipeline\n\nNatural Language Processing(NLP) pipeline is a set of text preprocessing and feature extraction steps that are performed in a sequential manner. The length of the pipeline varies from one usecase to another usecase and also the kind of text data we are dealing with. \n\n","abaaa9ef":"## Data Preprocessing","34a18c46":"## Import Libraries","5a09169f":"Suppose that the following paragraph needs to be processed to find the stem words for Nouns, Verbs, Adjactives and so on.

Stemming & Lemmatization\n\n**Stemming**-Stemming is a technique of finding root word of the given word. For example, if a word is 'running' then the stem word of that word is 'run'.\n\n**Lemmatization**-Lemmatization refers to find the axle word by doing vocabulary and morphological analysis of the words.\n\n### Stemming Approaches\n\n#### #1 gensim.parsing.stem()\nThere is an inbuilt method called **stem()** in **parsing** package of gensim. It does the stemming(PorterStemming) on the given text. \n\n#### #2 PorterStemmer \nThe basic approach on stemming is using `PorterStemmer` object. Gensim has a porter stemmer class in `gensim.parsing.porter` package. The class has different functions to accept input as word, sentence and list of sentences. \n\n#### #3 Chain along pipes & filters\nAnother approach is chain the stem_text method in the cleaning pipeline filter and pass it as a parameter to `preprocess_string()` function.","e8a7a219":"### 1. Data Cleaning Pipeline\n\nThis is going to be the first step of Text analysis. We will be applying various cleaning algorithms to remove unwanted elements from the text data. \n"}}
