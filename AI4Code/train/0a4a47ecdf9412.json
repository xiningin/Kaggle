The new attributes (also known as components) created by PCA have the following properties: (1) they are linear combinations of the original attributes, (2) they are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other, and (3) they capture the maximum amount of variation in the data.\n\nThe example below illustrates the application of PCA to an image dataset. There are 16 RGB files, each of which has a size of 111 x 111 pixels. The example code below will read each image file and convert the RGB image into a 111 x 111 x 3 = 36963 feature values. This will create a data matrix of size 16 x 36963.    \n\n**<font color=\"red\">Code:<\/font>**","4ee37513":"## 4.6 Summary\n\nThis tutorial presents Python programming examples for data preprocessing, including data cleaning (to handle missing values and remove outliers as well as duplicate data), aggregation, sampling, discretization, and dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis.   \n\n**<font color='blue'>References:<\/font>**\n\n1.

In the example code below, we will draw a boxplot to identify the columns in the table that contain outliers. Note that the values in all columns (except for 'Bare Nuclei') are originally stored as 'int64' whereas the values in the 'Bare Nuclei' column are stored as string objects (since the column initially contains strings such as '?' for representing missing values). Thus, we must  convert the column into numeric values first before creating the boxplot. Otherwise, the column will not be displayed when drawing the boxplot.\n\n**<font color=\"red\">Code:<\/font>**","8b94d68c":"Observe that only the 'Bare Nuclei' column contains missing values.

In some cases, the information was not collected; while in other cases, some attributes are inapplicable to the data instances. This section presents examples on the different approaches for handling missing values. \n\nAccording to the description of the data (https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original), the missing values are encoded as '?' in the original data. Our first task is to convert the missing values to NaNs. We can then count the number of missing values in each column of the data.\n\n**<font color=\"red\">Code:<\/font>**","30486076":"Using PCA, the data matrix is projected to its first two principal components.

Among the common data quality issues include noise, outliers, missing values, and duplicate data. This section presents examples of Python code to alleviate some of these data quality problems.

There are various methods available for data sampling, such as sampling without replacement, where each selected instance is removed from the dataset, and sampling with replacement, where each selected instance is not removed, thus allowing it to be selected more than once in the sample.\n\nIn the example below, we will apply sampling with replacement and without replacement to the breast cancer dataset obtained from the UCI machine learning repository.\n\n**<font color=\"red\">Code:<\/font>**\n\nWe initially display the first five records of the table.","25703919":"## 4.2 Aggregation\n\nData aggregation is a preprocessing task where the values of two or more objects are combined into a single object. The motivation for aggregation includes (1) reducing the size of data to be processed, (2) changing the granularity of analysis (from fine-scale to coarser-scale), and (3) improving the stability of the data.\n\nIn the example below, we will use the daily precipitation time series data for a weather station located at Detroit Metro Airport.
