In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.). In other words, the logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.\n\n# Logistic Regression Assumptions\n* Binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.\n* For a binary regression, the factor level 1 of the dependent variable should represent the desired outcome.\n* Only the meaningful variables should be included.\n* The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity.\n* The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.\n* Logistic regression requires quite large sample sizes. <br>\n\nKeeping the above assumptions in mind, let\u2019s look at our dataset."}}
