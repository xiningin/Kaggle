Thank you for bringing the Fastai course and making deep learning so easy to understand.The procedures in the text of this topic are copied from the Fastai course content for everyone reference and study.\n\nWhen I was studying Fast AI (2020), I often confused the difference between Fastai version 1 and Fastai version 2 (many of the functions in version 1 are no longer usable), which can be very confusing if you're following the code on GitHub. So I decided to share the latest code for this course with everyone and make sure it was all done.\n\n## Why kaggle\nBecause my computer doesn't have a GPU.T.T","d12552f7":"it's odd here ,  i think 'hate' is heavy negative words ,but the showed result is 'pos'","6796c746":"## 3.IMDb\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)"}}
