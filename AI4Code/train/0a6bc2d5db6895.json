Inflation has an impact on the value of gold, but not as much as one might expect. Most novice gold investors believe that if inflation is rising in the United States, then the price of gold should also go up, since you will need to give more inflated dollars per ounce. However, in the long run, there is no strong correlation between inflation and gold prices.\n\n2. Gold, along with the US dollar and other reserve currencies, is a reserve market instrument. Therefore, if the exchange rate of one of the currencies (for example, the dollar) decreases relative to the other reserve currencies, while maintaining the purchasing power of buying gold by other currencies, then the logical consequence is a rise in the price of gold relative to the cheaper currency.\n\n3. War or the threat of war is the most significant (after financial market crises) source of uncertainty for investors. Gold is best served as a safe investment in those moments when investors are very scared, and the war may well cause such conditions in the market. In addition, the war is associated with a number of other factors that contribute to price increases, including excessive spending, money issuance, political instability, and currency depreciation.\n\n4. Gold is sensitive to interest rates because it does not generate current income and is therefore highly sensitive to stock market alternatives that offer potential income, such as bonds or even dividend-paying stocks. There is a noticeable, though not perfect, negative correlation: when bond yields rise, there is a high probability that the trend in gold will be sideways or even downward, while a decline in yields usually leads to very positive movements in gold prices. For example, to combat the recession of the early 2000s, the Fed lowered interest rates to very low levels, which forced long-term investors to move away from low-yield bonds and diversify their portfolios at the expense of gold. This provided good support to the already rising gold prices.\n\n5. Supply and demand - the most difficult factor to assess the impact on the value of the metal. Large investors in gold, including central banks, the IMF and leading funds, have a significant impact on the market. The actions of these participants can significantly change the demand for gold jewelry and investment instruments. Accounting for the actions of these major players is an impossible task for an ordinary private investor who does not have access to the disclosed information of all these players.\n****","6765b1e3":"![](https:\/\/psv4.userapi.com\/c537232\/u178734482\/docs\/d6\/078fb47f1c69\/MyCollages_1.jpg?extra=TJDzCF-Skj1acETPUptVHnce2Qb_7cRLkUVfyhKVetll9x44teINorfXp4UPfx4aMtgJU7wcHPwmluv6U7c8kQttSeTK7kTcUpSWiDwAfhLB4bMLWIscnG_dgTsO5e9Tnz02cB00VVNUdvehWs2kq__tdQs)","011f9b28":"****\n**Introduction**\n\nIn a world where paper money matters, gold is the reserve of any country. In the case of inflation, it can be used as an alternative replacement for the money we are used to. If ordinary money becomes worthless in the process of inflation, the country's gold reserve will be released to support the economy. This system was developed taking into account the fact that paper money can easily devalue, and gold throughout it's history has not lost in value until now.\n****","fe4fdfb4":"****\n**Histrory**\n\nThe price of gold remained unchanged until the abandonment of the Bretton Woods system and the devaluation of the US dollar in 1971. The Bretton Woods system was created near the end of World War II to restore trade relations and fair competition. Previously, in each country, a unit of the national currency was directly linked to a certain fixed amount of precious metal. At the same time, the leaders of the states set the exchange rate independently. In order to gain trade and economic advantages over their partners, states began to massively devalue their own currencies, which further increased the overall financial instability. It was decided to strictly link only one currency to gold and use it in international settlements. However, as countries recovered from the war, governments began to resent the dominance of the dollar and the mandatory pegging of their national currency to the American one. It was more convenient for countries to switch to floating rates, depending on the degree of success of the domestic economy, export and import potential. Thus, the complete abandonment of the gold standard allowed more paper money to be printed, and gold was no longer pegged to the dollar. The final transition from the Bretton Woods system to the Jamaican system occurred in 1976, when we can observe a major growth.\n\nThe Iran-Iraq conflict and the war in Afghanistan have also pushed up the price of gold. The protracted tensions between the USSR and the United States were not without reason. Both countries wanted to spread their influence under the pretext of helping other states, of course there was an indirect interest in resources. Any war entails economic shocks, and these in turn lead to a demand for resources: mainly oil, but gold is no exception.\n\nA major increase in the price of gold started with the terrorist attack of the United States on September 11, 2001. The attack was made on the main financial center - New York. While the shares of many companies fell significantly, investors rushed into protective assets, primarily in gold.\n\nPolitical and economic instability on a global scale at the turn of 2002 and 2003 disrupted the pace of the gradual recovery of gold and forced prices to rise again. The reason for this this time was the beginning of the Iraq War and the settlement of the crisis over the DPRK's nuclear program.\n\nAgainst the background of the financial crisis in 2008, the leaders of the leading world powers and investors are increasingly considering gold and the provision of the world currency with gold as an integral part of the possible structure of the monetary and financial system of the post-crisis world. At first, many were afraid and began to sell gold, however, a few months after the fall in the price, gold broke the bar of 1000$ and continued to grow until 2012. On October 13, 2008, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for the creation of a \"new Bretton Woods\". Many central banks in other countries have announced the priority of gold as a reserve instrument \u2014 gold is not directly affected by the economic policy of a particular country. Thus, the demand for gold grew again.\n\n"}}
