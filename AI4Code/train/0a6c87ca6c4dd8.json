This preprocessing method dated back to previous diabetic retinopathy competitions (Ben Graham is the competition winner). \n\nAccording to the previous diabetic retinopathy winner the reasoning behind doing this preprocessing (points on the bracket is why I believe this might work for this competition) :\n* Enhance finer details (Enhance thin strokes)\n* Tackle different illumination problem.
