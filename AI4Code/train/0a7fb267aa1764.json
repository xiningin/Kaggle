The Gallup World Poll consists of more than 100 global questions as well as region-specific items.\n*     The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors \u2013 economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity \u2013 contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world\u2019s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.\n    > * **Ladder score**: Happiness score or subjective well-being. This is the national average response to the question of life evaluations.\n    > * **Logged GDP per capita**: The GDP-per-capita time series from 2019 to 2020 using countryspecific forecasts of real GDP growth in 2020.\n    > * **Social support**: Social support refers to assistance or support provided by members of social networks to an individual.\n    > * **Healthy life expectancy**: Healthy life expectancy is the average life in good health - that is to say without irreversible limitation of activity in daily life or incapacities - of a fictitious generation subject to the conditions of mortality and morbidity prevailing that year.\n    >*     **Freedom to make life choices**: Freedom to make life choices is the national average of binary responses to the GWP question \u201cAre you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?\u201d ... It is defined as the average of laughter and enjoyment for other waves where the happiness question was not asked\n>*     **Generosity**: Generosity is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question \u201cHave you donated money to a charity in the past month?\u201d on GDP per capita.?\n>*     **Perceptions of corruption**: The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: \u201cIs corruption widespread throughout the government or not\u201d and \u201cIs corruption widespread within businesses or not?\u201d\n>*     **Ladder score in Dystopia**: It has values equal to the world\u2019s lowest national averages. Dystopia as a benchmark against which to compare contributions from each of the six factors. Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world's least-happy people. ...
