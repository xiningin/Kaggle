In LogisticRegression, we looks for these below mentioned characteristics.\n\n1.Dataset should have atleast  100 or more observations.\n\n2.Dataset is not missing any values.\n\n3.Predictable variable is binary(In this case class attribute -  0 or 1 )\n\n4.All Predictors variables are independent of each other and variables should be continous.(The range of values for a particular data item has a minimum and a maximum value. Continuous data can be any value in between.. ex- degree of spondylolisthesis..)\n\n Because if they are not, it can skew the predictions\/results.\n\nAfter a lot of research, on the dataset,it seems Pelvic Incidence can be a good predicting variable for classifying a Normal vs abnormal spine and so is Degree Spondylitis can be another predictor variable for classifying a Normal vs abnormal spine.The relation between predictable variable and predictor variables shows #seaborn#plot sigmoid curve.Notes:https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2852036\/\n\nPelvic radius is another technique to predict the abnormalities. After some digging around, I felt like this dataset could be incomplete with r.t. Pelvic radius, we need another attributes like hip angle, pelvic angle.Here is article that I used to come to that conclusion. https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3175929\/\n\nI am thankful that this dataset gave me a chance to analyze more and figure out something that I didn\u2019t have a clue before. I am not a medical student or related to medical field. So please understand these are my observations made on my own. \n\nConclusion is  Degree Spondylitis is giving better classification results (81%) to Pelvic Incidence(PI) . This dataset is definitely missing some important attributes but gave  lot of insights into the problem and how to go about it. \n\n\n\n","90f350cd":"***Wanted to check if the accuracy changes , if we considered the  all featutes\/attributes 'pelvic_incidence', 'pelvic_tilt numeric', 'lumbar_lordosis_angle',\n       'sacral_slope', 'pelvic_radius', 'degree_spondylolisthesis' attributes., it seems coeff are really skewed******\n       \n      ","d3b04c77":"***Wanted to check if the accuracy changes , if we considered the 'lumbar_lordosis_angle','pelvic_radius', 'degree_spondylolisthesis' attributes., it seems be closes to the above results******"}}
