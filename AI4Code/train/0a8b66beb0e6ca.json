Quoting the docs\n>if sep is None, the C engine cannot automatically detect the separator, but the Python parsing engine can, meaning the latter will be used and automatically detect the separator by Python\u2019s builtin sniffer tool, csv.Sniffer.\n\n- Python parser has another great built-in feature that allows us to have a regex as a seperator which can be very useful in case of badly fomatted csv files.
