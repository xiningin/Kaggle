Let's do that using the cumulative product of each successive day:","d89c81a1":"Finally, we can plot both the most likely values for $R_t$ and the HDIs over time.

[The derivation](https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0002185) is beyond the scope of this notebook, but here it is:\n\n$$ \\lambda = k_{t-1}e^{\\gamma(R_t-1)}$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the reciprocal of the serial interval ([about 7 days for COVID19](https:\/\/wwwnc.cdc.gov\/eid\/article\/26\/7\/20-0282_article)). Since we know every new case count on the previous day, we can now reformulate the likelihood function as a Poisson parameterized by fixing $k$ and varying $R_t$.\n\n$$ \\lambda = k_{t-1}e^{\\gamma(R_t-1)}$$\n\n$$P\\left(k|R_t\\right) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$\n\n### Evaluating the Likelihood Function\n\nTo continue our example, let's imagine a sample of new case counts $k$.

Note that since we only had four days of history, I did not apply the Gaussian process to this sample. Next, however, we'll turn to a real-world application where this process is necessary.","4f0e9ca0":"### Running the Algorithm\n\n#### Choosing $\\sigma$ for the Gaussian Process\n\n> Note: you can safely skip this section if you trust that we chose the right value of $\\sigma$ for the gaussian process below. Otherwise, read on.\n\nThe original approach simply selects yesterday's posterior as today's prior. While intuitive, doing so doesn't allow for our belief that the value of $R_t$ has likely changed from yesterday. To allow for that change, we apply Gaussian noise to the prior distribution with some standard deviation $\\sigma$. The higher $\\sigma$ the more noise and the more we will expect the value of $R_t$ to drift each day. Interestingly, applying noise on noise iteratively means that there will be a natural decay of distant posteriors. This approach has the same effect of windowing, but is more robust and doesn't arbitrarily forget posteriors after a certain time like my previous approach.\n\nHowever, there's still an arbitrary choice: what should $\\sigma$ be? Adam Lerer pointed out that we can use the process of maximum likelihood to inform our choice. Here's how it works:\n\nMaximum likelihood says that we'd like to choose a $\\sigma$ that maximizes the likelihood of seeing our data $k$: $P(k|\\sigma)$. Since $\\sigma$ is a fixed value, let's leave it out of the notation, so we're trying to maximize $P(k)$ over all choices of $\\sigma$.\n\nSince $P(k)=P(k_0,k_1,\\ldots,k_t)=P(k_0)P(k_1)\\ldots P(k_t)$ we need to define $P(k_t)$. It turns out this is the denominator of Bayes rule:\n\n$$P(R_t|k_t) = \\frac{P(k_t|R_t)P(R_t)}{P(k_t)}$$\n\nTo calculate it, we notice that the numerator is actually just the joint distribution of $k$ and $R$:\n\n$$ P(k_t,R_t) =  P(k_t|R_t)P(R_t) $$\n\nWe can marginalize the distribution over $R_t$ to get $P(k_t)$:\n\n$$ P(k_t) = \\sum_{R_{t}}{P(k_t|R_t)P(R_t)} $$\n\nSo, if we sum the distribution of the numerator over all values of $R_t$, we get $P(k_t)$. And since we're calculating that anyway as we're calculating the posterior, we'll just keep track of it separately.\n\nSince we're looking for the value of $\\sigma$ that maximizes $P(k)$ overall, we actually want to maximize: \n\n$$\\prod_{t,i}{p(k_{ti})}$$\n\nwhere $t$ are all times and $i$ is each state.\n\nSince we're multiplying lots of tiny probabilities together, it can be easier (and less error-prone) to take the $\\log$ of the values and add them together. Remember that $\\log{ab}=\\log{a}+\\log{b}$. And since logarithms are monotonically increasing, maximizing the sum of the $\\log$ of the probabilities is the same as maximizing the product of the non-logarithmic probabilities for any choice of $\\sigma$.\n\n### Function for Calculating the Posteriors\n\nTo calculate the posteriors we follow these steps:\n1. Calculate $\\lambda$ - the expected arrival rate for every day's poisson process\n2. Calculate each day's likelihood distribution over all possible values of $R_t$\n3. Calculate the Gaussian process matrix based on the value of $\\sigma$ we discussed above\n4. Calculate our initial prior because our first day does not have a previous day from which to take the posterior\n  - Based on [info from the cdc](https:\/\/wwwnc.cdc.gov\/eid\/article\/26\/7\/20-0282_article) we will choose a Gamma with mean 4.\n5. Loop from day 1 to the end, doing the following:\n  - Calculate the prior by applying the Gaussian to yesterday's prior.\n  - Apply Bayes' rule by multiplying this prior and the likelihood we calculated in step 2.\n  - Divide by the probability of the data (also Bayes' rule)","8346bd3d":"### Compile Final Results\n\nGiven that we've selected the optimal $\\sigma$, let's grab the precalculated posterior corresponding to that value of $\\sigma$ for each state.

It's the number of people who become infected per infectious person at time $t$. The most well-known version of this number is the basic reproduction number: $R_0$ when $t=0$. However, $R_0$ is a single measure that does not adapt with changes in behavior and restrictions.\n\nAs a pandemic evolves, increasing restrictions (or potential releasing of restrictions) changes $R_t$. Knowing the current $R_t$ is essential. When $R\\gg1$, the pandemic will spread through a large part of the population. If $R_t<1$, the pandemic will slow quickly before it has a chance to infect many people. The lower the $R_t$: the more manageable the situation. In general, any $R_t<1$ means things are under control.\n\nThe value of $R_t$ helps us in two ways. (1) It helps us understand how effective our measures have been controlling an outbreak and (2) it gives us vital information about whether we should increase or reduce restrictions based on our competing goals of economic prosperity and human safety. [Well-respected epidemiologists argue](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/06\/opinion\/coronavirus-end-social-distancing.html) that tracking $R_t$ is the only way to manage through this crisis.\n\nYet, today, we don't yet use $R_t$ in this way. In fact, the only real-time measure I've seen has been for [Hong Kong](https:\/\/covid19.sph.hku.hk\/dashboard). More importantly, it is not useful to understand $R_t$ at a national level. Instead, to manage this crisis effectively, we need a local (state, county and\/or city) granularity of $R_t$.\n\nWhat follows is a solution to this problem at the US State level. It's a modified version of a solution created by [Bettencourt & Ribeiro 2008](https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0002185) to estimate real-time $R_t$ using a Bayesian approach. While this paper estimates a static $R$ value, here we introduce a process model with Gaussian noise to estimate a time-varying $R_t$.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or improvments feel free to get in touch: [hello@systrom.com](mailto:hello@systrom.com). And if it's not entirely clear, I'm not an epidemiologist. At the same time, data is data, and statistics are statistics and this is based on work by well-known epidemiologists so you can calibrate your beliefs as you wish. In the meantime, I hope you can learn something new as I did by reading through this example. Feel free to take this work and apply it elsewhere \u2013 internationally or to counties in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, a huge thanks to [Frank Dellaert](http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/fdellaert\/) who suggested the addition of the Gaussian process and to [Adam Lerer](http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/adamlerer\/) who implemented the changes.

This is because Bayesian updating uses information from both days and effectively averages the two.

To make it iterative: every day that passes, we use yesterday's prior $P(R_{t-1})$ to estimate today's prior $P(R_t)$.
