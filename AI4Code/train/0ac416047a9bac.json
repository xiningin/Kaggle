Who are **The Data Chicks?**  *Curious?* They're females of different age categories on Kaggle passionate about everything that involves data: from data enthusiasts to Machine Learning experts to students learning data science, and lots more.  Data science and ML are often perceived as male-dominated fields but let\u2019s delve into some data analysis and see what the females are doing on Kaggle while having fun as Chicks hence the name **Data Chicks- *We have fun analyzing Data!***\n\nThis kernel provides everything you need to know about these amazing females even to the minutest details. Here you will get to know who they are, where they are from, what they do, their most preferred programming languages and lots more.\n\n\n\n","a0ab9456":"<a id=\"Tools\"><\/a>\n<h3> 5.4 Let\u2019s Delve Into Some Tool Analysis <\/h3>\n\nWhen it comes to tools, everyone has choices. Let's verify through analysis what Data Chicks preferences are with respect to the tools they use. We like to look into the following:\n\n* *Data Chicks with respect to their most preferred Hosted Notebooks*\n* *Data Chicks and their most preferred Programming Languages.*\n* *Data Chicks and amount of time spent actively coding*\n\nTaking a look at Figure 11, *over 1400 data chicks will prefer to use Local or hosted development environment for their analysis.* This is followed by the choice of Basic Statistical Softwares by 708 data chicks . Cloud-based data software & APIs (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) are used by few data chicks. We can infer from this analysis that **Most data chicks are not into product developement(i.e putting models into production)**. Beacause is they are, they will require the use of cloud-baseed softwares and APIs.\n","6756edd5":" In order to answer the question of **the prevalence discipline among data chicks,** we present a plot in Figure 5 showing the course of study of data chicks. The courses mostly studied are **Computer Science, Mathematics or Statistics and Engineering** having 37%, 17% and 11% of Data Chicks respectively.","df83b9cd":"<a id=\"Industry\"><\/a>\n<h3> 5.3 Data Chicks and their Industry Presence <\/h3>\nThe following questions will be addressed in this section:\n* \tWhat industries do Data Chicks dominate?\n* \tIs there any relationship between their years of experience and Salaries?\n\nFigure 9 shows that over 900 Data Chicks are Students.

Age and Location Demographics of Data Chicks on Kaggle:**\n\nAmong the total respondent of the 2018 Kaggle annual survey, there were **4,010 respondents** declared as **females** which is about **17% of the total.** Among these Data Chicks, the age range with the highest participation is from ages 25-29 with a total of 1,115 respondents followed by ages 22-24 with a total of 1,024 respondents. We can infer from this analysis that the ***most active Data Chicks on Kaggle have their ages ranging from 22-29 years.***\n\nLooking into their geographical location, it is interesting to identify that United State of America (USA) has the highest participating Data Chick in the survey followed by India with a total number of **1,082 Data Chicks and 657 Data Chicks in USA and India respectively.**\n\n**2. Data Chicks Education analysis and Job Roles**\n\nThe field of AI is being perceived as a less-involving field for females due to the technicalities involved in the field. In this survey, we can say this opinion is affirmative because we had 16.8% Data Chicks respondent and 81.4% Male Respondents while 1.4% preferred not to say and 0.3% preferred to self-describe their sex. However, taking a cursory look at the dataset, we observed that ***more Female Kaggle respondent (The Data Chicks) pursue advanced degrees when compared to the Male Kaggle respondents.***  This can be substantiated by the fact that approximately (~) 16% of the Data Chicks have a Doctorate Degree and ~52% of the Data Chicks have Master's Degrees.  While for the male Kaggle respondents, ~14% have Doctorate Degrees and ~45% have Masters Degrees as shown in [Section 5.2.](#Eduanalysis)\n\nIt is interesting to say that by delving deeper into their job roles,, we observed that 10.9% of Data chicks respondents take up job roles as Data Analysts, 4% as Business Analyst and 1.5% Statisticians. A lower percentage was observed when compared to male Kaggle respondents, 7.9% of the Male Kaggle respondents are Data Analysts, 3.2% are business analysts and 1% statistician, most of the population are either Students, Software Engineers or Data Scientist as shown in Table 4 and 5 of [Section 5.2.](#Eduanalysis) This implies that ***more Data Chicks on Kaggle are likely to pick up Data related roles.***","6f224fa3":"<p id=\"Analysis\"> <\/p>\n### 5.0 SURVEY STORY","f74750fb":"<p id=\"Conclusion\"> <\/p>\n### 6.0 CONCLUSION\n\nCarrying out this analysis was indeed fun, eye-opening and as well insightful because it opened up some hidden things in the survey dataset. We were able to identify interesting stuffs about the Data Chicks that participated in the survey. \n\nThese Data Chicks are from 58 differents countries with USA and India having the highest participants. The youths with an age range of 22-29years took the lead in the survey. The Data Chicks are well learned females as most of them are bagded with either a Masters, Bachelors or Doctorate Degree. We were also able to draw an inference from the analysis in section 5.2 that  ***more Female Kaggle respondent (The Data Chicks) pursue advance degrees when compared to the Male Kaggle respondents.***  \n\nThis survey analysis have proven that Data Chicks on kaggle have high potentials to produce results if offered the right platform, given adequate resources, and motivation. They are young, proactive and result oriented women. However, there is a huge gender gap between male and female kaggle survey repondents. This can be addressed by driving female inclusion programmes in the data science community.  More female only competitions can be introduced, training supports and other programmes that encourages women to get involved in data science.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed our analysis. Thank you for your time!","d3529615":"<a id=\"Eduanalysis\"><\/a>\n<h3> 5.2  Data Chicks Education Analysis and Job Roles <\/h3>\nLooking through the responses of some Data Chicks on their discipline and job roles, we were faced with thought-provoking questions about Data Chicks as follows:\n\n* *Are Data Chicks passionate about learning?*\n* *What is the prevalent discipline among Data Chicks?*\n* *Does age really affect the course of study of Data Chicks?*\n* *How about their Job Roles? Is there a divergence from their course of study?*\n* *What field do we find Data Chicks with the highest qualifications?*\n\nIn Figure 4 showing a plot of the data chicks and their level of education, we can see that a total of 2,054 data chicks have a master's degree and 626 data chicks have a doctorate degree, that gives us approximately **52% of data chicks with a master's degree** and **16% of data chicks with doctorate degrees!** This gives an insight into the crave for knowledge among females on Kaggle. By doing a comparative analysis with male kaggle respondents, we observed *a lower percentage of males with masters and doctorate degree,* **14% have doctorate degrees** and **~45% have masters degrees** as shown in Table 3.\n","cc580dd3":"<p id=\"ReadData\">\n    <h3> 4.2 Reading in Datasets <\/h3>\n<\/p>\nHere we read in the multiple choice csv file to perform our analysis.","087305ae":"We present in Figure 2 using a Choropleth map, the numbers of Data Chicks respondent and their geographical spread across the globe.

This survey represents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning as most of the respondents were found primarily through Kaggle channels, email list, discussion forums and social media channels. The survey was live for one week in October 2018, and after the data was cleaned, it had **23,859 responses** from 147 countries and territories.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaggle\/kaggle-survey-2018\/home\">Further details about the dataset can be found here. <\/a>\n\nIn this analysis, we will be considering the female respondents in the dataset with primary focus on the multipleChoiceResponse.csv file.\n\nThe multipleChoiceResponse.csv contains **50 multiple choice questions**, with some questions containing subparts totaling to 395 column entries and 23,860 row count. The first row contains the description of the questions, while the remaining 23,859 row represents the participant responses. \nThe **female respondents** consist of approximately **17% of the dataset.** Our analysis and results are based on this sample size. \n\n","6986e1e9":"*How about their Job Roles? Is their a divergence from their course of study?*  \nIn Table 4, we observed that 10.9% of Data chicks respondents take up job roles as Data Analysts, 4% as Business Analyst and 1.5% Statisticians. A lower percentage was observed when compared to male Kaggle respondents in Table 5, 7.9% of the Male Kaggle respondents are Data Analysts, 3.2% are business analysts and 1% statistician. This implies that ***more Data Chicks on Kaggle are likely to pick up Data related roles.***\n\nIn Figure 7, we also observed that over 400 data chicks who studied computer science are students. Also, over 250 are Data Engineers and over 200 are Data Scientists. We can also find over 100 Data Chicks who studied Mathematics or Statistics taking up Data Engineering and Data Science roles. Other disciplines like Medicine, and Art related fields has low representation of Data Analyst, Data Scientist and Data Engineers. From this result we can say **Data Chicks on Kaggle position themselves into careers that focus on the 4th Industrial Revolution**. It was also identified that some of the Data Chicks that studied non-IT related courses are taking up job roles as Data Scientist.","f67c02c4":"*What field do we find Data Chicks with the highest qualifications?* In figure 8, we observed that over 500 Data Chicks are Master's degree students. The top 3 job roles with high number of master degree holders are *Data scientist with 400 Data Chicks,*  *Data Analyst with over 200 Data Chicks* and *Software Engineering with over 150 Data Chicks.* Also looking at the job roles of ***Data Chicks with doctorate degrees***, we have a high number as ***Data Scientist, Students and Research Scientist.*** ","c1ceab60":"<p id=\"DataPreps\"><\/p>\n### 4.0 DATA PREPARATIONS\n\n * <a href=\"#Libraries\">4.1 Libraries Used<\/a>\n * <a href=\"#ReadData\">4.2 Reading in Datasets<\/a>\n *  <a href=\"#DataManipulation\">4.3 Data Manipulation<\/a>","9ea478bf":"<a id=\"Demograph\"><\/a>\n<h3> 5.1  All you need to know about the age and geographical location of Data Chicks on Kaggle. <\/h3>\nI am sure that there are several questions racing through your mind about Data Chicks demographics, here we will address some questions relating to the age and location of data chicks.
