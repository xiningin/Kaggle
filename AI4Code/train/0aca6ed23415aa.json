Inspecting  various feature types\n\nThere are 4 types of features that i can broadly classify this dataset as,\n\n* Categorical features:\n  * Nominal Type : labels do not express implicit order\n  * Ordinal Type : labels have an implicit order.\n  \n\n* Numerical \/ Continuous features\n\n\n* Temporal features\n\n\n## 2.1 Categorical features\n\n\n### 2.1.1 Nominal features\n\nAt this stage we will plot the strip plots for all the categorical features so that we can:\n* find out features that do not contain info\n\n\n* features that might be more expressive if we somehow combine them or simplify them\n\n\n* features that do ot have much target value variation across different categories... They are useless too if we cannot find any good correlation for that feature with other features as they do not have any pattern we can harness to improve predicitons.\n\n\nWe will be using strip plot with boxplot, you can also use swarm plot but it hides boxplots so we will be using strip plots... the idea is that these plots tell what is the distribution of instances in different categories, we will be easily able to visualize in which category the most of the instances are concentrated.","50fed736":"**Findings** : From the above plots we can infer a lot of important things, there are alot of features that only conatin mostly one type of label, a lot of feature that have to many missing values, features that do not have any similar mean target value across its various categories which is not a good thing as there is no differentiation possible within different categories... lets list all these findings feature wise. ***`No Garage` label that we imputed earlier is actually a pretty informative one, house with no garage are less expensive, which is quite intuitive!!*** \n\n**To drop**: There a lot of features that we can drop!! they just do not give any info gain or they have too many missing value or have similar target means.\n* `BsmtFinType2`: most instances concentrated in `Unf`, plus the mean target value for labels in this feature is also not to informative as mean value for all the labels lie close to each other, its better to just concentrate on `BsmtFinType1`.\n\n\n* `BsmtHalfBath`: too many instances in label `0` and mean target value is same for the labels, it does not provide any info whatsoever.\n\n\n* `Condition2`: Almost all the instances lie in `Norm`, no info gain.\n\n\n* `Electrical`: Quite a lot of instances are with label `SBrkr`, i do not think it will be as useful, i would rather not increase 3-4 one hot columns in my dataset by keeping it and increasing dimensionality and increase chances of overfitting.\n\n\n* `Exterior2nd`: A copy of `Exterior1st` feature, cardinality is too high, lets just keep one of them\n\n\n* `Functional`: Too many instances in the `Typ` label.\n\n\n* `Heating`: Too many instances in the `GasA` label.\n\n\n* `KitchenAbvGr`: Too many instances in the `1` label.\n\n\n* `LandSlope`: Too many instances in the `Gtl` label and it seems to somewhat related to `LandContour` and `LotShape`.\n\n\n* `RoofMatl`: almost all the instances have label `CompShg`, No information gain.\n \n\n* `Street`: almost all the instances have label `Pave`, No information gain.\n\n\n* `Utilities`: almost all the instances have label `AllPub`, No information gain.\n\n\n* `RoofStyle` : not informative, two labels `Gable` and `Hip` have most of the instances and there spreads are quite equivalent\n\n\n* `LotConfig` : the spread is equivalent and the means are around the same values\n\nNow, it is not necessary to drop these features, an expert in the field related to houses can find really good relations betweem these features that are based on human inference based on experience and field expertise, but statistical tests such as `chi-square test` will not be able to unfold those hidden relations that only an expert can infer, so we will have to drop these features.\n\n**Combine labels**: there are a lot of features that have labels that are somewhat similar in the sense that there mean target values are similar, so we can essentially say that if these labels are not related to some other labels in othe categorical features, if we combine them together into a single label, we will not be dropping any information, rather we will be decreasing the dimensionality and cardinality of our categorical labels and also reducing labels will very few instances present with them and combine these labels into a new label `other` with increased number of instances present with it. Again, an analysis to find out which labels are actually related to some other labels in other categorical variables will require a lot of in depth analysis, that is better down by a domain expert.\n\n\n*benefit we get by doing so is that we combine labels with very few instances and similar target means which is a label quite similar to these labels with increased instances present for it, hence increasing its significance.*\n\nFirst we have to convert MSSubClass to 'object' and then combine its labels\n\n* `MSSubClass` : combine labels `20 + 75 + 70 + 80` to `label_1`, `40 + 50 + 85 + 90 + 190` to `label_2` and `45 + 30 + 180` to\n`label_3`\n\n\n* `Condition1` : combine labels `PosN + RRNn + PosA + RRNe + RRAn`  as `PPRRR` and `Feedr + Artery + RRAe` as `FAR`\n\n\n* `BldgType`: combine labels `2fmCon`, `Duplex` and `Twnhs` to new label `other`.\n\n\n* `BsmtFinType1`: combine labels ` ALQ`, `Rec`, `BLQ`, `LwQ`  into `other`.\n\n\n* `Foundation`: combine labels `Wood`, `Slab` and `Stone` into `other`.\n\n\n* `GarageType`: combine labels `Detchd`, `CarPort`, `Basment` and `2Types` into `other`.\n\n\n* `LotShape`: combine labels `IR2` and `IR3` into `other`.\n\n\n* `MasVnrType`: combine labels `None` and `BrkCmn` into `other`.\n\n\n* `SaleCondition`: combine labels `AdjLand`, `Alloca`, `Family` and `Abnorml`\n\n\n* `SaleType`: combine labels `COD`, `ConLD`, `ConLI`, `CwD`, `ConLw`, `Con` and `Oth` into `other`.\n\n\n* `HouseStyle`: cobine labels `2Story + 2.5Fin` into `label_1`, `SFoyer + 1.5Fin` into `label_2`, `SLvl + 1Story` into `label_3` and `1.5Unf + 2.5Unf` into `label_4`.\n\n\n* `PavedDrive`: combine labels `N` and `P` into `other`.\n\n\n* `MSZoning`: combine `C (all)`, `RM` and `RH` into `other`.\n\n\n* `Neighborhood` : combine `MeadowV + BrDale + IDOTRR` to`MBD`, `Sawyer + NAmes + NPkVill + Mitchel + SWISU + Blueste` to \n`SNNSBM`, `Gilbert + Blmngtn + SawyerW + NWAmes` to `SNGB`, `ClearCr + CollgCr + Crawfor` to `CCC`, `Veenker + Timber + \nSomerst` to `VTS`, `OldTown + Edwards + BrkSide` to `OBE`, `StoneBr + NridgHt + NoRidge` to `SNN`.","d2139fa0":"# Final Data set creation","630ea200":"### 2.1.2 Ordinal features \n\n\nI feel this category deserves its own separate analysis too other than as above where we just combined it together with categorical type, i purposeful not include any oridnal features into analysis.

When we look at ordinal features in our dataset. Po(Poor), Fa(Fair), TA(Average), Gd(Good), Ex(Excellent) should follow 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 where they are highly correlated with the hosue price, if thats the case it makes things easy. But thats not the case for many ordinal features and main reason being lack of instances in some of these ordinal categories, So we will either combine labels to extract value or just drop such features. Lets check them out.\n\n* `ExterCond` : Mean target value for Gd is below TA and Ex has too less instances so we do not know what its actual range should be, but all in all, moreover more than 87% instances are in TA, feature itself does not contribute much info, plus the fact that oridanly encoding it will just create a numeric feature not correlated with target makes things worse. So we will drop it.\n\n\n* `GarageQual` : Again a feature that will not be correlated with target if encoded in ordinal fashion, it has almost 90 % instances in TA label, not much info.\n\n\n* `GarageCond` : Same reason as above.\n\n\n**Combine labels**: Now as we have discussed about the Trap, Not all ordinal features are like that, There are some really great features that will correlate very well with target if ordinally encoded!!\n\n* `ExterQual` : Spreads are quite great!! They quite efficaciously capture the price ranges increase with label level increase. We can combine `Fa` and `TA` to `other`.\n\n\n* `BsmtQual` : This feature is great a proper defination of ordinal feature!! just check out the spreads, they are highly correlated with target, by combining labels `No Basement` and `Fa` into `other`, we make these distintions even clearer. \n\n\n* `BsmtCond` : combine `No Basement`, `Fa` and `Po` into `other`.\n\n\n* `BsmtExposure` : combine `Mn`, `Av` into `other`.\n\n\n* `HeatingQC` : combine `Po`, `Fa`, `TA` into `other`.\n\n\n* `KitchenQual` : combine `TA` and `Fa` into `other`.\n\n\n* `GarageFinish` : combine `No Garage` and `Unf` into `other`.\n\n\n***Now the only thing we have to know is whether it would be best to one hot encode the ordinal features or perform an ordinal encoding. We already have dropped a lot of cardinality one hot encoding might prove to be a better option!!***","4ff14679":"**Findings**:\n* `TotalPorch` feature is not a good feature when it comes to its correlation with the Target, we should just drop all porch features except `OpenPorchSF`.","4cf32fb7":"## 3.4 Creating feature through feature interactions\n\n\nFeature interaction is basically observed when 2 or more than 2 variables are combined together by multiplying them with each other. \n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n\nTo create feature interaction between our various continuous features we first have to decide what is the maximum degree of interaction features can be, then class PolynomialFeatures() can then combine all the given features with every combination possible upto degree 3, it might be the case that some of the features may have correlation with target that is even greater than the features we currently have with us, but these interaction features will be correlated to the features it was based upon, But it is not always the case that interaction feature is correlated to  the interacting features, given the fact that there existed some hidden relation between these features which was expressed when these features were combined and overpowered the feature interaction actually become independent of the interacting feature, But we were not that lucky `:(` !! \n\n* we will be creating a super feature out of the best correlated features we have.\n\n* then we will create an interaction feature out of those features which are not correlated well with the Target and try obtaining a feature which is a little better correlated and then drop the interacting features.","f6a53522":"**Findings**: feature `MoSold` and `YrSold` are too stable, they do not show any trend which can be harnessed by the model to make better predictions as there is differentiating factor, unless we can do some in depth time series analysis, we might not be able to utilize these feature hence we have to drop them.\n* To drop : `MoSold` and `YrSold`","8f4f2fbd":"Lets first lets create ordinal encoding of ordinal features which we can drop through the FeatureSelection class.","41ecb281":"### 3.4.1 creating a highly correlated feature","867bf482":"Our new feature looks awesome!! it already shows no signs of heteroscedasticity and has excellent collinearity with the Target...
