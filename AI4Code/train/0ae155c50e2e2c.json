Let's create a set of points on a plane (2 features), each point will be one of two classes (+1 for red, or -1 for yellow). If you look at it as a classification problem, it seems very simple: the classes are separated by a line. ","71317a66":"This is often done in one of two ways:\n- setting aside a part of the dataset (*held-out\/hold-out set*). Thus we reserve a fraction of the training set (typically from 20% to 40%), train the model on the remaining data (60-80% of the original set), and compute performance metrics for the model (e.g accuracy) on the hold-out set.\n- *cross-validation*. The most frequent case here is *k-fold cross-validation*.","a839d38c":"## 3. Nearest Neighbors Method\n\n*The nearest neighbors method* (k-Nearest Neighbors, or k-NN) is another very popular classification method that is also sometimes used in regression problems. This, like decision trees, is one of the most comprehensible approaches to classification. The underlying intuition is that you look like your neighbors. More formally, the method follows the compactness hypothesis: if the distance between the examples is measured well enough, then similar examples are much more likely to belong to the same class.","905feb01":"Let's draw the resulting tree. Due to the fact that it is not entirely a toy example (its maximum depth is 6), the picture is not that small, but you can \"walk\" over the tree if you click on the picture.","eaf7500b":"### Complex Case for the Nearest Neighbors Method\nLet's consider another simple example.

The entropy of this group is $S_1 = -\\frac{5}{13}\\log_2{\\frac{5}{13}}-\\frac{8}{13}\\log_2{\\frac{8}{13}} \\approx 0.96$. The right group has 7 balls, 1 blue and 6 yellow. The entropy of the right group is $S_2 = -\\frac{1}{7}\\log_2{\\frac{1}{7}}-\\frac{6}{7}\\log_2{\\frac{6}{7}} \\approx 0.6$. As you can see, entropy has decreased in both groups, more so in the right group. Since entropy is, in fact, the degree of chaos (or uncertainty) in the system, the reduction in entropy is called information gain. Formally, the information gain (IG) for a split based on the variable $Q$ (in this example it's a variable \"$x \\leq 12$\") is defined as","85286340":"In k-fold cross-validation, the model is trained $K$ times on different ($K-1$) subsets of the original dataset (in white) and checked on the remaining subset (each time a different one, shown above in orange).\nWe obtain $K$ model quality assessments that are usually averaged to give an overall average quality of classification\/regression.\n\nCross-validation provides a better assessment of the model quality on new data compared to the hold-out set approach. However, cross-validation is computationally expensive when you have a lot of data.\n \nCross-validation is a very important technique in machine learning and can also be applied in statistics and econometrics. It helps with hyperparameter tuning, model comparison, feature evaluation, etc. More details can be found [here](https:\/\/sebastianraschka.com\/blog\/2016\/model-evaluation-selection-part1.html) (blog post by Sebastian Raschka) or in any classic textbook on machine (statistical) learning.","2c1572e9":"Now let\u2019s make predictions on our holdout set.

Some of the most popular **tasks *T* in machine learning** are the following:\n\n- classification of an instance to one of the categories based on its features;\n- regression \u2013 prediction of a numerical target feature based on other features of an instance;\n- clustering \u2013 identifying partitions of instances based on the features of these instances so that the members within the groups are more similar to each other than those in the other groups;\n- anomaly detection \u2013 search for instances that are \"greatly dissimilar\" to the rest of the sample or to some group of instances;\n- and so many more.\n\nA good overview is provided in the \"Machine Learning basics\" chapter of [\"Deep Learning\"](http:\/\/www.deeplearningbook.org) (by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, 2016).\n\n**Experience *E* ** refers to data (we can't go anywhere without it). Machine learning algorithms can be divided into those that are trained in *supervised* or *unsupervised* manner. In unsupervised learning tasks, one has a *set* consisting of *instances* described by a set of *features*. In supervised learning problems, there's also a *target variable*, which is what we would like to be able to predict, known for each instance in a *training set*. ","fb41d681":"Here, the tree proved to be better than the nearest neighbors algorithm: 94.2%\/96.6% accuracy for cross-validation and hold-out respectively. Decision trees perform very well, and even random forest (let's think of it for now as a bunch of trees that work better together) in this example cannot achieve better performance (95.1%\/95.3%) despite being trained for much longer. ","f1dd643e":"Furthermore, when there are a lot of numeric features in a dataset, each with a lot of unique values, only the top-N of the thresholds described above are selected, i.e. only use the top-N that give maximum gain. The process is to construct a tree of depth 1, compute the entropy (or Gini uncertainty), and select the best thresholds for comparison.\n\nTo illustrate, if we split by \"Salary $\\leq$ 34.5\", the left subgroup will have an entropy of 0 (all clients are \"bad\"), and the right one will have an entropy of 0.954 (3 \"bad\" and 5 \"good\", you can check this yourself as it will be part of the assignment). The information gain is roughly 0.3.\nIf we split by \"Salary $\\leq$ 95\", the left subgroup will have the entropy of 0.97 (6 \"bad\" and 4 \"good\"), and the right one will have the entropy of 0 (a group containing only one object). The information gain is about 0.11.\nIf we calculate information gain for each partition in that manner, we can select the thresholds for comparison of each numeric feature before the construction of a large tree (using all features).\n\nMore examples of numeric feature discretization can be found in posts like [this](http:\/\/kevinmeurer.com\/a-simple-guide-to-entropy-based-discretization\/) or [this](http:\/\/clear-lines.com\/blog\/post\/Discretizing-a-continuous-variable-using-Entropy.aspx).

At the bottom of the tree, at some great depth, there will be partitions on less important features (e.g. whether a client came from Leeds or New York). We can exaggerate this story further and find that all four clients who came to the bank for a loan in green trousers did not return the loan. Even if that were true in training, we do not want our classification model to generate such specific rules.\n \nThere are two exceptions where the trees are built to the maximum depth:\n- Random Forest (a group of trees) averages the responses from individual trees that are built to the maximum depth (we will talk later on why you should do this)\n- *Pruning* trees. In this approach, the tree is first constructed to the maximum depth. Then, from the bottom up, some nodes of the tree are removed by comparing the quality of the tree with and without that partition (comparison is performed using *cross-validation*, more on this below).\n\nThe picture below is an example of a dividing border built in an overfitted tree. \n","0c6ce596":"#### Example\nLet's consider fitting a decision tree to some synthetic data.

Calculate the distance to each of the samples in the training set.\n2. Select $k$ samples from the training set with the minimal distance to them.\n3. The class of the test sample will be the most frequent class among those $k$ nearest neighbors.\n\nThe method adapts quite easily for the regression problem: on step 3, it returns not the class, but the number \u2013 a mean (or median) of the target variable among neighbors.\n \nA notable feature of this approach is its laziness \u2013 calculations are only done during the prediction phase, when a test sample needs to be classified. No model is constructed from the training examples beforehand. In contrast, recall that for decision trees in the first half of this article the tree is constructed based on the training set, and the classification of test cases occurs relatively quickly by traversing through the tree.\n \nNearest neighbors is a well-studied approach. There exist many important theorems claiming that, on \"endless\" datasets, it is the optimal method of classification. The authors of the classic book \"The Elements of Statistical Learning\" consider k-NN to be a theoretically ideal algorithm which usage is only limited by computation power and the [curse of dimensionality](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Curse_of_dimensionality).

Pros and Cons of Decision Trees and the Nearest Neighbors Method\n\n### Decision trees\n\nPros:\n- Generation of clear human-understandable classification rules, e.g. \"if age <25 and is interested in motorcycles, deny the loan\". This property is called interpretability of the model.\n- Decision trees can be easily visualized, i.e. both the model itself (the tree) and prediction for a certain test object (a path in the tree) can \"be interpreted\".\n- Fast training and forecasting.\n- Small number of model parameters.\n- Supports both numerical and categorical features.\n\nCons:\n \n- The trees are very sensitive to the noise in input data; the whole model could change if the training set is slightly modified (e.g. remove a feature, add some objects). This impairs the interpretability of the model.\n- Separating border built by a decision tree has its limitations \u2013 it consists of hyperplanes perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, which is inferior in quality to some other methods, in practice.\n- We need to avoid overfitting by pruning, setting a minimum number of samples in each leaf, or defining a maximum depth for the tree. Note that overfitting is an issue for all machine learning methods.\n- Instability. Small changes to the data can significantly change the decision tree. This problem is tackled with decision tree ensembles (discussed next time).\n- The optimal decision tree search problem is NP-complete. Some heuristics are used in practice such as greedy search for a feature with maximum information gain, but it does not guarantee finding the globally optimal tree.\n- Difficulties to support missing values in the data. Friedman estimated that it took about 50% of the code to support gaps in data in CART (an improved version of this algorithm is implemented in `sklearn`).\n- The model can only interpolate but not extrapolate (the same is true for random forests and tree boosting). That is, a decision tree makes constant prediction for the objects that lie beyond the bounding box set by the training set in the feature space. In our example with the yellow and blue balls, it would mean that the model gives the same predictions for all balls with positions >19 or <0.","f61b33e2":"$$ \\Large IG(x \\leq 12) = S_0 - \\frac{13}{20}S_1 - \\frac{7}{20}S_2 \\approx 0.16.$$","580b6673":"The quality of classification\/regression with k-NN depends on several parameters:\n\n- The number of neighbors $k$.\n- The distance measure between samples (common ones include Hamming, Euclidean, cosine, and Minkowski distances). Note that most of these metrics require data to be scaled. Simply speaking, we do not want the \"salary\" feature, which is on the order of thousands, to affect the distance more than \"age\", which is generally less than 100. \n- Weights of neighbors (each neighbor may contribute different weights; for example, the further the sample, the lower the weight).","facc8f81":"### How a Decision Tree Works with Numerical Features\n\nSuppose we have a numeric feature \"Age\" that has a lot of unique values. A decision tree will look for the best (according to some criterion of information gain) split by checking binary attributes such as \"Age <17\", \"Age < 22.87\", and so on. But what if the age range is large? Or what if another quantitative variable, \"salary\", can also be \"cut\" in many ways? There will be too many binary attributes to select from at each step during tree construction. To resolve this problem, heuristics are usually used to limit the number of thresholds to which we compare the quantitative variable.\n \nLet's consider an example.

By the way, [Alexander Dyakonov](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dyakonov), a former top-1 kaggler, loves the simplest k-NN but with the tuned object similarity metric;\n- Good interpretability. There are exceptions: if the number of neighbors is large, the interpretability deteriorates (\"We did not give him a loan, because he is similar to the 350 clients, of which 70 are the bad, and that is 12% higher than the average for the dataset\").\n\nCons:\n- Method considered fast in comparison with compositions of algorithms, but the number of neighbors used for classification is usually large (100-150) in real life, in which case the algorithm will not operate as fast as a decision tree.\n- If a dataset has many variables, it is difficult to find the right weights and to determine which features are not important for classification\/regression.\n- Dependency on the selected distance metric between the objects. Selecting the Euclidean distance by default is often unfounded. You can find a good solution by grid searching over parameters, but this becomes very time consuming for large datasets.\n- There are no theoretical ways to choose the number of neighbors \u2013 only grid search (though this is often true for all hyperparameters of all models). In the case of a small number of neighbors, the method is sensitive to outliers, that is, it is inclined to overfit.\n- As a rule, it does not work well when there are a lot of features due to the \"curse of dimensionality\". Professor Pedro Domingos, a well-known member in the ML community, talks about it [here](https:\/\/homes.cs.washington.edu\/~pedrod\/papers\/cacm12.pdf) in his popular paper, \"A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning\"; also \"the curse of dimensionality\" is described in the Deep Learning book in [this chapter](http:\/\/www.deeplearningbook.org\/contents\/ml.html).\n\nThis is a lot of information, but, hopefully, this article will be a great reference for you for a long time :)","9a949a5e":"Let\u2019s train a random forest on the same dataset, it works better than k-NN on the majority of datasets.

For example, as a credit institution, we may want to predict loan defaults based on the data accumulated about our clients. Here, the experience *E* is the available training data: a set of *instances* (clients), a collection of *features* (such as age, salary, type of loan, past loan defaults, etc.) for each, and a *target variable* (whether they defaulted on the loan). This target variable is just a fact of loan default (1 or 0), so recall that this is a (binary) classification problem. If you were instead predicting *by how much time* the loan payment is overdue, this would become a regression problem.\n \nFinally, the third term used in the definition of machine learning is a **metric of the algorithm's performance evaluation *P*.** Such metrics differ for various problems and algorithms, and we'll discuss them as we study new algorithms. For now, we'll refer to a simple metric for classification algorithms, the proportion of correct answers \u2013 *accuracy* \u2013 on the test set.\n \nLet's take a look at two supervised learning problems: classification and regression.","37a3a1d9":"## 5.

To illustrate further, 43.5 is the average of 38 and 49 years; a 38-year-old customer failed to return the loan whereas the 49-year-old did. The tree looks for the values at which the target class switches its value as a threshold for \"cutting\" a quantitative variable.\n \nGiven this information, why do you think it makes no sense here to consider a feature like \"Age <17.5\"?","f105cf5d":"We got this overly complex construction, although the solution is just a straight line $x_1 = x_2$.","d777ca8a":"It turns out that dividing the balls into two groups by splitting on \"coordinate is less than or equal to 12\" gave us a more ordered system.

The advantage of this algorithm is that they are easily interpretable. For example, using the above scheme, the bank can explain to the client why they were denied for a loan: e.g the client does not own a house and her income is less than 5,000.\n\nAs we'll see later, many other models, although more accurate, do not have this property and can be regarded as more of a \"black box\" approach, where it is harder to interpret how the input data was transformed into the output. Due to this \"understandability\" and similarity to human decision-making (you can easily explain your model to your boss), decision trees have gained immense popularity. C4.5, a representative of this group of classification methods, is even the first in the list of 10 best data mining algorithms (\"Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining\", Knowledge and Information Systems, 2008.

The initial decision could be a recommendation of a product (or service) that is popular among the *closest neighbors* of the person for whom we want to make a recommendation;\n- In practice, on large datasets, approximate methods of search are often used for nearest neighbors.

Then the procedure is repeated recursively until the entropy is zero (or some small value to account for overfitting). Different algorithms use different heuristics for \"early stopping\" or \"cut-off\" to avoid constructing an overfitted tree. \n\n```python\ndef build(L):\n    create node t\n    if the stopping criterion is True:\n        assign a predictive model to t\n    else:\n        Find the best binary split L = L_left + L_right\n        t.left = build(L_left)\n        t.right = build(L_right)\n    return t     \n```","a996423b":"### Class DecisionTreeClassifier in Scikit-learn\nThe main parameters of the [`sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) class are:\n\n- `max_depth` \u2013 the maximum depth of the tree;\n- `max_features` - the maximum number of features with which to search for the best partition (this is necessary with a large number of features because it would be \"expensive\" to search for partitions for *all* features);\n- `min_samples_leaf` \u2013 the minimum number of samples in a leaf.

The entropy of the initial state was maximal, $S=1$. Then, the first partition of the samples into 2 groups was made by comparing the value of $x_2$ with $1.211$ (find this part of the border in the picture above). With that, the entropy of both left and right groups decreased. The process continues up to depth 3. In this visualization, the more samples of the first class, the darker the orange color of the vertex; the more samples of the second class, the darker the blue. At the beginning, the number of samples from two classes is equal, so the root node of the tree is white.","98afa007":"The method of one nearest neighbor does better than the tree but is still not as good as a linear classifier (our next topic).","9beef866":"## 7.

But, for the left group, we need three more. Note that the entropy of a group where all of the balls are the same color is equal to 0 ($\\log_2{1} = 0$).\n\nWe have successfully constructed a decision tree that predicts ball color based on its position. This decision tree may not work well if we add any balls because it has perfectly fit to the training set (initial 20 balls). If we wanted to do well in that case, a tree with fewer \"questions\" or splits would be more accurate, even if it does not perfectly fit the training set. We will discuss the problem of overfitting later. ","f85788e3":"However, the border that the decision tree builds is too complicated; plus the tree itself is very deep.

Choosing Model Parameters and Cross-Validation \n\nThe main task of learning algorithms is to be able to *generalize* to unseen data.

But what variable to look at first? Let's discuss a simple example where all the variables are binary.\n \nRecall the game of \"20 Questions\", which is often referenced when introducing decision trees. You've probably played this game -- one person thinks of a celebrity while the other tries to guess by asking only \"Yes\" or \"No\" questions. What question will the guesser ask first? Of course, they will ask the one that narrows down the number of the remaining options the most. Asking \"Is it Angelina Jolie?\" would, in the case of a negative response, leave all but one celebrity in the realm of possibility. In contrast, asking \"Is the celebrity a woman?\" would reduce the possibilities to roughly half. That is to say, the \"gender\" feature separates the celebrity dataset much better than other features like \"Angelina Jolie\", \"Spanish\", or \"loves football.\" This reasoning corresponds to the concept of information gain based on entropy.","2fbc31d5":"### Class `KNeighborsClassifier` in Scikit-learn\nThe main parameters of the class `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier` are:\n- weights: `uniform` (all weights are equal), `distance` (the weight is inversely proportional to the distance from the test sample), or any other user-defined function;\n- algorithm (optional): `brute`, `ball_tree `, `KD_tree`, or `auto`. In the first case, the nearest neighbors for each test case are computed by a grid search over the training set.
