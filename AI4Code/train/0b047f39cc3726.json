Examples of common data augmentation techniques for images are rotation, flipping, perspective warping, brightness changes and contrast changes. For natural photo images such as the ones we are using here, a standard set of augmentations that we have found work pretty well are provided with the aug_transforms function. Because our images are now all the same size, we can apply these augmentations to an entire batch of them using the GPU, which will save a lot of time. To tell fastai we want to use these transforms on a batch, we use the batch_tfms parameter (note that we're not using RandomResizedCrop in this example, so you can see the differences more clearly; we're also using double the amount of augmentation compared to the default, for the same reason) \n*Source:* https:\/\/github.com\/fastai\/fastbook\/blob\/master\/02_production.ipynb","ce9a4c9e":"Model predictions can vary due to various reasons. In the above example, it seems the label (teddy) in the given dataset was wrong, but the model predicted correctly (black). However, since the image has a mix of black and white colors, the confidence of prediction is only 0.51. The loss rate is low, which indicates that the model performance is good.\n\nfast.ai provides a very handy function to clean the faulty images, such as deleting images or renaming their lables. This greatly helps in data preprocessing and greatly improves model accuracy. Jeremy suggests running this function after doing a basic training on the images, as this gives an idea of the kind of anamolies in the dataset.\n\nThis GUI for data cleaning, ImageClassifierCleaner allows you to choose a category and the training versus validation set and view the highest-loss images (in order), along with menus to allow images to be selected for removal or relabeling.","7664895a":"In this lesson, Bing image search API is used to search for required images, and then classify them based on the given criteria.

To avoid overfitting image transformation is a must. There are different way in image can be transformed like shown in the above examples. However, squishing and padding robs the original information from the images and adds additional pixels respectively. Hence randomly resizing the images yields good result. In this method as shown in the below example, random areas of each image is sampled during every epoch. This enables the model to learn more details of each image yielding better accuracy.**\n\n**Another important point to remember is, always tranform only the training images and do not modify the validation images.
