Let's look into the interests some more!","5f66c2bf":"It looks like regardless of your attractiveness, or any other trait for that matter, you are just as likely to experience heartbreak!\n\nIt also looks like typically, your own opinion of how attractive you are (attr3_1) is only weakly correlated with how attractive your date finds you (attr_o)! And in fact, there is nearly no correlation between how smart or sincere you think you are versus how smart and sincere your date thinks of you! Perhaps these are tough qualities to get across in a 4 minute date!\n\nSo that brings up the question, between attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and liking, what was the most influential in the final decision (dec)? I'll run a linear regression model.","460d41a9":"#### Lets start Analysis ","f2f258fe":"XGBoost was ever so slightly less accurate than Random Forest in the validation set.

Don't panic though, this is just from 4 minutes of meeting each other!
