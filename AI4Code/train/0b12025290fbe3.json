The objective of this assignment is to develop a solid understanding of Numpy array operations. In this assignment you will:\n> \n> 1. Pick 5 interesting Numpy array functions by going through the documentation: https:\/\/numpy.org\/doc\/stable\/reference\/routines.html \n> 2. Run and modify this Jupyter notebook to illustrate their usage (some explanation and 3 examples for each function). Use your imagination to come up with interesting and unique examples.\n> 3. Upload this notebook to your Jovian profile using `jovian.commit` and make a submission here: https:\/\/jovian.ml\/learn\/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas\/assignment\/assignment-2-numpy-array-operations\n> 4. (Optional) Share your notebook online (on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) and on the community forum thread: https:\/\/jovian.ml\/forum\/t\/assignment-2-numpy-array-operations-share-your-work\/10575 . \n> 5. (Optional) Check out the notebooks [shared by other participants](https:\/\/jovian.ml\/forum\/t\/assignment-2-numpy-array-operations-share-your-work\/10575) and give feedback & appreciation.\n>\n> The recommended way to run this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\". This will run the notebook on mybinder.org, a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks.\n>\n> Try to give your notebook a catchy title & subtitle e.g. \"All about Numpy array operations\", \"5 Numpy functions you didn't know you needed\", \"A beginner's guide to broadcasting in Numpy\", \"Interesting ways to create Numpy arrays\", \"Trigonometic functions in Numpy\", \"How to use Python for Linear Algebra\" etc.\n>\n> **NOTE**: Remove this block of explanation text before submitting or sharing your notebook online - to make it more presentable.\n\n\n# Playing with Fourier Transformation\n\n\n### Subtitle Here\n\nWrite a short introduction about Numpy and list the chosen functions. \n\n- function 1\n- function 2\n- function 3\n- function 4\n- function 5\n\nThe recommended way to run this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\".
