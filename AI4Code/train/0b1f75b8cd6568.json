A streaming service maybe paid\/unpaid subscription that lets you stream songs with a stable internet connection on your device. A paid subscription also lets you download songs on to your device to be listened to anytime even with your internet connection.\n\nCurrently, Spotify and Apple Music are the top two streaming services available. Apple Music is primarily used by iOS\/MacOS users while Spotify is used by any platform using internet services. Currently, as of 2020, Spotify has about 130 million subscribers compared to Apple Music with 75 million subscribers.\n\nHence, we can say Spotify is the leading music service by quite a distance. These music streams use curated playlists through various ML recommendation systems that keep feeding you with interesting songs and hence, keeping you interested in their services constantly.\n\nThrough this kernel, we would like to analyse the top 50 songs published by Spotify in 2019. We will check the various genres, popularity and some other features that made the songs to famous amongst the users.\n\n![34173-original.jpg](attachment:34173-original.jpg)\n\n# Importing the relevant libraries and dataset","14c0445b":"These were the four features that had high variance.

The notable other artists with more than 1 song have been shown above. All other artists had not more than 1 song in the top 50.\n\n\n## b) Top Genres of 2019\n\nLet us now check which genre of songs made it the most to the most to the top 50.

Hence, we shall directly head to data visualisation section.\n\n# Data Visualisation\n\n\n## a) Top Artists of 2019\n\nLet us check which artists featured most frequently in the top 50 songs.
