Math was the subject that students had the worst performance and writing has the best performance. In the analysis by gender, the performance are practically the same between male and famele, but the performance of females is a little better. While fameles were better in writing and reading, males were better in math, but nothing was so different in each subject.\n\nAfter conversion of the avarege scores in grades happened a separation of students by theses grades.The best students had grades A and the worst grades E\/F. Although the majority of students had grades above E\/F, the group E\/F had the largest number of students.\n\nWhen is made a comparasion about the characteristics between students in the group A and E\/F, ethnicity was not relevant since both groups had the same results, the most part of the students are in the group C of ethnicity and teh least part in the group E of ethnicity. The same situation happened with the comparasion about exams preparations, in boths groups the students didn't a exam preparation.\n\nThe features that had differents results were lunch and the level of parents education. In lunch, the group of students A had standard lunch and the group E\/F had a result almost divided, but the most part had standart lunch. In the level of parents education, the most part of parents of group A studied something after the high school, this is different with parents of group E\/F.
