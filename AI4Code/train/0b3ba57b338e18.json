However, instead of comparing the raw intermediate outputs of the base input image and the style image, we instead compare the Gram matrices of the two outputs. \n\nMathematically, we describe the style loss of the input image (generated image), $x$, and the style image, $a$, as the distance between the style representation (the gram matrices) of these images. We describe the style representation of an image as the correlation between different filter responses given by the Gram matrix  $G^l$, where $G^l_{ij}$ is the inner product between the vectorized feature map $i$ and $j$ in layer $l$. We can see that $G^l_{ij}$ generated over the feature map for a given image represents the correlation between feature maps $i$ and $j$. \n\nTo generate a style for our base input image, we perform gradient descent from the content image to transform it into an image that matches the style representation of the original image. We do so by minimizing the mean squared distance between the feature correlation map of the style image and the input image. The contribution of each layer to the total style loss is described by\n$$E_l = \\frac{1}{4N_l^2M_l^2} \\sum_{i,j}(G^l_{ij} - A^l_{ij})^2$$\n\nwhere $G^l_{ij}$ and $A^l_{ij}$ are the respective style representation in layer $l$ of $x$ and $a$. $N_l$ describes the number of feature maps, each of size $M_l = height * width$. Thus, the total style loss across each layer is \n$$L_{style}(a, x) = \\sum_{l \\in L} w_l E_l$$\nwhere we weight the contribution of each layer's loss by some factor $w_l$.

I was curious to see what it would look like if implemented using a different deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). I reviewed the 2015 paper, [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1508.06576), one more time and I did not find anything indicating this could not be done using a different DCNN. So, I went ahead and implemented neural style transfer using a pre-trained ResNet50 http:\/\/ethereon.github.io\/netscope\/#\/gist\/db945b393d40bfa26006. Why ResNet50?  I wanted to explore a structure that was proven to be great for image classification, and ResNet152 (deeper model with 152 layers instead of 50) won the 2015 ImageNet challenge with a top-5 error rate of 3.57%.","f04dc0d0":"### Optimization loop\n\nThe parameters used here are significantly different to those used for VGG nets.  Here we are using **style_weight = 1e6, content_weight = 1, and learning rate = 20**.  These were determined by trial an error, and seemed to generate the most appealing image for the content and style image selected.  ","d94f446e":"Then computing the gradients is easy:","8f126928":"### Computing style loss\nAgain, we implement our loss as a distance metric . ","37bd0cdd":"These are input content and style images.

In other words, we created a model that will take an input image and output the content and style intermediate layers! \n","b26957a4":"### Computing the loss and gradients\nHere we use [**tf.GradientTape**](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/programmers_guide\/eager#computing_gradients) to compute the gradient.

It records the operations during the forward pass and then is able to compute the gradient of our loss function with respect to our input image for the backwards pass.","0b11b5b1":"## References\nFor this work, I leverage a tensor flow tutorial developed by Raymond Yuan https:\/\/medium.com\/tensorflow\/neural-style-transfer-creating-art-with-deep-learning-using-tf-keras-and-eager-execution-7d541ac31398.","f0f19db9":"## Closing Remarks\nResNet50 is different to VGG19 which is used in the paper.

In order to obtain a better generated image, trial and error using different combinations for content and style layers as well as hyperparameters (learning rate, content weight, and style weight) is needed.\n\nI want to point out here that Neural Style Transfer is very much an art rather than a science. I have determned the generate image is the most appealing, but someone else may say it is not because they find one of the other generated images more appealing.  In addition, if using a diferent content or style image, it is likely these paramers will not yield be the best generated image (for me).","bd440a15":"Now that we know how the layers are named, we select the ones we want to use. This is done by trial and error. Do not select any layers that have no parameters.\n*   **For content layers:** Generally, one layer for content seems to work fine.\n*   **For style layers:** Identify the layers that work best for style transfer. I started using a single style layer to see if that layer, after running say 500 iteration, would translate any stlyle to the generated image, and if so how apealing that style was.  After doing this with several layers I selected the ones I liked best. The more layers are selected the longer it takes the optimization to run.  For this example we use 4 style layers.\n\nPlease note that when layer 'conv1' was included as a style layer, it dominated the optimization leading to a generated image that had all the colors of the style image but none of the distinctive patterns. For this reason, it is left out in the code block below.  This may be useful if there is an application where we want to tranfer the color only.\n","f8640e1a":"## Apply style transfer to our images\n","57c3df2c":"### Import and configure modules","06a35b4b":"We\u2019ll begin by enabling [eager execution](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/guide\/eager).
