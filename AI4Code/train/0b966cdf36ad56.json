Basic data preparation, nothing too fancy, all the analysis here was done for personal entertainment and practice only.<\/strong>","567a7e39":"### Anxious Behaviour\nAnd now anxious patterns.","544185bc":"# Deriving from Attachment Styles\n\n(Please note that this is my <b>personal interpretation<\/b> and might not be fully in accordance to the oficial theory, now there are also 4 types, etc. ... in order to find more info on the matter just google 'Attachment Theory')\n\nBy now a lot of people have heard about attachment theory and it's various archetypes (I consider them archetypes, not types, styles nor kinds, as mostly no one is prone to exhibiting only patterns belonging to just one group).\n\nA quick sum of the archetypes:\n\n<strong>Secure<\/strong> - the person in question is exhibiting behaviours and atittudes that show that this person is in alignment with themselves and trusting the process of being in a relationship. Healthy exchanges, give and take.\n\n<strong>Anxious<\/strong> - this person is off center and seeking to find greater alignment by shaping circumstances around them, or behaviour they might think are useful to change situations around them (such as worry and fear). Seeking outside help to appease feelings coming from the inside.\n\n<strong>Avoidant<\/strong> - this person is centered and might fear that another person might unbalance them, will end up interfering too much and cause some kind of disruption or unwanted change, power loss. \n\nUsually the secure style is considered the model for healthy relationships. In the past, 'anxious' and 'avoidant' where considered 'abnormal' and 'secure' normal, but actually any healthy relationship can have all three dynamics playing out in different scenarios, situations and phases. \nHow can anxious and avoidant dynamics be healthy, may you ask?\nWell, because we are all human, we are all becoming our best selves, we are all growing, and unfortunately during the process we will hurt and get hurt. Occasional bumps are great opportunities to grow and learn.\n<strong>No abusive or neglectful situation should be looked at as a 'bump to grow'.<\/strong>\n\nFor more details: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Attachment_in_adults\n\n\n\n## The questions\n\nThe questions were divided into the 3 behaviours\/archetypes mentioned above.\nSocial behaviour is one of the most complex to figure out and study (and that's what makes it sooo cool), so keep in mind that a lot of the sentences stated above could have been classified in a very different way, if you considered for example, personal interpretation of the participant (self-awareness and culture as well), the intensity or frequency of that pattern, background information, etc.\n\nThis is how I divided them (as in, the higher the score, the more it matches to the style):\n\nSecure - Q2, Q3, Q15, Q19, Q22, Q25, Q27, Q29, Q31, Q33, Q35\n\nAnxious - Q4, Q6, Q8, Q10, Q12, Q14, Q16, Q18, Q20, Q24, Q26, Q28, Q30, Q32, Q34, Q36\n\nAvoidant - Q1, Q5, Q7, Q9, Q11, Q13, Q17, Q21, Q23","dcea9f58":"'Other' genders seem to rate higher on avoidant behaviour, followed by 'Females', and lastly 'Undefined' and 'Males'.\n\n'Other' also find it harder to depend on their romantic partners, although all rate above average.

There are higher scores in the secure matrix rather than the others, which is great as it indicates that people associate security to being in a close relationship a lot more than the other two dynamics. And they prefer to go after, and worry, and bothered (anxious), than to avoid or run away. Could this be a sign that avoidant behaviour is less prevalent in close relationship? Probably...\n'Other' genders seem to stand a bit out as having more avoidant and less secure tendencies.\n\nI also noticed other tendencies that seem to go against the grain of pop culture. Females, usually portrayed in movies as needy, the ones seeking validation outside, here seem to not want to merge with their counterparts as much.\nAnd Males, portrayed in pop media as freaking out as soon as their partner wants something more, seem to not be fussy will getting real close at all. Could it be an indication that things are slowly changing?\n"}}
