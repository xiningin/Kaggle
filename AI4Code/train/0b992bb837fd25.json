Seoul, South Korea. Courtesy of Kim Joon-hee*\n\nIt is common knowledge that air pollution can cause several problems in the environment and in our health. The photo above was taken on December 11th, 2019 and shows how it can severaly impacted Seoul landscapes. In this occasion, a smog of ultrafine dust, coming all the way from China, lasted two days and made the local government issue emergency emission reduction measures. According to [The Korea Times](https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/nation\/2020\/02\/281_280126.html), the Air Quality Forecasting Center, filliated with the Ministry of Environment, reported that on December 11th at 10 p.m the concentration of PM2.5 particles was about 118 micrograms per cubic meter in Seoul. \n\nGiven that context, my intention in this study was to understand and visualize how air pollution is distributed geographically in the 25 districts that compose the country's capital. To do so,I analyzed a dataset containing hourly collected records of six pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM10, PM2.5) during a period of three years. In Seoul, each district has its own station measuring this set of pollutants, so I could analyze both pollution as whole and segregated by region.\n\nThis kernel provides maps to show the concentrations of gases and particles in Seoul as well as time series analysis to figure out cycles, sazonality and tendency. In the appendix I also analyze if there is a pattern in the occurence of errors in the stations. **This is my first kernel in Kaggle doing EDA and I'm still learning how to this properly. Feel free to comment below suggestions or errors, it really helps me a lot. And if like this notebook, please give it an upvote. Thank you!**\n\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Importing data and libs](#importing-data)\n- [Data preparation](#data-prep)\n- [Exploratory analysis](#eda)\n    * [Where are stations located?](#eda-map-station-loc)\n    * [Pollution levels](#eda-pol-level)\n    * [Does pollutants have correlation?](#eda-pol-corr)\n    * [How pollutant concentrations varies with location?](#eda-pol-local)\n    * [What are the most and least polluted regions of Seoul?](#eda-pol-most-least)\n    * [What really happened on that December 11th?](#eda-11-dec)\n    * [Does the concentration of pollutants have sazonality and tendency?

But this spike was much more evident in the last two time series.","9ca1b151":"#### Rows where measurements should be discarded but were collected ","bed3c396":"### What are the most and least polluted regions of Seoul? <a id='eda-pol-most-least'><\/a>\n\nIn order to answer this question, I calculated the average Z-score of the previous heatmap and produced a single value that represents how much each region is polluted. The map showing these values can be seen below.","dbf1c46f":"#### Pollution levels along the three years time span ","ec304a6e":"### How pollutant concentrations varies with location? <a id='eda-pol-local'><\/a>\n\nIn order to analyze the data geographically, I first calculated the mean concentration of each pollutant per region. But here we face a problem that pollutants have diffent units of measurement. So I also standardized the 6 distributions of pollutants, each one having 25 points (districts).\n\nIn the following heatmap, the scale is the amount of standard deviations from the mean (Z-score). Negative values indicate below average pollution and positive values indicate the opposite.","fbf16ef1":"### Does pollutants have correlation? <a id='eda-pol-corr'><\/a>\n\nWe know that cars and industries are agents responsible for large pollutant emissions. Also, it is very common that they release more than one type of gas at the same time. For example, motor vehicles typically release both CO and NO2. So we except some degree of correlation between the time series.  ","fcf07832":"#### First five rows of the parsed measurements dataset","f6bfe6fa":"We can notice a few things according to the last two plots:\n\n- An instrument can be under repair approximately any time of the day. However it is slightly more likely that the repair is being conducted during the morning or the evening.\n- Power problems can occur almost anytime.\n- Calibration is more likely to be required in the beggining of the evening.\n- Abnormal data is produced more frequently in the beggining of the afternoon, around 8 p.m.\n- Analysing the distribution of \"need for calibration\" and \"abnormal data\" jointly, I can infer that when an equipment starts to behave unexpectedly, it first change status to \"need for calibration\". After some time it change status again to \"abnormal data\", since the lack of calibration should make the instrument output weird numbers or even don't output them at all.\n\n### Are there regions with more instrument problems? <a id='eda-inst-where'><a\/>\n    \nIn this context, I grouped problems by district."}}
