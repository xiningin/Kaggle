Clever and creative feature engineering will augment our model's precision far more  than equivalent time investment into modelling and hyperparameter tuning. If we don't process features properly and don't engineer new insightful ones, our final model will be crude and possibly inaccurate, however \"optimal\" our models may be. *Garbage in, garbage out.*\n\nWe are given **10** features to work with:\n* `Class`\n* `Name`\n* `Sex`\n* `Age`\n* `Number of siblings on board`\n* `Number of parents\/children on board`\n* `Ticket ID`\n* `Fare`\n* `Cabin`\n* `Embark Location`\n\nWithout any processing or feature engineering, some of these features are of very limited use to us. In particular, the `Name` field contains a lot of useful information, but we need to chip away at it first; right now it gives us very little. I'll go through each feature one-by-one and describe the processing, imputation, and engineering strategies I used for this dataset.\n\n<h3>Class<\/h3>\n\nPretty straightforward, but we need to change the datatype of this feature. By default it will be imported as a numeric, but we should change it to be categorical. We do this since `Class` is ordinal in nature. In terms of social structure, 1st class is superior to 2nd class; 2nd class is superior to 3rd class. But the distance between classes isn't measurable. So we convert classes to strings, so they act as labels instead of quantifiers.\n\n<h3>Name<\/h3>\n\nThis is the big one. There are two main things we can do with this feature, get the passenger's `Title` and their `FamilyName`  .\n\n`Title` will end up being important for imputing missing ages. If we have a Male with a missing age, we can use his `Title` to give us a better guess. If he's a `Mr.`, he will probably be around 30, but if he is a `Master`, he likely be under 10. The age that we impute will end up affecting the final accuracy of the model, so using `Title` to enhance our imputation is advisable.\n\n`Family Name` is more complicated. This is the step that improved my leaderboard standing the most, and allowed me to crack 80% prediction accuracy. Using the training data, we can create a network of families and record all the outcomes for each member of every family group. This can unlock hidden insight about whether the passenger survives or not that we wouldn't have access to if we just treated them as a general passenger. For instance, if there are 7 Robinsons all in the same family in the training data, and all but 1 die, it is safe to assume that any Robinsons we encounter in the testing data ALSO died. Setting up the data structures to engineer this feature is somewhat sophisticated, so I will explain it in further detail below.\n\n<h3>Sex<\/h3>\n\nObviously a very important feature. Females have significantly higher probability of survival compared to males.\n\n<h3>Number of siblings\/parents\/children<\/h3>\n\nWe condense these two features into one, family size. Having this intuitive descriptor broken up into siblings (horizontal) and parents\/children (vertical) is a little too noisy and overly complicated. Something of note, though, is that we can use the `ParCh` feature alongside `Title` to help us engineer a new feature `isParent?`. If the passengers title is `Mr.`, `Mrs.`, or `Other` and their `ParCh` feature is > 0, it's reasonable to label them as a parent.\n\n<h3>Age<\/h3>\n\nAs mentioned above, the `Age` feature has a lot of missing values. 20%, in fact. Strategic imputation will have a significant effect on our final predictions, so we should tread carefully. Something like imputing the overall mean age for passengers with missing ages is too general, so instead we impute the mean age of all passengers sharing that passenger's `Sex`, `Class`, and `Title`.\n\n<h3>Ticket ID<\/h3>\n\nWe can use `Ticket` as a psuedo family name, so to speak. Two young adults who are friends could be travelling together, with their ticket information being the only thing that links them. If we know the fates of multiple members of a ticket group, we gain predictive ability for the rest of that group. Travellers in the same group will likely be in the same location on the ship during the disaster and will tend to stick together once panic ensues.\n\nTo tap into the ticket group information, a similar approach is used to what we use for `FamilyName`. Again, more information on this can be found below.\n\n<h3>Fare<\/h3>\n\nTicket price correlates to socioeconomic status, even amongst passengers in the same `Class`.\n\n<h3>Cabin<\/h3>\n\nIntuition tells us that `Cabin` should be a good piece of information for predicting survivorship. Passengers with cabins closest to the point of impact with the iceberg should stand a lower chance of a survival compared to those closer to the lifeboats. However, this feature has a lot of missing values, about 77%. Usually in the event where this many values are missing, I would just drop the entire column, but in this case, I think refinement and imputation is worth it, albeit marginally.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of missing cabins occur for 2nd and 3rd class passengers. A quick Google search tells us that these class groups were largely assigned to the DE and FG deck groups, respectively. I make a new, more simplified feature out of `Cabin` - called `Deck`. `Deck` will have three possible values: ABC, DE, and FG. These largely correlate to the three class groups (1st, 2nd, 3rd), but there is enough discrepancy between these features to make it worth our while.\n\nThe imputation strategy I used is to rely on the passenger's `Class` to determine which deck their cabin is likely located in.\n\n<h3>Embark Location<\/h3>\n\nThere are two missing values for this feature, so it's a safe bet to impute them with the modal value (S).\n\n***\n\n\n<h2>Notes on implementation for family group survival rates<\/h2>\n\nIn this section I will try to explain the approach I used to build the passenger survival rates by family name.\n\nFirstly, we need an additional identifier differentiate family groups, their size. If we don't do this, common last names will all be grouped into one big bucket, potentially containing different families. The key we will use to identify families is the tuple `(FamilyName, FamilySize)`.\n\nWe will go through the training set iteratively, recording the survival outcome of the passenger to their family.\n\nI do this using a defaultdict `family_survival_details` with\n**key** = `(FamilyName, Family Size)`\n**value** = list of tuples (`Name`, `Survived`) for each passenger in that family group\n\nUsing `family_survival_details`, we can get family-based survival probability estimates for each passenger in the training **and** testing set.\n\nTo do this, we lookup the passenger in `family_survival_details` based on their `FamilyName` and `FamilySize`, then consider the outcomes of all the passengers in the family **NOT** including that passenger - we want to avoid data leakage (the predicted feature shouldn't play any part in engineering predictive features). With all these other family members, compute the proportion that survived and we can use this is a \"family survival rate\".\n\nIf there is no additional family survival data for a particular passenger, then we will just give them a baseline survival probability based on their `Class`, `Gender` and `Title`.\n\n\"Ticket survival rate\" can be determined in the same fashion.\n\nSince this is the most technical step in the entire notebook, I have annotated much of my code. Hopefully this family grouping process isn't too cryptic.\n\n***\n\n<h2>Numerical vs. Categorical Features<\/h2>\n\nWe only have two numerical features here, `Age` and `Fare`. Both are checked for skewness and then transformed accordingly using a Box Cox transformation and RobustScaler.\n\nAll other features are categorical, so we most use one-hot encoding to ensure they are interpretable by our models.\n\n***\n\n<h2>Modeling and Submission<\/h2>\n\nI use an ensemble model composed of five classification models:\n* RandomForestClassifier\n* SVD RBF\n* XGBClassifier\n* AdaBoostClassifier\n* GradientBoostingClassifier\n\nI conduct a grid search with cross validation to tune the respective hyperparameters for each model. To this end, I use GridSearchCV with a ShuffleSplit with `n = 5, test = 0.3, train = 0.6`.\n\nI must give credit to [LD Freeman](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ldfreeman3)'s kernel for providing the framework to this voting ensemble model.\n\nAfter each model is optimally tuned, the models are trained to the entire training set and a hard vote is conducted. If three of our classifiers predict death but the other two predict survival, our final prediction will be that the passenger died. *Majority rules*.\n\nFinal predictions are exported for submission to be graded.\n\n***\n\n<h2>Performance<\/h2>\n\nAt the time of writing, this solution scores **81.3% classification accuracy** and ranks **top 4%** in the leaderboard."}}
