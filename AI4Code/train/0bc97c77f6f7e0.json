For photos that are largely taken from the side (e.g. most photos of dogs and cats, as opposed to photos taken from the top down, such as satellite imagery) we can use the pre-defined list of functions `transforms_side_on`.

The pretained model was trained for 1000 classes therfore the final layer predicts a vector of 1000 probabilities. The model for cats and dogs needs to output a two dimensional vector. The diagram below shows in an example how this was done in one of the earliest successful CNNs. The layer \"FC8\" here would get replaced with a new layer with 2 outputs.\n\n<img src=\"images\/pretrained.png\" width=\"500\">\n[original image](https:\/\/image.slidesharecdn.com\/practicaldeeplearning-160329181459\/95\/practical-deep-learning-16-638.jpg)","383d44e8":"Let's look at the Dogs v Cats code line by line.\n\n**tfms** stands for *transformations*. `tfms_from_model` takes care of resizing, image cropping, initial normalization (creating data with (mean,stdev) of (0,1)), and more.","3ee3529c":"Note that the other layers have *already* been trained to recognize imagenet photos (whereas our final layers where randomly initialized), so we want to be careful of not destroying the carefully tuned weights that are already there.\n\nGenerally speaking, the earlier layers (as we've seen) have more general-purpose features. Therefore we would expect them to need less fine-tuning for new datasets. For this reason we will use different learning rates for different layers: the first few layers will be at 1e-4, the middle layers at 1e-3, and our FC layers we'll leave at 1e-2 as before. We refer to this as *differential learning rates*, although there's no standard name for this techique in the literature that we're aware of.","99c639f5":"As well as looking at the overall metrics, it's also a good idea to look at examples of each of:\n1. A few correct labels at random\n2. A few incorrect labels at random\n3. The most correct labels of each class (i.e. those with highest probability that are correct)\n4. The most incorrect labels of each class (i.e. those with highest probability that are incorrect)\n5. The most uncertain labels (i.e. those with probability closest to 0.5).","361a92ac":"## Improving our model"}}
