Despite all the advantages and hype of deep learning,\nit shares one limitation with traditional machine learning models, hyperparameter optimization. The selection of values for the \nhyperparameters of models like logistical regression, k-means, e.t.c are usually based on trial and error till we get a\nsuitable value for our evaluation metric of our choosing. Deep learning models are no different, In the case of keras, when\nwe build models, we have to fine-tune hyperparameters like batch size, number of epochs, optimizer used in order to get a acceptable evaluation metric value.Of course, one of the more effcient ways we can go about hyperparameter optimization would be to\nuse tools like gridsearchCV and randomsearchCV but in the case of deep learning models using keras to build either Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convulusion Neural Networks (CNNs),\nwe can use a hyperparameter optimization library called talos to fine tune these hyperparameters. In a demonstration below, the Heart Disease UCI dataset by from kaggle will be used to demonstrate how talos can be used to make hyperparameter optimization more efficient than compared to the standard trial and error","4bbad310":"Once that is done, I can use the model to predict my target values by inputing my own X_values using heart_diease_predmodel.model.predict_classes(X_values)","9ff5f16b":"# Keras Deep Learning Model hyperparameter optimization using talos ","f75527ae":"# Scalling the data","86826ddf":"Once the tunning is done, we want to see the results of the tunning, To do this, I will be using Reporting() from talos","f110aa33":"Binarising the target variables \n","3155d038":"Now, I will be setting the values that I want to test out for the hyperparameters of my model.

In this case, I've decided to use 3 dense layers only. However, If you were to look closer, this model is a bit different from how a keras model is normally builded as the hyperparameters that I've decided to finetune are fitted with the variable 'params' which will then be scanned by talos.","b1fb01ad":"# Building our keras model for hyperparameter optimization","4975a4da":"So as we can see below, the data contains some factors such as age, sex, e.t.c that might affect the 'target' value to be either 0 or 1.
