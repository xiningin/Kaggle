","8fd204a1":"## TF-IDF \n\nSince we have reviews as text and we want to run a mathematical model we need a method to convert the text to numbers. We will use TF-IDF method for this, inorder to know the details about TF-IDF you may read about it __[here](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/sentiment-analysis-introduction-to-naive-bayes-algorithm-96831d77ac91)__. Note that it contains 50k rows so its a mid-sized database so we expect the TF-IDF based model to work better than deep learning models.  \n\nWe will use pre-built TF-IDF vectorizer from sklearn library. Let us create a document term matrix (DTM) using TF-IDF. ","e37b38d7":"Using df.head(), df.tail() we can observe that reviews are randomly distributed thus we don't need to redistribute the data to randomize it. We also observe that data contains (review column): lower case and upper case letters, some html tags within \"< > \", punctuations, apostrophies e.t.c.

","2543cf41":"## Comparing Different Models\n\nHere we have seen that LSVM with limited data pre-processing brings the best result to us with the accuracy of over 91.10% .
