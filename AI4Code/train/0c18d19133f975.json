It has two possible values: `True` and `False`.","2631378f":"(Click the \"output\" button to see the answer)\n\nTo answer this, you'd need to figure out the order of operations. \n\nFor example, `and` is evaluated before `or`. That's why the first expression above is `True`. If we evaluated it from left to right, we would have calculated `True or True` first (which is `True`), and then taken the `and` of that result with `False`, giving a final value of `False`.\n\nYou could try to [memorize the order of precedence](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/reference\/expressions.html#operator-precedence), but a safer bet is to just use liberal parentheses. Not only does this help prevent bugs, it makes your intentions clearer to anyone who reads your code. \n\nFor example, consider the following expression:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or rain_level < 5 and have_hood or not rain_level > 0 and is_workday\n```\n\nI'm trying to say that I'm safe from today's weather....\n- if I have an umbrella...\n- or if the rain isn't too heavy and I have a hood...\n- otherwise, I'm still fine unless it's raining *and* it's a workday\n\nBut not only is my Python code hard to read, it has a bug. We can address both problems by adding some parentheses:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or (rain_level < 5 and have_hood) or not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday)\n```\n\nYou can add even more parentheses if you think it helps readability:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))\n```\n\nWe can also split it over multiple lines to emphasize the 3-part structure described above:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = (\n    have_umbrella \n    or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) \n    or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))\n)\n```","a63f6eba":"### Manual Checking Leap Year without using Calendar Library\n\n```python\ndef isLeap(year):\n    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)\n```","b99fdbd1":"## Comparison Operations\n\n| Operation     | Description                       || Operation     | Description                          |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------||---------------|--------------------------------------|\n| ``a == b``    | ``a`` equal to ``b``              || ``a != b``    | ``a`` not equal to ``b``             |\n| ``a < b``     | ``a`` less than ``b``             || ``a > b``     | ``a`` greater than ``b``             |\n| ``a <= b``    | ``a`` less than or equal to ``b`` || ``a >= b``    | ``a`` greater than or equal to ``b`` |\n\n","cad5e2b0":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

This is similar to what happens when we define a function - the function header ends with `:`, and the following line is indented with 4 spaces. All subsequent indented lines belong to the body of the function, until we encounter an unindented line, ending the function definition.","e3da7fcd":"Rather than putting `True` or `False` directly in our code, we usually get boolean values from **boolean operators**.
