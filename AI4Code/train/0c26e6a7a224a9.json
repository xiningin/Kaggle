information to the impurity-based feature importance analysis. Once again the number of non proficient English speakers is at the top. 95percent_ci_low_39 is the lower confidence interval for the number of nonproficient English speakers. This makes sense because people who are not proficient in the language are less likely to want to seek medical attention because of the language barrier. This goes along with many what has been in the news where immigrants have been hit hard by the pandemic. We also see that once again the percent of native hawaiian or other pacific islanders seems to have a large impact on the death rate. The percentage of native Americans also appears to be of some importance. Once again, this makes sense since native American reservations have been ravaged by Covid-19. However, this approach does not show the importance of a county being rural compared to the impurity-based approach. \n<br\/>\nQuick note: <br\/>\nThe features that appeared in this approach changed after normalizing the data with the MinMaxScaler approach. Before the normalization, one of the other important features was whether or not someone was insured. I wanted to include this because this feature made a lot of intuitive sense. These individuals who do not have health insurance may only seek the guidance of a health care professionals after their symptoms have worsened. Also, the other features pertaining to the percentage of speakers not proficient in English were also percieved to be important before I applied data normalization.","d313de69":"# Conclusion","1393720a":"Once we read in the data, we want to get what is the latest date. This is because the data is the cumulative number of confirmed cases or deaths per county in the United States. That way we will be able to conduct our analysis with the most up to date data. We will filter out all the data except the data most recently available death and confirm cases number along with the county and state information. ","1ab6ee73":"# Random Forest Regression Model","bf4a5966":"The data from the us-county-health-rankings-2020 dataset is incredibly extensive so some of the features would be needed to be filtered out. It originally had over 500 features, and after the feature selection process there were only a little over 100 features. Below is the process used to chose the features that will be used in the model. An example of features that were removed were something like teen birth rates. Some features didn't seem to have any obvious connection to the death rate. Features such as obesity, health, and smoking were of course kept for the model.","6ea75850":"From the feature extraction analysis, we are able to see some features that may have a higher correlation with death rate than others. These are the features that will be most important for policy makers to keep in mind when trying to make decisions in the United States. If there are attributes of these communities that are leading to higher death rates, it is up to the others to realize that these are the populations that need to go to the hospital if they have any symptoms at all. Hopefully, by trying to focus on these features of counties in the United Sates, we will be able to help mitigate the impact on Covid-19 on communities that are yet to be ravaged by the virus. ","0f77f619":"Permutation feature importance is the decrease in the score of the model when a specific feature is shuffled randomly. If there is a change in the model, this means that the feature that was randomly shuffled had an impact on the outcome of the model. There is the n_repeats parameter in the permutation_imporance function which determines how many times each feature is randomly shuffled.","ff70936a":"# Feature Importance Exploration","33943ba9":"With the information we gathered from the feature importance methods, we can use other data from the us county health rankings in order to try to make more accurate models. The model that I used had 106 features. It would be interesting to try using fewer features since our data is not very large. We can also experiment with using different minimum death filters. For example in my model, I made an arbitrary decision to use the information with counties with 20 or more deaths. However, it may be that a filter of 10 will lead to more enlightening information about the impact of death rates, and thus the populations who should seek a HCP. ","ba0fceeb":"# **Importing the correct datasets**<br\/>\nThis analysis uses three main datasets:\n* The USA Facts Confirmed Cases dataset \n* The USA Facts Deaths dataset\n* The us-county-health-rankings-2020.csv dataset provided by Kaggle\n\nThese USA Facts datasets are similar to the confirmed-covid-19-cases-in-us-by-state-and-county.csv and the confirmed-covid-19-deaths-in-us-by-state-and-county.csv dataset provided by Kaggle. However, the datasets used are from the usafacts.org website.

It still has a stronger correlation than many other values, but it is formed of all values randomly generated from zero to one. This means any value with a lower absolute value of the correlation value should not be included in important features. <br\/>\nThe average number of physically healthy days, 95percent_ci_high_3 (upper confidence interval for average number of physically healthy days), 95percent_ci_low_3 (lower confidence interval for the average number of physically healthy days) were all in the top five positive correlations. This shows that previous unhealthiness seems to be an important part of determining the death rate. Quartile 10 is the percent of people with access to exercise opportunities while quartile 9 is the percent of physically inactive people. The percentage of physically inactive people having a positive correlation makes sense because inactive people are more likely to have preexisting conditions.<br\/>\nIn terms of the negative correlation the only feature that seems to be important is the percentage of native hawaiian or other pacific islanders. It seems that this feature has a large impact on the death rate given its large negative coefficient.","1bf94f9d":"# **Which populations assessed should stay home and which should see an HCP?**","d0e8af80":"# Impurity-Based Feature Importance","def33f6d":"# Permutation Feature Importance","267ef2c0":"There is a lot we can get from this graph. However, it is important to note that the impurity-based feature importance may be deceptive when there are there are large amounts of unique categorical data. The other thing to keep in mind about the horizontal bar graph above is that these are the most important features in the random forest regression model. The model right now has an R squared, validation value of 0.41 which still needs to be substantially improved before the features in the graph can be trusted more. <br\/>\nOn the other hand, if we look at our most important features based on the graph, these features do not seem to far off of reality. Many of the counties with the highest death rates are from counties in more rural states such as Ohio, Louisiana, and Indiana. The next four highest rated features all have to do with the whether or not the county has proficient English speakers. This once again is not too far off of reality where immigrants often do not have the same accessability to relief options. Interestingly, it appears that the percentage of females in a county has a important role in the prediction of our model. After the English proficiency, it appears that race\/ ethnicity, age distributions, insurance, and overcrowding all have an impact.","53bcdc52":"Since this question only has a few submissions, I think this notebook will be able to add a new perspective. The question we are trying to answer is \"Which populations assessed should stay home and which should see an HCP?\" When viewing this research question this sparked the question which what would be a metric to measure which communities should see a HCP? I decided to use death rate to determine which populations should stay home versus see an HCP. <br\/>\nDisclaimer: This analysis is only using data from the United States.
