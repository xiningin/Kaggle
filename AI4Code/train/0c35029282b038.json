Nintendo is one of the world's largest video game companies by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pok\u00e9mon. It originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards. By 1963, the company had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and love hotels. Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion in 2007.(source=Wikipedia)\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/0d\/Nintendo.svg\/1200px-Nintendo.svg.png)\n\n# Activision \n* Activision Publishing, Inc. is an American video game publisher based in Santa Monica, California. It currently serves as the publishing business for its parent company, Activision Blizzard, and consists of several subsidiary studios. Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016.\n\nThe company was founded as Activision, Inc. in October 1979 in Sunnyvale, California, by former Atari game developers, upset at how they were treated at Atari, to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console. Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The 1983 video game crash, in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the expertise of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games, forcing them to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of Infocom. After a management shift, with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis, the company renamed itself as Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around US$500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991.\n\nKotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from the former debt, started acquiring numerous studios and intellectual properties over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series. A holding company was formed as Activision's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding merged with Vivendi Games (the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO. Within this structure, Activision serves to manage numerous third-party studios and publish all of the parent company's games outside of those created by Blizzard.\n![](https:\/\/donanimarsivi.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/activision-blizzard-corona-virus-2-milyon-dolar-bagis.jpg)\n\n\n# Take-Two Interactive Software\n* Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. is an American video game holding company based in New York City and founded by Ryan Brant in September 1993.The company owns two major publishing labels, Rockstar Games and 2K, which operate internal game development studios. More recently, Take-Two created the Private Division label to support publishing from independent developers, and acquired the developer Social Point to establish itself in the mobile game market. The company also owns 50% of professional esports organization NBA 2K League. Take-Two's combined portfolio includes franchises such as BioShock, Borderlands, Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K, and Red Dead among others.As of March 2018, it is the third-largest publicly traded game company in the Americas and Europe after Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, with an estimated market cap of US$13 billion(source=Wikipedia)\n![](https:\/\/www.mavikol.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/TakeTwoInteractiveSoftware-Inc.jpg)\n\n\n# Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\n* Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) is a multinational video game and digital entertainment company wholly owned by Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation. The SIE Group is made up of three legal corporate entities, which operate under a single global leadership: Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC (SIE LLC), based in San Mateo, California, United States and the global headquarters, Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. (SIE Inc.), based in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe Ltd (SIEE Ltd.), based in London, United Kingdom.[2] Tokyo-based SIE Inc. was originally founded as Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI or SCE) in November 1993 to handle Sony's venture into video game development for the PlayStation systems.[2] SIE LLC was established in San Mateo in April 2016[2] and is managed through Sony's American hub, Sony Corporation of America.[1]\n\nSince the launch of the original PlayStation console in 1994, the company has been developing PlayStation home video game consoles, accessories and services lineup. The company expanded from Japan into North America and Europe, where it founded the branches Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) in May 1995 (in Foster City, California) and Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) in July 1995 (in Liverpool). The company quickly became Sony's main resource for research and development in video games and interactive entertainment. In April 2016, SCE and Sony Network Entertainment International was restructured and reorganized into Sony Interactive Entertainment, carrying over the operations and primary objectives from both companies. The same year, SIE LLC was established, with its headquarters in San Mateo, California.\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment handles the research and development, production, and sales of both hardware and software for the PlayStation video game systems. SIE is also a developer and publisher of video game titles, and operates several subsidiaries in Sony's largest markets: North America, Europe and Asia. By August 2018, the company had sold more than 525 million PlayStation consoles worldwide(source=Wikipedia)\n![](https:\/\/img.bolumsonucanavari.com\/images\/news\/97047_550x250.jpg)\n\n\n\n# Microsoft Game Studios(now:XBOX Game Studios)\n\n* Xbox Game Studios (previously known as Microsoft Studios, Microsoft Game Studios, and Microsoft Games) is an American video game publisher and division of Microsoft based in Redmond, Washington. It was established in March 2000, spun out from an internal Games Group, for the development and publishing of video games for Microsoft Windows. It has since expanded to include games and other interactive entertainment for the namesake Xbox platforms, Windows Mobile and other mobile platforms, and web-based portals. As the studio grew, it has acquired and relinquished ownership of several other studios, and is the parent organization of fifteen other
