Additionally, the dataset is relevant to all of us as drivers and pedestrians within the city of Philadelphia.

This is useful because we know that temperature and visibility, while helpful, are not critical from an EDA perspective.

This is understandable as sometimes road lengths may not be in front of any business with a street number - like an airfield for example. There are no duplicate rows in the data with all matching attributes There are no duplicate rows in the data with the same Start_Time and Street. Unfortunately there are few numeric attributes in the dataset that can be meaningful derived to determine outliers using a box plot. For this example, I selected the attribute Distance(mi). This returns the length in distance of an affected traffic incident. In this plot, we see an outlier causing nearly 350mi of road length affected by the accident.
