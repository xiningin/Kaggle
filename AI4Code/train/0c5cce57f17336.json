Lets see a simpler plot and see which of the players positions are most likely to get a player of the week award by seeing the total entries in the dataset grouped by positions.","611641c2":"Great!!! \n\nReally hope you enjoyed reading through this as much as i enjoyed creating it. However, we dont need to stop here. There's still a lot of un answered questions.\n\nWhich team has the highest number of player of the week awards per season?\nDoes that team's winning player's age comply with the Age vs awards graph we checked ?\n\nI know there can be a lot more questions that can be covered and I'd love to hear them from you in the comments.\n\nAny and all feedback's most wellcome , Thanks!","114dbd6d":"Ah there you go! some of the heights are expressed as ft-in and some are displayed as x cm. Since most of them are expressed as ft-in, we'll convert all the values to feet, and while we are at it, lets also convert the date acoordingly.\n\nWe'll also add a new column that acts as a bin for the height , although we could do that through a histogram, I added this like a categorical column.","6b1fd496":"While we are at it , lets see the team with the most player of the week awards.","c40a1d3c":"So its kinda like abbreviated positions.

Read on below to find out!!!","8ef83032":"Yup, by the looks of it, the weight is expressed both in kilograms and pounds (after all, what athelete would weigh like 310 Kgs????) Lets convert that as well.","c87946e8":"Ok, most of the players lie in the range of 6-7 feet and thats pretty obvious! However this is something surprising that we have players below 6 as well! thats cool. Now lets look at the weight."}}
