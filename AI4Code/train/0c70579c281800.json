So, what's contributing to this? `ord_3` once again is having a significant positive impact on the output. Interestingly, it is very close in value to the same feature in `row 0`. Unlike `row 0`, `nom_7` and `nom_8` have a far lower impact on the model predictions. Again decoding the features back into their original states might shed some more light into whats going on here.","6d17bb27":"### Some intial Comments\n\nThere's lots of interesting features here...\n\n1. id, target\n    * Row identifier and target variable.

The dots have three characteristics: \n* The vertical location of the dots show what feature they are depicting\n* Color shows whether that feature value was high or low for that row of the dataset\n* Horizontal location shows whether the effect of that value caused a higher or lower prediction.\n\n\n### Let's look at some features in particular.\n\n#### ord_3\n\n**Context:** This feature has 14 categories, letters `a` to `o`. For the purpose of the model, they were ordinally encoded with `a` becoming 1 up to `o` becoming 14.\n\nThis feature has the largest impact on the model and interestingly the higher the value, the more positive the contribution the feature gave to the model prediction. So any rows with letters, `m`, `n`, or `o` are more likely to associate with target variable 1 while `a`, `b`, or `c` are more likely to be associated with target variable 0.\n\n#### bin_1\n\n**Context:** This is a binary feature of `0's` and `1's`.\n\nUnlike `ord_3` this feature has very little impact on the models predictions. When this feature is 1, it has slightly negative impact on predictions, i.e. they are more likely to be 0. And conversely, when this feature is 0, is has a slighly positive impact on predictions.","a8d4d8d0":"# 3. Feature Encoding\n\nWhile the CatBoost algorithm doesn't necessarily need and encoding (it has built in tools itself to deal with categories), to get the best out of the Shap package we need to make sure each feature is numerical.\n\nSo, on that note:","23c1250d":"Ok, so the most importance features in this model are `ord_3`, `ord_5` and `ord_2` while the least important features are `bin_1` and `bin_4`. This is useful information, but let's use Shap to go deeper.","3e56e93f":"**Row 0** output is lower than the model baseline. This means the row would be predicted as being `0`. What's contributing to this? Well `nom_7` and `nom_8` appear to have the largest negative impact on the output, while `ord_3` has the largest positive impact. Outside of `ord_3` no other features are having any meaningful positive impact on the predcition. \n\nTo get a deeper insight into what's actually going on here, decoding the features back into their original states might shed some more light.","0fecc95a":"First, let's take some rows at random and look at the shapley contribution each feature made to each prediction.","cbbb2add":"This would be a long, long process to run through this exercise with many rows. So to speed up the insights, lets stack a number of them horizontally and see what we get.","938f36e3":"# 4. CatBoost Algorithm"}}
