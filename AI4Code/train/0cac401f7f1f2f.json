In this report, datasets include both regular session and March Madness from the aspects of games, players and events on court. As a famous basketball tuornament, March Madness contains lots of data with completeness in 30 years. A comprehensive data mining based on these data can help management of the tournament, teams and conferences, which is imperative.","c37120cd":"# Introduction","993ef950":" We can tell from the plots that, men's teams shoot more 3-pointers than women's teams. And there is an obvious increasing trend for men's teams' 3-pointer attempts since year 2016, while there is not obvious change for women's teams' 3-pointer attempts. This indicates that more and more men's teams choose to score behind the three-point line, which proves that shooting more 3-pointers is more efficient to score based on nowadays modern basktball theory. Another point may be applied to this fact is the succsess of teams like Golden Sate Warriors and Houston Rockets in the NBA. These teams have their own fashion to shoot a lot of 3-pointers in the game. They have very good record during the season and even win a championship, which really set an example for the rest of the basketball world.\n  \n   Based on the plots that focusing on free throws, we can clearly see that men's teams usually have more free throw attempts than the women's teams. This will be easily explained beacuse male players are more likely to use their body and strength to score, which makes a male player to draw a foul more often than female players. In short, games between men's teams are more physical compared with games between women's teams.","e658bf21":"In topic 4, We all know male and female differ in the strength, stamina, speed, and agility. So, there must be some differences in performances during the basketball game of the two genders.

The 64 teams selected from all called seeds. NCAA has been divided into 4 regions: east, west, north and south. Each regoin has some team conferences. Teams are selected by in-conference games and regional elimination-games.Then the outstanding teams from 4 regions get the spot and are ranked by their performance and according seeds. Finally through elimination series 64 teams decide the title(champion).","d6ee7729":" According to the three plots based on field goal data, we can find an intersting fact that women's teams have way more field goal attempts than men's teams, which leads to another fact that women's team's feild goal percentage is lower than men's teams. The reason came to my mind is the finish ability difference due to the physical differnce between men and women. For example, when a male player drives into the paint, he can either dunk or layup, but more likely to dunk, which has a much higher chance to score. However, very few female players are able to dunk, which cause a lower chance to score the basket.","5e6b6d1f":"Based on game data from 2010 till now, each state has averagely held 19 games during Madeness March.

It suggests that in some years the good and bad are intermingled in the 64 selected. And the selection rules of those years are not so valid, since 64 selected teams experienced a large range of team strength than the entirety of hundreds.","7013d2f2":" The dataset used is reconstructed by calculating the average of field goal rate(FG%) and field goal attempts(FGA) of each team in 2019 matches. We try to compare FG, FG% and FGA between NCAA man teams and woman teams. From the figures, we found:\n\nBy conducting the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, except for area 5 and 10, mean FG% of men and women teams in all areas are significantly different. It is comprehensible that FGAs in area 3 and 13 have no significant differences cause few FG attempts were made in these areas. Except for area 3 and 13, area 1 also passes the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which suggests that man and woman teams make same numbers of attempts in area 1 each match, but FG% of women teams are apparently lower. We count successful dunks in 2019 for man and woman games respectively, finding that male players made 6575 dunk successes while female players only made 15 in a year. It comes to us that FG rate of male and female diverge beacuse of the high success rate of dunks. To test this hypothesis, we subtract dunks from data and compare FG rate and FGA again. Wilcoxon rank-sum test are falied this time, proving that, other than dunking, average FG rate of male and female in area 1 has no difference.","641d09ca":"Topic 2 provides some basics information about the tuornament NCAA.\n\nWe shown a distribution of host place as state, a list of strong teams that are always competetive in March Madness, situation of team ages in tournament and information about area preference of actions on court.
