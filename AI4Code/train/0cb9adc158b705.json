Here we are using ResNet50. ","5bb067f1":"Fastai is extremely flexible and powerful at the same time. This is just the baseline notebook. You can easily build on top of it. Here are some things that you can experiment with:\n\n- Preprocess and Feature Engineering\n- Data Augmentation and External Datasets\n- Different Model Architectures\n- Training Schedule, Optimizer, etc\n- Postprocess\n\nYou can find the **[inference notebook here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ankursingh12\/fastai-plant2021-starter-inference)**.\n\nHope you had fun reading the notebook.

You can read the [6th notebook (or chapter)](https:\/\/github.com\/fastai\/fastbook\/blob\/master\/06_multicat.ipynb) in fastbook for details. It explains the topic in the most simplest way possible.

Now lets create our dataloaders, & then take a look at some images.","48a9c65d":"hmm, just image names and their label. Looks simple ? Not so soon. The labels are space-delimited strings. Its a multi-label problem. \n\nWe will use Fastai's datablock API to load our data. DataBlock API is simply amazing. Infinitely  flexibility and incredibly powerful. To use the datablock API, you need to define some functions.","7c318d14":"Looks good to me, what do you think?\n\nWe are done with data, time for some training.","3d7b1ce0":"Amazing! Lets export the model so that we can deploy it to production \ud83d\ude02.

I have resized all the images so that its much faster to load them into the RAM. You can find the dataset [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ankursingh12\/resized-plant2021).
