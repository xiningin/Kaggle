If we see more of that it will tell us which countries are doing the best during this time period covid wise and which are doing the worst.According to our data, Russia has the most recoveries upwards of 85 million cases, while Germany is coming in at a close second. Russia also has the largest total number of confirmed cases, but England has come in a close second and their recovery numbers in the lower echelon at 261.704k, which is abyssmal considering the number of cases. They also have 5 million deaths as well which is terrible considering the amount of recoveries they have had. England has got to do better and that is evident based on the data.","68973231":"## Thank you for taking a look, please leave feedback!\n\nI am a beginner in using interactive data visualization libraries like plotly and would definitely like some feedback on my code and the analysis as a whole.","f0e57399":"# Percent Distribution of Total Confirmed Cases Via Pie Chart\n\nBy looking at the chart we see below, we can see the percentage of confirmed cases that are active, recovered, or have resulted in death. 50.1% of the cases in europe have been recovered, 6.69% of those confirmed cases resulted in deaths, and 43.1% of those cases are still active as of today. We can conclude that the number of deaths is low relative to the total number of recoveries, but ideally the number of deaths would be lower. ","e253df66":"# Goals of this Script:\n\nThe goals of this script are to get an introduction to analysis of the covid 19 data in Europe. I want to see differences and changes over time in the number of confirmed cases, the number of active cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries. Another thing I found was the total number of cases by country and compare them to see which has the most. Lastly, I found the percent makeup of confirmed cases, specifically the percentage of cases that were active, resulted in recoveries, and resulted in death. This is only a start and I always welcome suggestions. I am new to interactive visualizations and am learning, so please feel free to leave suggestions and feedback.\n\n","ae03516b":"## Trends in Cases over time\n\nWe can see that the total number of confirmed cases has increased from January 2020 to August 2020 as well as the deaths and recoveries. However, with the active cases, we see a sharp increase from March to April, and then May to June the rateof increase starts to slow, and then once August hit there was another spike of cases in Europe. With that being said, the reason we saw that is because the amount of recoveries from May to August increased significantly, so we are seeing good progress in Europe on the recovery rate. However, the confirmed cases increasing means Europe definitely needs to be more careful for a bit."}}
