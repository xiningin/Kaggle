The data has been preprocessed and transtioned from a scholarly articles in a json format into a plain text that was inserted into a list (seperated by sentences) then converted to a csv file. \n\nPurpose: The foucs of this project is to estimating an incubation period of covid-19 based on all the gathered articles. \n\nApproach: After pasring the plain text, we looked into sentences that contained the word 'incubation' and gathered the numerical values surrounding the word when they existed within a reasonable range( 0 - 30 ) days. \n\nResult: We came to a conclusion that the estimated incubation period for the covid-19 virus will have an average of roughly 9 days.\n\n"}}
