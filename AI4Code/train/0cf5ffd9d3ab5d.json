To understand my results, I present my major assumption: I assume a **static** approach for this case study, which means that my calculated parameters will not change over time. Basically my results here present a specific scenario:\n\n### What would happen if Italy doesn't take any action after ending of March\n\nThis is important to say because most of the world are doing a **dynamic** approach:\n- Measure the curve by chosen parameters\n- Make predictions to understand better the techniques they need to apply such as isolation or lockdown\n- Apply a technique and study if your situation has improved\n- Evaluate if your model start to show higher errors compared to reality\n- Restart the circle","b666ca26":"# SEIR Model Explanation\n\nSEIR is a set (system) of ODE (Ordinary Differencial Equations) which models the dynamics of four main dependent variables over time during a pandemic:\n- **S(t)**: Suscetible cases - Population fraction that can get a disease\n- **E(t)**: Exposed cases - Population fraction that got the virus, but doesn't present any symptom\n- **I(t)**: Infected cases - As exposed, but presents any symptom\n- **R(t)**: Recovered cases - Population fraction that got infected and recovered after some time\n\nThe mathematical ODE system is presented bellow:\n![seir](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/32513366\/80239696-101ed200-8637-11ea-8ace-918fb5d98076.PNG)\n\nThe dynamics between them are correlated and reminds SIR model. For more modelling information I strongly recommend the [MAA SIR reading](https:\/\/www.maa.org\/press\/periodicals\/loci\/joma\/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model) and [Numberphile - The corona curve](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k6nLfCbAzgo) to understand SIR model (it helps to understand this model too) and a [SEIR Model doc](http:\/\/www.public.asu.edu\/~hnesse\/classes\/seir.html).\n\nIn red, I specify the parameters that control SEIR curves:\n- **er**: exposed rate\n- **ir**: infection rate\n- **rr**: recovery rate\n\nSo when you hear:\n\n### \"Flatten the Corona curve\" \n\nThe objective is to decrease **infection rate** to flatten the Infection curve. This is achieve by lockdown\/isolation techniques.\n\nA higher **recovery rate** is desired too, because the number of people in hospitals tends to decrease.\n\n\nThis ODE system present your dependent variables (s, i, e and r) in lowercase. This statement is important because for my solution I evaluated fraction values related to population size (N):\n![SEIR_CR](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/32513366\/80240551-65a7ae80-8638-11ea-8784-6edad80e0ba2.PNG)\n\n## But how I will develop this model?\nGiven the fact that I have:\n- A model approach: SEIR\n- Initial curves for Infected and Recovered cases in each state\n\nI will implement an **optimization technique** to find the actual parameters that minimize my error for both initial curves: i(t) and r(t).\n\n## Defined functions","a61e56d6":"## Define region population\n\nAccording to this [source](https:\/\/www.citypopulation.de\/en\/italy\/admin\/03__lombardia\/) I defined Lombardia N population as:","c0076b10":"### Commentary:\n- The most meaningful observation that you can get from this plot is that each spike for 4 risk regions in Italy will occur between 05\/15 and 06\/01.\n- Piemonte present a more flatten curve.\n- Lombardia actual state would present the worst scenario.\n\n## Maximum ventilators necessity for each region","28ef02bd":"# Case Study: Italy\n![italy-flag](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/32513366\/80289653-5eef6900-8716-11ea-9e12-4e3681b34a59.jpg)\n\n## Why Italy?\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, many countries including european, did not consider the SARS-COV-2 virus to be harmful. Italy's situation can be considered as the first western shock and what has caused many countries to take action. Given this fact, I chose an in-depth study in Italy to show what the impacts would be on other countries if no action was taken.","488f8b54":"### Commentaries:\n- One point to notice: my results are in 0 to 1 interval which means that I'm measuring in population % of N\n- Based in those results, Lombardia would achieve a spike in **infected curve** around 05\/15 with a portion of ~60% infected!\n- You can see that **exposed curve** is pretty low. This is possible given the EDO formula and lower calculated parameter. This could mean that infection was already too strong (given the higher infection rate compared to exposed rate) and most of the population passed from exposed to infected **before 02\/24**. Other possible reason is that my optimization is focused in recovery and infected curve.\n\n## Ventilators necessity\n\nBased in **Study assumptions**, my ventilators necessity will be **13%** of my **infected curve**. Let's calculate this curve."}}
