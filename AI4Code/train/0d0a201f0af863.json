No code has been included here, though methods will be discussed. Code was implemented in google colab to allow for long training sessions. \n\nFirst, here is sample of images generated by the final model:","a458685a":"The method used for generating images was implementing StyleGAN-ADA and simply feeding in all images in the dataset. \n\nFrom the image above, decent images of deer, butterflies, trees, and a few cars can be found. Some horses, houses, trucks, and planes are identifiable. No readily identifiable cats or frogs were found, perhaps due to high variability of those images. \n\nHybrids can also be found. There are some deer-cars, fish-cars, and deer-trees. Many images are not easily categorized. I imagine this problem would be fixed by implementing a conditional GAN."}}
