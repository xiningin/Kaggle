above the production of movies increasing exponentially by years.   \nThe profit gained also from this industry is increasing in a very impressive pattern\nin our analysis we explained that spending more budget not mandatory will lead to more revenue. \nAlso the popularity of the movies increased year by year. \nwe cross check the increasing of the popularity in the last 5 years with the vote count and vote average. \nit was clear that vote count increase by increasing the popularity, however no strong effect shown on the vote average.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion (02)    \nThe Most popular Movie was (Jurassic World)  released in 2015 and directed by Colin Trevorrow  \nThe least popular Movie was (North and South, Book I) released in 1985 and directed by Colin Trevorrow  \n  \n  \n  \nThe movie

For example, the dataset does not confirm that every release of every director is listed.  \n\n2-There is no normalization or exchange rate or currency conversion is considered during this analysis and our analysis is limited to the numerical values of revenue.  \n\n3- Dropping Null values from variables of our interest might skew our analysis and could show unintentional bias towards the relationship being analyzed. etc.  \n\n4- the genres for each movies was a combined of list of genres , in this study we depend only on the first written genre.  \n\n","e0fceb78":"### Lets cross check the Top popular genres all over the time with the average vote counts","12eef466":"<h2 style=\"color: blue;border: 1px solid black; text-align: center; background-color:lightgray;\"><br>I would like first to check the completence of the data<br>","9df70eac":"So far we found the number of movies produced and the profit from this industry increaing from year to year.  \nlets figuer out the what is the trend of the popularity over time  ","5b2342a9":"### Check the andjusted revenue and the adjusted budget over time ","81caa1fa":"### Popularity of the produced movies trend over time (the average popularity of the movies by year)","0a578489":"The above List sorting the Top 10 budjets starting from (The Warrior's Way) to (Avatar)  \nand it's sound clear that the movie budget is not the main factor to increase the revenue or the profit  \nas we see (The Warrior's Way) with the highiest budjet among the 10 of them return the lowest revenue  \nThat apply also on (Avatar)  ","8275ef30":"### Let's dig lettel deeper\nI will seperate the numerical columns from the categorical columns <br>\nalso i am interseted to find the counts of each type in the categorical columns","056087b4":"## Quick visualization ","81971ed2":"<a id='intro'><\/a>\n## Introduction\nThis data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.  \nThe primary goal of the project is to go through the datasets and perform general data analysis using Numpy, pandas and Matplotlib to find other interesting patterns and relations in the datasets.  \na lot of questions could be examine and analysis to find an interesting answers.  \n  \nQuestion (1)  \nMeasure and investigate the movies industry's performing over the years!!  \ndependent variable (Duration from 1960 to 2015 )  \nindependent variables     \n1- Number of produced movies per year.   \n2- revenue gained per year.  \n3- budget invested on movies per year.  \n\n\n\nQuestion (2)  \nlet's figure out for all duration the following:  \n1- Which movies have the highest and lowest popularity?  \n2- Which movies have the highest and lowest revenue?  \n3- Which movies have the highest and lowest budget?   \n4- Which movies have the highest and vote counts?  \n5- Which movies have the highest and vote average? \n\n  \nQuestion (3)\n\nWhich genres are most popular from 1960 to 2015?   \nAnd find the popularity trend for each \n\n","f0a11c2c":"let's first check the numirical distibution ","276cf843":"\n# Project: Investigate TMDb Dataset \n\n## Table of Contents\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#intro\">Introduction<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wrangling\">Data Wrangling<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#eda\">Exploratory Data Analysis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusions\">Conclusions<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>"}}
