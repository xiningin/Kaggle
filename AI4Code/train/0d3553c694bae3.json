The data is only of the actual revenue generation and not at bid level. The dataset has the following columns:\n\n1. date\n1. site\\_id : each id denotes a different website\n1. ad\\_type\\_id : each id denotes a different ad_type. These can be display ads , video ads, text ads etc\n1. geo\\_id : each id denotes a different country. our maximum traffic is from english speaking countries\n1. device\\_category\\_id : each id denoted a different device_category like desktop , mobile, tablet\n1. advertiser\\_id: each id denotes a different bidder in the auction\n1. order\\_id : can be ignored\n1. line\\_item\\_type\\_id : can be ignored\n1. os\\_id : each id denotes a different operating system for mobile device category only (android , ios etc) . for all other device categories, osid will correspond to not_mobile\n1. integration\\_type\\_id : it describes how the demand partner is setup within a publisher's ecosystem - can be adserver (running through the publisher adserver) or hardcoded\n1. monetization\\_channel\\_id : it describes the mode through which demand partner integrates with a particular publisher - it can be header bidding (running via prebid.js), dynamic allocation, exchange bidding, direct etc\n1. ad\\_unit\\_id - each id denotes a different ad unit (one page can have more than one ad units)\n1. total\\_impressions - measurement column measuring the impressions for the particular set of dimensions\n1. total\\_revenue - measurement column measuring the revenue for the particular set of dimensions\n1. viewable\\_impressions - Number of impressions on the site that were viewable out of all measurable impressions. A display ad is counted as viewable if at least 50% of its area was displayed on screen for at least one second\n1. measurable\\_impressions - Impressions that were measurable by Active View out of the total number of eligible impressions. This value should generally be close to 100%. For example, an impression that is rendering in a cross-domain iframe may not be measurable.\n1. revenue\\_share\\_percent - not every advertiser gives all the revenue to the publisher. They charge a certain share for the services they provide. This captures the fraction of revenue that will actually reach the publishers pocket.","b698322f":"## Results\n\nGet the finel MSE: `4469.8`","ea2b42df":"## Split data to train and test by 2019-06-21"}}
