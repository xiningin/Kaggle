In 3000 years of our history, people from all over \n               the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. \n               From Alex1ander onwards, the Greeks, the Turks, the Moguls, the Portuguese, the British,\n               the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. \n               Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. \n               We have not grabbed their land, their culture, \n               their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. \n               Why? Because we respect the freedom of others.That is why my \n               first vision is that of freedom. I believe that India got its first vision of \n               this in 1857, when we started the War of Independence. It is this freedom that\n               we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us.\n               My second vision for India\u2019s development. For fifty years we have been a developing nation.\n               It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top 5 nations of the world\n               in terms of GDP. We have a 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling.\n               Our achievements are being globally recognised today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to\n               see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured. Isn\u2019t this incorrect?\n               I have a third vision. India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that unless India \n               stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be \n               strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand. \n               My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr. Vikram Sarabhai of the Dept. of \n               space, Professor Satish Dhawan, who succeeded him and Dr. Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear material.\n               I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this the great opportunity of my life. \n               I see four milestones in my career\"\"\"","155ff968":"import re\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer","ac2926b8":"wordnet=WordNetLemmatizer()\nsentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(paragraph)","4507569f":"len(sentences)","91d3527a":"corpus = []\nfor i in range(len(sentences)):\n    review = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', sentences[i])  # removing everything except letters a-z & A-Z\n    review = review.lower()\n    review = review.split()\n    review = [wordnet.lemmatize(word) for word in review if not word in set(stopwords.words('english'))] \n    review = ' '.join(review)\n    corpus.append(review)","5615b1d6":"corpus","30f08841":"from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\ncv = TfidfVectorizer()\nX = cv.fit_transform(corpus).toarray()","c946cf90":"X","2981fdf8":"# Performing Lemmatization\n## Lemmatization usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma.\n![](https:\/\/user.oc-static.com\/upload\/2021\/01\/06\/16099625533417_P1C3%20%281%29.png)","64e45da1":"# Creating TF-IDF model\n## TFIDF, short for *term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency*, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.
