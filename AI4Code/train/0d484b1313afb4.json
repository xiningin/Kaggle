So, we can have a diverse picture of the variables of temperature. \n\n\n**Objective of the Project**\n\nThe primary objective of the project work is to predict the temperature of Szeged based upon its humidity. In other words, at the end of the project we will come to know how the humidity of Szeged explains the Temperature. Apart from that Apparent Temperature of a particular location is obtained with mutual interaction of many components of the weather along with temperature. If one measures the temperature in a thermometer it will be the actual temperature of the place, but the real feeling or in other words the apparent temperature is something that is influenced by humidity. We will also analyze how well the humidity helps in explaining the apparent temperature using Regression analysis. \n\n\n**Method Used**\n\nFor this analysis we have used linear regression model. The coefficient of regression is obtained through ordinary least square method.\n\nThe basic form of the simple regression model of one independent variable is,\n\n*Y = \u03b20 + \u03b21X+ \u03b5*\n\nX is the independent variable and Y is the dependent variable, and \u03b20 is the intercept. \u03b21 is the \nslope between Y and X and thus expresses the relationship between Y and X. \u03b5 is known as \nerror or disturbance term, and it represents all those factors that affect Y but are not taken into \naccount for the calculation explicitly, and thus it captures the errors in the measurement of Y.\nThe assumption of the error term is in accordance with the Ordinary Least Square (OLS)\nassumption, i.e., Y is normally distributed, the errors are also normally distributed with a mean \nof zero and a constant standard deviation, and that the error terms are independent of the size \nof X and independent of each other.\n\n"}}
