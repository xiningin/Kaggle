We will code a simple learning schedule for our algorithm:","9de2ce58":"<h1 align='center'>Cost Functions<\/h1>","e6cdc4f6":"<h1 align='center'>Scaling<\/h1>\n\nIn order for gradient descent to operate properly, we need to scale our features to that they are on a similar scale.

The formula is shown below:\n\n\n![](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/3MhPr.png)\n\nYou can think of gradient descent like this: if I was on top of a mountain, what is the best direction to take a step in? \n\n\n<h2>Learning Rate<\/h2>\n\nThe learning rate controls the size of each 'step' taken by gradient descent.\n\nIf the learning rate is too large, the gradient descent might miss the global minimum. If the learning rate is too small, then gradient descent wil take to long to converge(reach a point where it is no longer descreasing). \n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*An4tZEyQAYgPAZl396JzWg.png)\n\n<h2>Types of Gradient Descent<\/h2>\n\n\nThere are three main types of Gradient Descent:\n\n1. Batch Gradient Descent\n2. Stochastic Gradient Descent\n3. Mini-batch gradient Descent\n\n**Batch Gradient Descent**\n\nHere, the **whole** training set(batch) is taken into consideration when caclulating the derivatives. While this may have the smoothest path, it can become extremely slow and computationally expensive to do so. Therefore, it is not ideal for large datasets.\n\n**Stochastic Gradient Descent**\n\nHere, instead of calculating the partial derivative for the whole training set, the calcuation is only done on one **random** sample(stochastic meaning random). This is great because the calcuations are only needed to be done on one training example instead of the whole training set, making it much faster and ideal for large datasets.\n\nHowever,due to its inherent randomness, stochastic gradient descent does not have a smooth descend as in batch gradient descent. This means that it will bounce around, and while it may produce good parameters,they will rarely be optimal.\n\n**Mini-batch Gradient Descent**\n\nInstead of computing the gradients based on the whole training set,or just one training set, it computes it on small random subsets of the training set called **mini batches**.\n\nIt tends to have a much smoother descent than stochastic gradient descent, and is again computationally fast. However, like stochastic gradient descent, it may be stuck on local minima, meaning that the parameters will be good, but not optimal\n\n![](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/lU3sx.png)\n\n\nAs suggested by the title, we will be implementing stochastic gradient descent, with a twist!\n\nAn important thing to note is that the initial parameters are randomly initialized. This is known as (you guessed it), Random Initialization!","4aabdac2":"Ok, now let's evaluate to see how well the algorithm performed","1fd56057":"Wow! From 592 to 29, definitely an improvement!
