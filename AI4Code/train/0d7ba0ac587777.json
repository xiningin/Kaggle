After doing that, you could make any change to it.\n\nEach block of code is named \"cell\". And to run a cel you need to put the cursor on it and hit \"ctrl+Intro\" in the keyboard. \n\n\nThe next cell has some python modules that we will use (module = a bunch of useful functions).

So the next cell reads the data and save it under the name \"train\". One could read in the same way the other files; to do that one just needs to eliminate the character \"#\" of the beggining of the line and run again the cel.\n\nThis could take like 30 seconds to run."}}
