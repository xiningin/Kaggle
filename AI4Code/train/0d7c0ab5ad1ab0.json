Code faults because variable is not recognized due to size being assigned with upper case S and called with lower case s. I made the adjustment and rest of program compiles without fault. \n\n6\/10 Comments: Added a few comments.  Comments should introduce the start of the program (done) and break the code into fucntional sections of the program. \n\n10\/10 Difficulty & Effort: The scope of this project is insufficient to cover the requirements of the project and in difficulty for the time given to complete. \n\n10\/10 Idea has insufficeint scope for all of the requirements of the project.  \n\n10\/10 Print statement(s) included in meaningful way and works. Print command is used with syntax to include strings and variables structured correctly. Did not see print statement works because of compiling problem, but structure looks good.\n\n10\/10 User input included in meaningful way and works. See comments above in code. \n\n10\/10 An int\/float variable is appropraitely created and used. Good job converting your inputs into integers for math operations. Using a number is not identifying its value or purpose as a int or float unless you specifically use the int or float data structure. \n\n15\/20 Math Operators: At least one +, -, , \/ and one \/\/, % are included and used properly. After making correction to the variable so the program will compile, the total length of items in inches is calculating to zero!"}}
