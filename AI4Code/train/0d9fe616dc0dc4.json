Each point has a related rallyid and consists of the player who started the rally with his serve, the return player, the winner of the point, the number of strokes in the rally and the total time in seconds elapsed in the rally. The x,y coordinate describes the position on the court where the rally ended.

Failed serves are not included. For some serves the actual position of the bounce could not be tracked due to changes in the perspective of the broadcast video.

For example, in soccer event-based data is available for all major leagues by professional data providers like [Opta](https:\/\/www.optasports.com\/), [Statsbomb](https:\/\/statsbomb.com\/) or [Wyscout](https:\/\/wyscout.com\/). Generating event data for football matches is incredibly time consuming as there are lots of different events to annotate.  For tennis there is no event data available that covers the actual rallies played in games on either ATP or WTA tour. There exists official statistics of all matches played on ATP and WTA Tour. There is also Jeff Sackmans [github repository](https:\/\/github.com\/JeffSackmann), which is a great way to start. He also has a [match charting project](http:\/\/www.tennisabstract.com\/blog\/2015\/09\/23\/the-match-charting-project-quick-start-guide\/) where point-by-point data is collected.\nBut when I think about tennis, it is the movement of the ball and players, the tactics and the actual rallies and strokes. This is what I want to be able to see and analyse.  \nAs a proof of concept that collecting detailed data about positional, temporal and stroke information in tennis is possible and as a tribute to Novac Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, two of the greatest tennis players of all time, I manually annotated each rally and stroke of their [Australian Open final 2019](https:\/\/www.atptour.com\/en\/scores\/2019\/580\/MS001\/match-stats?isLive=False). Fortunately for me it only went over three sets.\nThe results are a couple of csv files that can be easily analyzed using pandas or R.  \nI prepared this notebook as a staring point for everyone who wants to work with rally-by-rally tennis data and I hope you enjoy it.","b611de11":"# Simple Plots\nAs this notebook is intended as starting point for own investigations, here are some sample plots that might be useful in your own investigations.\n\n## Tennis court dimensions\nHere is a function to draw the tennis court and its coordinate system.

Feel free to fork the kernel and extend and improve on the shown methods. Here are some possible topics to get you started.\n* Generate a chart of the match statistics from the rally data\n* Create a GUI that allows to easily replay points\n* Investigate where both players served to. E.g. positions in service box, forehand or backhand of the opponent.\n* Create heatmaps of the movement of each player for each set.\n* Create a heatmap for each players return position.\n* ...","82975b46":"This dataframe contains all labeled events from the tennis match. Each row relates to when one of the players hit the ball. The player who his the ball is called hitter and the other player receiver.
