When number of layer increase, layers start to learn more complex things like convex shapes or characteristic features like forefinger.\n* Lets create our model\n    * There are some hyperparameters we need to choose like learning rate, number of iterations, number of hidden layer, number of hidden units, type of activation functions. Woww it is too much :)\n    * These hyperparameters can be chosen intiutively if you spend a lot of time in deep learning world.\n    * However, if you do not spend too much time, the best way is to google it but it is not necessary. You need to try hyperparameters to find best one.\n    * In this tutorial our model will have 2 hidden layer with 8 and4 nodes, respectively. Because when number of hidden layer and node increase, it takes too much time. \n    * As a activation function we will use relu(first hidden layer), relu(second hidden layer) and sigmoid(output layer) respectively.\n    * Number of iteration will be 100.\n* Our way is same with previous parts however as you learn the logic behind deep learning, we can ease our job and use keras library for deeper neural networks.\n* First lets reshape our x_train, x_test, y_train and y_test.","d6ed8502":"<a id=\"1\"><\/a> <br>\n# INTRODUCTION\n* In this kernel, we will enter deep learning with ANN.\n* Before you start this kernel,I recommend you to review that kernel but it depends on you.You can continue this kernel directly.\n    * => <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/orhansertkaya\/logistic-reg-for-introduction-to-deep-learning\">Logistic Reg. for Introduction to Deep Learning<\/a>\n* Let's start.","7284a47a":"<a id=\"9\"><\/a> <br>\n## Backward propagation\n* As you know backward propagation means derivative.","8dbfdfb1":"<a id=\"4\"><\/a> <br>\n# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\n\n* It is also called deep neural network or deep learning.\n* **What is neural network:** It is basically taking logistic regression and repeating it at least 2 times.\n* In logistic regression, there are input and output layers. However, in neural network, there is at least one hidden layer between input and output layer.\n* **Why it is called hidden:** Because hidden layer does not see inputs(training set)\n* Lets see 2 layer neural network: \n<a href=\"http:\/\/ibb.co\/eF315x\"><img src=\"http:\/\/preview.ibb.co\/dajVyH\/9.jpg\" alt=\"9\" border=\"0\"><\/a>\n * As you can see there is one hidden layer between input and output layers. And this hidden layer has 3 nodes.Number of node is hyperparameter like learning rate. Therefore we will see hyperparameters at the end of artificial neural network.\n * Input and output layers do not change. They are same like logistic regression.\n * In image, there is a tanh function that is unknown for you. It is a activation function like sigmoid function. Tanh activation function is better than sigmoid for hidden units because mean of its output is closer to zero so it centers the data better for the next layer. Also tanh activation function increase non linearity that cause our model learning better.\n    * As you can see with purple color there are two parts. Both parts are like logistic regression. The only difference is activation function, inputs and outputs.\n        * In logistic regression: input => output\n        * In 2 layer neural network: input => hidden layer => output. You can think that hidden layer is output of part 1 and input of part 2.\n* Thats all. We will follow the same path like logistic regression for 2 layer neural network.","74a3c452":"* For x_train that has 348 sample $x^{(348)}$:\n$$z^{[1] (348)} =  W^{[1]} x^{(348)} + b^{[1] (348)}$$ \n$$a^{[1] (348)} = \\tanh(z^{[1] (348)})$$\n$$z^{[2] (348)} = W^{[2]} a^{[1] (348)} + b^{[2] (348)}$$\n$$\\hat{y}^{(348)} = a^{[2] (348)} = \\sigma(z^{ [2] (348)})$$\n\n* At logistic regression, we initialize weights 0.01 and bias 0. At this time, we initialize weights randomly. Because if we initialize parameters zero each neuron in the first hidden layer will perform the same comptation. Therefore, even after multiple iterartion of gradiet descent each neuron in the layer will be computing same things as other neurons. Therefore we initialize randomly. Also initial weights will be small. If they are very large initially, this will cause the inputs of the tanh to be very large, thus causing gradients to be close to zero. The optimization algorithm will be slow.\n* Bias can be zero initially.","ec3aea78":"<a id=\"15\"><\/a> <br>\n# Conclusion\n* If you like it, please upvote :)\n* If you have any question, I will be appreciate to hear it.","8fc98648":"* The shape of the X is (410, 64, 64)\n    * 410 means that we have 410 images (zero and one signs)\n    * 64 means that our image size is 64x64 (64x64 pixels)\n* The shape of the Y is (410,1)\n    *  410 means that we have 410 labels (0 and 1) \n* Lets split X and Y into train and test sets.\n    * test_size = percentage of test size. test = 15% and train = 75%\n    * random_state = use same seed while randomizing.
