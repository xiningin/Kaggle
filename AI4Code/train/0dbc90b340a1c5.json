our Data ?<\/font>\n\n### A company recently introduced a new bid type called \"average bidding\" as an alternative to the current bidding type, namely \"maximum bidding\". One of our clients has decided to test this new feature and wants to run an A \/ B test to see if average bidding yields more conversions than the maximum bid. In this A \/ B test, our client divides his random audience into two groups of equal size, the Test and the Control group. The ad campaign containing the \"maximum bidding\" is submitted to the \"Control group\", another campaign containing the \"average bidding\" to the \"Test group\". A \/ B testing has been going on for 1 month, and our customer now expects you to analyze and present the results of this A \/ B test.  \n\n\n* **Impressions:** The number of times an ad is displayed.\n* **Clicks:** The number of clicks on ad links directed to Advertiser\u2019s website.\n* **Conversion** **Rate :** Number of Actions \/ Number of Website Clicks x 100\n* **Group:** Shows which group the value belongs to\n* **Purchase:** Show the number of purchasing\n\n\n\n### A\/B Testing method cover the statistical hypothesis tests are used to reveal significance of the difference in a metric variable values between two groups such a Group A and Group B. There are two statistical methods to test the significance as Independent Samples t Test and Mann-Whitney U Test. According to result of 1. Step: Testing the Normality Assumption, it is decided between two alternative methods.\n\n### In this notebook i would like to introduce you a user developed function finalises the necesarry statistical steps of A\/B Testing and interprets the result of the hypothesis tests that are used in A\/B Testing process.\n\n\n# A\/B Testing Steps \n\n## **Step 1: Testing the Normality Assumption**\n\n**H0: The sample data are not significantly different than a normal population.**\n\n**Ha: The sample data are significantly different than a normal population.**\n\nIt is necesarry to decide which way of testing the significany of difference will be choosen. **Shaphiro Wilks** test is a way to test if the serie has normal distrubation or not. Also a **Box Plot** might be helpfull to observe if the serie has outliers or not.\n\nAccording to result of the test it can be decided between **Independent Samples t Test** and **Mann-Whitney U Test**.\n\nIf p value of the test is **greater than .05** A\/B Testing method will be Independent Samples t Test.\n\nIf p value of the test is **less than .05** A\/B Testing method will be Mann-Whitney U Test.\n\nIn addition Mann-Whitney U Test does not require any other assumptions, so if the result is not normal then you can jump to  3. Step: Alternative 2 -> Mann-Whitney U Test. \n\n## **Step 2: Testing the Homogeneity Assumption**\n\n**H0: The variances are equal across all samples**\n\n**Ha: The variances are not equal for at least one pair.**\n\n\nIn addition Independent Samples t Test requires another assumption which is **Homogeneity,** so if the result is normal then you can follow 2. Step: Testing the Homogeneity Assumption.\n\nThis assumption is only relevant in the case of normal distrubation. It is necesarry to decide which code setting will be choosen while executing the 3. Step: Alternative 1 -> Independent Samples t Test.\n\n## **Step 3: Alternative 1 -> Independent Samples t Test**\n\n**H0: There is NO statistically significant difference between A and B groups in Purchase values.**\n\n**Ha: There i\u015f a statistically significant difference between A and B groups in Purchase values.**\n\nIt can be defined as an approach that tests to statistically reveal whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups of data.\n\n## **Step 3: Alternative 2 -> Mann-Whitney U Test**\n\n**H0: The distribuation of the values of two groups are equal.**\n\n**Ha: The distribuation of the values of two groups are not equal.**\n\nIt can be defined as an approach that tests to statistically reveal whether there is a significant difference between the distributions of two groups of data.\n\n![](http:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/791\/1*JlpbE7evTO4LD8R7c_M-sA.png)\n\n\n[Check out! A\/B Testing Story for more](https:\/\/ersoykubraa.medium.com\/a-b-testing-ef7e8dbb9859)\n\n# Conclusion\n\n### **Q1 :How would you define the hypothesis of this A\/B test?**\nH0: There is NO statistically significant difference between A and B groups in Purchase values.\n\nHa: There is a statistically significant difference between A and B groups in Purchase values.\n\n### **Q2 :Can we conclude statistically significant results?**\n\nThere is no significant difference in Purchase. If you want to decide according to one metric, both bidding system can be choosen but A data shows a lower std dev which can be more trustworty.\n\nHowever we have reported A\/B Testing results thank to the code loop, accordingly other performance metric could be evaluated.\n\n### **Q3 :Which statistical test did you use, and why?**\nIndependent Samples of t Test cause the distribution is normal which is symetrical and we can use means of Purchase.\n\n### **Q4 :Based on your answer to Question 2, what would be your recommendation to client?**\n\nAccording to the results GroupB (Average Bidding) has greater mean\/median values in Earning, Conversion Rate, Earning per Purchase and Impression compared to GroupA (Maximum Bidding) while smaller mean\/median values in Click . In this context based on the other variable's values. Both options can be preferred.\n"}}
