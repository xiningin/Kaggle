Most of the time we want a descending sort however, where the higher numbers go first. That goes thusly:","77453ef4":"You can think of each group we generate as being a slice of our `DataFrame` containing only data with values that match. This `DataFrame` is accessible to us directly using the `apply` method, and we can then manipulate the data in any way we see fit. For example, here's one way of selecting the name of the first wine reviewed from each winery in the dataset:","baef8be8":"Effective use of `groupby` will allow you to do lots of really powerful things with your dataset.","f45fc346":"`groupby` created a group of reviews which allotted the same point values to the given wines. Then, for each of these groups, we grabbed the `points` column and counted how many times it appeared.\n\n`value_counts` is just a shortcut to this `groupby` operation. We can use any of the summary functions we've used before with this data. For example, to get the cheapest wine in each point value category, we can do the following:","b0b55cf5":"For even more fine-grained control, you can also group by more than one column. For an example, here's how we would pick out the best wine by country _and_ province:","13729fdc":"## Multi-indexes\n\nIn all of the examples we've seen thus far we've been working with `DataFrame` or `Series` objects with a single-label index. `groupby` is slightly different in the fact that, depending on the operation we run, it will sometimes result in what is called a multi-index.\n\nA multi-index differs from a regular index in that it has multiple levels. For example:","2eb93d9a":"To sort by index values, use the companion method `sort_index`. This method has the same arguments and default order:","dff65a4d":"# Grouping and sorting reference\n\nThis is the reference component to the \"Reshaping and aggregation\" section of the Advanced Pandas track. For the workbook component, click [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/grouping-and-sorting-workbook).","0942243b":"## Grouping\n\nMaps allow us to transform data in a `DataFrame` or `Series` one value at a time for an entire column. However, often we want to group our data, and then do something specific to the group the data is in. To do this, we can use the `groupby` operation.\n\nFor example, one function we've been using heavily thus far is the `value_counts` function. We can replicate what `value_counts` does using `groupby` by doing the following:","80a63bce":"Finally, know that you can sort by more than one column at a time:","ca6eda05":"Another `groupby` method worth mentioning is `agg`, which lets you run a bunch of different functions on your `DataFrame` simultaneously. For example, we can generate a simple statistical summary of the dataset as follows:","53a0864e":"Grouping is so important that it has its own section in the comprehensive official `pandas` documetation: [Groupby: split-apply-combine](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/groupby.html). Multi-indexes are covered extensively in the [Advanced indexing](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/advanced.html) section, and sorting is a section in [Advanced basic functionality](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/basics.html#sorting).","50a05dd1":"## Sorting\n\nLooking again at `countries_reviewed` we can see that grouping returns data in index order, not in value order. That is to say, when outputting the result of a `groupby`, the order of the rows is dependent on the values in the index, not in the data.\n\nTo get data in the order want it in we can sort it ourselves.  The `sort_values` method is handy for this.","60480de4":"Multi-indices have several methods for dealing with their tiered structure which are absent for single-level indices. They also require two levels of labels to retrieve a value, an operation that looks something like this. Dealing with multi-index output is a common \"gotcha\" for users new to `pandas`.\n\nThe use cases for a `MultiIndex` are detailed alongside detailed instructions on using them in the [MultiIndex \/ Advanced Selection](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/advanced.html) section of the `pandas` documentation.\n\nHowever, in general the `MultiIndex` method you will use most often is the one for converting back to a regular index, the `reset_index` method:"}}
