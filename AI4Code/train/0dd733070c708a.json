When the MACD rise above the signal line, this is a bulish signal.\n\n* Divergence: Whent the price diverges from MACD, it signal the end of the current trend\n\n* Dramatic Rise: When MACD rises dramatically, that is, the shorter moving average pulls away from the longer-term moving average, this is a signal that the stock is overboutgh\n\nSource: https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/macd.asp\n\nLet's calculate 26-day EMA, 12-day EMA and 9-day EMA","e122f248":"# Feature engineering  <a name=\"feature-engineering\"><\/a>\n## Daily percent change <a name=\"daily-percent-change\"><\/a>\nThis is the percentage change applied to a security.
