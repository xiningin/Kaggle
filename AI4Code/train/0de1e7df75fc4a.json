This is a stark confirmation of the contribution of our everyday activities to sources of emissions of the air pollutants that we breathe and the greenhouse gases that drive global warming. The speed with which emissions have fallen shows how quickly we can improve our environment when motivated and how vulnerable we are living in degraded environments.\n\nAs with previous shocks, we know that pollution continues to occur even with significant government-imposed constraints. For example, pollutants from transport and industrial sectors have decreased but not from residential or agricultural sources. Moreover, some pollutants, like ozone, result from secondary atmospheric processes resulting in nonlinear links between reduced emissions and ambient concentrations \n\nWhile these decreases result in public health benefits from improved air quality, they come at the unacceptable cost of thousands of deaths, rapidly increasing unemployment, and staggering economic dislocation. And, at the individual level, some families may be exposed to even greater pollution levels (e.g. from increased open-burning cookstove meals) during the lockdown.","aec0148e":"# This notebook covers  -\n   \n*  Analyzing pollution levels in delhi over the years from 2015 to 2020\n*  Effect of lockdown on pollution level of delhi","9ff1c347":"# NO2 level in Delhi","697391a3":"> SO2 levels are increasing from 2015 then lowered in june 2016 then pick attained in 2017 and then again lowered after 2018","bb249208":"## Pattern of NO2 in 2019 and 2020","218c0cad":"> As from the above graph we can see that PM10 is lower this year in march and april , it may be because of lockdown (as compared to year 2019)                                                                                                                       \n> PM10 level in 28 march 2019 ~  257.27                                                                                             \n> PM10 level in 28 march 2020 ~  34.15","5dc7fcdc":"### Particular matter\n\nParticulate matter is a mix of solids and liquids, including carbon, complex organic chemicals, sulphates, nitrates, mineral dust, and water suspended in the air.\n\nPM varies in size. Some particles, such as dust, soot, dirt or smoke are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. But the most damaging particles are the smaller particles, known as PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 refers to particles with a diameter smaller than 10 microns (10\u00b5m) \u2013 that\u2019s 100 times smaller than a millimetre. PM2.5 refers to particles with a diameter smaller than 2.5 microns, and these are known as fine particles. The smallest fine particles, less than 0.1 micron in diameter, are called ultrafine particles.\n\n### Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\n\nNitrogen dioxide is a gas and is a major component of urban air pollution episodes.Man-made sources of nitrogen oxides(NO), including nitrogen dioxide(NO2), are vehicles, power stations and heating. Diesel vehicles are major contributors in urban areas. Roadside levels are highest where traffic is busiest.\n\n### Ozone (O3)\n\nOzone is a gas composed of 3 atoms of oxygen. In the upper level of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, it absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation.Near the ground, ozone is made by a chemical reaction between the sun\u2019s rays and organic gases and oxides of nitrogen emitted by cars, power plants, chemical plants and other sources.Ozone is usually highest in the spring and summer and lowest in the winter. Ozone levels are highest during the afternoon and are often higher in the country than in towns. Ozone is a major component of summer air pollution episodes.\n\n### Sulphur dioxide (SO2)\n\nSulphur dioxide is a colourless gas, with a pungent, suffocating smell. It\u2019s produced by burning sulphur-containing fuels such as coal and oil. This includes vehicles, power generation and heating.\nMost sulphur dioxide comes from electric industries that burn fossil fuels, and also from petrol refineries and cement manufacturing.
