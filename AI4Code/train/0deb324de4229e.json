And, we have not made any profits yet.\n- The reason is that \"Moving average crossover strategy\" actually does not perform that great in reality. \n- The first company that we took has an overall upward trend. That is why we were able to get such huge profit.\n- Also; we've implemented over 10 days and 30 days period. In reality, whenever this strategy is applied, it never does good for short period of times, We stake bigger mmoving_averages.\n- Even after that, this strategy does not promise good returns.\n- The main reason is behind the intuition for the strategy. This strategy is used as it tells us about the trend. And, that is exactly it fails may times.\n- It tells us about the trend when the trend has already started. Not before that.\n\n#### I used this here to demonstrate how we can automate trading with pyhton. Which is called algorithemic trading. This perticular strategy is not actually used for trading. But this gives an idea of how algorithemic trading works. We use more advanced techniques in real which, you'll see in my upcoming notebooks.\n\n#### Thank You! I hope this notebook gave you a fair knowledge of how we can use python for trading and of \"Moving Average Crossover Strategy\" .Feel free to comment for any query or suggestions. I would love to know your thoughts on this one.","46e14011":"## Transection history:","bc157ac0":"## Model Performance\n### Now; we'll see how our model has performed. For that, let's define some new attributes:\n- Direction is same as temp: -1=shares bought, +1=shares sold.\n- Cur_Shares is No of shares that we hold on that perticular day.\n- Transection stimulates our bank account transection. i.e. money deducted for buying shares or money came in as we sold our shares.\n- Profits is just the cumulative sum of transections. It tells us how much money we have made till date.","7ab907a2":"## Getting data from the web.","238265d8":"- Link for inflation rate: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inflation_in_India\n\n#### We have observed that:\n- Saving money is not a good idea. It just loses its value over time.\n- Bank deposit is a better idea than just saving it.\n- Our trading strategy has given us a huge return on out meer investment.","dbab41c9":"## Strategy and Rules\n\n- We are going to apply a trading strategy which is possibly the easiest, that is: \"Moving Average Crossover Strategy\".\n\n### Terms:\n- N_moving average : Average of any attribute calculated over last N observed values. Moving average smoothens the curve of a trend line. And, gives us better understanding of the trend.\n- Fast signal      : Smaller moving average (ex. 10 days \/ 20 days moving average) It is called fast signal because it moves closely to the actual trend. (We'll see this later in this notebook)\n- Slow signal      : Bigger moving average (ex. 30 dys, 50 days, 200 days) It is called slow signal because it changes less with the changes of values. (Will be clearer with the visualization.)\n\n### Rules:\n- When fast signal crosses over slow signal; it indicates a change in trend.\n- If fast signal has been lower than the slow signal and now has a crossover and gets higher than the slow signal; it indicates an upward trend.\n- If fast signal has been higher than the slow signal and now has a crossover and gets smaller than the slow signal; it indicates an downward trend.\n\n### Strategy:\n- We'll buy stock at the positive crossover, i.e. on a signal of upward trend.\n- We'll sell stocks at the begetive crossover, i.e. on a signal of negative trend.\n- This way we'll be able to buy a stock in the starting of an upward trend and sell them as soon as the trend starts going downwards.\n- We'll only nuy one share of stock at a time.","00cb6922":"## Observations","57fa1e54":"#### Here, one thing to keep in mind is that, profit going negetive does not mean loss, it is just that we are buying shares again. But after that on selling, if we don't get higher than before then it is a loss.","cb48d057":"- WE'LL proceed with Bajaj Fiinserv here.
