The other ones are far behind, but are probably also widely used. Just not as a primary tool. \n\nFor example, probably every Kaggler has used Excel at some point.","36c26af8":"## Let's dive right in!","fdf83748":"A lot of Kagglers are hesitant to share their yearly compensation.

This makes sense, because a large part of the Kaggle platform is about learning and developing. This naturally attracts more students and less experienced people.\n\nHowever, we also see a substantial amount of Kagglers with more than 5 years of experience. This makes the platform a nice ecosystem of students and professionals. Students are probably more concerned with learning and professionals with sharing and competing. \n\nThis does not mean of course that students can't share or compete nor that professionals cannot learn from students. Everyone can compete, share and learn in the fast-evolving field of Data Science!"}}
