We can assume that these high (positive) skewness stocks (especially XRP and ADA), are more desirable by investors since there is some probability to gain huge profit that potentially cover all the frequent small losses. On the other hand, the stock with low (negative) skewness (specifically SPY) is less desirable. BTC and ETH are the crypto assets which their skewness are in the medium level amongst others.
