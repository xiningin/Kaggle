Type of chest pain-represented by 4 values(0,1,2 and 3)\n4. Resting blood pressure\n5. Serum cholesterol which is the combined measurement of HDL and LDL (high and low density lipo-proteins). HDL is often deemed as good cholesterol and indicates lower risk of heart disease whereas LDL is seen as bad cholesterol which indicates a higher risk of heart disease and increased plaque formation in your blood vessels and arteries. \n6. Fasting blood sugar which indicates the level of diabetes and is considered to be a risk factor if found to be above 120 mg\/dl.\n7. Resting electrocardiographic results which measure the electrical activity of the heart. It can diagnose the irregular heart rhythms, abnormally slow heart rhythms, evidence of an evolving\/acute heart attack possibilities etc. \n8. Maximum heart rate achieved is the average maximum number of times our heart beats per minute. It is calculates as (220-age of the person).\n9. Exercise induced angina(AP) is a common concern among cardiac patients. Angina is usually stable but is triggered when we do physical activity especially in cold conditions.\n10. Oldpeak is described as the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. ST depression occurs when the J point is displaced below baseline. Not all ST depressions represents an emergency condition.\n11. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n12. The number of major vessels\n13.

A well known fact is that adults over the age of 60 are more likely to suffer from heart diseases than younger adults. So, we create a separate column to filter the entries in which the person is either 60 years or older. We can do this by assigning 0's to those below 60 years of age and 1's to people over 60.
