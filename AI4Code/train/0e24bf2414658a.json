The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.\n#### Goals of data analysis:  \nYour goals are divided into three sub-goals:\n- ##### Investment type analysis: \nComparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.\n- ##### Country analysis: \nIdentifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Funds\u2019 favourites as well.\n- ##### Sector analysis: \nUnderstanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight 'main sectors' provided in the mapping file. The two files \u2014 companies and rounds2 \u2014 have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)\n","aa0d6121":"### Exploratory data analysis\n##### Company analysis:","a66a606e":"As we see there are more null values, we need to impute these values with avg value of each respective funding_round_type","6b301448":"Checking if improper \"0\" values found in words in category_list of master_frame, like in mapping category_list","32a2741f":"and also \/organization\/ word present for every permalink row, its good idea to keep it simple with just name, so removing \/organization\/"}}
