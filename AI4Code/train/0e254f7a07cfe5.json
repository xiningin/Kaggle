The notebook features n-grams and aggrigation.\n\nThanks to:\n* Art124 https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/art12400 for both the dataset and the task","55475f05":"# n-Grams\nN-grams are a tool in nlp for finding sets of commonly co-occuring words, where n refers to the number of consecutive occuring words. for instance 'Machine', 'Learning', 'Rules' would be a 3 word n-gram or trigram. Notice how the tope seven bigrams overlap and have the same count, this is because there are multiple identical entries. When we view skip-grams (where words don't need to occur imediately next to one another) we start seeing more non-overlapping counts.","a7562ea9":"The two datasets are from December 1, 2018 to November 30, 2019.
