But what size should we make our \"bands\"?\nLet's do some exploration to find a good value.","d2989e86":"#### ~24% Less than Optimal\n\nWe now see a total route size of 1,865,000 which is about 24% less than Optimal (compared to Kaggle Competition leaderboard).  But we have some benefits:\n\n* Our route contains round trips to the \"hub\" so we can get more gifts or have elfs do some of the timezones\/wedges\n* Our route is broken up into evenly sized distributions (by city count)\n* Our route has a predictable path\n   * This is important in Logistics where we'd want to load packages in a \"first in, last out\" order\n      * Imagine the label for a gift being printed at the fulfillment center.  This is 1 or 2 days before delivery.  At that time we can print the \"wedge\" and \"band\" on the label.  This information can then be used to sort the package in \"first in, last out\" order into the delivery truck.  The alternative, which is also popular, is to relabel the package at the delivery \"hub\".\n \n#### Further Considerations and Improvements\n\nThere is still more to consider and improve!\n\n* Could we use a variable band width inside a wedge?\n* We balance the wedges by cities (with assumption that each city has the same number of stops and gifts), but we should also balance by distance and time\n   * For Logistics we'd want to assign the same amount of \"work\" to each delivery person\n      * Equal \"work\" is a balance of city density, time, distance, gifts and addresses per stop","2fdc6f07":"#### Polygon Route\nThe shortest route should be one where the path does not cross itself.\nThus let's try to create a polygon where each node is a city.\nTo do this, we'll add a column to the data being the arctan2 of where that city is in comparison to the north pole.","207d85b1":"#### Logistics Considerations\n\nI'm more interested in seeing what happens if we make some assumptions about Santa doing the deliveries.  Many of these assumptions are things we would need to consider in Logistics.\n\n* Santa only delivers at night.  This means he cannot travel to arbitrary locations.  Instead he needs to visit a time zone when it is night and avoid timezones when it is daylight.\n * We can model this by dividing the delivery area into 24 \"wedges\".  Think of each wedge being an area that Santa needs to complete all deliveries within 1 hour.\n * With Logisitics we may want to accomplish all deliveries at the same time.  Thus we may assign each \"wedge\" to a different delivery person so that they can be done in parallel.\n* Santa probably can't carry all presents in his bag\/sleigh.  Yes, he is magical but he may need to return to the North Pole to get more presents.\n * With this assumption, we'll center the \"wedges\" around the North Pole and we'll make each \"wedge\" a roundtrip where he goes out and back.\n * With Logistics we'd want a \"Hub\" where all the delivery people start from.  Thus the aligns well with \"wedges\" around the North Pole (Hub).\n \nFor simplicity, let's assume that each citiy receives the same number of presents.  Thus we can divide the cities equally across the wedges (each wedge thus has 1\/24th of the total cities)","65fa11e0":"# Logistics and Travelling Santa\n\nThis started with an exploration of how to solve the problem as-is.\nBut I became interested in how to make this more \"real world\" and consider many practical limitations and how to address those considerations in the scope of this problem.\n\n#### Let's first import some modules that we'll be using","69fba269":"#### >50% Improvement\n\nWe see a more than 50% improvement but it still doesn't look good.  In this case we have a big variance in distance between consecutive points as they vary in distance from the center (north pole).\n\nLet's try to divide this route into \"bands\".  To do this, let's add a distance from the center (north pole) to our data.","cea10682":"#### Let's see what the data looks like","622b21eb":"#### Define some functions to help us compute the score for a given route","89e10fc1":"#### Let's create a really simple route that passes thru each city and compute the score for that route\n"}}
