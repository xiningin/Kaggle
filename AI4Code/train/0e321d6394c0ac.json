Question or problem definition.\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\n7. Supply or submit the results.\n\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\n\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https:\/\/en.wikiversity.org\/wiki\/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\n\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\n\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.","0f06956d":"We can now remove the AgeBand feature.","6a3f2118":"## Wrangle data\n\nWe have collected several assumptions and decisions regarding our datasets and solution requirements. So far we did not have to change a single feature or value to arrive at these. Let us now execute our decisions and assumptions for correcting, creating, and completing goals.\n\n### Correcting by dropping features\n\nThis is a good starting goal to execute. By dropping features we are dealing with fewer data points. Speeds up our notebook and eases the analysis.\n\nBased on our assumptions and decisions we want to drop the Cabin (correcting #2) and Ticket (correcting #1) features.\n\nNote that where applicable we perform operations on both training and testing datasets together to stay consistent.","addb08a9":"### Completing a categorical feature\n\nEmbarked feature takes S, Q, C values based on port of embarkation.

We will first do this for the Age feature.\n\nWe can consider three methods to complete a numerical continuous feature.\n\n1. A simple way is to generate random numbers between mean and [standard deviation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Standard_deviation).\n\n2. More accurate way of guessing missing values is to use other correlated features. In our case we note correlation among Age, Gender, and Pclass. Guess Age values using [median](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Median) values for Age across sets of Pclass and Gender feature combinations. So, median Age for Pclass=1 and Gender=0, Pclass=1 and Gender=1, and so on...\n\n3. Combine methods 1 and 2. So instead of guessing age values based on median, use random numbers between mean and standard deviation, based on sets of Pclass and Gender combinations.\n\nMethod 1 and 3 will introduce random noise into our models. The results from multiple executions might vary. We will prefer method 2.","ecf057cd":"## Model, predict and solve\n\nNow we are ready to train a model and predict the required solution.

We are also perfoming a category of machine learning which is called supervised learning as we are training our model with a given dataset. With these two criteria - Supervised Learning plus Classification and Regression, we can narrow down our choice of models to a few.

We also do not need the PassengerId feature in the training dataset.","c21b9d8d":"## Analyze by visualizing data\n\nNow we can continue confirming some of our assumptions using visualizations for analyzing the data.\n\n### Correlating numerical features\n\nLet us start by understanding correlations between numerical features and our solution goal (Survived).\n\nA histogram chart is useful for analyzing continous numerical variables like Age where banding or ranges will help identify useful patterns. The histogram can indicate distribution of samples using automatically defined bins or equally ranged bands. This helps us answer questions relating to specific bands (Did infants have better survival rate?)\n\nNote that x-axis in historgram visualizations represents the count of samples or passengers.\n\n**Observations.**\n\n- Infants (Age <=4) had high survival rate.\n- Oldest passengers (Age = 80) survived.\n- Large number of 15-25 year olds did not survive.\n- Most passengers are in 15-35 age range.\n\n**Decisions.**\n\nThis simple analysis confirms our assumptions as decisions for subsequent workflow stages.\n\n- We should consider Age (our assumption classifying #2) in our model training.\n- Complete the Age feature for null values (completing #1).\n- We should band age groups (creating #3).","30886121":"### Converting categorical feature to numeric\n\nWe can now convert the Embarked Fill feature by creating a new numeric Port feature.","034e00da":"**What is the distribution of numerical feature values across the samples?**\n\nThis helps us determine, among other early insights, how representative is the training dataset of the actual problem domain.\n\n- Total samples are 891 or 40% of the actual number of passengers on board the Titanic (2,224).\n- Survived is a categorical feature with 0 or 1 values.\n- Around 38% samples survived representative of the actual survival rate at 32%.\n- Most passengers (> 75%) did not travel with parents or children.\n- Nearly 30% of the passengers had siblings and\/or spouse aboard.\n- Fares varied significantly with few passengers (<1%) paying as high as $512.\n- Few elderly passengers (<1%) within age range 65-80.","a0a38c7d":"### Quick completing and converting a numeric feature\n\nWe can now complete the Fare feature for single missing value in test dataset using mode to get the value that occurs most frequently for this feature. We do this in a single line of code.\n\nNote that we are not creating an intermediate new feature or doing any further analysis for correlation to guess missing feature as we are replacing only a single value. The completion goal achieves desired requirement for model algorithm to operate on non-null values.\n\nWe may also want round off the fare to two decimals as it represents currency.","6780ebf9":"Let us create Age bands and determine correlations with Survived.","7b1e3127":"**Which features are categorical?**\n\nThese values classify the samples into sets of similar samples. Within categorical features are the values nominal, ordinal, ratio, or interval based? Among other things this helps us select the appropriate plots for visualization.\n\n- Categorical: Survived, Sex, and Embarked. Ordinal: Pclass.\n\n**Which features are numerical?**\n\nWhich features are numerical? These values change from sample to sample. Within numerical features are the values discrete, continuous, or timeseries based? Among other things this helps us select the appropriate plots for visualization.\n\n- Continous: Age, Fare. Discrete: SibSp, Parch.","f992ea69":"**Which features are mixed data types?**\n\nNumerical, alphanumeric data within same feature. These are candidates for correcting goal.\n\n- Ticket is a mix of numeric and alphanumeric data types. Cabin is alphanumeric.\n\n**Which features may contain errors or typos?**\n\nThis is harder to review for a large dataset, however reviewing a few samples from a smaller dataset may just tell us outright, which features may require correcting.\n\n- Name feature may contain errors or typos as there are several ways used to describe a name including titles, round brackets, and quotes used for alternative or short names.","a493468d":"We can replace many titles with a more common name or classify them as `Rare`.","78e10a48":"### Creating new feature extracting from existing\n\nWe want to analyze if Name feature can be engineered to extract titles and test correlation between titles and survival, before dropping Name and PassengerId features.\n\nIn the following code we extract Title feature using regular expressions. The RegEx pattern `(\\w+\\.)` matches the first word which ends with a dot character within Name feature. The `expand=False` flag returns a DataFrame.\n\n**Observations.**\n\nWhen we plot Title, Age, and Survived, we note the following observations.\n\n- Most titles band Age groups accurately. For example: Master title has Age mean of 5 years.\n- Survival among Title Age bands varies slightly.\n- Certain titles mostly survived (Mme, Lady, Sir) or did not (Don, Rev, Jonkheer).\n\n**Decision.**\n\n- We decide to retain the new Title feature for model training.","bad9ae5d":"Let us start by preparing an empty array to contain guessed Age values based on Pclass x Gender combinations.","2ec74ffb":"We can also create an artificial feature combining Pclass and Age.","bb948563":"### Create new feature combining existing features\n\nWe can create a new feature for FamilySize which combines Parch and SibSp. This will enable us to drop Parch and SibSp from our datasets.","23d47dbe":"### Correlating numerical and ordinal features\n\nWe can combine multiple features for identifying correlations using a single plot. This can be done with numerical and categorical features which have numeric values.\n\n**Observations.**\n\n- Pclass=3 had most passengers, however most did not survive. Confirms our classifying assumption #2.\n- Infant passengers in Pclass=2 and Pclass=3 mostly survived. Further qualifies our classifying assumption #2.\n- Most passengers in Pclass=1 survived. Confirms our classifying assumption #3.\n- Pclass varies in terms of Age distribution of passengers.\n\n**Decisions.**\n\n- Consider Pclass for model training.","964fb1f8":"## Acquire data\n\nThe Python Pandas packages helps us work with our datasets. We start by acquiring the training and testing datasets into Pandas DataFrames. We also combine these datasets to run certain operations on both datasets together.","b0291cfa":"### Assumtions based on data analysis\n\nWe arrive at following assumptions based on data analysis done so far. We may validate these assumptions further before taking appropriate actions.\n\n**Correlating.**\n\nWe want to know how well does each feature correlate with Survival. We want to do this early in our project and match these quick correlations with modelled correlations later in the project.\n\n**Completing.**\n\n1. We may want to complete Age feature as it is definitely correlated to survival.\n2. We may want to complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.\n\n**Correcting.**\n\n1. Ticket feature may be dropped from our analysis as it contains high ratio of duplicates (22%) and there may not be a correlation between Ticket and survival.\n2. Cabin feature may be dropped as it is highly incomplete or contains many null values both in training and test dataset.\n3. PassengerId may be dropped from training dataset as it does not contribute to survival.\n4. Name feature is relatively non-standard, may not contribute directly to survival, so maybe dropped.\n\n**Creating.**\n\n1. We may want to create a new feature called Family based on Parch and SibSp to get total count of family members on board.\n2. We may want to engineer the Name feature to extract Title as a new feature.\n3. We may want to create new feature for Age bands. This turns a continous numerical feature into an ordinal categorical feature.\n4. We may also want to create a Fare range feature if it helps our analysis.\n\n**Classifying.**\n\nWe may also add to our assumptions based on the problem description noted earlier.\n\n1. Women (Sex=female) were more likely to have survived.\n2. Children (Age<?) were more likely to have survived. \n3. The upper-class passengers (Pclass=1) were more likely to have survived."}}
