Managing these damaging outbreaks is a critical priority to improve the health of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Effective management of COTS outbreaks is also a necessary complement to research and innovation that helps the Great Barrier Reef resist, adapt to, and recover from the impacts of climate change.

Vanuatu has experienced crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks numerous times, and previous COTS outbreaks documented in 2006, 2008 and 2014 caused significant reef habitat declines.\"\n\n\"There is currently an active outbreak of COTS in Vanuatu that has been observed on fringing reefs around the main island of Efate and nearby islands of Lelepa, Moso, Ifira and Hideaway, areas of high to very high coral cover. There are also reports of COTS on fringing reefs around islands to the north \u2013 Nguna, Pele, Espiritu Santo \u2013 as well as islands in the south of the country \u2013 Tanna.\"\n\n\"Due to limited resources and high accessibility of fringing reefs, COTS control is haphazard through a voluntary program, and only some data (e.g. number of COTS culled) are documented using an online reporting system1. Marine tourism operators and community groups are leading the initiative using injector kits to cull COTS, and remote villages without kits are removing COTS manually and burning or burying them. Critically, a network of committed marine stakeholders are reporting sightings of COTS in high densities and responding accordingly with collective culling efforts. Communities have also used a \u2018bounty\u2019 system as incentive to remove COTS, with Pele Island addressing a recent outbreak and protecting their high-value eco-tourism reefs.\"\n\n\"An intensive 6-months of control in 2020 removed over 5,600 COTS and identified hotspot areas around Pango Peninsula and in Mele Bay. Observations that COTS outbreaks are becoming more frequent is of great concern to the tourism and fishing sectors, and future successful COTS control will require a more strategic and coordinated approach that is locally appropriate.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.rrrc.org.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/2021-International-COTS-Control-Forum-Program-DIGITAL.pdf","bdb30d5f":"#Reviewing COTS control efforts 2012-2019: adaptive management leads to continuous improvement\n\nAuthors: Chad L Hewitt, Marnie L Campbell, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia\n\n\"The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) holds an iconic place in the Australian psyche and represents unique and outstanding values to Australia and the global community as acknowledged through its World Heritage listing in 1981. Despite numerous protections, the GBR has been under increasing stress from numerous threats resulting in decreases in hard coral cover. These include impacts from tropical cyclones, oceanic heatwaves, increased nutrient inputs, fishing pressures and coral predation by the natural predator crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) particularly during cyclic \u2018outbreaks\u2019.\"\n\n\"COTS outbreaks have some degree of predictability, particularly within the cycle of an outbreak, leading to opportunities for intervention to minimise or even prevent coral loss. When a new outbreak was detected in 2010 (the fourth outbreak cycle since the 1960s), several parties including tourism operators, reef managers and key members of the public lobbied for significant efforts to minimise COTS impact. In 2012 the Australian Government provided significant funding for manual COTS control at key economic assets between 2012 and June 2018, and additional funding for an expanded program between July 2018 to June 2020.\"\n\n\"An independent review has examined the COTS Control Program between 2012\/13 and 2018\/19.

Optimising COTS control strategies within such a complex system requires a systems-modelling approach. The Coral Community Network (CoCoNet) model represents major coral groups and age-structured COTS populations on more than 3750 reefs connected through ocean larval dispersal.

However, this will be achieved gradually over the next two decades and maintaining control capacity throughout the COTS boom-bust cycle will be critical to the success of the strategy\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.rrrc.org.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/2021-International-COTS-Control-Forum-Program-DIGITAL.pdf\n","726c1561":"#Distribution expansion and historical population outbreak patterns of crown-of-thorns \nstarfish for the last 100 years; additional insights into secondary outbreaks\n\nAuthor: Nina Yasuda\n\nDepartment of Marine Biology and Environmental Science, Faculty of Agriculture, \nUniversity of Miyazaki1-1 Gakuen Kibanadai-nishi, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan\n\n\"The distribution and population outbreak records of the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), Acanthaster cf. solaris, in Japan from 1912 to 2015 was reviewed and analyzed. The literature survey suggests that COTS distribution has been extending northwards since 1945 from Amami Ohshima (its previous northernmost distribution) to Miyake Island and Goto Island.\"\n\n\"Genetic homogeneity within Japanese COTS populations indicates that larval dispersal has likely caused this poleward migration. Water temperatures have significantly increased in the temperate area of Japan, implying that climate change is partly responsible for this poleward migration.\"\n\n\"More frequent and intense population outbreaks in temperate areas were also observed, possibly in relation to increased water temperatures and successive larval dispersal from the south. Overall, complex and persistent patterns were observed fortwo major successive population outbreaks in Japan: from 1969 to 1991 and from 1995 to now.\"\n\n\"The evidence suggests that the western Okinawa populations are the most likely origin for secondary outbreaks within Japan. The Amami population is also likely to be an important source for outbreaks intemperate regions. However, no records of intensive population outbreaks were found until 2015 for least in two regions: Ogasawara and the Ohsumi Islands.
