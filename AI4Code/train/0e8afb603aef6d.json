This might be due to few number of flight arrivals at the airport in the morning. So drivers are not willing to take the trip as they will not have a booking to return back to the city, hence they cancel the trip. \n\n2) Customers find massive number of unavailable cars during evening hours from 5PM to 10PM, this could be due to huge number of flight arrivals and departures in the evening, that results in high demand for the cabs. Hence customers could not find a cab in the evening hours. \n\n","e064a520":"# Welcome to my kernel ","1970ab77":"You have an emergency to reach a destination point, but unfortunately no cabs are available or maybe cancelled by cab driver.
