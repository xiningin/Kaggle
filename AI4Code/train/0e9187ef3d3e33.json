Get View by Continent grouping as well.\n\nTop ten countries are China, India, United States, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia, Germany, Turkey, United Kingdpm, France. China occupies 37.6% and India occupies 12.9% of Global Total. These two countries occpy over 50% of Global Total. View by Continent grouping is that Asia occpies 66.7%, America occupies 17%, Europe occupies 13.6%, Africa occupies 2.1% and Oceania occupies 0.5%.\n\n\n2) What are the Top 10 countries with fully vaccinated people? Get View by Continent grouping as well.\n\nThe Top 10 countries with fully vaccinated people are Gibraltar, Malta, Maldives, Qatar, Singapore, Portugal, Cayman Islands, Spain, Iceland, Isle of Man. View by Continent grouping is that Europe 50.0%, Americas 37.0%, Asia 32.2%, Oceania  25.3% and Africa  7.5%\n\n\n3) What are the Top 10 countries with at least 1+ doses administered?\n\nThe Top 10 countries with at least 1+ doses administered are Greenland, Gibraltar, Maldives, Falkland Islands, Portugal, Malta, Qatar, UAE, Singapore, Cayman Islands.\n\n\n4) What is the access to vaccines - by least wealthy and most wealthy countries? (based on GDP per capita per country data)\n\nThe 10 least wealthy countries are Burundi, Somalia, Mozambique, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, Afghanistan, DR Congo,Liberia and Sudan. Nine countries of 10 are in Africa.\n\nThe 10 most wealthy countries are Monaco, Liechtenstein, Bermuda, Luxembourg, Cayman Islands, Switzerland, Macau,Ireland, Norway and United States. Six countries of 10 are in Europe. Three countries are in America and one country is in Asia.\n\n\n5) What is the average daily rate of the dose administered? Which countries are Top 10 and Bottom 10? Which countries are above and below the World average?\n\nThe average daily rate of the dose administered is 166.072. Top 10 countries are India, China, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Korea, United States, Turkey. Bottom 10 countries are Anguilla, San Marino, St. Helena, Gibraltar, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Guinea-Bissau, Sint Maarten, Turks & Caicos, Bermuda, Andorra.\n\nYou can find the list of countries above and below the World average in 5)-3 and 5)-4 in this notebook. 33 countries are above the World average and 168 countries are below the World average. In 33 countries above the average, 17 countries are in Asia, 7 countries are in Ameria and in Europe. One is in Africa and in Oceania. In 168 countries below the average, 50 countries are in Africa, 36 countries are in Europe, 33 countries are in America, 30 countries are in Asia and 7 countries are in Oceania.\n\n\n2 Insight\n\nAccording the webite 'worldmeter' ( https:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/geography\/7-continents\/ ), world population share of continents in 2020 are Asia 59.54%, Africa 17.2%, Europe 9.59%, America 13.13% and Oceania 0.55%.\n\nOn the other hand, share in which vaccinations are administered is that Europe 50.0%, Americas 37.0%, Asia 32.2%, Oceania  25.3% and Africa  7.5%. And average fully vaccinated people is that Europe 50.0%, Americas 37.0%, Asia 32.2%, Oceania  25.3% and Africa  7.5%. Nine countries of least wealthy 10 countries are in Africa.\n\nIt is very huge umbalance and it also means that Vaccien Gap is very serious especially in Africa.\n\nI can find the positive correlation between Percentage of population fully vaccinated and GDP. Technology may help us improve not only GDP of Africa but also supply chain of vaccine in Africa. HealthTech, Data Science and global cooperation are necessity for it.\nhttps:\/\/www.devex.com\/news\/sponsored\/opinion-bridging-the-vaccine-gap-threatening-africa-100447\n","e9168874":"1) What are the Top 10 countries where vaccinations are administered?
