ARIMA with Python\nThe statsmodels library provides the capability to fit an ARIMA model.\n\nAn ARIMA model can be created using the statsmodels library as follows:\n\n1. Define the model by calling ARIMA() and passing in the p, d, and q parameters.\n2. The model is prepared on the training data by calling the fit() function.\n3. Predictions can be made by calling the predict() function and specifying the index of the time or times to be predicted.\n\nFirst, we fit an *ARIMA(5,1,0) model*. This sets the lag value to 5 for autoregression, uses a difference order of 1 to make the time series stationary, and uses a moving average model of 0.\n\nWhen fitting the model, a lot of debug information is provided about the fit of the linear regression model. We can turn this off by setting the disp argument to 0.","37a0e19c":"There is a positive correlation with the first 10-to-12 lags that is perhaps significant for the first 5 lags.\n\nA good starting point for the AR parameter of the model may be 5.","e2f94600":"# ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting\nlink: https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python\/","7e358c72":"# 1. Reading data, datetime index","41e196f1":"# 5. Configuring an ARIMA Model\nThe classical approach for fitting an ARIMA model is to follow the Box-Jenkins Methodology.\n\nThis is a process that uses time series analysis and diagnostics to discover good parameters for the ARIMA model.\n\nIn summary, the steps of this process are as follows:\n\n1. **Model Identification**. Use plots and summary statistics to identify trends, seasonality, and autoregression elements to get an idea of the amount of differencing and the size of the lag that will be required.\n2. **Parameter Estimation**. Use a fitting procedure to find the coefficients of the regression model.\n3. **Model Checking.** Use plots and statistical tests of the residual errors to determine the amount and type of temporal structure not captured by the model.\n\nThe process is repeated until either a desirable level of fit is achieved on the in-sample or out-of-sample observations (e.g. training or test datasets).","773205f7":"from datetime import datetime\ntime_value = [datetime.strptime('190'+df.Month[i] , '%Y-%m') for i in range(len(df))]","f9010d31":"# 4.
