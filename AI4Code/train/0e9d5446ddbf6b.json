After fine-tuning the hyperparameters we obtain the following metrics:\n\n+ Precision: **67%**\n+ Recall: **70%**\n+ Accuracy: **70%**\n+ f1: **0.68**\n\nThe performance in the test set is as follows:\n\n+ Precision: **63**\n+ Recall: **66%**\n+ Accuracy: **66%**\n+ f1: **0.64**\n\nSince this is multiclass classification, we are talking about weighted scores. However, the scores obtained by each class are very different. It can be seen that the result is terrible in the extreme scores (3, 4 and 8). As we saw in the distribution of the target variable, it is very unbalanced, there are hardly any observations for the extreme values, so the model does not have enough training data for all the quality scores.\n\nAll predictor variables are relevant to the model. The three that most affect prediction are the following:\n\n+ alcohol\n+ sulphates\n+ volatile acidity\n\nIt could be interesting to evaluate the model by segmenting our target variable into quality ranges (for example, bad and good) and see if we obtain better results.","6d280588":"After adjusting hyperparameters, a very slight improvement is achieved over the default hyperparameters.
