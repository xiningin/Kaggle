Sr\u0161en used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\n**Products**\n\n1.\tBellabeat app: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n\n2.\tLeaf: Bellabeat\u2019s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n\n3.\tTime: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\n\n\n4.\tSpring: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.\n\n**Purpose of this Analysis**\n\nDuring this analysis I will carefully examine how consumers use their smart fitness devices to improve their health. In order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices, I will examine a public data set provided by Fitbit on Kaggle and gather information that might help us to develop an effective marketing strategy for BellaBeats fitness products.\n\n**Data Credibility and Integrity****\n\nEven though the data has been provided by a credible organization, this dataset may contain \u201csampling bias\u201d As it does not represent the population as a whole. Unfortunately, only information from thirty participants were gathered during this process and we have no idea as to what genders are included during this analysis and how it might affect our conclusions regarding BellaBeats \u201cwomen exclusive\u201d products.\n\n**ASK**\n\nI will first begin this analysis by highlighting some important key questions. \n1.\tWhat are some trends in smart device usage?\n2.\tHow could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3.\tHow could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n**PREPARE**\n\nTo ensure maximum reliability of this analysis I used a public data provided by Mobius on Kaggle named, \u201cFitbit Fitness Tracker Data.\u201d This dataset explores smart device users\u2019 daily habits and contains personal data of thirty Fitbit users, who consented to the submission of their personal fitness data to be used specifically for this analysis. \nI first began the analysis by examining four data sets in CSV format.\n\n* dailyActivity_merged.csv\n* dailySteps_merged.csv\n* weightLogInfo_merged.csv\n* sleepDay_merged.csv\n\n\nUpon browsing through the data sets in google sheets, I determined that the data has been stored as long data as it contains multiple variables for each ID user and will require advanced statistical analysis and graphing.\n\nTherefore, I have chosen to use Python for deeper and further analysis.\n","d4a245b4":"**Now I will proceed to merge the data.**\n\n**We will merge daily_steps and df_weigloginfo to see any correlation between variables by using id and date as their primary keys.**\n\n**We will merge daily_activity and daily_sleep to see any correlation between variables by using id and date as their primary keys.**\n\n","a37267ab":"***There seems to be duplicates which have been found in df_sleepDay.

This could be due to several factors, such as stress and the inability to commit to a schedule. According to the results, users who sleep at least 7 hours each night tend to have higher incremental steps than those who display irregular sleeping patterns. The best recommendation for solving this problem would be for Bella beats to build \"daily routine apps\" integrated into each of their products so that these reminders can help users improve their daily habits.https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/sleep\/about_sleep\/how_much_sleep.html\n\n In addition, there seem to be more sedentary and lightly active users than 'very active,' which brings us to the issue of motivation as well.\nBellabeat needs to take a different approach for its users by developing a compelling brand story that connects with its users. An effective brand story will give purpose to the product, thereby attracting more customers who will be loyal to the brand.\n","593b0375":"****Now we will identify all the unique users per data frame. ****","0df51831":"****Id 1927972279\t133.500000\t916.129032 seems very unmotivated, which bring us to the issue of motivation.
