We will try to see if what the model predicted was reasonable or not. In this case the mistakes look reasonable (none of the mistakes seems obviously naive). This is an indicator that our classifier is working correctly. \n\nFurthermore, when we plot the confusion matrix, we can see that the distribution is heavily skewed: the model makes the same mistakes over and over again but it rarely confuses other categories. This suggests that it just finds it difficult to distinguish some specific categories between each other; this is normal behaviour.","a7bc5b02":"It's astonishing that it's possible to recognize pet breeds so accurately!

Parkhi et al., 2012](http:\/\/www.robots.ox.ac.uk\/~vgg\/publications\/2012\/parkhi12a\/parkhi12a.pdf) which features 12 cat breeds and 25 dogs breeds. Our model will need to learn to differentiate between these 37 distinct categories. According to their paper, the best accuracy they could get in 2012 was 59.21%, using a complex model that was specific to pet detection, with separate \"Image\", \"Head\", and \"Body\" models for the pet photos. Let's see how accurate we can be using deep learning!\n\nWe are going to use the `untar_data` function to which we must pass a URL as an argument and which will download and extract the data.","ee808e99":"Since our model is working as we expect it to, we will *unfreeze* our model and train some more.","156d0f43":"## Training: resnet50","e7a7fd9b":"## Looking at the data","e3d7fc2e":"In this lesson we will build our first image classifier from scratch, and see if we can achieve world-class results.

We _always_ need to understand very well what the problem is and what the data looks like before we can figure out how to solve it. Taking a look at the data means understanding how the data directories are structured, what the labels are and what some sample images look like.\n\nThe main difference between the handling of image classification datasets is the way labels are stored. In this particular dataset, labels are stored in the filenames themselves. We will need to extract them to be able to classify the images into the correct categories. Fortunately, the fastai library has a handy function made exactly for this, `ImageDataBunch.from_name_re` gets the labels from the filenames using a [regular expression](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3.6\/library\/re.html).","b893dcae":"## Unfreezing, fine-tuning, and learning rates","ebfe6567":"Now we will train in the same way as before but with one caveat: instead of using resnet34 as our backbone we will use resnet50 (resnet34 is a 34 layer residual network while resnet50 has 50 layers. It will be explained later in the course and you can learn the details in the [resnet paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1512.03385.pdf)).\n\nBasically, resnet50 usually performs better because it is a deeper network with more parameters. Let's see if we can achieve a higher performance here. To help it along, let's us use larger images too, since that way the network can see more detail. We reduce the batch size a bit since otherwise this larger network will require more GPU memory.","e878fdfa":"If it doesn't, you can always go back to your previous model.","a4a0dd0f":"Now we will start training our model. We will use a [convolutional neural network](http:\/\/cs231n.github.io\/convolutional-networks\/) backbone and a fully connected head with a single hidden layer as a classifier. Don't know what these things mean? Not to worry, we will dive deeper in the coming lessons. For the moment you need to know that we are building a model which will take images as input and will output the predicted probability for each of the categories (in this case, it will have 37 outputs).\n\nWe will train for 4 epochs (4 cycles through all our data)."}}
