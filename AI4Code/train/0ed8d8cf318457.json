On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. That's why the name DieTanic. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget. \n\nIt took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for beginners to start a journey in data science and participate in competition in Kaggle. \n\nThe objective of this notebook is to give an idea how is the workflow in any predictive modeling problem.

For this, we will use pandas.qcut. \n\nSo what qcut does is it splits or arranges the values according the number of bins we have passed. So if we pass for 5 bins, it will arrange the values equally spaced into 5 seperate bins or value ranges. ","7f28e186":"Family_Size=0 means that the passenger is alone. Clearly, if you are alone or family_size=0, then chances for survival is very low. For family_size>4, the changes decreases, too. This also looks to be an important feature for the model. Let's examine this further. ","accc1fdc":"Now the above correlation plot, we can see some positively related features. Some of them being SibSp and Family_size and Parch and Family_size and some negative ones like Alone and Family_size.

This feature may become an important feature during modeling along with the Sex. ","320afa30":"## Part1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)","69742430":"**Observations:**\n\nHere too the results are quite similar. Passengers with their parents onboard have greater chance of survival. It however reduces as the number goes up. \n\nThe chances of survival is good for somebody who has 1-3 parents on the ship. Being alone also proves to be fatal and the chances for survival decreases when somebody has >4 parents on the ship.","760db3cf":"Observations:\n\n1) The number of children increases with Pclass and the survival rate for passengers below Age 10(i.e children) looks to be good irrespective of the Pclass.\n\n2) Survival chances for Passengers aged 20-50 from Pclass 1 is high and is even better for Women. \n\n3) For males, the survival chances decreases with an increase in age. \n\nAs we had seen earlier, the Age feature has 177 null values. To replace these NaN values, we can assign them the mean age of the dataset. \n\nBut the problem is, there were many people with many different ages. We just can't assign a 4 year kid with the mean age that is 29 years. Is there any way to find out what age-band does the passenger lie?\n\nBingo!! We can check the Name feature. Looking upon the feature, we can see that the names have a salutation like Mr or Mrs. Thus we can assign the man values of Mr and Mrs to the respective groups. \n\n\"What is in a Name??\"","18863d32":"**Correlation Between the Features**","e326a798":"The Age, Cabin and Embarked have null values. I will try to fix them. ","d284f7c7":"**Gaussian Naive Bayes**","8fd9f04d":"### Cross Validation\n\nMany a times, the data is imbalanced, i.e there may be a high number of class 1 instances but less number of other class instances. Thus we should train and test our algorithm on each and every instance of the dataset. Then we can take an average of all the noted accuracies over the dataset. \n\n1) The K-Fold Cross Validation works by first dividing the dataset into k-subsets. \n\n2) Let's say we divide the dataset into (k=5) parts. We reserve 1 part for testing and train the algorithm over the 4 parts. \n\n3) We continue the process by changing the testing part in each iteration and training the algorithm over the other parts. The accuracies and errors are then averaged to get a average accuracy of the algorithm. \n\nThis is called K-Fold Cross Validation. \n\n4) An algorithm may underfit over a dataset for some data and sometimes also overfit the data for other training set. Thus with cross-validation, we can achieve a generalized model.

","5ae63d19":"**Observations:**\n\nThe barplot and factorplot shows that if a passenger is alone onboard with no siblings, he have 34.5% survival rate. The graph roughly decreases if the number of siblings increase. This makes sense. That is, if I have a family on board, I will try to save them instead of saving myself first. Surprisingly the survival for families with 5-8 members is 0%. The reason may be Pclass??\n\nThe reason is Pclass. The crosstab shows that Person with SibSp > 3 were all in Pclass 3. It is imminent that all the large families in Pclass(>) died. ","b6b9294d":"**Dropping UnNeeded Features**\n\nName: We don't need name feature as it cannot be converted into any categorical value.\n\nAge: We have the Age_band feature, so no need to this. \n\nTicket: It is any random string that cannot be categorised. \n\nFare: We have the Fare_cat feature, so unneeded. \n\nCabin: A lot of NaN values and also many passengers have multiple cabins. So, this is a useless feature. \n\nFare_Range: We have the fare_cat feature. \n\nPassengerId: Cannot be categorized. ","7c481090":"**Observations:**\n\n1) The survival chances are almost 1 for women for Pclass 1 and Pclass 2 irrespective of the Pclass. \n\n2) Port S looks to be very unlucky for Pclass 3 Passengers as the survival rate for both men and women is very low.

","a80b264a":"**SibSp --> Discriete Feature**","77463a19":"**Age_band**\n\nAs I have mentioned earlier that Age is a continuous feature, there is a problem with Continuous Variables in Machine Learning Models. \n\nWe need to convert these continuous values into categorical values by either binning or normalization. I will using binning i.e group a range of ages into a single bin or assign them a single value. \n\nThe maximum age of a passenger was 80. So let's divide the range from 0-80 into 5 bins.

","02925639":"We use FactorPlot in this case, because they make the seperation of categorical values easy. \n\nLooking at the CrossTab and the FactorPlot, we can easily infer that survival for Women from Pclass 1 is about 95-96%, as only 3 out of 94 Women from Pclass 1 died. \n\nIt is evident that regardless of Pclass, Women were given first priority while rescue. Let's analyze other features.

","712f9f71":"**Observations in a Nutshell for all features:**\n\nSex: The chance of survival for women is high as compared to men. \n\nPclass: There is visible trend that being a 1st class passenger gives you better chances of survival. The survival rate for Pclass3 is very low. For women, the chance of survival from Pclass1 is almost 1 and is high too for those from Pclass2. Money Wins!!!\n\nAge: Children less than 5-10 years do have a high chance of survival. Passengers between age group 15 to 35 died a lot. \n\nEmbarked: This is a very interesting feature. The chances of survival at C looks to be better than even though the majority of Pclass1 passengers got up at S. Passengers at Q were all from Pclass3. \n\nParch+SibSp: Having 1-2 siblings, spouse on board or 1-3 parents shows a greater chance of probability rather than being alone or having a large family travelling with you. ","1215864c":"As discussed above, we can clearly see that as the fare_range increases, the chances of survival increases. \n\nNow, we cannot pass the Fare_Range values as it is.

","34e57cdc":"**Family_size and Alone**\n\nAt this point, we can create a new feature called 'Family_size' and 'Alone' and analyze it. This feature is the summation of Parch and SibSp.

The reason for this maybe the rescue of all the Pclass 1 and Pclass 2 Passengers. \n\n3) The Embark S looks to the port from where majority of the rich people boarded. Still the chances for survival is low here, that is because many passengers from Pclass 3 around 81% didn't survive. \n\n4) Port Q had almost 95% of the passengers were from Pclass 3.

Let's say that a classifier is trained over a training ata and tested over the test data and it scores an accuracy of 90%. \n\nNow this seems to be very good accuracy for a classifier, but can we confirm that it will be 90% for all the new test sets that come over? The answer is No, because we can't determine which all instances will the classifier will use to train itself. As the training and testing data changes, the accuracy will also change. It may increase or decrease. This is known as model variance. \n\nTo overcome this and get a generalized model, we use Cross Validation.

Some of the features being Sex, Port of Embarcation, Age, etc. \n\nFirst, let us understand the differnt types of features. \n\n**Types of Features**\n\n**Categorical Features:**\n\nA categorical variable is one that has two or more categories and each value in that feature can be categorized by them. For example, gender is a categorical variable having two categories (male and female). Now we cannot sort of give any ordering to such variables. They are also known as Nominal Variables. \n\nCategorical Features in the dataset: Sex, Embarked.\n\n**Ordinal Features:**\n\nAn ordinal variable is similar to categorical values, but the difference between them is that we can have relative ordering or sorting between the values. For ex: If we have a feature like Height with values Tall, Medium, Short, then Height is an ordinal variable. Here we can have a relative sort in the variable. \n\nOridinal Features in the dataset: Pclass\n\n**Continuous Features:**\n\nA feature is said to be continuous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the feature column. \n\nContinuous Featrues in the dataset: Age\n","7f53f0e6":"The lowest fare is 0.0.
