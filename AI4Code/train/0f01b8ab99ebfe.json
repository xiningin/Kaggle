Another thing we must know is that it has two parts. Left and right. On the left hand side, we have product information. On the right hand side we have customer information. You can easily spot all products that are listed. But customer information is only available for some products. This is because  information about a customer is inserted once the deal is done. Logicaly, on sold items are associated with a buyer. Let\u2019s see what a row looks like. This should clear the logic of the table for you.  \n\nMadalyn Mercer with a custommer ID C0028 was 19 when she bought apartment 30 in building 1 to live there. She paid $246,172.68 for an area of 743.09ft in November 2005. Madaly is from Califonia.\n\nFeel Very satisfied with the deal and did not get a mortgage for the purchase. She found out about our product through our website.\n\nNow that the explanation is out of the way. It is time to identify the types of data and level of measurement for some of them. This is a crucial step because we cannot analyse the data, if we do not know its type. \n\nLet's start:\n\n1.** ID**\nis a value we assign to each item that let us to differentiate it between products. It may look numerical, but it is categorical.  To clarify it. The ID can also be infom of names like Jane1, Jane 2, Jane 3, etc.  The meaning would not change. ID variables are like name we assign to different products. However, it is much easier to use numbers as unlike names, we have infinite number of numbers. A simple way to check if a variable is numerical or categorical, is to interpret its mean. Think about it. The mean ID number will show nothing. Now oppose this to mean price. The mean price is a valuable piece of information. \n\nThe bottom line is ID is a categorical variable.  What about its level of measurement? It is Qualitative Norminal.\n\n2.  The next variable we must examine is Age. ** Age **is rather interesting. The level of measurement is Quantitative Ratio. A real use for verifying ratio is asking the question, is there a true 0 point. Well for age when you were born you were exactly 0 years old. That\u2019s the true zero point. So we are safe. However, what\u2019s intrguigng is whether age is discrete or continuous. It maybe both. In this case, we can only see age as a whole number. Therefore is it discrete.\n\n3 \u2022\tThe next variable we have is **age interval. This is yet another way to represent age. Once again is it continuous or discrete as we are talking about the same variable. This time though the level of measurement is ordinal , instead of a ratio. The age group represent different category order but are not numerical. This shows that the same variable can have different level of measurement within the same database. \n\n4. In most  corporate analysis, **price** is central. No matter the dataset, it is always a numerical variable. And like age may be discrete or continuous depending on their needs. The level of measurement here is ratio\n\n5. Another variable to look at is **gender**. It is of categorical type and its level of measurement is norminal. It is similar to the yes no question. Such variables are called (Binary). As there are only two possibilities.\n\n6 **Location**( such as state is a  categorical variable like ID we talked about earlier. You can label the US state from 1 to 50 and use the numbers instead. Either way, the variable is categorical. And its level of measurement is norminal \n\n\n","25f838cc":"Now let's plot a pie chart to visualise gender","b552f184":"\n\n**If you find this kennel useful, please will appreciate if you can UPVOTE. \nTHANKS.\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\nA real estate company is launching a marketing campaign and wants to target its audience properly.

As a business intellegence analysit, the task I will be executing is identifying the groups of people that are most likely to buy products from the company.\n\n","30efb7cb":"Another vital variable we should see is age. we have to note that age represent the age of the buyer when  the deal was sealed. In other word, the age of clients at the time they bought their properties. \n\nIn addition, Real estate is something people rarely buy more than once in their life. So age would probably be a central variable in our analysis.
