In this example we will use hypertension. Hope it helps - please up vote if it does.\n\nAn odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome. The OR represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. Odds ratios are most commonly used in case-control studies, however they can also be used in cross-sectional and cohort study designs as well (with some modifications and\/or assumptions).[read more](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2938757\/)\n\nIn the CORD19 documents OR will often be presented in the text of the document something like this\n\nhypertension [or=2.3 [95% ci (1.76, 3.00), p<0.01]\n\nHere is an example of the hypertension OR data from the Kaggle.com contibutions page so you can see what we are looking to accomplish. [see OR example](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/covid-19-contributions#Hypertension)\n\nOk let's get started and load the required python packages.","608dfef1":"# Now we will iterate through the focused dataframe and pass the full text (or absract when no full text) to the extract ratios function.\nThe function works as follows:\n- the text and the term we want the OR for (hypertension) is passed to the function\n- using re.finditer, every starting location (integer) of the word hypertension is found in the text and returned as a list\n- then the list containing the starting location is looped through and a str from the starting location of hypertension +75 is returned\n- The the str is tested to see if it contains important characters that lead to finding OR or other important ratios.\n- if '95' in extracted or 'odds ratio' in extracted or 'p>' in extracted or '=' in extracted or 'p<' in extracted or '])' in extracted or '(rr' in extracted:\n- only the strs meeting the requirments are included and passed back.\n\nFinally a table is created with the publicaitons and the ratios\n\n*Note - one drawback, if the ratio data is not found in the text, the system ignores the document and some documents may only have the ratios in a table.*\n\n# Please use it and improve it, if it helps - upvote if you find it useful."}}
