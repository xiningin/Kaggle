features that have very similar distributions between the two types of transactions.**","c06c67c4":"**Identity theft**\n\n        Identity theft can be divided into two broad categories: application fraud and account takeover.\n**Application fraud**\n\n    Application fraud takes place when a person uses stolen or fake documents to open an account in another person's name. Criminals may steal documents such as utility bills and bank statements to build up useful personal information. Alternatively, they may create fake documents. With this information, they could open a credit card account or Ioan account in the victim's name, and then fully draw it.\n\n**Account takeover**\n\n    An account takeover occurs when criminals pose as a genuine customer, gain control of an account and then makes unauthorized transactions. According to Action Fraud,[11] fraud is committed at the point money is lost.[12] An account takeover refers to the act by which fraudsters will attempt to assume control of a customer\u2019s account from a broad array of service providers such as credit cards, email, banks, and more. Control at the account level offers better long-term returns for fraudsters but can be extremely harmful to the rightful account owners. According to Forrester, risk-based authentication (RBA) plays a key role in identity and access management (IAM) and risk mitigation of account takeover attacks that result in up to 7 billion in annual losses.\n\n\n\n**Skimming**\n\n*Skimmer 1(device)\" redirects here. For other uses, see Skimmer (disambiguation)*\n\n     Skimming is the crime of getting private information about somebody else's credit card used in an otherwise normal transaction. The thief can procure a victim's card number using basic methods such as photocopying receipts or more advanced methods such as using a small electronic device (skimmer) to swipe and store hundreds of victims' card numbers. Common scenarios for skimming are restaurants or bars where the skimmer has possession of the victim's payment card out of their immediate view.The thief may also use a small keypad to unobtrusively transcribe the three- or four-digit card security code, which is not present on the magnetic strip. Call centers are another area where skimming can easily occur.Skimming can also occur at merchants such as gas stations when a third-party card-reading device is installed either outside or inside a fuel dispenser or other card-swiping terminal. This device allows a thief to capture a customer's card information, including their PIN, with each card swipe.\n\n\n**Checker**\n\n    Checker is a term used for a process to verify the validity of stolen card data.[26] The thief presents the card information on a website that has real-time transaction processing. If the card is processed successfully, the thief knows that the card is still good. The specific item purchased is immaterial, and the thief does not need to purchase an actual product; a website subscription or charitable donation would be sufficient. The purchase is usually for a small monetary amount, both to avoid using the card's credit limit, and also to avoid attracting the card issuer's attention. A website known to be susceptible to carding is known as a cardable website.\n\n\n**BIN attack**\n\n    Credit cards are produced in BIN ranges. Where an issuer does not use random generation of the card number, it is possible for an attacker to obtain one good card number and generate valid card numbers. But the probability for such an action remains very low and because of the presence of the Valid date \/ Expire date and the CVV.[citation needed]\n\n**Phishing**\n\n    Scammers may use a variety of schemes to lure victims into giving them their card information through tricks such as websites pretending to be of a bank or payment system. Telephone phishing can also be employed, in which a call center is set up to pretend to be associated with a banking organization.\n\n**Balance transfer checks**\n\n    Some promotional offers include active balance transfer checks which may be tied directly to a credit card account. These are often sent unsolicited and may occur as often as once per month by some financial institutions. In cases where checks are stolen from a victim's mailbox, they can be used at a point of sales location thereby leaving the victim responsible for the losses. They are one path at times used by fraudsters.

Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.\n\n\n![](http:\/\/test.marutitech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Machine-Learning-fraud-detection-1.jpg)\n\n    Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card, as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction.[1] The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying, or to obtain unauthorized funds from an account. Credit card fraud is also an adjunct to identity theft. According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, while the rate of identity theft had been holding steady during the mid 2000s, it increased by 21 percent in 2008. However, credit card fraud, that crime which most people associate with ID theft, decreased as a percentage of all ID theft complaints for the sixth year in a row.\n\n    Although incidences of credit card fraud are limited to about 0.1% of all card transactions, they have resulted in huge financial losses as the fraudulent transactions have been large value transactions. In 1999, out of 12 billion transactions made annually, approximately 10 million\u2014or one out of every 1200 transactions\u2014turned out to be fraudulent.Also, 0.04% (4 out of every 10,000) of all monthly active accounts were fraudulent. Even with tremendous volume and value increase in credit card transactions since then, these proportions have stayed the same or have decreased due to sophisticated fraud detection and prevention systems. Today's fraud detection systems are designed to prevent one-twelfth of one percent of all transactions processed which still translates into billions of dollars in losses.\n\n![](https:\/\/the-military-guide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Credit-Card-Fraud.jpg)","b2a111f1":"For Improving accuracy increase value of generations and population_size \n\nAnd play with mutation_rate and crossover_rate.","c2380b41":"Now we can see violinplot of attributes V1 to V28 with Class","720d28d9":"TPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/EpistasisLab\/tpot\/master\/images\/tpot-ml-pipeline.png)\n\n\n\n\nOnce TPOT is finished searching (or you get tired of waiting), it provides you with the Python code for the best pipeline it found so you can tinker with the pipeline from there.\n\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/EpistasisLab\/tpot\/master\/images\/tpot-pipeline-example.png)\n\n\n\n\nTPOT is built on top of scikit-learn, so all of the code it generates should look familiar... if you're familiar with scikit-learn, anyway.\n\n\n\nTPOT is still under active development and we encourage you to check back on this repository regularly for updates.\n\n\n\n\nFor further information about TPOT, please see the [project documentation](http:\/\/epistasislab.github.io\/tpot\/).","071d6f27":" There is less data on Class 1\n \nClass 1 is Fraud\n\nClass 0 is Not Fraud","322f89ff":"**Reading data into Notebook**","d54a5181":"**Majority of the Fraud is taking place with less than 200. **","ec103a5b":"Now we can see many attributes have coreation b\/w others","aba0211c":"**Let's Make Prediction Model with TPOT**","16b7a03f":"**Initiation of a card fraud**\n\n    Card fraud begins either with the theft of the physical card or with the compromise of data associated with the account, including the card account number or other information that would routinely and necessarily be available to a merchant during a legitimate transaction. The compromise can occur by many common routes and can usually be conducted without tipping off the cardholder, the merchant, or the issuer at least until the account is ultimately used for fraud. A simple example is that of a store clerk copying sales receipts for later use. The rapid growth of credit card use on the Internet has made database security lapses particularly costly; in some cases, millions[6] of accounts have been compromised.\n\n    Stolen cards can be reported quickly by cardholders, but a compromised account can be hoarded by a thief for weeks or months before any fraudulent use, making it difficult to identify the source of the compromise. The cardholder may not discover fraudulent use until receiving a billing statement, which may be delivered infrequently. Cardholders can mitigate this fraud risk by checking their account frequently to ensure constant awareness in case there are any suspicious, unknown transactions or activities. \n\n**Stolen cards**\n\n    When a credit card is lost or stolen, it may be used for illegal purchases until the holder notifies the issuing bank and the bank puts a block on the account. Most banks have free 24-hour telephone numbers to encourage prompt reporting. Still, it is possible for a thief to make unauthorized purchases on a card before the card is canceled. Without other security measures, a thief could potentially purchase thousands of dollars in merchandise or services before the cardholder or the card issuer realizes that the card has been compromised.\n\n    The only common security measure on all cards is a signature panel, but, depending on its exact design, a signature may be relatively easy to forge. Some merchants will demand to see a picture ID, such as a driver's license, to verify the identity of the purchaser, and some credit cards include the holder's picture on the card itself. In some jurisdictions, it is illegal for merchants to demand cardholder identification. Self-serve payment systems (gas stations, kiosks, etc.) are common targets for stolen cards, as there is no way to verify the card holder's identity. There is also a new law that has been implemented that identification or a signature is only required for purchases abov USD 50 unless stated in the policy of the merchant.[citation needed][where?] This new law makes it easier for credit card theft to take place as well because it is not making it necessary for a form of identification to be presented, so as long as the fraud is done at what is considered to be a small amount, little to no action is taken by the merchant to prevent it.
