Let's start by looking at the sales life cycle of the first console I ever owned: the Atari 2600!","63e036a6":"Many of the best sellers are ones that you'd expect. For example the Mario games on Nintendo platforms and the Sonic games on Sega platforms. I'm surprised that Kinect Adventures was the biggest selling game on the Xbox 360 and that Minecraft was the highest selling game on the PlayStation Vita. These are not games you'd typically indentify with those platforms.  ","6a3a8191":"**By platform and year: PlayStation 3 vs Xbox 360**\n\n![external-content.duckduckgo.com.jpg](attachment:2d6cbbea-e138-4100-8a56-9ea1ecc178b1.jpg)\n\nAn era in the console wars I'm particularly interested in is when the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 fought for supremacy. At the start of this console generation PlayStation was riding high having won the last two generations. However we saw from the earlier total sales by platform analysis that the total number of games sold on the Xbox 360 ended up being greater than the number sold on PlayStation 3 (979,960,000 vs 957,840,000). One reason for this might have been that the Xbox 360 was able to gain some ground by launching before the PlayStation 3. To see if this was the case, let's examine the sales over the life cycle of both these platforms seperately. As it was first to market, let's look at game sales for the Xbox 360.  ","b0c357a4":"# Summary\n\nThe distribution of individual game sales was found to be very right skewed, with some large outliers selling 40 or even 80 million units. However the mean number of sales per game was found to be about 500,000. Median sales varied by platform and older consoles were found to have higher median sales (the NES and the Atari 2600 specifically). \n\nThis finding contradicts the other finding somewhat: that overall game sales have increased over the years. However these higher median sales during platforms of the 1980's could likely be explained by fewer games in general being released on those earlier platforms (and\/or poorly selling games not having their sales recorded at the time, for future inclusion in this dataset.) \n\nGames sales were found to be on an upward trend untill the late 00's, with sales declining after that. However it could be that games sales could still have increased since this period had the dataset included mobile games. Also it's not clear if the dataset includes digital download sales, which were the increasingly dominant channel for games sales over the last decade.\n\nPutting the game sales during the Xbox 360's and PS3's life cycles against each other, brought out that they had a very similar pattern. For the majority of the years in which both consoles were active, the PS3 sold more games. However the Xbox 360 acutally had the higher overall total sales (totallying over the entire life cycle of both platforms). This was found to be due to 3 or 4 years where that platform's sales were significantly higher than the PS3 and for the years where the PS3 was in the lead, the lead was slim. \n\nExaming the highest selling game by year of release and also examining what was the highest selling game on each platform, found a mixture of expected and suprising best sellers.\n","9fdc0474":"Again the right skewed nature of the data is shown, but this time the boxplot is actually informative. What is striking is how the four sections of the plot are uneven in size. The distance between the median and the lower quartile and the lower whisker is much smaller than the distance between the upper quartile and the upper whisker. Even above the upper whisker, the boxplot is displaying some high selling outliers, which still remain.\n\nThe median itself looks to be above 100,000 sales but decently below 200,000 sales. Let's find the exact figure with a small bit of code.","c7e733cc":"# Notebook Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate basic data analysis using Python, via the exploration of video game sales data. The dataset used is from the Udemy course \"Data Manipulation in Python: A Pandas Crash\nCourse\". https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/course\/data-manipulation-in-python\/   It's a great course which I really recommend to anyone who wants to learn how to apply Python to data analysis. As the dataset is supplied as part of the course to allow students' to practice what they have learnt, it's not 100% accurate or complete. However it's still interesting to explore and use to create some simple data explorations and visualisations. If anyone can provide or point to a more accurate dataset, please let me know!\n\n**Import data and Python libraries**\n\nLet's start with some basic exploration. The first code block sets up the Python libraries we need, imports the raw csv file and displays a peek at the first 5 rows.","a0d90902":"The Atari 2600 had a longer lifespan than almost any other console. The dataset is clearly inaccurate here as the 2600 came out in 1977. The peak year of sales was its second year (in this dataset) : 1981. What is interesting is that software sales spiked up again in 1987. What caused this? Let's look at the games in the dataset for the Atari 2600 which were released in 1987.","6bf70699":"As the boxplot indicates, the exact median sales of a video game (in this subset dataset) is 140,000. A good use of boxplots is to use them to contrast the distribution of a variable of interest (in this case game sales) across different sub-groups. Let's use boxplots this way to see how the distribution of sales varies by platform.","4fdf6885":"The graph is extremely right skewed, and this makes sense as the vast majority of the 16,000 games in the dataset have sold less than 1 million. (Recall that the mean of global video game sales was 537,441.) However due to a few high selling outliers such as Wii Sports and Super Mario Bros, selling around 80 million and 40 million respectively, the chart's x axis has to expand out to 80 million. Let's see how this skewedness is represented in a box plot","a739698b":"![PngItem_74487.png](attachment:da46f470-d49c-4764-ae80-23cb825dbdf1.png)","eea7efc4":"Interestingly the older platforms (NES and 2600) have significantly higher median sales per game. They also had relatively few games released on them compared to other platforms. The 2600 only had 133 games and the NES had only 98 (in this dataset). One possible explanation for the higher median sales is that these platforms were earlier in the history of video games. At this time, if someone was interested in trying a video game there was less options to choose from (literally less video games to buy) and therefore that lead to higher sales per game. Also, perhaps in this early period for video games, only the relatively high selling games had their sales results recorded. Perhaps poorly selling games didn't have their sales recorded at the time and so could not later be included in this dataset, which I'm presuming was put together much more recently. Also really striking is that the 25th percentile of sales for NES games is higher than the median of all the other platforms! In our dataset there might be relatively few NES games, but they were big sellers!\n\nWe can also examine the exact median figure for each platform, away from the chart","b2b30f8b":"# **Video Game Sales: Analysis & Graphs with Python**","a377ba10":"**Have sales of videogames always increased over time?**\n\nOne hunch I have is that videogame sales have generally increased year on year. This is due to gamers who started playing in the 70's and 80's continuing to buy and play games as they get older and their sales being added to by younger gamers. However have sales always increased like clockwork? \n","6252b0b1":"There was actually a very similar pattern in the sales life cycle between the two platforms. Between 2005 and 2008 more games were sold on the Xbox. In 2009 the PS3 beat the Xbox slightly but then the Xbox returned to selling more games in 2010 by quite a large margin. Then from 2011 onwards PS3 games started consistenly outselling the Xbox. \n\nThe impact of the Xbox 360 launching one year earlier than the PS3 is probably more complex to capture than I first assumed. The early start of 2005 may not have counted for much, as the sales during that year were very low compared to later years. (I do recall that the Xbox 360 launched in Nov\/Dec of 2005, so 2005 wasn't actually a full year).\n\nIf we ignore 2005, the PS3 had higher sales in 7 of the 11 years the consoles were competing against each other. How did the Xbox 360 end up having slightly higher sales overall?  Looking at the years 2006,2007,2008 and 2011, these were years were the Xbox 360 outsold the PS3 and by a significant margin. The PS3 outsold the Xbox 360 from 2011 onwards but the margin\/lead during those years was comparatively small (apart from 2013 arguably).\n\nLet's conclude our exploration for now by looking into two more questions. What was the highest selling game of the year, for each of the years we have data for? Also what was the highest selling game on each of the platforms? ","6278fb1b":"# Sales By Year","5e644137":"We can see that there are 16598 rows (representing sales data for 16598 video games). We do have some null values in Year and in Publisher. Lets use missingno to explore this missing data.","d943eb7b":"Game sales were comparatively low during the first few years of the Xbox 360's life. The peak of sales was during it's 6th year of existence (2010). Perhaps strangely, that peak followed a dip in sales during the preceding year (2009). Let's contrast this pattern to PlayStation 3.","5e013679":"Lets take the analysis deeper by grouping by both platform AND year. ","6f1949da":"If we group the data by year and order by Global Sales descending, the peak of video game sales appears to have been in the late 00's. Each of the top five years for sales were all between 2006 and 2010. Let's graph the figures in year order to see if we can see more trends.","0ae07b4e":"The describe method gives us a great overview, but we must interpret it intelligently (as always). The rank indicates the order of each game in Global Sales. (Remember Wii Sports is ranked at 1 with 82,740,000 sales.) There is not much to gain from examining the mean and standard deviation of Rank and Year. However it is interesting to know that the mean global sales for video games in the dataset is 537,441 (just over half a million). That global mean can be compared to the mean sales in the regions, for example to Japan, where the mean number of sales per game was just 309,291. The max sales across the different regions are also interesting to contrast with North America (NA) having the highest at 41,490,000. Japan is the region with the lowest, top selling video game with 10,220,000 sales.\n\nLet's explore a bit further by seeing how many games in the dataset were released on each platform.\n","b859384c":"![Atari-2600-Wood-4Sw-Set.jpg](attachment:8e749c09-11bf-4fb1-985f-4d63706dab2c.jpg)","648adecb":"Then we get the index\/postion of the highest selling game within each year of the dataset grouped in this way and then use it to strip out only the rows we want  to see ","8505edfa":"# Sales By Platform and Year","43f109e9":"Before we explore sales by year, we should remove those games from the dataset where this information is missing.

I'm also going to convert the datatype of year to integer, as it does not change the value of the data but makes it look nicer in charts (its drops the .0 from the end of the value, which does make sense for years). ","a0a481fc":"To get these figures, we first have to group the dataset by year and name (of game) and reset the index. (I'm continuing to use the subset dataset where we have complete year information)","b493837c":"# Sales By Platform\n\nLet's take this analysis of sales data by video game platform deeper. If we group everything up by platform, how many sales ocurred on each platform? I'm going back to the full dataset because we only have to group up by the 31 platforms in the dataset. Thereby we avoid some of the challenges that outliers pose for graphing, when looking at individual game sales.","35ab76e3":"The DS and the PS2 are well in the lead on the total number of games released on them, with both having over 2000.\nIn the dataset, only 1 game was released for the Game Gear and PCFX. The TurboGrafix 16 and 3DO had only 2 and 3 games respectively and the Sega CD only had 6 games. While it's true that these platforms did not have a lot of games released for them, this again indicates that the dataset is far from complete\/fully accurate. I believe all these platforms did have more games released for them, than recorded in this dataset. Still fun to explore of course!\n\nI didn't recognise which platform is represented by 'WS'. After some exploration it turns out this is the WonderSwan, a GameBoy alike which I had never heard of!\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/WonderSwan\n\nFollowing on from these headline stats, lets look at a graph of the global sales by individual game.","ab6ef1a6":"The NES has by far highest median sales. Double any other platform, except for the Atari 2600! Again the Wonder Swan (WS) stands out to me. It only has 6 games in this dataset, but they are recorded as selling well.","ec108ef1":"I hadn't heard of Kung Fu Master but apparently it was an arcade hit that was ported to many home consoles. As the Atari 2600 was very old by that point the port was considered a great technical feat. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kung-Fu_Master_(video_game)#Ports_2 . Initially, my guess was that Commando was a movie tie in game, based on the Schwarzenegger film out around that time, but apparently that is not the case. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Commando_%28video_game%29. Now let's look at a more recent era in video games.","4277b155":"The chart makes it clear that the PS2 is in a class of its own, way out ahead in terms of sales. Then there is the second tier of platforms including the Xbox 360 to the first PlayStation, which have between 1000 million and 600 million sales. Then beyond the PlayStation 1 there is a big drop down to less than 400 million sales for the GBA.\n\nNow let's look at the data by another variable, year of release.","50cd28b6":"Even with the unusually high selling games excluded, we can see that sales are still very right skewed. Let's keep on exploring by repeating the box plot but on the trimmed data.","8844ee5f":"Publisher is missing for 58 rows but this is information I'm not interested in exploring. Year is missing for 271 rows and this is unfortunate as it may affect time series analysis. (Although 271 out of 16598 is a relatively small amount of missing data.)  There are also rows where both Year and Publisher are missing, which might be worth examining. For analysis focussed on yearly trends, creating a subset of the data only containing rows where the Year information is not missing might be a good approach. \n\nAt this point let's get a general sense of the entire dataset and explore the headline figures of means, standard deviations, minimum and maximum values.","043943e6":"From the chart it's easy to see that video games sales haven't always increased. (Before fully exploring this, one aspect of the dataset that the chart highlights is that there are very low sales for the years 2016  and onward. Sales were really low in 2017 and 2020, so low that you cannot see them on the chart. Also, the years 2018 and 2019 don't even exist in the dataset. This dataset can't be accurate for those years, so I'm going to keep my commentary to the years 1980 to 2015. \n\nSales do appear to have quasi cyclical pattern, where sales would peak in a particular year (1981,1985,1989,1992,1998 and 2002) then drop and recover in subsequent years. Also of note is that sales didn't break 100 million a year until 1996. From then on, they have gone up and down but never dipped below 100 million.  \n\nThe peak year for sales is 2008, so that would disprove my hunch that video game sales always increased. Recalling the platform list, mobile phone games are not included. Is it possible that the sales that would have gone to console game sales are going towards games on IPhone and Android in more recent years? At the same time, the dataset does appear to be more incorrect and incomplete for more recent years. An aspect of the dataset I'm unsure about is, does it include digital sales (meaning not physical,boxed copies)? The drop in sales from 2008 would be in line with then digital download sales of games would have really been taking off. I wonder if we had a dataset that included mobile phone games and digital download sales, would there been another peak year since 2008, that would even top the sales that year? ","335bd3ad":"# What was the highest selling game released on each platform?","ede1f1b2":"The PS2 is the platform with the highest software sales with 12,555,640,000 sales! Which is 1255 million units! This might lead you to question the dataset, or my analysis of it, but the figure does seem to actually be an underestimate, triangulating from other sources https:\/\/vgsales.fandom.com\/wiki\/PlayStation_2. What I find surprising is that the PSP comes in 8th in terms of total software sales. The video game press reported on the PSP as if it was a failure for Sony, with many sales lost through to piracy. Actually, there were more software sales on the PSP than on the SNES, NES, Game Boy and original Xbox. Even more than the 3DS which was a handheld released after the PSP!\n\nLet's graph these figures to bring them to life.\n","9bdb5f3d":"As you'd expect the top sellers are familiar titles. It's interesting to see that Duck Hunt was such a big seller back in 1984. I'm not surprised to see the Call of Duty games topping sales in the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015. As mentioned before we don't have data for the years 2018 and 2019. Also the sales for 2016, 2017 and 2020 are so low that they can't be complete. Perhaps the last reasonably accurate and complete year in the dataset is 2016.\n\nLets use the same technique as above to find the highest selling game on each platform.","6f893106":"Again the skewness means the visualisation isn't really informative. The 25% percentile, mean and 75% percentile are all bunched up on each other. You can see the outliers of Wii Sports and Super Mario Bros are visible at the 80 and 40 million marks. Let's remove these high selling outliers and see what difference it makes. As the mean number of sales is about 500,000, lets filter the dataset so that only games which sold fewer than 1 million are included, and see what the graphs look like then.","48e301bb":"This dataset is structured so that each row provides information about an individual video game, what platform (video game system i.e. PlayStation 4) it was released on, which year it was released in, its genre and publisher and its sales in North America, EU, Japan, other regions and it's total global sales. \n\nThe dataset is ranked in order of global sales with the highest selling game ranked as number 1. The sales units are in the millions, so Wii Sports is the single highest selling video game with 82,740,000 units sold! Wii Sports came packed in with the Wii console itself, so everyone who bought a new Wii got this game anyway. One viewpoint would be that therefore Wii Sports isn't really the highest selling videogame, as consumers had no choice but to buy it when buying the Wii console. In that case Super Mario Bros, with 42,240,000 sales would be considered the highest selling videogame.\n\n**Dataset overview including missing values**\n\nBefore commencing analysing and summarising, let's get a sense of the size of the dataset and the extent of any missing values.","aa2c8fab":"The PlayStation 3 launched in 2006, a year later than the Xbox 360. In an interesting coincidence, it's 6th year was also the peak of it's software sales (2011). Also both platforms had years where sales dipped and then recovered the following year: 2009 to 2010 for Xbox, 2011 to 2012 for PS3. Also that subsequent year was the peak of sales for both platforms! Surprising that sales on both platforms followed this pattern. Why would sales peak in a console's sixth year? My guess would be that the sixth year in a console's life cycle might be around the period when the price of the console itself has reduced. Concordantly, there are likely games being released at that time which strongly take advantage of the platform's hardware, as programmers have had a good amount of time to get used to developing for it.\n\nNow lets put the sales by year data for both platforms head to head against each other in a chart to really compare and contrast them."}}
