This helps reflect external conditions and demonstrates how well cities are prepared for and can adjust to external impacts compared to others.\n* **Geographic scope:** While this methodology can be applied to cities worldwide, the numerical analysis of KPI calculation is carried out only for the US in line with the company data provided by CDP for the purposes of this competition. The ambition comparison however is provided for cities globally subject to the availability of relevant data in their responses.\n","597c1491":"### Companies\n\nComapnies which are eligible to score points in the socially adjusted collaborative engagement are listed below. \n\nNote: \"Activites\" and \"sectors\" are taken from CDp company resitration forms.\n\n ![image.png](attachment:image.png)","be5335af":"# Climate change ambition, social co-benefits and collaboration\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nTo maximise potential synergies between the climate change and social programmes and ensure that climate change mitigation is happening in a socially responsible and inclusive way, it is important to understand where these synergies can arise and whether cities are actively considering the environmental\/social overlap in their actions. We consider four key areas of social co-benefits which include **improvement of public health, increased employment levels, reduced congestion and enhanced social inclusion**.\n\n**Therefore, through our KPIs we propose a way to assess how climate change ambition in cities may be linked to the social performance and an extent to which social considerations are incorporated in the cities\u2019 climate change actions and collaborative initiatives.** This is done through three KPIs which are as follows:\n\n* **A)\tAmbition:** Climate change ambition is assessed by comparing mitigation targets set by cities with the global ambition of reaching net zero by mid-century. Given the difficulty of comparing city-level targets amongst differences in scope, base year and composition of emission sources, we develop a simplified measure of ambition based on the city\u2019s target emissions pathway to 2050, relative to today\u2019s emissions.\n* **B)\tSocial co-benefits:** Cities\u2019 performance in relation to this indicator is assessed in two steps based on (B1) their performance in the four key areas of social co-benefits (health, employment, congestion and inclusion) evaluated through external publicly available datasets and (B2) the extent to which relevant social considerations are taken into account in the climate change actions underpinning the city ambition. Step B2 is designed to recognise that in most cases a city\u2019s performance in the considered social areas will be a result of multiple factors unrelated to climate change actions or city policies in general and inresponse to that give greater value to cities\u2019 actions.\n* **C)\tCollaboration:**  Collaboration is assessed in two steps whereby we (C1) first look at the overall collaboration level of the city administration and willingness of local companies to collaborate and then (C2) assess collaboration specifically in those areas which are likely to generate social co-benefits. Adding step C2 effectively increases the weighting of socially important collaboration in the overall collaboration scoring.\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nThe value of these KPIs is that they allow to quickly understand where cities stand in terms of their climate change ambition and actions\/collaborations delivering social co-benefits and compare cities\u2019 performance in these areas. Moreover, city-specific analysis in each key co-benefit area **(health, employment, congestion and inclusion)** can be derived.\n\nThe assessment was undertaken combining responses from cities and companies provided to CDP with external data sourced from public databases. We applied an NLP algorithm based on the Google BERT model to classify free text answers.","0ab119b7":"## Examples of methodology application to selected cities\n\n\nExamples of assessment for three selected US cities are presented below together with some quick insights which can be derived form the obtained KPIs.\n\nPlease note that the analysis also takes into consideration the economic performance of each city (as measured by GDP per capita), given that city wealth is an important factor of assessing cities\u2019 performance. (Unfortunately the image of the table including GDP will not upload!).\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n","959f6e78":"# Appendix 1\n\n# Ambition KPI calculation\n\n## Justification of the approach\n\nOverall, the comparison of city targets (as well as national or corporate targets) is significantly complicated by the fact that cities use different base years, target years and have varying scope of emissions which are covered by their targets. Globally, there are no widely applied approaches which would allow to compare target ambition in a way which would not penalise either early movers, or late comers to the climate change action arena. The approach developed by the [Climate Action Tracker](http:\/\/climateactiontracker.org\/) may be one of the more comprehensive approaches which compares countries\u2019 ambition by extrapolating their ambition level globally and assessing what global warming scenario it would lead to (e.g. +1.5C, +2C, etc.). This approach, however, requires an extensive volume of data about the performance of all countries for the extrapolation to be robust. Given the data limitations, we base our assessment of ambition on the assumption from the [IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C](http:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/2018\/10\/08\/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments\/) that in order to limit global warming to 1.5C the global community has to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We assume that all cities should align their ambition to this target as it is a trajectory to zero that ultimately matters and compare their actual ambition to this benchmark.\n\n\nWhile it is recognised that cities\u2019 conditions vary significantly, which complicates the task of comparing their ambition level and emission reduction performance, the proposed methodology takes the city-specific considerations into account by adjusting the assessment results per capita (using both the current population figure as well as the population estimates in the future). These allows the methodology accommodate the topic of growing population in many cities, particularly in the developing countries. Further, the emissions reductions are inherently relative to each city\u2019s own current performance, minimising any bias against cities relying on industries with higher emissions. Moreover, the assessment is adjusted by the level of the city wealth (as measured by the GDP per capita). \n\n\nThis approach takes into consideration not only the 2050 city target but also the pace at which decarbonisation is expected to be achieved by including any announced intermediary targets between today and 2050.  This is due to the fact GHGs emitted in the atmosphere accumulate having greater impact on the global climate change and therefore the sooner decarbonisation is achieved, the lower the cumulative impact of a city is. This is consistent with the approach of \u201ccarbon budgets\u201d which refers to the overall allowable amount of additional emissions ([IPCC, 2019](http:\/\/www.carbonbrief.org\/analysis-how-much-carbon-budget-is-left-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c)). This is particularly important as some cities (and countries) may be delaying their climate change actions expecting the development of more efficient and cheaper low carbon technologies while their cumulative emissions and impact continue to grow.\n\nFor this reason, our approach assesses the ambition of the climate change trajectory of each city thereby considering cumulative targeted future emissions. This approach therefore benefits cities who aim to achieve their decarbonisation sooner over those who envision steeper reductions further in the future. \n\n## Justification of used data\n\nIdeally, we would like to be able to check ambition relative to a city's current emission performance, and hence evaluate its current progress towards its target(s). However, responses to the question Q5.0a 'Percentage of target achieved so far' appear to have quality issues: a significant proportion of cities do not submit an entry for this field and a visual check of some of those who do suggest it is not completed consistently (for example, using the same percentage against different targets; in this case it is not clear which base level of emissions this is relative to as they are likely to be errors in the entered data). Instead, we could attempt to make use of data given in Q4.6: 70% of cities report current-year emissions inventories. However, the basis on which the targets and emissions inventories sit is particularly complex (see sub-questions within Q4.6 and variability in inventory data collection methodologies) and would need to be comparable for us to plot; this was considered too in-depth given the available time.\n\n\nAs such, we simplify the plot to be relative to the targeted emissions in the current year (2020). Where no such base or target exists in this year, we take the linear interpolation between the most recent base year emissions and next target year emissions. This assumes that the city has been decarbonising in line with its latest target up to 2020, falsely benefitting cities who are behind their target (assuming a linear trajectory) and hiding over-achievement of cities who are ahead of their target. However, the impact of this limitation on the overall KPI is considered to be minor compared to the impact of future targets. It is however recognised that using actual current emissions should be considered as a potential methodology enhancement step in the future.\n\n","e11af929":"# KPI B: Social co-benefits\n\n## Approach\n\n**This step will assess cities\u2019 performance in the four key areas where social co-benefits of climate actions which are typically identified ([Gouldson et al, 2018](http:\/\/newclimateeconomy.report\/workingpapers\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2018\/06\/CUT2018_CCCEP_final.pdf)). These four areas are: improvement of public health, increased employment levels, reduced congestion and enhanced social inclusion. It will be delivered in two steps to consider (B1) cities\u2019 current performance in indicators related to these areas utilising external datasets and (B2) whether cities are taking into account these areas when designing their climate change and sustainability agenda. These two assessment steps will have equal weighting recognising the importance of taking actions in these areas at the same level as the performance itself.**\n\n## Selected social areas\n\nWhile many cities are implementing actions to reduce their emissions, the co-benefits of these actions, particularly in the social area, are becoming increasingly important as the negative impacts of climate change tend to disproportionately affect socially vulnerable groups. The review of literature related to the social co-benefits of climate change actions in cities suggests that the four main areas in which co-benefits can be expected are related to the improvement of public health, increased employment levels, reduced congestion and enhanced social inclusion ([Gouldson et al, 2018](http:\/\/newclimateeconomy.report\/workingpapers\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2018\/06\/CUT2018_CCCEP_final.pdf)). These four areas will constitute the bases of the assessment of social action co-benefits and will also be used in KPI C to analyse cities\u2019 collaborative efforts. \n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n\n## Justification of the approach\n\nIt is recognised that cities\u2019 performance in the four selected areas of co-benefits will be a result of multiple factors, and hence the indirect effect of climate change actions may appear to be minor. In particular, the performance in these areas will be majorly impacted by the relevant sector-specific policies, both on the city and national level. Moreover, they will be affected by other factors external to a city which may include the impact of economic cycles or other significant drivers (e.g. the current COVID-19 pandemic). Therefore, the approach suggested for assessing cities\u2019 performance is two-fold, whereby we\n* (Step B1) first consider the cities\u2019 performance in the respective areas using the most suitable indicators based on the external data and then\n* (Step B2) cross-check whether a city has climate change or sustainability actions specifically taking into account these areas as included in the city\u2019s CDP response.\n\nThese two assessment steps will have equal weighting recognising the importance of taking actions in these areas at the same level as the performance itself. \n\n\n\n\n","2ebe04db":"## Co-benefit analysis\n\nIn addition, analysis per area of social co-benefits can be derived.

The assessment is based on comparing cities\u2019 ambition trajectories assuming that all cities will need to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 in line with the 1.5C IPCC scenario. The assessment is based on the targeted GHG emissions per capita. Economic performance measured through cities' GDP per capita is also taken into consideration to recognise the difference in cities\u2019 economic conditions.**\n\n**Why look at ambition?**\n\nAssessing city mitigation ambition allows to set the scene for comparing climate change and social agenda in cities. It is recognised that assessing mitigation ambition without considering actual emission reduction performance and actions in both the adaptation and mitigation areas does not reflect the full picture. However, given that CDP are already scoring cities\u2019 responses to assess their performance in these areas and recognising the extent of information required to assess it, we focused on the ambition part as the main climate change-related indicator. This is also aligned with the problem statement of this project which asked to assess how climate ambition is taking into consideration social aspects. We however recognise that further expansion of this approach to include climate change performance is recommended and can to a great extent be based on the existing CDP scoring methodology.\n\n## Justification of the approach\n\n*For full version of the approach justification and data used please see Appendix 1*\n\nThe comparison of city targets is significantly complicated by the fact that cities use different base years, target years and have varying scope of emissions which are covered by their targets. Given thar there is no widely applied way to compare targets, we base our assessment of ambition on the assumption from the [IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C](http:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/2018\/10\/08\/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments\/) that in order to limit global warming to 1.5C the global community has to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We assume that all cities should align their ambition to this target as it is a trajectory to zero that ultimately matters and compare their actual ambition to this benchmark. Moreover, we look not only at 2050 target but also at all intermediary targets plotting an assumed targeted emission reduction trajectory between now and 2050 thereby assessing targeted cumulative emissions. This approach therefore benefits cities who aim to achieve their decarbonisation sooner over those who envision steeper reductions further in the future. The trajectory plotting is adjusted by population and is ultimately assessed by incorporating the CDP per capita to reflect differences in cities\u2019 economic situations.\n\n## Ambition calculation methodology\n\nTo calculate the ambition KPI, we plot the targeted emission reduction trajectory between 2020 and 2050. The plot presents three key pieces of information for each city:\n* the city's emissions\n* the city's level of ambition\n* a profile of the city's targets\n\nThe first two give an idea of the scale of the current emissions and the drive to quell it, respectively. This helps us to understand the cities or regions of most concern, and where further work (education, finance, collaboration) is needed to encourage targets in line with the 1.5C scenario pathway. \nTo reduce complexity in the limited time available we make some key exclusions, eventually covering 206 of the 566 worldwide cities (36%) and 81 of the 144 US cities (58%) with our metric. Our analysis is restricted to cities which do not fall into the exclusions listed below:\n* The city reports emissions targets (Q5.0a) covering all emission sources. (226\/566)\n* The boundary of the target is equal to or greater than the city boundary. (218\/566)\n\nOnce exclusions are handled, we take the targets as pairs of base year and target year and use the following process:\n1. Treating base- and target-year emissions equivalently (we refer to them collectively as \u2018data points\u2019), discard the greater emissions value wherever multiple values are found in the same future year (not pictured) - *See Note 1 below*. \n2. (Upper-left)Plot all reported target and base year emissions.\n3. (Upper-right) Connect each data point with its nearest neighbours with respect to time.\n4. (Lower-left) Trim the years of consideration to 2020-2050, linearly interpolating between the nearest data points which span the boundaries to obtain values for 2020 and 2050. In this way, for 2020, we estimate expected current performance *(see Note 2 below)*. Where target values do not extend to 2050, we assume a constant emissions profile. This measure penalises cities which did not develop long term emission reduction objectives.\n5. (Lower-right) Normalise the axes to fit on a unit square. Take the area under the curve to represent the target cumulative emissions, relative to today, to 2050. The ambition metric is then calculated using the complement to this value (1 - area_under_curve).\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n*Notes:*\n* *1. This is because, unless there are administrative errors, the greater value should always be a target- rather than a base- emissions value (emissions for base or current years should be known with certainty), if we assume that more recently specified targets would only act to increase ambition (increasing a target to match performance defeats the purpose of a target).*\n* *2. We deem the current emissions data to have quality issues or require excessive manipulation to be prepared during the competition, and hence take an interpolated value between targets as a proxy for current performance.*\n\n## Visualisation\nThe results of this assessment are then shown on the map and provide an easy visual understanding of the cities current emissions and the ambition of their targets. The numerical values of KPI A are then jointly considered with KPIs B and C so understand to what extent social action is incorporated in the cities plans to reach its targets. Note that we have computed these values, where possible, for cities worldwide.","eceda48b":"### Companies\n\nWe undertake the same form of assessment as in Step C1, however we only do it for companies in selected sectors.

This higher-level indicator was chosen since more targeted health indicators, such as specific disease rates, may be hard to trace back to the lack of climate change actions. For example, research suggests that the most common diseases caused by poor air quality include stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and chronic respiratory diseases ([WHO, n.d.](http:\/\/www.who.int\/teams\/environment-climate-change-and-health\/air-quality-and-health\/ambient-air-pollution)). Poor air quality in cities is principally a result of fossil fuel burning from industry and inefficient transport networks and their decarbonisation will lead to reduction of air pollutants. At the same time, however, these diseases can be caused by a variety of other factors not related to air quality and have many confounding variables. Therefore, only a higher level indicator of life expectancy at birth was selected to assess city\u2019s performance in the health area. It will have a weighting of 50% of the total health performance.\n* Additionally, the assessment includes CDP response data pertaining to the **overall quality of life** in the city and other factors directly or indirectly improving public health. The following factors are weighted equally at 12.5%:\n\n    * **Air quality in cities**: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3 and SO2 pollutant level for the most recent year available. (Q10.14)\n    * **Green areas**: Area of parks per capita (Q11)\n    * **Access to potable water**: Share of total population having access to potable water. (Q14.1)\n    * **Food security**: Share of people having food security. Complement of (Q12.6) \n\n### Employment\n\nEmployment IS assessed through the **employment status of the city population** (over 16 y.o).  Additionally, we will look at the number of green jobs reported by the city in the CDP questionnaire (Q6.15) adjusted by population in each city. Given the difficulty of calculating green jobs, its weighting will only be 10%, yet it will still be included as it is desirable for cities to estimate it. \n\n### Congestion\n\nWe use **average commute time** as a proxy for congestion in each city, based on external data. We supplement this with the **share of public transport use (Q10.1)**. Given that the use of public transport will very often depend on the geography of the city and will be more relevant for more densely populated cities, yet it is a desirable environmental objective, we will assign a weighting of 25% to this factor, while the congestion time will account for 75% of the score in this category.\n\n### Inclusion\nIn order to understand to what extent cities are inclusive both in economic and racial terms, we will use the economic and racial inclusion indices as developed by the [Urban Institute](http:\/\/apps.urban.org\/features\/inclusion\/?topic=map). These indices rely on the US census data and are derived as follows:\n* **The racial inclusion index** is made up of five measures: racial segregation (white\/person of colour dissimilarity index), homeownership gap, educational attainment gap, poverty rate gap, and share of people of colour.\n* **The economic inclusion index** is made up of four measures: income segregation (rank-order information theory index), rent burden, share of 16- to 19-year-olds who are not in school and have not graduated, and working poor.8\nThese two indices will have an equal weighting in the assessment of the inclusion performance.\n\n## KPI B2\n\nAssessment of KPI B2 relied on the responses which cities provided in their CDP responses, It used scoring of the drop down menu answers as well as questions where NLP analysis was applied.\n\n### Health \n* Q2.0b.

Inclusion of social factors into city climate change actions\n\nFollowing the assessment of the cities\u2019 performance in four co-benefit areas, we then assess whether there are actions in the cities\u2019 CDP responses which are directly or indirectly targeting these four areas. As mentioned earlier, while the performance of a city in relation to a given indicator is likely to depend on a great variety of factors, the targeted actions may appear to be even more important in reflecting the effort which a city is putting in improving its performance as well as how well a city has investigated the links between its climate change agenda and other social factors. The assessment of relevant actions is undertaken based on cities CDP responses listed in Appendix 2.\n\n## Assessment approach\n\nEach answer will gain either one or zero and the average value of all answers in each category will be taken as a final score in that category.  If a question is not answered, it will score zero. These questions were selected in line with the indicators chosen to calculate city performance in step B1.\n\n\n### NLP Approach\n\nWe trained an NLP algorithm on the manual scoring of approximately 500 reponses to targeted questions. The model chosen was a pre-trained BERT classifier which we added two linear layers to in order to function as a multilayer classifier. The algorithm is more thoroughly documented within the code (CDP:ABC-NLP). The scoring was done in line with the four co-benefit areas considered in the analysis. Some of the scoring principles are listed below by indicating which actions were likely to score points:\n\n* Health\n    * Actions tareting improvement of healthcare services, providing medical advice to the population, improvement of air quality in cities, creation of city parks and other action targeting reduction of the heat island effect, actions reducing health impacts of heat waves, increased use of bicycles, etc.\n    * At the same time, health of soil, trees etc received no points\n\n* Employment\n    * Actions targeting development of new skills and profesional training related to climate mitigation adaptation\/projects, etc.\n    * Where a city described a project but not mention new jobs\/skills, points were not awarded\n\n* Congestion\n    * Actions targeting increase of the piblic starnsport use, walking and cycling promotion, etc.\n    * Use of EVs was not scored to reducing congestion, however it got points in the health category for improvmeent of city air quality\n\n* Inclusion\n    * All actions specifically targeting the needs of vulnerable groups (low income, indigenous people, elderly, etc) etc.\n\n\n\nSimilar to step B1, the best performing city in each area of co-benefits will score one and the performance of all other cities adjusted accordingly. The average of the four will be then used as B2 score.\n","e8da580d":"# C1. Climate change collaborative action\n\nIn this step we first look to identify cities which report collaboration with companies and then look at companies which report various forms of engagement including those with policy makers. These two areas will have equal weighting and will be assessed as follows:\n\n### Cities: \n* We first review cities\u2019 responses to identify those which reported collaboration with businesses in Q6.2. The CDP questionnaire provides a variety of options to answer this question. Given that estimated emission reductions from each form of collaboration are not reported, we take the **variety of the collaboration forms as a measure of the cities\u2019 collaborative effort**. The scoring will be done as follows:\n    * *Q6.2. Does your city collaborate in partnership with businesses in your city on sustainability projects?*\n        * Each from of reported collaboration scores one point\n\n### Companies:\n* We then review companies\u2019 responses to identify those which reported engagement in C12.3. There are four possible forms of engagement which each scoring one point. The average performance across all companies reporting in a given city will be calculated. All companies will be linked to respective cities through their HQs and the average score across the city will be calculated. The limitation of this approach is recognised as many companies will have extensive operations outside of the city of their HQ, however, we assume that if a company is engaged with policymakers\/stakeholders across its operations it is likely to be open to engagement with the city of its HQ city. The scoring will be done as follows:\n    * *C12.3. Do you engage in activities that could either directly or indirectly influence public policy on climate-related issues through any of the following?*\n        * Each from of reported engagement scores one point\n* Similarly, to the previous KPIs, these scores will be normalized where the highest score will be classed as 1. The average of the city and the corporate scores will comprise the overall C1 score (50:50 weighting as it is assumed that both the city and companies have to collaborate for the collaborative action to be successful).\n","f28ef7d1":"## B1. Review city\u2019s performance in relation to the four key co-benefit areas\n\nTo assess a city\u2019s performance in each co-benefit area, we use the following set of indicators:\n\n### Health\n* Life expectancy at birth (External data: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health)\n* Quality fo life:\n    * Air quality in cities: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3 and SO2 pollutant level for the most recent year available. (Q10.14)\n    * Green areas: Area of parks per capita (Q11)\n    * Access to potable water: Share of total population having access to potable water. (Q14.1)\n    * Food security: Share of people having food security. Complement of (Q12.6) \n\n### Employment\n* Employment status (External data: US Census\/ American Community Survey)\n* Number of green jobs per capita (Q6.15)\n\n### Congestion\n* Average commute time (External data:  US Census\/ American Community Survey)\n* Share of public transport use (Q10.1)\n\n### Inclusion\n* Economic inclusion index (External data: Urban Intitute)\n* Racial inclusion index (External data: Urban Intitute)\n\n\nThese indicators include data sources from external sources as well as the data provided in by cities in their CDP responses. For each indicator within co-benefit areas a weighting factor was selected to reflect importance of that indicator for the overall co-benefit performance assessment.\n\nThe weighting of each indicator is demonstrated below and the rationale for their selection is explained in detail in Appendix 2.\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n"}}
