The goal of the club was to discuss literary works created by African authors in the 20th and 21st centuries. \n\nThe [MMAL book-club](https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Munich-Meets-African-Literature\/) has gone on to experience much success with up to 188 registered members participating in monthly meetings of books voted for and selected by members of the group. The group is public and anyone is free to join. \n\nThis notebook provides an exploratory data analysis based on the current list of books which have been selected for discussion. \n\n![Munich Meets African Literature](https:\/\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/4\/6\/e\/highres_468474382.jpeg)","982ed3b1":"## COUNTRIES\n\n#### The main selection criteria for a book is the nationality of the author. Care is taken to ensure that the books selected are from as many countries within the continent as possible. This has not prevented a slight over-representation of a few countries.

Chinua Achebe's classic 'Things Fall Apart' was rejected by several publishing houses prior to its publication by Heinemann due to the perceived lack of interest in African stories at the time. Heinemann's risky decision to represent Achebe led to the dissemination of one of the most impactful pieces of literature within the African and, dare I say, global canon. "}}
