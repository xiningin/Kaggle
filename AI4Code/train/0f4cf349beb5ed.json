[bbc](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/article\/20190313-why-more-men-kill-themselves-than-women)\n* [wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gender_differences_in_suicide)\n\nSummary:\nWomen also are even more likely than men to attempt suicide but male suicide methods are often more violent, making them more likely to be completed before anyone can intervene.
