The post author asked for the same in python. Therefore, I am recreating this notebook in python. I have been coding in R throughout the majority of my career, nevertheless, I wanted to show that it can be recreated using python as well. The end values from my notebook in R are slightly different from what I have here due to other feature engineering conducted in the previous notebook that will not be present here. The concepts are all be the same.\n\nLet's get started and tackle the original question","589a3919":"# Model\n\nNow that we have our average salary, lets create a linear regression and calculate the correlation coefficient for `average_salary` explained by `rating`","4a3ab9bd":"As we can see from the correlation coefficient above, the value is basically zero. Despite this, it is still a good idea to take a look at the statistical outputs from our model. Getting into the habit of looking at the regression output is important for grasping the statistics behind our models. ","9e0ad8fc":"# Quick plot \n\nA quick scatter plot of our data appears to show there is no significant linear correlation. But let's proceed! ","6963ef7d":"# Feature Engineering\n\nBecause the `salary_estimate` series only provides a range, we must feature engineer the average salary from the range. We will take advantage of *regular expressions* to extract the numbers we need. ","bee8c1fd":"# The Original Question \n\nThere was a [task](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/andrewmvd\/data-analyst-jobs\/tasks?taskId=1586) that asked if there was a correlation between *salary* and *rating*. \n\n# The Short Answer - And a New Question\n\nYou can always calcualte the correlation coefficient for two variables; **the better question is: Is the correlation between *salary* and *rating* statistically significant?** If you are not sure what statistical significance is, I encourage you to read about it! Understanding the statistics behind models will make you a better data scientist. \n\n\n**Before we can answer the question, we must do some data preprocessing and think about the dataset. I would caution that the results of this analysis can only be specified to this dataset, which is not representative about jobs or salaries as a whole, and more importantly stress that CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION!!!**\n\n**So please interpret the results with caution.**\n\nNevertheless, lets do some data preprocessing:"}}
