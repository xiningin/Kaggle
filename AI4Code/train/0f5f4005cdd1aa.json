You can compare unique categorical features by using the code \"*dataframe[feature].unique*\"","648483e8":"## THE END!","51487afe":"We have a new problem... It appears merging the dataset reduced our training observations to 867,447 from 11,341,042. That's a huge drop. Can we blame ourselves? If you find a better way to do this, kindly share. As it stands, there are more observations in the test dataset than the train. However, it's not the end of the world. It only shows how particularly challenging this dataset is. Next, we explore the dataset using seaborn visualizations.","02aea03a":"I'll leave the intepretation to you. You can try additional features to see what comes out of it. Next, lets prepare our datasets for Machine Learning predictions. Since the target variable has three classes (0-3), we use models that are a good fit for classification problems.","6af28539":"New challenge! Columns in test frame do not match train. This will create more problems for us. However, we soldier on! Lets drop all columns in the test frame that are not in the train frame.","9e56b134":"Perfect! The above is what we expect. Remember train has additional features such as \"*accuracy, accuracy_group, num_correct, num_incorrect*\". Remeber, this is not the best way to go about this. However, my target is simplicity. Next step, lets convert the timestamp column into period of day and day of the week. This will help us get some more interpretation from our imperfect data.","56f18565":"Think about the above results for a minute. Do you notice any challenge from the results? Remember, the goal for this project is to predict the \"accuracy_group\". So the obvious task is to merge the \"train\" and \"train_labels\" datasets to match the target variable with the explanatory variables. However, the labels dataset has only 17690 observations, which is way less than the 11,341,042 in the train dataset.\n\nTo work around this challenge, lets attempt to merge the two datasets based on the common identifying features in both; installation_id or game_session. But first, we will look at the headers from both datasets to see if they give us any aditional information on these two features.","7bb9a4ac":"From the two dataframes, we notice that game_session and installation_id can be repeated (not unique). However, we can still merge them using game sessions. We can infer that game sessions in the labels dataset has multiple counts in the train dataset, hence, the difference in observations. We can look at the unique values to see if they are close.","bf2bb8e0":"The above confirms that game_sessions are not repeated in the label set. Next, lets merge the datasets to see how it goes.","0f985c41":"We are almost ready now. Next, lets drop columns that will not be useful for our simple model. Remember this is a panel data and so more work may be required to arrive at acceptable results. However, I'm curious to see what accuracies our efforts will reslut in.","86f9bf66":"Next, lets compare to see if we have the same number of columns. We need to do this everytime we modify the dataframes","82c2d240":"Thank you for your time! I hope this wasn't too boring. All the best with the competition!","0eb00eb3":"The cell below displays the breakdown of accuracy groups by the game title.

Now with our new features, lets see if there are any interesting correlations using a heatmap","e9ee712f":"Awesome! Appending worked. now we need to export our submission using the instalation_id and accuracy_group columns.","efb40aed":"From the above, we can conclude that both train and test have the same headers. This is a good start. Next, lets check to see the number of observations contained in each dataset. This is important because it will help to understand the split for train and test later when we implement our selected ML models","a38efcc5":"In this notebook, I try as much as possible to share the intuition that goes into every cell. I'm not an expert at this but I hope others can build on my mistakes and also arrive at better my results. I have looked at other notebooks and realized that the accuracies are pretty low. My goal here is to use a different approach to improve results. I do not use any fancy Machine Learning (ML) models here. I use a KNN and a Decision Tree model. I also avoid aggregating the data based on time and panel. This complicates things. Again, the gola here is to see what will happen if I reduce the complexities in the data.","db2b18dc":"Start modelling already!!","73e04bfb":"The above are two examples of classification models. Since the decision tree model provides the best accuracy, I stick to that. Remember in Machine Learning, accuracies are not really significant in determining how good your model is. There are several ways to test for this. For example, there could be overfitting.\n\nNext, we need to append the classification from the decision tree, to our initial test dataset (ie. dsb_test)","4e322a44":"Time for the verdict. Now, we explore the new dataset and hope it makes sense :)"}}
