We can draw the inference that Continental and Cafe have more rating than the Indian, North Indian and Chinese counterparts. Hence, it might be apparent, that though Indian, and CHinese foods are more famous than continental or cafe restaurants, the quality of food served by them exceeds the indian and Chinese restaurants.\n\n*Conclusion 2:* **Bangalore has really good restaurants serving continental food and coffee**","47b80a01":"The above graphs clearly shows that North Indian and Chinese restaurants dominate the market, whereas, South Indian, Fast Foods and Biryani etc are lagging behind. Also, the number of votes by the customer is an indication of the number of footfalls in the restaurant. Going by the Vote count, we can see that the number of restaurants serving a cuisine is somewhat proportional to the number of footfalls recieved by the restaurant, for most cuisines, which is expected. However, from the plots, it is apparent that the footfall of the continental restaurants are more than chinese restaurants, even though they are less in number. The same arguments goes for cafes.\nHence, the following conclusion can be drawn. \n\n*Conclusion 1:* **Bangalore loves continental foods. Bangalore has a prevalent cafe culture**"}}
