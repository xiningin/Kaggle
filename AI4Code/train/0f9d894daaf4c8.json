Today I'll like to explain the popular California Housing Price Prediction that is easy to understand for 100% beginners.  (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/camnugent\/california-housing-prices) If you find that there is any error here or anything that can be better explained, please feel free to comment. Otherwise, let me go ahead and get started. \n\n# The Data\n\nThe dataset pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. We will be using this dataset in order to predict what housing prices could be in the future. Obviously the data is outdated but it will be a good way to help learn machine learning. This is also included in Kaggle Machine Learning course which I highly recommend you check out. Here are some information on the dataset that we are given: \n\n1. **longitude**: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west\n\n2. **latitude**: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north\n\n3. **housingMedianAge**: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building\n\n4. **totalRooms**: Total number of rooms within a block\n\n5. **totalBedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms within a block\n\n6. **population**: Total number of people residing within a block\n\n7. **households**: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block\n\n8. **medianIncome**: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)\n\n9. **medianHouseValue**: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)\n\n10. **oceanProximity**: Location of the house w.r.t ocean\/sea\n","4574a18a":"# Exploring Correlation Between Features\nAside from looking at it visually, we can also calculate the correlation between all the features and the median house values using the correlation matrix. The .corr() function is used to compute pairwise correlation of columns in a dataframe, excluding NA\/null values.","db7b5fd0":"Back to the categorical data, ocean_proximity. In order to analyse it, we can use the OneHotEncoder function. ","a8723f43":"Alright, I've come to the end of it! Over here, I didn't validate the model using the test data, but I figured it was a good start. For this practice, I really have to credit this video: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z1gibQGgbdg&list=PLnWSiezypm5xwNXilf31sRP_30wtf3i6j&index=6&t=2234s for helping me tons in understanding machine learning better along with the Kaggle Machine Learning course.","e81ada80":"# Loading & Understanding The Data \nNext, let us import the file and take a brief look at the data using .info() \nThere are two things to look out for here:\n\n**1. Are there null values?**\n\nMost machine learning algorithms cannot deal with Null values. These null values must be either filled or dropped. \n\n**2. The type of data** \n\nIf they are non numeric, categorical data, we need to transform them to numeric data as well.   \n***\n\n\nHow we do so will be discussed later. Let's take a look at the data first! \n","e49e3e13":"Selecting the data we need to work with. We drop median_house_value as that is what we are trying to predict and ocean proximity (for now) as it is categorical. ","405e43ff":"After that, we can evaluate the model by calculating the root mean squared error. ","6521d6db":"Back to the null data! Remember some of total_bedrooms data was null. To fix that, we can easily replace that with the median. However, before you replace it with the median, it needs to first calculate the median. This step of calculating is done using the .fit(). Next, we want to replace the dataset with the newly calculated value and return the new one. That is what the .transform() function does. \n\nAfter that we build the data frame with the newly transformed values. Now total_bedrooms have no null values. ","f3b1f049":"# Importing Libraries \nLet's get started by importing the relevant packages. For those who are curious, here's what we are importing: \n1. **Pandas**: one of the most popular libraries on python which is used for data analysis\n2. **NumPy**: a library used for working with arrays, which is much faster than lists\n3. **%matplotlib inline**: used in interactive environments like Jupyter or this Kaggle kernal in order to make your plot outputs appear and be stored within the notebook\n4. **Matplotlib**: a plotting library for the Python\n5. **matplotlib.pyplot**: Supports logarithmic and logit scales\n\n","5668fb5a":"# Alright! Let's Start Working On The Data \n\nWe start by splitting the data into the training dataset and the testing dataset. A good mix would be 80% for training and 20% for testing.
