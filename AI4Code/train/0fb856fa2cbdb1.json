the process of **automating** the time-consuming, iterative tasks of the machine learning model development.<a href=\"#f1\" id=\"a1\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/a>\n<br>\nSeveral major AutoML libraries have become very popular **since 2013** with [Auto-Weka](https:\/\/www.cs.ubc.ca\/labs\/beta\/Projects\/autoweka\/). The aim is always the same: to **automate one or more phases** of the classic **machine learning pipeline**, making it easier for non-experts to create machine learning models or allowing expert users to build models quicker and more efficiently.\n<br>\nIn general, the **main components** of the pipeline that can be automated are: the initial data preparation and feature engineering,  hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation and neural architecture search.<a href=\"#f2\" id=\"a2\"><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/a>\n\nBelow, an image showing the **areas heavily affected by AutoML**, adapted from <a href=\"#f3\" id=\"a3\"><sup>[3]<\/sup><\/a> and <a href=\"#f4\" id=\"a4\"><sup>[4]<\/sup><\/a>.","d605f1bf":"<h2  style=\"color:#316fa5; font-family:Work Sans; font-weight:500\" id=\"Data-Visualization\">Data Visualization<\/h2>\n\n<h3  style=\"color:#316fa5; font-family:Work Sans; font-weight:500\">Dataviz and Storytelling<\/h3>\n\nWhat is the most effective way of communicating information? \n<br>The right answer to this question is *it depends*. It depends on the purpose of the project and on the target audience. It depends on the level of detail one wants to reach, on the visualization channel and on the tool to be used. It depends on many other variables.\n<br>\nFor us, **the most important was delivering a message by telling a story**.\n\n<h3  style=\"color:#316fa5; font-family:Work Sans; font-weight:500\">CV as a visual metaphor<\/h3>\n\nBased on the message we wanted to convey, creating a **traditional notebook was not the best choice**. Rather, we wanted our visual project to be **interactive** as well as eye-catching and strongly distinguished on a graphic level. For this reason, we have decided to display the CVs of our Personas, **recalling the *desktop-file* interaction** that anyone among us is familiar with. The **metaphor** used is relevant both to the **topic** of our analysis (we are in fact talking about how the working landscape in data science will transform) and to the **type** of data displayed (education, work experience, tools, skills, etc.).\n<br>\nThe next challenge was to understand **how** to do it (with all the limitations of the case).\n\n<h3  style=\"color:#316fa5; font-family:Work Sans; font-weight:500\">The design process and the choice of the Tool<\/h3>\n\nWhy Tableau?\n<br>\nOut of all the data visualization tools that we master, it was the one that came **closest** to providing us with the tools to be able to achieve what we had in mind from a technical point of view. But clearly, **Tableau is not a graphic layout program**; for this reason, we encountered many difficulties. During the process we experimented with [Flourish](https:\/\/flourish.studio\/), then discarded it as it was not technically suitable for what we wanted to achieve.\n<br>\nThe final result came after **multiple tests**: the added value was certainly brought by the **continuous exchange of feedback**, demonstrating that working as a team is always enriching.\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/alessiamusio.com\/other\/Kaggle\/Process.jpg\" alt=\"process\">\n<br>\n\nOnce we identified the tool, we worked on the **graphic mask**, essential to compose the layout we had imagined.\n<br>\nAnother aspect we worked on was to **always associate color with a measure rather than a categorical dimension**. In this way, those who interact with our views will learn to **associate** the measurement of a **count** variable with this visual aid.\n\n<h2  style=\"color:#316fa5; font-family:Work Sans; font-weight:500\" id=\"Exploratory-Matrix\">Exploratory Matrix<\/h2>\n\nThe creation of the story and the design of the dashboard derive from a **careful exploratory analysis of the dataset**.\n<br>\nThis took place thanks to a **simple heatmap built in Tableau** that maps the Personas and the answers to the different questions.\n<br>\nSince we had to make choices and simplifications, **we leave it to you so that you can explore further insights too**!\n\n<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1638056622506' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Percentage ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ex&#47;ExploratoryDataAnalysisKaggleSurvey2021&#47;Percentage&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' \/><\/a><\/noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' \/> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' \/> <param name='site_root' value='' \/><param name='name' value='ExploratoryDataAnalysisKaggleSurvey2021&#47;Percentage' \/><param name='tabs' value='no' \/><param name='toolbar' value='yes' \/><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ex&#47;ExploratoryDataAnalysisKaggleSurvey2021&#47;Percentage&#47;1.png' \/> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' \/><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' \/><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' \/><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' \/><param name='display_count' value='yes' \/><param name='language' value='it-IT' \/><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' \/><\/object><\/div>                <script type='text\/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1638056622506');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='957px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/javascripts\/api\/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                <\/script>\n\n<h5 style=\"text-align:right; font-style:normal;\"><a style=\"color:#316fa5; text-decoration:none\" href=\"#TOC\">Back to the Table of Contents \u2191<\/a><\/h5>","a3962a02":"<h1  style=\"color:#316fa5; font-family:Work Sans; font-weight:600\" id=\"Breakdown\">Breakdown<\/h1>\n\n<h2  style=\"color:#316fa5; font-family:Work Sans; font-weight:500\" id=\"Topic\">Topic<\/h2>\n\nThe choice of the topic was almost **immediate** and without second thoughts.\n<br>\nThe reason is that AutoML is often approached in terms of \"Data Scientists vs AutoML\", in the same way that Artificial Intelligence is portrayed as \"Robots will replace us\".\n<br>\nIn our opinion, the key is **coexistence and not opposition**, Data Scientists **AND** AutoML and not **VERSUS**.
