The question is: Might a show like this influence people to call their kids after participants of the show?\n\nTo answer this question, we first need the names of the participants The most important ones were Loana Petrucciani and Christophe Mercy because they won it. Christophe is a common French name, so we might not be able to see any influence, but Loana is uncommon. Another famous participant was Steevy, which isn't a common French name.\n\nTherefore, we will visualize at the number of kids called \"Loana\" and \"Steevy\" to see if there is any influence of the show.\n"}}
