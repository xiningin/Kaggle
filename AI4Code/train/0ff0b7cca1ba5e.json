Insights of the dataset:\n   First, we will load a single dataset, analyse the structure of the dataset and check whether there is a presence of missing dataset. We are performing this step because all the dataset have the same format. For this step, we will load belem data(station_belem)","b227658b":"##### Note: Feel free to comment your ideas or any suggestion in order to make the kernal more informative. Thank you for your support :)","e65470eb":"**whoa!!** we have found an abnormal data in the record.

Wrangling the dataset:\nWhen I perform wrangling process in any dataset, I start by studying the columns of a dataset, which we did in the above step. The next step is that printing the first few records in order to check whether it has any missing data or any outliers. So, let's print few records.","513d1651":"Let's transform the dataset of belem and use Heatmap which is a suitable chart for the temperature dataset.","1c06abc2":"The information from the above graph is **VERY BAD** The temperature of Belem is rapidly increasing from 26 to 29 (approx.) over the year 1960 to 2020.\n\nLet's load few more datasets and compare it. We will be using the function defined above which performs cleaning of data.","37715092":"Let's explore the columns present in the dataset.","d69e0b63":"### 3. Analysis:","c8754ac7":"The dataset has 18 columns and we will go through each column and their purpose.\n1. YEAR - it represents the year of the data\n2. JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC - it represents the temperature of the respective month\n3. D-J-F - it represents the mean of the temperature of December, January and February\n4. M-A-M - it represents the mean of the temperature of March, April and May\n5. J-J-A - it represents the mean of the temperature of June, July and August\n6. S-O-N - it represents the mean of the temperature of September, October and November\n7. metANN - it represents the annual temperature mean","2eb7ac56":"To handle the missing data, let's see what options we have:\n1. we will remove the data from the dataset -> this will work if the entire row is missing (like row number 5 in the dataset above), but most of the rows have few missing data (i.e., only 4 to 5 missing data). so, this won't be a better choice.\n\n2. Replacing the missing data with the mean - Here, we will take the mean of the two rows above. By this step, we can replace the missing data without losing any real data","546d83db":"Here, we can see that all the missing values has been replaced by the mean value of the prior two rows of the respective columns. Also, if you notice, the mean value (metANN) of 4th row is approximately equal to the calculated mean value with the missing data replaced.","e45de34e":"Below, we created a function where it will replace the missing data with the mean value of the respective columns. This function is created because we can reuse the same function for multiple datasets.","527a16c3":"### 1. Loading the necessary libraries:\n    * pandas -> to handle the datasets\n    * seaborn and matplotlib -> to perform data visualizations","26957550":"Overall, we can see that all the state in Brazil has an increase in their temperature over the time method.
