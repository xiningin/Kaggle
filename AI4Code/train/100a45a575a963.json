Black tiles have 0 pixels in the lower end, while \"white\" (actually \"dirty gray\") has only about 20 pixels in that region. We then see that tiles with some actual tissue have a more even distribution. Let's call this metric \"lowpass energy\". It turns out that if we later select lowpass energy > 100 we are garanteed to have actual tissue in the slide, and we can discard anything with < 100.

You CANNOT use \"reshape\" instead, that will scramble the channels.","d4247565":"# Tiling the Large Images into 512x512 tiles\nHere are some useful functions that use the numpy slicing capability to select specifc tiles of the image. \n\nNOTE: The numpy arrays have dimensions [height, width, channels]. This Notebook will tile the image using offsets for the height index and width index. So:\n- a Tile with coordinate [0,0] represents the first tile on the top left corner.  \n- a Tile with coordinate [1,0] represents a tile with height offset = 1*Tile Size, in this case it starts at numpy coordinates [512,0], which means it is the tile below [0,0]\n- a Tile with coordinate [0,1] represents a tile with wodth offset = 1*Tile Size, in this case it starts at numpy coordinates [0,512], which means it is the tile to the right of [0,0]","181f36ce":"In the same fashion, the code below scans the test directory and converts all the images there too.

To build the complete dataset I built one at the time.","398e80c5":"# Objective:\n\nThe objective of this notebook is to provide an example of how to transform the HubMAP Hacking the Kidney competition dataset into a form that can readily used to train models leveraging accelerators. The images in this competition have very high resolution, averaging 30,000 x 30,000 pixels, and this presents a difficult challenge in memory management. It is just not possible to read them all in memory in the Kaggle environment, and it is also not possible to build a model using the whole image as input. This notebooks provides some tips for reading the competitions images and masks, and proposes a strategy to deal with the large sizes. \nThe strategy adopted in this Notebook is to tile the images in 512X512 tiles, and then transforming the tiles into TFRecords such that we can later use them as input to train models using GPU or TPU accelerators. \n\nThis Notebook takes a long time to run because it processes all the competition files and the resulting, compressed dataset is 18.1G, almost exceeding the Kaggle VM limit. I was able to process all files and then uploaded the results to a Kaggle daset that I have made public:\n--> [Link to the TFRecord Dataset Produced by this Notebook.](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/marcosnovaes\/hubmap-tfrecord-512)\n\nI have also developed a Notebook that explains how to use the TFRecord Dataset: [https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/marcosnovaes\/hubmap-looking-at-tfrecords\/](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/marcosnovaes\/hubmap-looking-at-tfrecords\/)\n\nIf you want to use the dataset without change you don't need to run the Notebook -- but do read through it because it provides a lot of insight on how the read the images, masks and convert them to TFRecords. I will be using this dataset on my subsequent notebooks. You can also easily costumize this Notebook if you want to produce tiles od different sizes (I used 512x512) or if you want to include more metadata for each tile. ","97406c14":"The id corresponds to the images provided. For each image, you are provided a .tiff image file and the Run Length Encoding Mask. \n\nBut notice that the masks are also provided as a .json file with polygon definitions. I used this option instead in this Notebook. ","81e9567e":"Verify all images were written","fb037641":"As can be noticed in the sample image displayed, there is a black border and then a lot of white surrounding the tissue. If we select [0,0] we expect to see a black tile. If we move a little to the right and down, we are then in the white zone. So let's try the values [0,0] and [5,5] and we should be a black and a white tile respectively.","4110b9f0":"Bingo!!! We found our first glom. Let's now derive a metric for masks, so that in the future we can easily find tiles with gloms. This metric will be used when we want to filter the training dataset to make sure it includes a certain number of tiles with gloms. Simply counting the number of \"TRUE\" pixels in the mask is a great metric that indicate the tile contains a glom.","a3d0399a":"Let's read the tile with col offset 8 and row offset 20 (i.e. [8,20]) which we previously noticed to contain a glom.","1d4fdc1a":"The masks are provided in the csv files in RLE format, but we are also provided json files that describe the mask as polygons.

But they have very large dimensions, we would not be able to train a ML model at these dimensions.

Find and read the competition train.csv file.","7efe2bf9":"# Transforming the Tiles into a TFRecord Dataset\nWe are now ready to read all the images (one at a time or we will run out of memory!) and then writing each tile to a TFRecord file. Kaggle has a limit of 50 upper level directories, so we will create one dir for each image. We will also build a pandas dataframe that has the metadata for each tile, including the lowpass energy and mask density metrics that we derived above. \n\nUsing the TFRecord format for storing data should be easy, but unfortunately it requires data serialization which complicates it a little bit. This is done using [protocol buffers](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/protocol-buffers\/) and that is a bit of a learning curve. But in ML you only need to understand the [TFExample](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/train\/Example) format. In this Notebook I provide a little template code for dealing with TFExamples that can be quickly customized for any type of data. This template is explained in detail in [this tutorial](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/load_data\/tfrecord); but you don't need to read all this, in this Notebook I provide an example specific for image data that you can quickly customize.\n\nFor serialization using TFExample, we have to make any data fit into either one of 3 types:\n* bytes_feature\n* float_feature\n* int_64_feature\n\nIn this Notebook and image and mask are passed as bytes_features and the other metadata as int_64.
