However, out of those that do it seems that the Night's Watch has suffered the most deaths and House Arryn has suffered the least.","44bd3154":"8. List the highest number of battles that took place in a year using two different methods. (Hint: Use .max() and .sort_values())","6761ce3f":"# Display\nOftentimes when working with datasets, it can be overwhelming. There can be what seems like an abundance of information to work with and you may want to selectively view bits and pieces of the dataset at a time - rather than the entire thing at once.\n\nYou can use the .head() function to display the top number of rows and the .tail() function for the bottom rows in a dataset. If you would like to specify how many rows, use the parenthesis () to fill in number of your choice. Otherwise, a default of 5 rows will be displayed. \n\n1.

After examining average deaths and deaths per year, let's say we want to find the year with the highest number of battles and the year with the lowest.\n\nSort methods in Pandas include:\n* .sort_index() and sort_values(). - Displays values in the table in an order from highest to lowest or vice versa\n* .max() and .min() - returning the maximum\/minimum value\n* .idxmax() and .idxmin() - returning the index of the maximum\/minimum value\n","443e8e9b":"9.

Hope you enjoyed my tutorial and learned something new from it!","09da615f":"# Frequency Counts\nThis is yet another way to find the size of a particular group. For instance, if we wanted to count the number of attacker kings throughout all the years, we can do so through the frequency count method:\n* .groupby().size()","aa1aa94e":"11. Display a pie chart to distribute the number of deaths.\n\nFrom the graph, it is clear that there are more battles in which there are no deaths than there are a maximum of one.","e7a9b6a9":"4.

The methods for select are:\n* .iloc[] - selecting by row numbers\n* .loc[] - selecting by labels\n* conditional - specifying conditions within the selection []\n","9455ef8d":"7. Now let's say I want to combine Select and Summarize and find the average number of deaths for battles in only the year 299. How can I specify this?
