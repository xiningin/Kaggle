Right before we knew about the binary black holes it was believed the black holes can be super massive in size or just small but intermediate size black holes were believed to exist with no proof but after the first time the gw signals were recieved travelling several light years it was proved that intermediate size black holes were also there in the form of binary black holes .\n<\/p>","c39ef776":"<p style = \"font-family:courier,arial,helvetica;font-size:200%;\">\nSomething that can be seen here is that the signal for site 1 was huge at first meaning that there was a huge difference in the values of target 1 and target which shows a decrease in teh difference as the time goes on which means as the time goes on the strength of the signal  gw) weaskens hence making the difference between the target 1 and 0 smaller as well hence making a difference.
