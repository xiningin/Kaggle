In the center of the screen is a map that can be zoomed in\/out using the minus and plus buttons on the bottom left side of the screen.\n\nOn the **left side** of the map are **layers** that correspond to COVID-19 prevalence. Select one (and only 1) from each display group to populate the map with corresponding data (see sections below for more details). \n\nEach **\u201cdisplay group\u201d** basically populates the map with different types of data. In this visualization, Group A corresponds to the COVID case statistic type (deaths, recovered, active). Group B corresponds to the specific metrics being examined (climatic or demographic, depending on the visualization). Group C is an option that can allow data to be grouped specifically by region in the country.\n\n### Date selection\n\nAlong the **bottom** of the screen there is a **date picker**. Selecting a single date will populate the map with the number of COVID cases **<u>up until that date<\/u>**. For example, if the date April 12 is selected, then the COVID statistics will display the accumulated cases up until April 12, and not the number of new cases\/recoveries\/deaths on April 12 only. Therefore, even though the visualization has a built-in slider to accommodate date range, it does not work correctly yet. Date ranges will be incorporated into future functionality. The Group B data at that given date will also be displayed (for climate data, and not applicable to demographic data).\n\n### Climate Metrics\n\nThere are a variety of layers included in display group B to represent climate such as average temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, etc. A color spectrum is then used to mark regions depending on the value of the numerical climate metric measure. Currently, we have comprehensive climate data available for visualization only in the country of Italy (none of the other countries can be analyzed with this tool yet). The climate data for each region can be accessed by hovering the mouse over one of the colored dots inside the map view (the climate summary for the selected layer will be displayed above the cursor).\n\nSources:\n- [Corona Data Scraper](https:\/\/coronadatascraper.com\/#home)\n- [NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) POWER project](https:\/\/power.larc.nasa.gov\/)\n\n\nWHAT IT DOES:\n\nThis chart displays Italy\u2019s  municipal regions\u2019 COVID-19 information and the corresponding climate condition for a given **date**.\nThis chart gives the following INFORMATION of the region:\n\n- Number COVID Cases\n- Region Name\n- Number of Active Cases\n- Number of Deaths\n- Number of Tests Conducted\n\nAnd ONE of the below CLIMATE conditions of that region is displayed:\n\n- Average Temperature\n- Minimum Temperature\n- Maximum Temperature\n- Relative Humidity\n- Pressure\n \n \n\n\n### Demographic Metrics\n\nThis visualization shows various population demographic data from regional age and gender distributions to population density.\nThe options on the left are best when only using one selection from each group:\n\n**Group A** - Age, Gender\n\n**Group B** - COVID-19 cases: Total, Active, Recovered and Deaths\n\n**Group C** - Regional Population Density of average number of people per square kilometer.\n\n<u>Group A<\/u>\nAge and gender\/sex distributions:\n\n<img src=\"attachment:age_points.png\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right:10px\"> 9 age distribution brackets: 0-9, 20-29, 30-39, 30-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+\n\nThe order goes from top left like you would read a book. If a region had a uniform distribution of ages they would all be white dots, so this example from Emilia-Romagna shows a lower proportion of under 29\u2019s and an over representation of 40-59 year olds.\n\n<img src=\"attachment:genders.png\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right:10px\"\/>Gender\/sex distribution, 0.5 would be equal distribution. Is displayed with male on the left and female on the right, equal would make both white though the deviation is only small, on average most countries have slightly more women than men, except places like China whose long term policies have affected the distribution.\n\n\n<u>Group B<\/u>\nThese allow different options to show regional counts for COVID-19\u2019s: Cumulative tested cases, number of active cases, number of recovered patients and number of deaths.\nThis is displayed as a circle in the centre of a region, the size displays the relative count.\n\n<u>Group C<\/u>\nThis option only has one choice that colours the regions to display the population density measured in people per square kilometer.\n \nSources:\n- [Population by different regional levels](http:\/\/demo.istat.it\/pop2019)\n- [Italian communes to province mapping](https:\/\/www.istat.it\/it\/archivio\/6789#Elencodeicodiciedelledenominazionidelleunitterritoriali-0)\n- [Cartographic data](https:\/\/www.istat.it\/it\/archivio\/222527)\n\n\n### Errata\n\nIn the climate visualization, the humidity data is missing some data points in specific Italian regions. In the database, if there is a missing data point, the database records the humidity value as -999 instead of NaN. We will fix this soon!\n\n\n[Back to top](#top)","b690dd11":"[Back to top](#top)\n\n\n# 8.

The extraction of geolocations on the original CORD-19 dataset.\n\n2. The gathering of geopolitical and demographic data related to the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe goal of the first line of work is to provide our teammates with additional insights about their findings, like the location of clinical trials or reports and claims.\nThe goal of the second line of work is to provide researchers with resources to confirm, debate or extends claims and findings made in the papers contained in the CORD-19 dataset.\n\n\nAt the current time, the extraction of geolocations from the CORD-19 datast is at a preliminary stage. We have achieved some initial results, but additional work is required in order to extract the important insights that would be useful to the research community at large. The gathering of geopolitical and demographic data is at a more developed stage. We provide very granular datasets on various aspects related to the spread of the virus and the resulting mortality in the population. The focus aspects were selected in collaboration with `task-risk` and `task-vt` via in depth analysis of the CORD-19 dataset. These datasets have been brought in a standardized format in order to make them easy to use and to combine for researchers and the public at large.\n\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER AND RISKS**\n\n\nWe have strived to provide as accurate and up to date information as possible. We rely on multiple external providers and our data is only as accurate as theirs is. Our goal is not to draw any conclusion from the data, but only to present it in a way that is as accessible as possible.\n\n[Back to top](#top)","ed009bde":"<a id=\"top\"><\/a>\n## Table of Contents\n1.
