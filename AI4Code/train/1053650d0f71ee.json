Running at speeds of up to 310 km\/h this extensive network allows for fast connections between cities in Spain. Travel from Madrid to Barcelona in less than 3 hours! This modern train system connects many cities across Spain from Madrid and Barcelona, to C\u00f3rdoba, Seville, M\u00e1laga and Valencia.\n#### ALVIA: The Spanish Alvia trains combine both a long distance and a high-speed service to connect major cities across Spain. The Alvia offers many routes such as connections from Madrid to Gij\u00f3n, Alicante and Castell\u00f3n and from Barcelona to Bilbao, A Coru\u00f1a and Vigo. With air conditioned carriages and check-in control before boarding the Alvia is comfortable and relaxed way to traverse one of Europe's biggest countries.\n#### REGIONAL: Regional and intercity trains in Spain. FEVE trains operate in the north of Spain, connecting cities like Bilbao, Gij\u00f3n, Le\u00f3n and Santander. Cercan\u00edas (suburban trains) is a network of trains that operates in and around the larger Spanish cities including Barcelona and Valencia.\n#### INTERCITY: Traditional intercity trains travelling between 160 do 250 km\/h allow you to reach nearly every corner of Spain. You can choose to travel in 2nd class (Turista) or 1st class (Preferente). The comfort of the carriages is close to that of the high-speed AVE trains. All trains are air-conditioned.\n#### AV City :The ave city trains are high speed train to complement the AVE to offer lower prices and marketed in economy class (p) and economy plus (p+)\n#### Less distance(LD) - Medium distance(MD): The LD-AVE and MD-AVE on the list of trains is for an indirect service that uses a comination of the regular trains (either the LD - Larga Distancia\/Long Distance or the MD - Media Distancia\/Medium Distance). Those trains requires a change (usually in Zaragoza or Valencia) so, due to the change and the lower speed trains on part of the way. The journey is longer but the tickets are cheaper. \n#### The LD,AVE-MD,AVE-LD,LD-MD,MD-AVE,MD,LD-AVE slightly falls under above category.\n#### TRENHOTEL: Trenhotel are night trains running in Spain and from Spain to Portugal. The trains are consisting of Talgo articulated stock, providing a very comfortable and smooth ride. There are different kinds of trains in use, offering different kinds of services. Older trains convey 2nd class seats, four bed sleepers, 2 bed sleepers and 2 bed sleepers with ensuite shower and WC. Newer trains convey only 1st class reclining seats and 2 bed sleepers with ensuite shower and WC. All trains have a bistro carriage.\n","a37ea86b":"### Observations:\n1.
