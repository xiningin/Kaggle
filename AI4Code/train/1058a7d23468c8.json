This can explain a user behavior such as when a user downloads an app without reading the description or without knowing what this app is about only to be disappointed after installation and give a bad rate, while other users download the same app knowing what this app is about and give the app a better rare. In contrast, we see app categories having less or no outliers, that make the app more robust and maybe the name of the app is not misleading in comparison of what the apps do.\n\nLet's see some examples: How rating and category are related?","6c56cf19":"So, our dataset consists of  13 features describing each app on the dataset. Some features such as `Rating` have a lot of missing values. All the features are strings but that's not right for all the columns while some of them describing numerical values.","95d24f26":"### Genres","70329bbd":"### What is the rating distribution?","287b2685":"Another filter in the dataset we see more apps as the first one!!!","d4ea88b4":"Ok here we have dates, we can easy to convert the text format as a date.","b73f2214":"### CATEGORY\n\n","9aab1cab":"Ok a simple feature, nothing to do here yet","85b5c246":"The size of the app is a numeric value too but is parsed as a string. We can turn them into numbers but we have another problem here, some of the apps are into Megabytes and some are into Kilobytes, plus there are apps that have no size. We can leave it as it is or we can make a function that looks the last letter and if it is MB it stays so if it is KB we turn it into megabytes by dividing with 1024.","9c368ba5":"### Reviews","e627779e":"118 unique app genres, I want to make a comparison with Category to see what's different","0eb2203b":"Ok it seems that the `DATE` category is the Category that receives the worsts ratings, while the `EVENTS` category has better ratings","6f898d9b":"### Content Rating","436b85cb":"We have done the hard work and now we see that this feature is in numeric format, the min value raises some questions while the size of 0 Mb is something to think about,  we assume that the app is too small.

Other than that apps have a normal size distribution.","5982633d":"### Android Ver","a10401fa":"Ok, we see that first category has a more robust rating but it has fewer ratings in total, looking in the apps name in this category we see maybe better app names.
