The\nX-ray pulsar AX J1631.9-4752\/IGR J16320-4751 is within the MAXI error circle\nand was suggested to be the source producing the bright transient emission.\nHowever, the Swift\/BAT position reported for the bright source (GCN#23550)\nis 8.4 arcminutes away from the XMM position of AX J1631.9-4752.  As this\nis significantly more than the 3 arcminute uncertainty (90% confidence)\nin the Swift\/BAT position, we obtained two NuSTAR observations on December\n28: a 14 ks observation pointed at the Swift\/BAT position and a 12 ks observation\npointed at AX J1631.9-4752. \n\nIn the 14 ks NuSTAR observation, we found a very bright source at R.A.\n= 247.806 deg, Decl. = -47.805 deg (J2000) with an uncertainty of 15 arcsec.\nThis position is consistent with the Swift\/BAT position and is not consistent\nwith the position of AX J1631.9-4752.  In addition, a search of the SIMBAD\ndatabase does not show any known source consistent with the NuSTAR position.\nThus, we conclude that MAXI J1631-479 is a new X-ray transient. \n\nThe NuSTAR observations were performed when the source was 34 degrees away\nfrom the sun. As the sun is close to the FOV, the star tracker used for\naspect reconstruction was only available approximately for 2.6 ks, but\nwe were able to obtain the source position with NuSTAR nominal astrometric\naccuracy due to the brightness of the source. \n\nThe source is detected across the 3-79 keV NuSTAR bandpass with a count\nrate in excess of 600 c\/s (FPMA and FPMB combined).  An absorbed disk-blackbody\nplus power-law model provides a reasonably good description of the continuum\nwith a reduced chi2 of 1.25 for 893 degrees of freedom.  The column density\nis (2.9+\/-0.2)e22 atoms\/cm2 (using wilm abundances), the temperature of\nthe disk-blackbody is 1.12+\/-0.01 keV, and the power-law photon index is\n2.39+\/-0.02 (90% confidence errors).  The 3-79 keV and 2-10 keV absorbed\nfluxes are 1.8e-8 erg\/cm2\/s and 1.7e-8 erg\/cm2\/s, respectively.  The residuals\nshow clear evidence for an iron Kalpha emission line, and adding a broad\ngaussian with an equivalent width of 90 eV improves the fit significantly.\nThis demonstrates that we are seeing a reflection component in the spectrum.\n\nThe spectral properties of MAXI J1631-479 indicate that it is very likely\nto be an accreting black hole in the soft state.  In the future, further\nwork on the MAXI and Swift\/BAT data may provide more information about\nthe overall evolution of the current outburst.  The source is still in\noutburst, and multi-wavelength observations are encouraged.  Based on the\nbehavior of other black hole transients, the outburst may last for another\nmonth or more.''')\nprint([(X.text, X.label_) for X in doc.ents])","c9862b56":"print([(X, X.ent_iob_, X.ent_type_) for X in doc])","3d6b5358":"labels = [x.label_ for x in doc.ents]\nCounter(labels)","17b6c9ea":"# sentences = [x for x in doc.sents]\n# print(sentences[0])","99b387c9":"displacy.render(nlp(str(doc)), jupyter=True, style='ent')","59fedb99":"# displacy.render(nlp(str(doc)), style='dep', jupyter = True, options = {'distance': 120})","1f0e2463":"*** Loading one of our astro telegrams ***","fc6364ca":"Using SpaCy's Named entity recognition pretrained on a large corpus of text","203195ca":"** Did not capture most words though :\/ **"}}
