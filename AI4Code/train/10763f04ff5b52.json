After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set. This will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that have been used to train the data. It is more realistic for real world problems.\n\nThis means that we know the outcome of each data point in this dataset, making it great to test with! And since this data has not been used to train the model, the model has no knowledge of the outcome of these data points. So, in essence, it\u2019s truly an out-of-sample testing.","a84a4cb0":"**About this Notebook**\n\nIn this notebook, we learn how to use scikit-learn to implement Multiple linear regression.

When more than one independent variable is present, the process is called multiple linear regression. For example, predicting co2emission using FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB, EngineSize and Cylinders of cars. The good thing here is that Multiple linear regression is the extension of simple linear regression model.","6dc79332":"As mentioned before, Coefficient and Intercept , are the parameters of the fit line. Given that it is a multiple linear regression, with 3 parameters, and knowing that the parameters are the intercept and coefficients of hyperplane, sklearn can estimate them from our data. Scikit-learn uses plain Ordinary Least Squares method to solve this problem.\n\n**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**\n\nOLS is a method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the target dependent variable and those predicted by the linear function. In other words, it tries to minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE) or mean squared error (MSE) between the target variable (y) and our predicted output (y-hat) over all samples in the dataset.\n\nOLS can find the best parameters using of these features:\n\n- Solving the model parameters analytically using closed-form equations\n- Using an optimization algorithm (Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Newton\u2019s Method, etc.)","c1bebe93":"**Understanding the Data**\n\nWe have downloaded a fuel consumption dataset, FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. \n\n**MODELYEAR** e.g. 2014\n\n**MAKE** e.g. Acura\n\n**MODEL** e.g. ILX\n\n**VEHICLE CLASS** e.g. SUV\n\n**ENGINE SIZE** e.g. 4.7\n\n**CYLINDERS** e.g 6\n\n**TRANSMISSION** e.g. A6\n\n**FUELTYPE** e.g. z\n\n**FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L\/100 km)** e.g. 9.9\n\n**FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L\/100 km)** e.g. 8.9\n\n**FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L\/100 km)** e.g. 9.2\n\n**CO2 EMISSIONS (g\/km)** e.g. 182 --> low --> 0","dbbb0c2f":"**Importing packages**","67218197":"**Prediction**","62a18b51":"**Reading the Data**","a5ab8fec":"**Train Data distribution**","ddd92323":"**explained variance regression score:**\n\nIf $\\hat{y}$ is the estimated target output, y the corresponding (correct) target output, and Var is Variance, the square of the standard deviation, then the explained variance is estimated as follow:\n\n$\\texttt{explainedVariance}(y, \\hat{y}) = 1 - \\frac{Var\\{ y - \\hat{y}\\}}{Var\\{y\\}}$  \n\nThe best possible score is 1.0, lower values are worse.","5cfbda15":"Lets plot Emision values with respect to Engine size:","b4655f9a":"**Practice**\n\nTry to use a multiple linear regression with the same dataset but this time use FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY and FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY instead of FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB.
