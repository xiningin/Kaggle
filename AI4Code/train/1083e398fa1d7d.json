See you next week!","751735dd":"# Part 1: Process the Data\n\nFor any machine learning project, once you've gathered the data, the first step is to process it to make useful inputs to your model.\n- **Remove noise**: You will first want to remove noise from your data -- that is, remove words that don't tell you much about the content. These include all common words like 'I, you, are, is, etc...' that would not give us enough information on the sentiment.\n- We'll also remove stock market tickers, retweet symbols, hyperlinks, and hashtags because they can not tell you a lot of information on the sentiment.\n- You also want to remove all the punctuation from a tweet. The reason for doing this is because we want to treat words with or without the punctuation as the same word, instead of treating \"happy\", \"happy?\", \"happy!\", \"happy,\" and \"happy.\" as different words.\n- Finally you want to use stemming to only keep track of one variation of each word. In other words, we'll treat \"motivation\", \"motivated\", and \"motivate\" similarly by grouping them within the same stem of \"motiv-\".\n\nWe have given you the function `process_tweet()` that does this for you.","7c2ffad4":"## Part 1.1 Implementing your helper functions\n\nTo help train your naive bayes model, you will need to build a dictionary where the keys are a (word, label) tuple and the values are the corresponding frequency.  Note that the labels we'll use here are 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n\nYou will also implement a `lookup()` helper function that takes in the `freqs` dictionary, a word, and a label (1 or 0) and returns the number of times that word and label tuple appears in the collection of tweets.\n\nFor example: given a list of tweets `[\"i am rather excited\", \"you are rather happy\"]` and the label 1, the function will return a dictionary that contains the following key-value pairs:\n\n{\n    (\"rather\", 1): 2\n    (\"happi\", 1) : 1\n    (\"excit\", 1) : 1\n}\n\n- Notice how for each word in the given string, the same label 1 is assigned to each word.\n- Notice how the words \"i\" and \"am\" are not saved, since it was removed by process_tweet because it is a stopword.\n- Notice how the word \"rather\" appears twice in the list of tweets, and so its count value is 2.\n\n#### Instructions\nCreate a function `count_tweets()` that takes a list of tweets as input, cleans all of them, and returns a dictionary.\n- The key in the dictionary is a tuple containing the stemmed word and its class label, e.g. (\"happi\",1).\n- The value the number of times this word appears in the given collection of tweets (an integer).","48bc8806":"#### Implement test_naive_bayes\n**Instructions**:\n* Implement `test_naive_bayes` to check the accuracy of your predictions.\n* The function takes in your `test_x`, `test_y`, log_prior, and loglikelihood\n* It returns the accuracy of your model.\n* First, use `naive_bayes_predict` function to make predictions for each tweet in text_x.","951b8366":"#### Positive and Negative Probability of a Word\nTo compute the positive probability and the negative probability for a specific word in the vocabulary, we'll use the following inputs:\n\n- $freq_{pos}$ and $freq_{neg}$ are the frequencies of that specific word in the positive or negative class. In other words, the positive frequency of a word is the number of times the word is counted with the label of 1.\n- $N_{pos}$ and $N_{neg}$ are the total number of positive and negative words for all documents (for all tweets), respectively.\n- $V$ is the number of unique words in the entire set of documents, for all classes, whether positive or negative.\n\nWe'll use these to compute the positive and negative probability for a specific word using this formula:\n\n$$ P(W_{pos}) = \\frac{freq_{pos} + 1}{N_{pos} + V}\\tag{4} $$\n$$ P(W_{neg}) = \\frac{freq_{neg} + 1}{N_{neg} + V}\\tag{5} $$\n\nNotice that we add the \"+1\" in the numerator for additive smoothing.

That is the \"prior\".\n\nThe prior is the ratio of the probabilities $\\frac{P(D_{pos})}{P(D_{neg})}$.\nWe can take the log of the prior to rescale it, and we'll call this the logprior\n\n$$\\text{logprior} = log \\left( \\frac{P(D_{pos})}{P(D_{neg})} \\right) = log \\left( \\frac{D_{pos}}{D_{neg}} \\right)$$.\n\nNote that $log(\\frac{A}{B})$ is the same as $log(A) - log(B)$.
