Looks simple ? Not so soon. The labels are space-delimited strings. Its a multi-label problem. \n\nWe will use Fastai's datablock API to load our data. DataBlock API is simply amazing. Infinitely  flexibility and incredibly powerful. To use the datablock API, you need to define some functions.","bf91db5b":"In this notebook, we will be using **Progressive Resizing** (technique made famous by Jeremy Howard). We will be using fastai library and pre-trained ResNet152. \n\nThis is the training notebook.

Here are some things that you can experiment with:\n\n- Preprocess and Feature Engineering\n- Data Augmentation and External Datasets\n- Different Model Architectures\n- Training Schedule, Optimizer, etc\n- Postprocess\n\nYou can find the [inference notebook here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ankursingh12\/fastai-plant2021-starter-inference).

Also, the model sees more details as we increase the size. Hence, we can train the model much faster. \n\nWe will start with 128x128 and gradually take the image size to 528x528"}}
