The data used is 'clean_dialog.csv'. Also some other general statistics is analyzed.\n\nNote: Prediction accuracy is far from optimal, and ngram implementation is very basic. Also the source code is documented poorly. The reason this simple project was published to Kaggle, is to say a _Thank You_ to Liu Renyu who gathered this amazing data set. It was a great fun to play with, even though nothing that special was achieved.\n\nProgram is written in Rust (Rust is like C++ but way less painful). Source code available here: \nhttps:\/\/gitlab.com\/tolvanea\/sgn-44006_artificial_intelligence_weekly_exercises\/tree\/master\/ex4\n\n## Methods\nThis program uses ngram-text classification with simulatenous n=1 and n=2. The ngram works in word-level integer encoded vocabulary.\nSee more: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/N-gram\n\nNgram is not optimal algorithm for predicting pony by line, because most prase lines are quite short (< 20 words), and there is simply just not enough data (i.e. word-pairs) to do accurate probabilistic matching. Also there are a lot of different characters, with very total few spoken lines.\n\nAll lines shorter than 20 words are left out from test-data to increase the effectiveness of ngram.\n\nNote: I did barely read how ngrams really work, and then just quickly threw together something. Therefore this is not an orthodox or exact implementation of ngram, but just fun play-around proof-of-concept. I did also some arbitary modifications to algorihm that seemed to produce better results (e.g. probability of word pair, when there exists no such mathces in the data). \n\n## Results\nThese are some outputs of program.\n\nTop 10 words in the show.

Even though accuracy is better than pure random, there's a lot of room for improvement. Also one has to remember that lines are quite short compared to normal ngram-data.\n(Worth noting is that the main 6 characters \"mane-6\" has the most lines in the show. If I were to guess, predicting only Twilight would probably yield at least 10% accuracy. I did not test that though.)"}}
