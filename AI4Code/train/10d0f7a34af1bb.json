This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters).

The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that Oi,j corresponds to the number of adoption records that have a rating of i (actual) and received a predicted rating j.
