One of the major forms of pre-processing is to filter out useless data. In natural language processing, useless words (data), are referred to as \"Stop words\"\n\nA stop word is a commonly used word (such as \u201cthe\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, \u201cin\u201d) that a search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query.\n\n"}}
