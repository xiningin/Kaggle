","da95b05f":"# 4 Model Building\nNow that I have identified and processed some usefull data, I will build a simple model. The first thing that I will need to do is set up the training and validation data using the `pd.DataFrame.merge()` method. Then I will seperate out a train and a test set, then I will train my model and finaly predict on the target test set.","992f1c8e":"## 3.3 Datafiles Files\nThere are a ton of files in the `datafiles` folder so I used a dictionary to store them all. I used list comprehensions to create the names and paths in order to load all of the files using pandas `pd.read_csv` function. The standard `pd.read_csv` worked for all of the files except for TeamSpellings. I will start with `RegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv` as this will likely be the most impactfull dat for an initial model and go from there. ","6a83da4f":"# 5 Submission file\nI will use the `SampleSubmission` file to make my predictions, I just need to split up the columns to perform the lookups.

It looks like everything is stored in .csv format, so it should be pretty easy to load with pandas `pd.read_csv` function. I used f-strings with list comprehensions below to print out the files provided in each of the folders.. ","c7071e74":"In this section I will go through most of the files give my thoughs on how the data can be used. I will also create a few visulizations for some of the more interesting and potentaily useful files. \n\n## 3.1 Sample Submission File \nFirst I like to find out what the submission will look like. I can do this by taking a look at the `SampleSubmissionStage1.csv` file. Since the comp is currently in Stage 1, the sample submission file includes all potential match ups for the 2014 through 2018 tournements. The 0.5 in Pred column cells indicates a 50\/50 percent chance of either team winning; for the competition a zero means that team 1 wins and a 0 means that team 2 wins. The format of the ID column is year, team one (lower id), then team two (higher id) seperated by an underscore.","116a6dd3":"## 3.2 Play by Play files\nIn each play by play folder there are two files; `Players_####.csv` and `Events_####.csv`. I took a look at the data in 2014 since the Stage 1 model building will be judged on models from this year. I took a look at the amount of data using the `pd.DataFrame.shape` attribute, then used the `pd.DataFrame.head()` method to look at the columns and a few values. I made a bar graph of events by winners and loosers to summarize the events data. There was not a whole lot to look at in the players file, so no graphs.","6a034533":"This is where I will test the model to make sure it is doing better than the baseline.","658f74a0":"# 1 Introduction\nIn this kernal I will dig into the data sources using seaborn for visualizations and pandas for aggregations, and at the end I will produce a submission file for Stage 1. The submission deadline for this contest is notourious for creeping up on the contestents, which happened to me last year when I missed the deadline and was not able to submit my predictions. One other important note about this competition is that this is not like the usaual March Madness brackets going around work where you pick your winners for each round, since you are providing the likelyhood of Team 1 winning for every possible match up if the team you pick looses you are stil in the game.  Also, since this is log loss, if you use 0 or 1 for one of you predictions and are wrong, your loss will go to infinity. \n\n# 2 Libraries\nKaggle starts you off with the numpy, pandas and os librarys for this kernal. I will also be using matplotlib and seaborn for plotting; sklearn functions for data processing and xgboost for the model. These are all pretty standard librarys for kaggle competitions, so nothing exiting here.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/goo.gl\/images\/GNCCmP\">"}}
