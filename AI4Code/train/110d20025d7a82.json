The $PosNegRatio$ is defined as \n\n$$PosNegRatio = \\sqrt{\\frac{(PosPredictionCount)(NegPredictionCount)}{(PosLabelCount)(NegLabelCount)}}$$\n\nwhere $PosPredictionCount = (TP+FP)$ means **total number of positive predictions** in the test set, and the other three variables can be interpreted in the same sense.\n\n## Interpretation : \nAbove, you can see that MCC score consists of 3 main variables, which we would like to maximize simultaneously.\nNote that, before seeing the simplified MCC version, we may have intuitively thought that **by increasing both positive precision and negative precision, MCC score should increase**, and perhaps the score is an average of the two precisions. **This intutiion is heuristically acceptable in many cases**, but not all, as explained in the next paragraph.\n\nThis intuition does not work especially in the VSB situation where we have such a imbalance distribution of positive (4%) and negative examples (96%). If a good MCC were just somehow be acheived by good precisions, we may do this by guess only one (very confident) positive example, and get 100% positive precision. Even though, we may predict all the rest as negative, due to the highly ratio of negative example, we still get around 96% of negative precision. In this case, we will have very high two precisions, but still a bad MCC score. The explanation lies in the third term, $PosNegRatio$.\n\nHere, $PosNegRatio$ plays an important role. This ratio forces us to make the number of positive and negative predictions **roughly the same as the ground-truth number of labeled examples**. So in the above case, we cheated by predict only 1 positive example, where there are around 4% of 11592 (public test data) $\\approx 464$, so we shall get a very bad score in the factor of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{464}}$.\n\nTo conclude, the correct intuition is to maximize the two precisions, and also $PosNegRatio$ together!\n\n## Deriving the intuitive formula\nWe shall start by its standard definition.\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\text{MCC} = \\frac{ \\mathit{TP} \\times \\mathit{TN} - \\mathit{FP} \\times \\mathit{FN} } {\\sqrt{ (\\mathit{TP} + \\mathit{FP}) ( \\mathit{TP} + \\mathit{FN} ) ( \\mathit{TN} + \\mathit{FP} ) ( \\mathit{TN} + \\mathit{FN} ) } }\n\\end{equation*}\n","fa70a61e":"First note that $(TP+FN)(TN+FP)$ is constant with respect to the given test set; they are in fact $(PosLabelCount)(NegLabelCount)$.

I think almost everyone here agrees that this *VSB Power Line Fault Detection* is not an easy competition. The performance of the best public kernel is so difficult to beat and improve. \n\nIn my opinion, one of the main reason is that the MCC formula \n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\text{MCC} = \\frac{ \\mathit{TP} \\times \\mathit{TN} - \\mathit{FP} \\times \\mathit{FN} } {\\sqrt{ (\\mathit{TP} + \\mathit{FP}) ( \\mathit{TP} + \\mathit{FN} ) ( \\mathit{TN} + \\mathit{FP} ) ( \\mathit{TN} + \\mathit{FN} ) } }\n\\end{equation*}\n\nis quite complex and not so intuitive compared to usual metrics like **accuracy, F1**, etc. \n\nEventhough this section on wikipedia https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Matthews_correlation_coefficient#Advantages_of_MCC_over_accuracy_and_F1_score gives us some explanation why MCC is nice :\nunlike the  **'accuracy' metric**, MCC adjust score well in the class imbalance situations, and unlike **F1** which concentrates only on positive-class prediction, MCC also force our performance to do well on both postive and negative prediction.\n\nHowever, due to its complexity, we will have a hard time to gain insight from our current MCC score, e.g. if we score 0.694, \n\n- how many positive\/negative examples that we are correctly classified? \n\n- Does our algorithm have a good precision?\n\n- If we are able to correct one more positive \/ negative example, how much will MCC increase?\n\n- To get 0.750, how many more data must I classify correctly?\n\nEven though we may not answer the above questions perfectly, in this problem, we may have a way to approximate them.\n\n## Goal of the kernel\nTo demythify some aspects of MCC, and understand impact of 'one more correct' positive and negative example to your current MCC score, so that you can better design a stretegic improvement on performance. Note that this is not a programming based kernel. But there is a small code in the end for illustration on MCC calculation.","77024e25":"# And now it's done\nNow we can answer the question we posted in the beginnning easily. First of all, let us check whether our four numbers will produce MCC score similar to the original one (0.694)","e2e75717":"## How can we calculate these four values?\nAccording to basic algebra, if we could get four equations, we can solve for all four variables (regarding public test data which is 57% of the total test data). And actually, we know of two trivially :\n\n$$TP + TN + FP + FN = \\text{Number of your test data} = 20337 * 0.57 = 11592 $$, and\n\n$$TP + FP = \\text{Number of your predicted positive examples} =673*0.57 \\approx 384 $$\n\nNote that in the second equation, I put the predicted number of positive examples of my models which is 673 (you can check your number easily at the summation of 1 in your submission.csv)\n\nFurther, note also that other similar relations such as $$ TN + FN = \\text{Number of your predicted negative examples}  $$ cannot be used, since it can be derived from the above two equations. In other words, we need two more *linear independent* equations.\n\nAnd where we need some hacks. Firstly, according to the post by Putalay and Sergey ( https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/vsb-power-line-fault-detection\/discussion\/82868 ), we can roughly probe **the ratio of the positive test data**, i.e. \n\n$$\\frac{TP+FN}{TP+FP+FN+TN } = \\frac{TP+FN}{11592}$$\n\nHere, according to Putalay's method, I test with the test data number 17511 and get the score 0.06. That's mean this example is indeed positive (faulty signal), and its implies that the ratio of positive data is around 2.3%. So our third equations is : \n\n$$\\frac{TP+FN}{11592} = 0.023 \\Rightarrow TP+FN = 0.023*11592 \\approx 267  $$\n\nSo far so good, now we have 3 linerly independent equations, we need just one more equation in order to decode for the four values. In fact, the fourth equation is the MCC equation itself where you can put the MCC you get from submission : \n\n\\begin{equation*} \\label{MCC}\n\\frac{ \\mathit{TP} \\times \\mathit{TN} - \\mathit{FP} \\times \\mathit{FN} } {\\sqrt{ (\\mathit{TP} + \\mathit{FP}) ( \\mathit{TP} + \\mathit{FN} ) ( \\mathit{TN} + \\mathit{FP} ) ( \\mathit{TN} + \\mathit{FN} ) } } = 0.694\n\\end{equation*}\n\nTheoretically, it's done. We can use all 4 linearly independent equations to solve for all the values of *TP, FP, TN and FN*. However, since the last equation (MCC) is non-linear, so it can be difficult in practice to solve it together with the first 3 equations. To simplify our process, we have to make some assumptions which may not 100% correct, but is sensible. Our assumption is based on the fact that we have abundant negative examples, and our model has no problem to accurately predict the negative ones at all. Hence, most of the time, our model will have $FN \\approx 0$ (which I found out to be quite correct, see verification code below). By using this assumption together with all information we have from the 3 equations we get:\n\n\\begin{equation*} \n\\frac{ \\mathit{TP} \\times \\mathit{(11592-384)} - \\mathit{FP} \\times \\mathit{0} } {\\sqrt{ (384) ( 267 ) ( 11592-384 ) ( 11592-267 ) } } = 0.694\n\\end{equation*}\n\nHence, we can now solve for *TP*, and can then in turn solve for other values!\n","8e8548ee":" ### To get 0.750, how many more data must I classify correctly?\n We can answer this question by just play around our mcc calculation","5d5793e5":"So you need to correct more 28 positive data, or around 9 if you group 3 phases togehter.
