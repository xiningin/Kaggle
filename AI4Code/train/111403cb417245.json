These include the passenger safety cell with a crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium carmakers. Mercedes-Benz is the leader in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.\n\nTo ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, the company\u2019s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Mercedes-Benz\u2019s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.\n\nYou are required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Others will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benz\u2019s standards.\n\nFollowing actions should be performed:\n\nIf for any column(s), the variance is equal to zero, then you need to remove those variable(s).\nCheck for null and unique values for test and train sets.\nApply label encoder.\nPerform dimensionality reduction.\nPredict your test_df values using XGBoost.","4387a0bb":"### Load training and testing data and look at the number of rows and colums for the same ","f191d8f6":"Looking at the above we have the following:- \n369 integer variables. \n8 object (likely a string) variables\n1 target variable\n\nLet us look at the cardinality of our features?","c5c36fc7":"### Inference from the graphs:\n##### 1) Since there is a need to reduce the testing time, the best values in the variables at which this time is minimal are az and bc (X0), y (X1), n (X2), x and h (X5) (hypothesis: on y?)\n\n##### 2) Variables X3, X5, X6, X8 have similar distributions of values, where there are no special differences within the feature between values in the context of means and quartiles\n\n##### 3) X0 and X2 have the greatest variety within variables, which can potentially indicate a greater usefulness of these features","4c962523":"## XGBoost Starter","f1e01531":"## Feature Analysis","6f8d5af2":"We have a set of numeric variables, where the value is set to 1 or 0, so there is no need to carry out volumetric analysis.
