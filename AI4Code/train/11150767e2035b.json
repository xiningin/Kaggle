What makes it even more unwieldy is that Pandas tends to take quite a few liberties with how it uses memory when processing data, seemingly making lots of copies of stuff in RAM during various intermediate states of doing what you ask. This is problematic because the training dataset is around 5 GB, and we only get 16GB of memory. So the training dataset would only possibly fit into memory at most 3 times. And apparently Pandas tries for more than 3, since my notebooks constantly run out of RAM **and restart, losing any intermediate state** when I try to perform some calculation on the whole training dataset. Most of the things I'm trying to do ought to be O(N) time-wise and O(N) or constant space-wise, but again, Pandas seems to have other ideas.\n\nAnyway, the solution is to **split the dataset into mostly-independent chunks**. And because most of the calculation and feature engineering I do is on a per-user basis (and I imagine this is true for most  features you might want to engineer for this dataset), it makes sense to split it up such that **each chunk contains all the data  for some subset of users**.\n\nThis way, I can perform my calculations independently on each chunk, Pandas will create its temporary overhead on just a small fraction of the data, and I can then manually aggregate the per-chunk results however I need to. *(in a way, I'm manually replicating a lot of how Dask does things, except Dask can't split on anything but an index... and can't have multi-index... and makes some assumptions about groupby)*","dd86bd4c":"Now we can extract the relevant fields from this multi-index series (it's a bit finicky but doable) and the actual regression takes no time at all:","116ee81a":"# Find \"break points\"\n\nI semi-arbitrarily decided I want roughly 500000 rows per chunk - this makes for about 200 chunks.\n\nFor each \"break point\" (multiple of 500000), I find the user whose `total_rows` is closest to that break point. \nAll users between this user and the previous \"break point\" user go into the current chunk.\n\n(and don't forget the last chunk - all users after the last break point)","44d23ed6":"# Load the training data","22421f66":"Well, I mean... it's better than random?..","45c9c06f":"Some sample results of the regresssion:","9a1aee97":"# Calculate per-user running total of rows\n\nI sort the user ids in ascending order, so that I can select a range of users with `<` and `>=`\n\nI then get the cumulative number of training data rows for all users so far.","b8859c50":"Now I want to do logistic rergression to predict the `answered_correctly` column, using the `encounters` column as input.\n\nThe simpler way to do this would be to pull out the relevant columns from each chunk and then stick them together them using `np.concatenate`, e.g. `all_encounters = np.concatenate([df['encounters'] for df in df_split])`. \n\nBut in this case, the logistic regression actually runs out of memory! Also it's actually needlessly slow, since what we really have is lots of copies of the same few combinations of `answered_correctly` and `encounters` (there are only so many combinations possible!)\n\nSo instead, I count the number of occurrences of each combination; and then use those counts as weights for the regression.","69661bb6":"# Example use case\n\nThis example is based loosely on the idea of Learning Factor Analysis: that students get better at a skill as they practice it, and that this learning curve follows a specific power curve. See [this notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/yanamal\/learning-factor-analysis-are-tags-skills) for details if you're interested.\n\nFor simplicity, in this example I'll just pretend that \"answering all kinds of TOEIC questions\" is a learnable skill. This is not particularly true in practice, but this is just an illustration of how I might deal with the split-out dataframes."}}
