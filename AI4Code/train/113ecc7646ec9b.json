You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.\n\nPart of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.\n\nIt is a sample of binary classifier, and you can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to prescribe it to a new patient.","b87d2539":"Droping the unknown values","28df6fc8":"## Checking for accuracy score","14909133":"## Checking wether the dimensions of y_test,x_test are same or not.
