How this is done is described in the code comments below:","63a545d9":"# Financial Distress Prediction - Forward Chaining\n\nContrary to Cross-Sectional Data, Longitudinal Data has a time-component that implicitly orders each row. Therefore, it is not a good idea to use K-Fold cross validation to test model performance. The right approach is to use [Forward Chaining](https:\/\/robjhyndman.com\/hyndsight\/tscv\/).\n\nPython's scikit-learn module has a [TimeSeriesSplit](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html) function that can help run Forward Chaining. However, the function makes an assumption that the entire DataFrame is to be treated as one entity. Whereas, it is possible that the entire DataFrame actually be composed of groups of data (row-wise) each of which group should be treated to Forward Chaining separately. The Financial Distress Prediction Data Set is exactly this type of a data set.\n\nLet me demonstrate what I mean:","9de161cb":"## Modeling\n\nNow that we have our lagged features as well as the indexes ready for Forward Chaining, we can proceed with modeling.\n\nHowever, one decision that we will need to take is whether we want to treat this as a classification problem or a regression problem. The 'Financial Distress' column is real-valued, containing both positive and negative values. As per the Data Dictionary, we should consider the company financially distressed if the 'Financial Distress' column is <= -0.50. Accordingly, we will convert this problem into a classification problem by using that definition.","3fa39327":"## Creating Lagged Features:\n\nWith the above pre-processing step out of the way, we will now move on to the 2nd piece of Feature Engineering - Creating lagged features (again, lagged features per group):","99060d90":"## Challenges with straightforward Time Series Split:\n\nAs can be seen based on the above code output, although we have 1 common time variable (Time), because we have multiple companies we may have multiple rows belonging to the same Time value (For example, 1 row for Time 1 + Company 1, another row for Time 1 + Company 2 etc).\n\nThis prevents us from using sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit, as the assumption of that function is that each row represents a data point from a unique instance of time (and the rows are arranged as per increasing value of time).\n\nWe can still achieve our goal of implementing Forward Chaining by:\n1. Split the Data Set into multiple groups - 1 group per Company\n2. For each group, derive the indexes for Forward Chaining\n3. Combine the list of indexes per group into 1 final index list\n\n## Dealing with Dummy Data:\n\nAs mentioned in the Data Dictionary, one of the features is actually a categorical feature. We will therefore create Dummy Columns:","f51598d3":"## Conclusion\n\nThe aim of this notebook was to show that forward chaining may not always be as straight forward as using TimeSeriesSplit function from sklearn. It is important to understand the structure of the data, and design the cross validation approach appropriately.\n\nOf course, I did gloss over a lot of other aspects in this kernel. We should have also focused on the following:\n1. **Dealing with imbalanced data:** Handling skewed data involves some flavor of undersampling of majority class + oversampling of minority class. We skipped over that here, but doing that is crucial in getting a good classifier. I plan on doing that as a later revision to this notebook.\n2. **Nested Validation to choose hyper parameters (like C value in Logistic Regression):** In practice, we would use nested cross validation to also determine the hyper parameters that we have hard coded here.","fbb01d39":"## Time Series Splits per group\n\nNext, we will write a helper function to create time series splits for forward chaining. The function will return a list of tuples. Each tuple will contain 2 values - The train index and the test index.\n\nHere is how the return value will look like:\n\n    > [(Int64Index([10, 11, 12], dtype='int64'), (Int64Index[13, 14], dtype='int64')), # For 1st iteration, train on row-index 10-12. test on row-index 13 and 14\n    > (Int64Index([10, 11, 12, 13, 14), Int64Index([15, 16])),                         # For 2nd iteration, train on row-index 10-14. test on row-index 15 and 16\n    > (Int64Index([10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]), Int64Index([17, 18]))]                # For 3rd iteration, train on row-index 10-16. test on row-index 17 and 18"}}
