Here I put a simple example (to extract only 6 features) ","1f3b2c62":"### Intro\n\nLooking through the kernels in the competition I noticed most of the kernels were using an iterative way to calculate features. So I'm sharing a template for vectorizing the feature extraction to improve the performance. Hope it would be useful for you. ","272b4061":"we use *prep_df_for_separation* function we defined earlier to prepare our train data frame and then separate x and y and process them separately. \n\nFor y, in this case we know the time_to_failure is reducing during each 150,000 section, so we can simply use min function to get the desired value (notice we used axis= 0) ","b58f8cb5":"Finally we can calculate features. You can compare its process time with the iterative method above and consider this is only for 6 features and if you would incrase the number of features, the difference woud be much more significant. ","0555ad50":"### Conclusion\nSome of the features are a bit harder to calculate using this method. Moving averag for instance, is possible but requires forming a larger matrix which consumes memory. I'd add more feature ideas later on if requested. "}}
