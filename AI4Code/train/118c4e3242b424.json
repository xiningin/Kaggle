Image augmentation has been shown to aid in perfomance of training however we have to be careful to not augment the image too much from its original form. With the augmentation we are trying to create new data each time to the image is passed over to create the invariance. We do not apply augmentation to the validation set as this is the image we want to test the accuracy on.","61196167":"Replace labels with string, and split the training data into 90% training and 10% validation and create a seperate dataframe for each and then count number in each.\nBatch size to be based through the image generators will be 32 at a time, this is an arbitory number and is a hyper parameter we can play with.","53368c49":"# Virtualize Training","06a37136":"# Example of generator\n\nIn this section we will look at an example of the image generator and how the image augmentation works. We input the image and thus get out 15 fairly different images. Hence this is wha the model will see if we train it on 15 epochs where 1 epoch it goes through the data once. We can therefor manually increase the dataset size by specifiying a batch size less than the number of examples and having the steps per epoch higher than is required to go through one epoch. Hence if we set the steps per epoch to be twice the size of length of training set \/\/ batch size, in one epoch the training set will be run through twice with a different image augmentation used for each image. The system never stores the image it flows the image from the location through the augmentation and then the model, so its a computationally efficent process. Making it far easier than hand creating new data.","5647ecb7":"From our data we have 12000 cats and 12000 dogs","3d217992":"# Prepare data","92c68304":"We will be using the Inception ResNet V2 pretrained model\n\nWe will initialise the model for an image shape of 256,256 with 3 channels and initialise the weights based of its weights for the imagenet challege.\n","5c4eeb83":"The notebook will take you through the use of transfer learning to obtain a validation accuracy of 0.99 +.

We then add drop out layer before narrowing the model to 10 neurons before the final neuron where we pass a single neuron with a sigmoid function that helps classify the problem.\n\nThe number of neurons we added is a randomly chosen number and can be seen as a hyperparameter we can chose to explore later along with dropout rate. \n\nWe never want to intentially create bottlenecks in data only when we want to reduce the dimensionallity of the data.","060bf7b9":"# Save Model","fe57bc20":"### See total amount of each in the training data, the data is nicely balanced so there is no inherent bias in the model","8d9ffc4f":"lets look at a random example of an image, if you run this code a number of times you will see that the images vary in size a lot something that will be dealt with later on","acbf7918":"# Prepare Data"}}
