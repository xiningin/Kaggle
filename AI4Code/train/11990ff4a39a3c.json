Speedml achieves this with nearly 70% fewer lines of code!\n\n### Run and download the [Titanic Solution using Speedml](https:\/\/github.com\/Speedml\/notebooks\/blob\/master\/titanic\/titanic-solution-using-speedml.ipynb).\n\n---\n\nThis notebook is a companion to the book [Data Science Solutions](https:\/\/startupsci.com). The notebook walks us through a typical workflow for solving data science competitions at sites like Kaggle.\n\nThere are several excellent notebooks to study data science competition entries. However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\n\n## Workflow stages\n\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\n\n1. Question or problem definition.\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\n7. Supply or submit the results.\n\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\n\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\n\n\n## Question and problem definition\n\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic).\n\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\n\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\n\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\n## Workflow goals\n\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\n\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https:\/\/en.wikiversity.org\/wiki\/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\n\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\n\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.","17973285":"In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features) in a learning problem.

Six in case of test dataset.\n- Five features are strings (object).","7b39cd4b":"### Correlating categorical features\n\nNow we can correlate categorical features with our solution goal.\n\n**Observations.**\n\n- Female passengers had much better survival rate than males. Confirms classifying (#1).\n- Exception in Embarked=C where males had higher survival rate. This could be a correlation between Pclass and Embarked and in turn Pclass and Survived, not necessarily direct correlation between Embarked and Survived.\n- Males had better survival rate in Pclass=3 when compared with Pclass=2 for C and Q ports. Completing (#2).\n- Ports of embarkation have varying survival rates for Pclass=3 and among male passengers.

Logistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable (feature) and one or more independent variables (features) by estimating probabilities using a logistic function, which is the cumulative logistic distribution.

Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.

For example: Master title has Age mean of 5 years.\n- Survival among Title Age bands varies slightly.\n- Certain titles mostly survived (Mme, Lady, Sir) or did not (Don, Rev, Jonkheer).\n\n**Decision.**\n\n- We decide to retain the new Title feature for model training.","dc33bc5f":"## References\n\nThis notebook has been created based on great work done solving the Titanic competition and other sources.\n\n- [A journey through Titanic](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/omarelgabry\/titanic\/a-journey-through-titanic)\n- [Getting Started with Pandas: Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\/details\/getting-started-with-random-forests)\n- [Titanic Best Working Classifier](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sinakhorami\/titanic\/titanic-best-working-classifier)","36068eca":"D3 Tree visualisation - from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/bhavesh09\/titanic-decision-tree-visual-with-d3-js","7f6370a8":"Let us drop Parch, SibSp, and FamilySize features in favor of IsAlone.","9b4a9f98":"Now we iterate over Sex (0 or 1) and Pclass (1, 2, 3) to calculate guessed values of Age for the six combinations.","feb11b75":"We can create another feature called IsAlone.","d1756c69":"Next we model using Support Vector Machines which are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.

A sample is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the sample being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.

A simple way is to generate random numbers between mean and [standard deviation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Standard_deviation).\n\n2. More accurate way of guessing missing values is to use other correlated features. In our case we note correlation among Age, Gender, and Pclass. Guess Age values using [median](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Median) values for Age across sets of Pclass and Gender feature combinations. So, median Age for Pclass=1 and Gender=0, Pclass=1 and Gender=1, and so on...\n\n3. Combine methods 1 and 2.

We may validate these assumptions further before taking appropriate actions.\n\n**Correlating.**\n\nWe want to know how well does each feature correlate with Survival. We want to do this early in our project and match these quick correlations with modelled correlations later in the project.\n\n**Completing.**\n\n1. We may want to complete Age feature as it is definitely correlated to survival.\n2. We may want to complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.\n\n**Correcting.**\n\n1. Ticket feature may be dropped from our analysis as it contains high ratio of duplicates (22%) and there may not be a correlation between Ticket and survival.\n2. Cabin feature may be dropped as it is highly incomplete or contains many null values both in training and test dataset.\n3. PassengerId may be dropped from training dataset as it does not contribute to survival.\n4. Name feature is relatively non-standard, may not contribute directly to survival, so maybe dropped.\n\n**Creating.**\n\n1. We may want to create a new feature called Family based on Parch and SibSp to get total count of family members on board.\n2. We may want to engineer the Name feature to extract Title as a new feature.\n3. We may want to create new feature for Age bands. This turns a continous numerical feature into an ordinal categorical feature.\n4. We may also want to create a Fare range feature if it helps our analysis.\n\n**Classifying.**\n\nWe may also add to our assumptions based on the problem description noted earlier.\n\n1.
