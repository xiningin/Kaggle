A brief overview drawn from [Machine Learning Plus](https:\/\/www.machinelearningplus.com\/nlp\/cosine-similarity\/):\n\n> Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. \nMathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. In this context, the two vectors I am talking about are arrays containing the word counts of two documents. \n\n>When plotted on a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a word in the document, the cosine similarity captures the orientation (the angle) of the documents and not the magnitude. If you want the magnitude, compute the Euclidean distance instead. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance because of the size (like, the word \u2018cricket\u2019 appeared 50 times in one document and 10 times in another) they could still have a smaller angle between them. Smaller the angle, higher the similarity.","16e630db":"### Missing Values\nLet's check for missing values, since they could be problematic when it comes to creating more keywords for overview.","a2336a1b":"Now we have several features with lists of keywords that are all lowercase and stripped of spaces, therefore making them unique keywords. ","44183482":"# Remarks\n\nIn the future, I might join this project with the larger movies dataset on Kaggle. That way I can use release date as a keyword as well. Along that vein, I could add a function that limits release date to x number of years forward and backward when recommending the movie.\n\nIt'd also be good to explore if I can weight the director keyword more than other keywords.\n\nThank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed.","21b4c592":"## Creating Model\n\nWe will use CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convet the keywords into a matrix of token counts, producing the frequency of each word.","7235b856":"# Content-Based Movie Recommendation Engine","59d2adf2":"### Cleaning Features","aad97520":"## Data Preprocessing\n### Loading Data","91392249":"What movie should I watch next?
