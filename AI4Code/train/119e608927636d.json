If you are not using Pipelines, you are probably doing it wrong'** when using sklearn.\n\nPipelining is an efficient, clean, and highly modifiable way of building Machine Learning Models. You can simply stick together multiple steps and **evaluate each step and its parameters** during cross-validation. Not only can you do Preprocessing and Feature Engineering in these pipelines, but you can even switch between different model types. \n\nPipelining enforces us to treat each Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering step as a submodel of our final machine learning ensemble. According to [T. Scott Clendaniel](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tscottclendaniel\/), understanding machine learning models this way is one key-mindset of Data Preprocessing, as mentioned in [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vsKNxbP8R_8&t=1630s) about advanced Feature Engineering. It allows us to evaluate each Feature Engineering, Feature Selection and Model Selection step individually.\n\n\nTake a look at my [Comprehensive Tutorial: Feature Engineering](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/milankalkenings\/comprehensive-tutorial-feature-engineering), if you want to practice your pipelining skills.","fe259635":"***\n# Sections\n\n## [1.

Combine all Pre Processing Pipelines\nFeatureUnion combines several transformers and concatenates the outputs of each pipe. ","f070b228":"<a id=\"sec0\"><\/a>\n***\n# 1. What is a Pipeline?\n\n\n\n\n**A Pipeline consists of two different sklearn objects:**\n### Transformers\nTransformers perform any transformation on any given data. \nThe correct usage of the methods **fit()** and **transform()** ensure, that the test data is transformed using the parameters, which were calculated on train. All transformers in our Pipeline have to implement both, **fit** and **transform**.\n* **fit()** calculates the parameters for the transformation and stores them. We only want to perform this on training data.\n* **transform()** transforms any given data using the parameters, calculated in **fit()**\n* **fit_transform()** performs the transform method after the fit method and thus should only be used on **training data**, since otherwise, **fit()** would train the parameters of the transformer on test.\n\n\n### Final Estimator\nThe last element of your Pipeline can be an **Estimator**, and thus only has to implement the **fit** method. E.g. we can use a random forest classifier. It wouldn't transform the data, but it would solely fit some parameters on the given data. The whole pipeline will act like the chosen estimator and thus it can call the respective estimator methods like **predict()**, **predict_proba()**, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Pipelines, we can easily switch between different Preprocessing, Feature Engineering methods and Machine Learning Models during **Gridsearch cross-validation**. The following sketch assumes, that we treat all numerical variables and all categorical variables equivalently. As we can see, the sketched Pipeline allows us to switch between two Encoding approaches for categorical data and it even allows us to switch between two different types of models.","92e6cf2d":"It seems like male patients are more likely to get false predictions, since they are slightly overrepresented in the set of incorrect predictions. \n\nI wouldn't overrate this result, since the number of false predictions (and the dataset in general) is pretty small.","3180d3ad":"<a id=\"sec21\"><\/a>\n# 3.1.
