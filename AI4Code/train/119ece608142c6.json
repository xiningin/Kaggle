One possible explanation could be connected with the inaccurate definition of course types, since *'Other'* does not provide much valuable information about course specification as well as *'Special English'*.","0d94bc73":"From the figure we can conclude, the majority of students from Italy come to Malta at the age of 17 and below (around 74 % of all Italian students). This fact is quite interesting since this tendency cannot be observed for age grouping for other countries, where such a significant age gap is absent. Generally speaking, we can see only one common feature, the biggest age group from all countries is students of 15 years old and under.","592a1505":"## Gender distribution of foreign students from Italy in 2017-2018","63f4f4c1":"The figure shows, the decrease in numbers was approximately the same both for male and female students.

Screen Malta for national statistical office which publishes annually statistical data on English language students undertaking English language courses in Malta.\n2. Use the data published in 2019 and prepare a short analysis.\n3. Focus on analysis of data on Italy (as a country sending the highest number of English language students).","43664411":"The figure above suggests, that there is a correlation between a total number of weeks a student spends learning English in Malta and his\/her age. Generally speaking, the majority of students coming to Malta are 25 years old and younger, there are about 75%, on average. If we concentrate on Italy, this tendency is the most perceptible, as we saw before the number of students coming to Malta by country and their age grouping."}}
