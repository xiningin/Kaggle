Are these extra add-ons really worth the price increase?","83209f06":"### Who doesn't love a little holiday getaway? Nobody that's who!\n\nLet's take a look at the hotel bookings of some holidaymakers and try to understand their accommodation requirements for maximum relaxation.","85022d90":"There are some null values in the *company*, *agent*, *country* and *children* columns. Luckily null values in these columns are rather intuitive:\n\n* if there is no *company*, the booking could most likely have been made privately, and so these null values can be changed to 0\n* if there is no *agent*, the booking could most likely have been made without an agent, and so these null values can be changed to 0\n* if the *country* is a null value, we can just list it as unknown\n* if there are null values of *children*, the number of children can be assumed 0\n\n(alternatively the company and agent columns could have been dropped, rows with null country values could have been dropped and\/or null values of children could be replaced with another number\/mean)","cb7adc64":"The number of special requests ranges from 0 to 5, with about half being 0. The number of car parking spaces requests ranges from 0 to 8, with majority of them being 0.","59fabd90":"So there really are bookings of just children and even babies without an adult. Rather than being on their own, at least the babies have a child to supervise them...\n\nBut who are these guests doing the bookings?","b3842350":"And now for the categorical features:","7301c0a2":"The average daily rate is equal to the average price for each hotel room sold for that day. The average daily rate fluctuates more for resort hotels than city hotels with standard deviations of \u20ac61 and \u20ac39 respectively. This is especially evident during the summer months (June, July, August and September) with prices ranging from \u20ac93 to \u20ac186. The winter months (December, January, February and March) have generally lower prices ranging from \u20ac69 to \u20ac57, except that there is a little peak in December which is probably due to Christmas and New Years. Even with the seasonal prices, it is the city hotels that maintain a higher price with a higher mean and median throughout the year.","7434d385":"Almost three quarters of the bookings at the City Hotel were canceled, while only less than half were canceled at the Resort Hotel. Maybe guests are more prone to cancelling their booking if they don't have to pay a deposit?","4f71bdb6":"So how early are guests booking their hotels?","89ea3dc5":"Let's look at the numeric features:","282b1cc9":"The good news is that out of the 44199 cancelled bookings, this current cancelled booking was 38259 (86.5%) guests' first cancellation so the guests aren't willy nilly booking and cancelling for the sake of it. There are 5700+ (12.9%) guests who have cancelled one prior booking, which I wouldn't consider as bad behaviour just yet. But now the bad news is that the remaining 0.6% of guests seem to have a bad habit of cancelling bookings even up to 26 times! Do these guests seriously consider their bookings or it is just a spur of the moment?","a115ed57":"There are a couple undefined values in the *market_segment* and *distribution_channel* columns which are acceptable. But the undefined values in the *meal* column should be lumped into the SC category (meaning no meal package):","48d4ab9a":"Almost a third of the bookings are for city hotels, but these include bookings that were both canceled and not canceled which leads to the next graph:","ca2ba8b1":"### Still thinking about going for a holiday? Well consider these next time you plan for your trip:\n* Almost a third of the total guests opt for a city hotel instead of a resort hotel.\n* If your preferred hotel is \"sold out\", don't fret because some of the guests are definitely going to cancel their booking especially if there was no deposit required. \n* If you are going to cancel your booking, it doens't matter if you're a first time guest or a repeated guest, and you don't have to feel bad because remember there are some guests out there who cancelled 26 times sometimes within the day or even after 2 months!\n* Your fellow holidaymakers would more likely comprise of a couple, or just a small family of up to 2 children and\/or 1 baby.\n* Summer months are more expensive for resort hotels while the prices for city hotels don't really flunctuate throughout the year.\n* To get the most bang for your buck you should book at least 175 days in advance, make the booking directly with the hotel and also join any loyalty programme.\n\nHave fun now!","dfec54cc":"Majority of the guests booked the hotels through both online and offline travel agents and tour operators (i.e. *Online TA, Offline TA\/TO, TA\/TO*) as opposed to *Direct* bookings themselves and *Corporate* bookings. It may be wise to direct marketing strategies to these travel agents and tour operators, especially agent 9, 0 and 240.\n\nLet's see what else the guests are requesting:","1349bc23":"Most guests book their hotel the day of arriving, and this number continues to decrease to a maximum of 737 days.

So most of the guests are local tourists, followed by the British, French and Spanish.","32b5def2":"And an even better deal if they are repeated guests regardless of whether they book a city or resort hotel! Perhaps it is time to join the hotel loyalty programme..","bd5bc309":"Majority of the adults are pairs, but this can go up to a huge party of 55. Almost all of the guests holiday without any children or babies, and those that do don't have too huge a preference in terms of a resort or a city hotel, perhaps just a slight lean towards a city hotel.\n\nHang on now, I'm still curious about the bookings made for children and\/or babies without any adult:","628e2ded":"Almost 30,000 of the 44,000+ cancelled bookings (67%) were cancelled because *No Deposit* was made thus the guest was not going to lose any money from the cancellation. On the other hand, even when a deposit valuing the total stay cost was made (i.e. *Non Refund*), a third of the guests still cancelled their booking - they must have had a rather important reason to lose their booking and therefore their money or maybe they're just a little bit dodgy."}}
