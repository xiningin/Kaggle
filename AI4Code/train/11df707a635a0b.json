This dataset is analyzing the evolution of gross and net (after taxes) income in Romania, between 1991 and 2020 (present). The data source is the Romanian Statistic Institute. The data is provided monthly.\n\n\nThere are few technical informations that need to be specified.\n\nStarting with 1990, post-communist economy depression, failing international markets for post-communist countries and internal political turmoil, correlated with rampant corruption in privatization of public sector resulted in an increasingly devaluation of the national currency `Leu` (`ROL`), or in other words, an aggresive inflation. In 2005, a revaluation of the national currency by Romanian National Bank equated 1 `ROL` to 10,000 `new Romanian Leu` or `RON`.\n\nTaxation as well shows an evolution with some landmarks we need to detail here.\n\nUntil 2005, taxation was progressive. The state could hardly collect the taxes and unique solution they could imagine was to increase the taxes.\n\nFrom 2005, there is a flat income taxation of 16%. It applied to the gross revenue, but besides the income taxes, other taxes, applied to the gross revenue (National Health Insurrance, Retirement National Plan) as well as to the net revenue. Totally, there were 7-8 taxes applied to the gross income (partially directly, partially through net income, the actuall total tax amounting to ~45-50% in average). Therefore, between 2005 and 2010 we can see a tac of ~23.5% to 27.5% (increasing) - this is the part of the total tax deducted from the gross earnings. From 2010 to 2018, tax percent is allmost unchanged.\n\nIn 2018, a new fiscal reform was passed and from then, all taxes applied to gross income and the average tax decreased from a total of ~45% from the gross earnings to 40% from gross earnings).\n\n","af1999fe":"Let's also check the distributions of values in the resulted data frame.","0123659a":"We change the columns names for `Earnings` to `Net` and `Gross` in the two datasets, before merging them on `Year` and `Month`."}}
