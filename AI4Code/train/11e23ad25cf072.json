An estimated 10 million people visit each year, drawn by winter sports, a warm summer climate and duty-free goods.https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-17028050#:~:text=The%20tiny%20principality%20of%20Andorra,for%20about%2080%25%20of%20GDP.","f74c5512":"#Why is Andorra rich? By Steve Morris\n\nAndorra has one of the longest life expectancies in the world (somewhere in the top 4, depending on which source you believe). It's also the 23rd richest country in the world, measured by per capita income \u2013 ahead of countries like Germany, France and the UK.\n\nFirstly, note that Andorra is one of the smallest countries in the world with almost no usable land and no natural resources of any kind. It\u2019s just mountains. It doesn\u2019t have enough agricultural land to feed its tiny population of just 86,000. It doesn\u2019t even have an airport.\n\nYou might have thought that a lack of resources would be a problem, but no. By contrast with the Central African Republic with its diamonds, Niger with its reserves of oil, gold and uranium, and Afghanistan, which grows almost the entire world\u2019s heroin crop, and which are three of the world\u2019s poorest countries, Andorra has nothing that it can dig up, chop down or otherwise exploit. So lesson number one is that wealth isn\u2019t something that nature provides. It\u2019s something that people create for themselves, literally out of thin air.\n\nAndorra knows that it can\u2019t grow its own food, generate its own electricity or defend its own borders from attack. So it doesn\u2019t try to do any of those things. Instead it focuses on creating the wealth it needs to pay for everything it lacks.\n\nAndorra imposes few restrictions on immigration. That\u2019s why the vast majority of the population are not Andorran citizens. Do these immigrants cause unemployment? No. Andorra has virtually no unemployment (0 per cent until the global financial crisis hit in 2008). Yes \u2013 zero percent.\n\nBecause the country needs to import so many goods, it imposes no import\/export duties. It also imposes little or no taxes on its population and businesses, so people can just get on with working and creating employment. The population grew from 10,000 in the 1960s to 80,000 today \u2013 not through a high birth rate, but by creating jobs and allowing people to come and work in the country.https:\/\/blogbloggerbloggest.com\/2013\/08\/29\/why-is-andorra-rich","db2e7091":"#Andorra says it does not have any more cases of coronavirus\n\nSince the first infection in the country, in March, there have been a total of 855 cases and 52 deaths, and since June 18 there has been no contagion.\n\nThe Andorran government confirmed on Thursday that there are no more patients with coronavirus in the country after four months of the pandemic outbreak.\n\nAndorra's Minister of Health, Joan Mart\u00ednez Benazet, confirmed this data after the results of the latest PCR \/ TMA tests performed on the last infected patient confirmed that person's recovery, as reported by the Andorra News Agency on Thursday.
