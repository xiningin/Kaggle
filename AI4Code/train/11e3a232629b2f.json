A widespread best practice to deal \nwith such data is to do feature-wise normalization: for each feature in the input data (a column in the input data matrix), we \nwill subtract the mean of the feature and divide by the standard deviation, so that the feature will be centered around 0 and will have a \nunit standard deviation. This is easily done in Numpy:","4a239b99":"\nNote that the quantities that we use for normalizing the test data have been computed using the training data.

A common regression metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n* When features in the input data have values in different ranges, each feature should be scaled independently as a preprocessing step.\n* When there is little data available, using K-Fold validation is a great way to reliably evaluate a model.\n* When little training data is available, it is preferable to use a small network with very few hidden layers (typically only one or two), \nin order to avoid severe overfitting.\n\nThis example concludes our series of three introductory practical examples. You are now able to handle common types of problems with vector data input:\n\n* Binary (2-class) classification.\n* Multi-class, single-label classification.\n* Scalar regression.\n\nIn the next chapter, you will acquire a more formal understanding of some of the concepts you have encountered in these first examples, \nsuch as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and overfitting.","4f4438bd":"# Predicting house prices: a regression example\n\nThis notebook contains the code samples found in Chapter 3, Section 6 of [Deep Learning with Python](https:\/\/www.manning.com\/books\/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff). Note that the original text features far more content, in particular further explanations and figures: in this notebook, you will only find source code and related comments.\n\n----\n\n\nIn our two previous examples, we were considering classification problems, where the goal was to predict a single discrete label of an \ninput data point. Another common type of machine learning problem is \"regression\", which consists of predicting a continuous value instead \nof a discrete label. For instance, predicting the temperature tomorrow, given meteorological data, or predicting the time that a \nsoftware project will take to complete, given its specifications.\n\nDo not mix up \"regression\" with the algorithm \"logistic regression\": confusingly, \"logistic regression\" is not a regression algorithm, \nit is a classification algorithm.","d463ea49":"We are still off by about \\$2,550.","2a02b9f0":"#<font color='red'>Question 2<\/font>\n## Building our network\n\n\nBecause so few samples are available, we will be using a very small network with two \nhidden layers, each with 64 units. In general, the less training data you have, the worse overfitting will be, and using \na small network is one way to mitigate overfitting.","f8895009":"\nOur network ends with a single unit, and no activation (i.e. it will be linear layer). \nThis is a typical setup for scalar regression (i.e. regression where we are trying to predict a single continuous value). \nApplying an activation function would constrain the range that the output can take; for instance if \nwe applied a `sigmoid` activation function to our last layer, the network could only learn to predict values between 0 and 1. Here, because \nthe last layer is purely linear, the network is free to learn to predict values in any range.\n\nNote that we are compiling the network with the `mse` loss function -- Mean Squared Error, the square of the difference between the \npredictions and the targets, a widely used loss function for regression problems.\n\nWe are also monitoring a new metric during training: `mae`. This stands for Mean Absolute Error. It is simply the absolute value of the \ndifference between the predictions and the targets. For instance, a MAE of 0.5 on this problem would mean that our predictions are off by \n\\$500 on average.","052cd632":"Let's plot this:","244aca69":"#<font color='red'>Study Well!<\/font>\n## Validating our approach using K-fold validation\n\n\nTo evaluate our network while we keep adjusting its parameters (such as the number of epochs used for training), we could simply split the \ndata into a training set and a validation set, as we were doing in our previous examples. However, because we have so few data points, the \nvalidation set would end up being very small (e.g. about 100 examples). A consequence is that our validation scores may change a lot \ndepending on _which_ data points we choose to use for validation and which we choose for training, i.e. the validation scores may have a \nhigh _variance_ with regard to the validation split. This would prevent us from reliably evaluating our model.\n\nThe best practice in such situations is to use K-fold cross-validation. It consists of splitting the available data into K partitions \n(typically K=4 or 5), then instantiating K identical models, and training each one on K-1 partitions while evaluating on the remaining \npartition. The validation score for the model used would then be the average of the K validation scores obtained.","1e18d879":"## The Boston Housing Price dataset\n\n\nWe will be attempting to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given a few data points about the \nsuburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, etc.\n\nThe dataset we will be using has another interesting difference from our two previous examples: it has very few data points, only 506 in \ntotal, split between 404 training samples and 102 test samples, and each \"feature\" in the input data (e.g. the crime rate is a feature) has \na different scale.
