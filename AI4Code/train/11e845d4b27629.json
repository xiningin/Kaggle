The First one is Metadata which is everything that can not be freely chosen by the subject, the other one is self_reflection which cosists of the self estimation of the subject. The Reason for this spilt is that certain Educational Sectors,Ages and Genders have a different probablility to be Entrepreneurial than others. I will use a Naive Bayes Net to Calculate the Probabiltiy of the subject being Entrepreneurial based on their Meta_Data.\n\nAfter doing that i will Create a RandomizedSearchCV to find the best Prams for the Tree and then use cross_val_score to score the Forest.","95701463":"**Conclusion**:\nWe can see that the fluctuation of the Accuracy is relativly high for only 20 folds. What is also interesing is that in some splits an accuracy of 0.9 is accieved and on other splits it goes as low as 0.5. Sadly I no clue how i would be able to stabelize the accuracy over 0.75.\n\nI would really appreciate Feedback for this Notebook.","c6eb94e2":"Addendum: Maybe I will add more comments regarding my actions and conclusions later"}}
