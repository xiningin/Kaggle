Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Neurol Clin. 2015;33(4):807-830. doi:10.1016\/j.ncl.2015.07.001\n\n\"Familial incidence of ALS was described in scattered publications beginning in the mid 1800s but received limited attention in the literature until the report in 1955 by Kurland and Mulder, which suggested that ALS may be familial in nearly 10% of cases. The application of molecular genetic techniques to ALS, marked by the report in 1993 of linkage of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene in familial ALS, signaled an increasing focus on genetics in ALS as a means to gain insights into the pathogenesis of the disease, identify therapeutic targets and facilitate diagnosis.\"\n\n\"In recent years a rapidly expanding list of genetic variations linked to ALS and their related clinical and pathological correlates continues to provide key insights into the causes of ALS and inform therapy development.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4670044\/","f53342c1":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Familial inheritance patterns in ALS<\/span>**\n\n\"Inheritance of most forms of familial ALS is autosomal dominant although autosomal recessive and X-linked dominant familial ALS also occur. Different modes of inheritance may be associated with the same gene depending on the specific sequence variant involved.\"\n\n\"Seemingly sporadic ALS patient with a family history of FTD (frontotemporal dementia) in a first-degree relative would be considered to have possible familial ALS. Validity of this concept is supported by the discovery that an abnormal expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72), a gene of unknown function, is the most common gene variant linked to ALS and is also commonly associated with ALS-FTD and pure FTD (frontotemporal dementia).\" \n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Gene variants linked to ALS pathogenesis<\/span>**\n\n\"A growing number gene variants associated with Mendelian inheritance of ALS have been reported. In outbred populations approximately 60\u201370% of FALS is accounted for by known ALS-linked genes. However, reports of families in which linkage to known loci has been excluded indicate further genetic heterogeneity.\"\n\n\"Although associations between the foregoing gene variants and FALS are well established each is also found infrequently in SALS patients. The possibility of incomplete information regarding the family history may be the basis for some of these observations, but documented nonpenetrance is established for the C9ORF72 repeat expansion and for some SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS variants.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4670044\/","7721574e":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72)<\/span>**\n\n\"A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the first intron of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function on chromosome 9, C9ORF72, is the most common gene variant associated with FALS, found in 40% of FALS and about 6\u20138% of SALS patients, with ethnic variation.\"\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)<\/span>**\n \n\"Sequence variants in the Cu\/Zn superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) on chromosome 21q12.1, were the first causative gene variants identified in ALS.

The remaining 90% of patients with no evident family history of ALS are designated as sporadic ALS (SALS), a potentially misleading designation for several reasons. First, persons with ALS associated with a causative gene variant may lack a family history of ALS as a result of reduced penetrance or small family size. In addition, family history may be incomplete or inaccurate owing to incomplete family history, incorrect diagnoses in ancestors, or death from other causes prior to onset of ALS in relatives genetically at risk.\"\n\n\"Estimates of the heritability of ALS, a measure of the extent of phenotypic variability that is attributable to genetic variation, provide additional evidence that genetic factors play a significant role in sporadic as well as familial ALS. In a study of identical twins that included twins with or without a history of ALS in other relatives heritability was estimated to be about 76% (95% CI=60\u201386%) for twins with a family history of ALS, and approximately 61% (95% CI=38\u201378%) for twins with no other family history of ALS .\"\n\n\"Recently it has been suggested that genetic contributions to ALS may represent the inheritance of risk variants of multiple genes, acting interdependently to cause ALS. The hypothesis that ALS may be oligogenic implies that at least two pathogenic ALS gene variants are required to initiate disease.\"\n\n\"Several studies have shown that a subset of FALS and SALS (sporadic ALS) patients carry at least one known ALS-linked gene variant in conjunction with a second potentially pathogenic variant and offer support for the oligogenic concept of ALS genetics, but these data have been questioned on the basis that the second gene variant may represent a benign variant, potential cohort selection bias and small sample size, and further validation was recommended.\" \n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4670044\/","6313fa37":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Other ALS risk genes and insights from ALS genetics on the pathogenesis of ALS<\/span>**\n\n\"The list of additional genes with sequence variants associated with ALS and related phenotypes continues to grow, aided by technological advances in large scale genetic screening in FALS and SALS patients, particularly whole exome analysis in recent studies. Although most of these genes contribute to a relatively small proportion of FALS and\/or SALS, they and more common FALS genes have offered insights regarding ALS pathogenesis.\"\n\n\"Disease-linked variants in these genes are uncommon in ALS but they have implicated toxic conformational changes in RNA-binding proteins with prion-like domains, such as TDP-43 and FUS, in neurodegeneration.\"\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">ALS-susceptibility genes associated with lower risk and potential disease modifying genes<\/span>**\n\n\"These variants tend to be uncommon, with limited data supporting linkage with ALS.
