Starting from this first exploration thanks to `Pandas Profiling`, we can **focus on more detailed explorations**, and then move on to the subsequent phases of the ML pipeline.\n\nFor more **customizations**, you can refer to the [Advanced section](https:\/\/pandas-profiling.github.io\/pandas-profiling\/docs\/master\/rtd\/pages\/advanced_usage.html) of the documentation, which explains in detail how to change the default settings.\n\nFor **large datasets**, there is a specific section [here](https:\/\/pandas-profiling.github.io\/pandas-profiling\/docs\/master\/rtd\/pages\/big_data.html)!\n\n\n\n### I hope this short notebook will help you enjoy more this competition (and many others)!","76212e1b":"## Widget call","b71fdb74":"As stated in the documentation, for each column the following statistics - if relevant for the column type - are presented in an interactive HTML report:\n\n- **Type inference**: detect the types of columns in a dataframe.\n- **Essentials**: type, unique values, missing values\n- **Quantile statistics** like minimum value, Q1, median, Q3, maximum, range, interquartile range\n- **Descriptive statistics** like mean, mode, standard deviation, sum, median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness\n- **Most frequent values**\n- **Histograms**\n- **Correlations** highlighting of highly correlated variables, Spearman, Pearson and Kendall matrices\n- **Missing values** matrix, count, heatmap and dendrogram of missing values\n- **Duplicate rows** Lists the most occurring duplicate rows\n- **Text analysis** learn about categories (Uppercase, Space), scripts (Latin, Cyrillic) and blocks (ASCII) of text data","39634ea2":"# Introduction\n\nBefore even considering any feature engineering or modeling aspect, it is imperative to explore the data we have. This step is usually called **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.\n\nIf we consider a standard Machine Learning pipeline, EDA is the [most time consuming task](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/gilpress\/2016\/03\/23\/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says\/).\n\n**Have you ever found yourself repeating the same procedures over and over at the beginning of a new competition?**\n\nWell...let's start using some **automation** and let me introduce you to [`Pandas Profiling`](https:\/\/pandas-profiling.github.io\/pandas-profiling\/docs\/master\/rtd\/pages\/introduction.html#).","fc0d4df5":"If you want to save your HTML report, you can use the `to_file()` function:"}}
