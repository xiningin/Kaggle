been most to least popular. We can see how most people do not go to or return from **Brooklyn**, **Staten Island**, and outside **New York** city. Most of the traffic is between **Manhattan** and **Queens**, and **Manhattan** and other locations. But the other districts are not as popularly used in comparison. No one travels from **Queens** to any other part of **New York** but **Manhattan**. **Queens** is a popular pickup and dropoff point from **Manhattan** but least popular pickup and dropoff point to or from any other district.

We can see how some locations are hotspots and not affected by time while other locations are very much temporal and changes with the hours, days, weeks, months and season. Our data is only limited to 2016 and only six months of it. The additional location-based and time-based fields have certainly helped see the tax trips from a different light than without them. We can see from all of the graphs how it's skewed towards certain locations and time factors and their combinations.","791ad80e":"### Most\/Least Popular Pickup\/Dropoff District (side-by-side)","aa52ea94":"<i><p style=\"font-size:20px; background-color: #FFF1D7; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">We can see how popular **Brooklyn** and **Manhattan** are as compared to the other districts i.e. **Staten Island**, **Queens**, when it comes to pickup locations in **New York City**.
