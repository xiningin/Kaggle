We can't be sure to be honest, and the total number of participants in this category is only 24, so there's really no point in further understanding here. Otherwise, nothing to note here.","9803b106":"#### GDP per capita of the countries having the highest Local percentage","3a9c1671":"## 3.4.  What are their ages?","45415593":"As we can see, the majority of these young respondents have considerably a low number of years of coding\/programming experience to be able to access titles like Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, etc. So what could explain such results?\n\n---\n\nLooking back at the titles distribution of these young respondents, these titles seem more of a major title rather than a job title for such ages. For instance, \"Data Scientist\" and \"Machine Learning Engineer\" correlate much more with majors at universities (Data Science, ML Engineering, etc.) when compared to \"DBA\/Database Engineer\" or \"Product Manager\".\n\nTaking a step back and having a second look at the survey questions (specifically at the file: `kaggle_survey_2021_answer_choices.pdf`), we can notice that the 5th question asked in the survey was about the \"Title\". The titles are mainly alphabetically ordered with titles such as \"Business Analyst\" and \"Data Analyst\" coming first. The 3 last title options in the list are: \"Student\", \"Currently not employed\" and \"Other\".\n\nOkay, so, hear me out on my analysis here:\n\nSince the \"Student\" option is listed at the bottom of the list of options, a multitude of student respondents could've missed it. This may have led them to choose the first viable option that they came across, which could very well be their studies title (e.g. if they are studying Machine Learning Engineering, they could have chosen \"Machine Learning Engineer\" as their title, instead of choosing \"Student\"). Further down the road, these respondents will bump into 2 questions that shouldn't be asked to the \"student\" respondents. These questions are:\n- **Q20) In what industry is your current employer\/contract (or your most recent employer if retired)?** Having neither an employer or a contract, the students may have chosen the \"Academics\/Education\" option since they're enrolled in a University degree and this would be the only logical option to choose in this scenario. \n- **Q25) What is your current yearly compensation (approximate \\\\$USD)?** . Here the students may have chosen the range 0-999\\\\$, since they most likely don't have a job. \n\nThis hypothesis could in fact explain why in the data exploration we see that a big proportion of respondents working in Academics\/Education seems to have a yearly salary of 0-999\\\\$.","16db828c":"# 1.

Using this metric, we can now intuitively understand the degree to which each category correlates with low income. This is why, from this point unwards, most of the visualizations will represent the local percentages rather than the global percentages.\n\nAs we can see in the graph above, the statisticians group has the highest proportion of low income respondents, whereas the product manager group has the lowest proportion of low income respondents.

This could most certainly explain why in these countries, the number of low income respondents is relatively high.\n\n---\n\nKeep in mind that the GDP per capita is essentially an average over the whole population. So for the case of Pakistan, with a GDP per capita of 1,254\\\\$, and assuming a normal distribution of salaries, this would mean that this value is also the median and 50% of the population earns less than this number. Keeping in mind that salary distributions are usually skewed to the left (meaning the median is less than the average and therefore meaning more than 50% of the population earns less than the mean), the local percentage of 27% makes complete sense for a country such as Pakistan.\n\n---\n\nWoohoo!! We now at least understand the reason behind the answer of a portion of respondents with low income. So:\n\n**A portion of respondents with low income, coming from countries caracterized by a low GDP per capita, are very likely to be actually earning 0-999\\\\$**.\n\nIf we're just foculizing on the 4 countries amongst the highest local pct (Pakistan, Nigeria, Egypt and Indonesia), they constitute 18% of the respondents that answered having a yearly compensation of 0-999\\\\$ (604 out of 3369 respondents with low income).

I'm thrilled to share with you my first ever notebook.\nAs a natural first step in understanding the data I'm working with, I started my EDA by visualizing the distribution of each question in the survey. This is when I stumbled upon the distribution of the \"yearly compensation rate\" among the respondents. I was extremely surprised to discover that the most chosen (and by a significant margin) answer here was the **yearly** salary range 0-999$. In this notebook, I aim to understand why this was the most chosen salary range, and discover the profile of the respondents that chose this option.\n\n---\n### A little about me \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this here is my first ever notebook (yay!). Being a biologist that lately found an interest towards the data science field, I decided to put my -newly learned- data science skills in action, by exploring the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey. I'm always looking for ways to improve myself and would be more than appreciative for your comments and critiques.\n\n---\n\nSo, are you ready? Wear your detective hats and let the investigation begin!","aa8bdbea":"It is surprising to find out that the most chosen salary range is by far **0-999\\\\$** (*3369 respondents*), largly surpassing the value counts of all other salary ranges. The rest of this notebook aims to explore this specific proportion of respondents and try to understand the reason behind having such a high number of respondents choosing this option. Moving forward, we will refer to the respondents answering the option 0-999\\\\$ as respondents \"with low income\".","f3dca993":"## 3.2. What are Their Titles?","b1171e69":"To sum it up, and as my investigation results may suggest, there are 2 main points that may help us understand the big number of respondents that chose a yearly salary of 0-999\\\\$:\n- First off, approximately 23% of respondents that chose a yearly salary of 0-999\\\\$ come from countries caracterized by a low GDP per capita, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, Egypt and Indonesia. Here, this option could very well be reflective of the truth.\n- Secondly, a considerable number of students could be behind the over-representation of the 0-999\\\\$ answer. These would be students mistankenly choosing their majors' titles as their title, rather than the \"Student\" title, and consequently being faced with questions about their employer industry and salary range, questions that aren't asked to respondents choosing the \"Student\" title.\n\nGiven that there is nothing to address in the first point, and while the remainder of the respondents choosing the 0-999\\\\$ option could be a mix of respondents actually earning that amount of money, respondents whom I couldn't come across a viable explanation to their answer, and probably some noise, we are left with the second point.\n\n**In order to avoid such ambiguities, I would recommend kaggle to place the \"Student\" option at the top of the choices list for the \"Title\" question. This will eliminate the confusion and allow students to directly spot their appropriate title, without risking bumping into questions that aren't meant to be answered by students.**\n\n**Given these results, and in order to have a cleaner data, I would recommend all kagglers that are interested in working with the yearly salaries: to remove from the dataset the respondents that belong to the \"18-21\" or \"22-24\" age groups and work in the Academics\/Education industries.**\n\n---\n\nThat's it for this notebook. It was originally planned to be published way sooner to help the maximum of people out with my findings, but many cirmustances slowed me down.

So how could respondents of age 18, 19, 20 occupy titles such as machine learning engineers?\n\nOne hypothesis would be that these young respondents started coding\/programming while they were in highschool, so they were gaining experience since then.

From this point onwords, we will refer to this percentage as a **Local pct** (local percentage), and we will refer to the previously visualized numbers as **Global pct** (global percentage).\n\nSo, to recap:\n* **Global pct** will refer to the percentage of respondents with low income that answered a given category (in the above example the categories were the titles).\n* **Local pct** will refer to the percentage of respondents within a given category that answered having a low income (0-999\\\\$).
