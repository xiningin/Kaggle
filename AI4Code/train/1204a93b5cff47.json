Analysing these will help to identify and assess concern areas.\n\n#### Note that throughout this task, the important points are differentiated using the Indented Quotes format.","8a3dd507":"> Total sales value was USD\\\\$2296195.59, and USD\\\\$230.15 on average for each transaction. This can range from USD\\\\$0.44 to a highest sales value of USD\\\\$22,638.48 for an individual transaction. The higher amounts were likely placed by Corporate or Home Office customer segments for larger quantities of products.\n\n> Total quantity sold was 37,820, and 4 on average for each transaction. This can range from 1 to a highest quantity of 14 products for an individual transaction. The higher quantities were likely placed by Corporate or Home Office customer segments.\n\n> Average discount was 16% for each transaction. This can range from no discount to a notable highest discount of 80% for an individual transaction. The higher discounts were likely from festivals, end-of-season sales, and clearance sales for stocks that are of older fashion.\n\n> Overall, the Superstore made a considerably good profit of USD\\\\$28,6241.42, and USD\\\\$28.69 on average for each transaction. However, this can range from a loss of USD\\\\$6,599.98 to a profit of USD\\\\$8,399.98 for an individual transaction. Higher discounts likely played a major role in the more signifant losses.","d438cadb":"Moving on, scatter plot allows detailed observation of the overall spread and relationships between Sales and Profit for all transactions.","4485d1e6":"# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)","305b4e40":"The final EDA will observe the effect of discounts on profit\/loss.","696c1993":"The Winsorisation method is popularly chosen to handle numerical outliers, where outlier values are replaced with the minimum or maximum non-outlier value identified using the interquartile range (IQR) method.

","b39b47ab":"> While the Consumer customer segment made up almost 51% of total sales, the profits contributed was only 47%. This is indicative that although there is good targeting strategy, the Superstore is bearing a slight loss in the Consumer segment due to lower profit margins. Superstore is advised to look into the reasons behind this, and take appropriate action such as improving sales service in order to increase profits. This is essential as Consumers are the most important customer segment to Superstore, taking up approximately half of the customer base.\n\n> The Corporate and Home Office segments are returning higher profits on sales made. While their joint sales value adds up to around 50%, their joint profits is over 53%.

Superstore is advised to improve on its notably low sales, such as through marketing strategies, in order to increase profits.\n\n> Furniture is considerably popular, but both profits and profit margin are dangerously low. This may be due to more expensive shipping costs as Furnitures are the most heavy and bulky products offered.","29bb691a":"Diving deeper into sales and profit data, these are compared through density plotting to visualise data frequency for overall data distribution. Analysis is mostly focused on the relationship between these. \n\nmatplotlib.pyplot graphics library is imported for the visualisations of figures. It is convenient as it has good reproducibility of scientific figures, for example when regenerating a figure using updated data, appearance, latex labels and texts, and aspects such as orientation. %matplotlib inline is used to configure the output of the figures to be embedded in the Jupyter notebook file, instead of opening a new window each time.\n\nData visualisation will include suitable graphs that are descriptive and comparative to effectively communicate both abstract and concrete ideas. Histogram density plots are chosen to illustrate the overall data distribution, as well as the data distributions of Sales and Profit. Seaborn is used for a terser Application Programming Interface (API).\n\nKernel density estimate (KDE) plots, using the kde() method, will visualise the overall distribution through a continuous probability density curve. This generates two histogram density plots and their continuous probability density curves for Sales and Profit in the same figure space, and clearly differentiates them by specifying different colours in its parameters. The xlim() method restricts plot range to 0 and above for meaningful visualisations, since it is impossible for Sales to have a negative value and more interest is placed on Profits in this case study.","e242a70f":"> Sales and Profit have a moderate positive linear correlation. When Sales increase by USD\\\\$1, Profit will increase by USD\\\\$0.48. This is indicative that this Superstore is a popular company with constant demand of the products sold, and the management may have a good ability in managing costs to ensure high profit margins. \n\n> Discount and Profit have a weak negative linear correlation. When Discount increase by 1%, Profit will decrease by USD\\\\$0.22. This is because discount deductions will reduce overall sales revenues.\n\n> Quantity and Profit have little to no linear correlation. This is indicative that the Superstore may sell a considerable number of products at low profit margins, with promotional strategies such as higher discounts on larger quantities of products in a single transaction, and Buy One Get One Free (BOGOF) promotions. As a result, average profit is lower. Another likely explanation is that Profit will increase as Quantity increases, but not on a linear scale.\n\n> Discount and Sales have little to no linear correlation. This is indicative that despite targeting to implement discounts as a promotional strategy to successfully increase sales, Superstore encouraged bad consumer psychology instead. A considerable number of customers may develop the thinking that Superstore's products are defective or low quality, according to the lowered prices after discount deductions. In a long run, this can negatively affect Superstore's brand image. Superstore is advised to consider other promotional strategies.\n\n> Discount and Quantity have little to no linear correlation. This is indicative that implementing discounts as Superstore's promotional strategy is not attractive or motivating. As discussed in the previous point, this may result in bad consumer psychology. Superstore is advised to consider other promotional strategies, as identified according to customer's preferences through market researches and surveys.\n\n> Quantity and Sales have a weak positive linear correlation. When Quantity increase by 1 unit, Sales will increase by USD\\\\$0.20.

In total, the difference amounts to a notable USD\\\\$200k increase in sales value when there are discounts.\n\n> The average price of a discounted product is USD\\\\$63 as compared to USD\\\\$59 for a non-discounted product. This is indicative that discounts are offered on more expensive products to promote affordability.\n\n> Considering both average and total sales quantities, customers tend to buy more products when there are discounts. Although the average quantity in a sales transaction that includes discounted products is 3.77 as compared to a higher 3.81 where there are no discounts, the total difference amounts to a notable 1.3k of additional products sold when there are discounts.\n\n> However, discounts will affect profits.

In total, losses amount to USD\\\\$35k when there are discounts, as compared to a profit of USD\\\\$321K when there are no discounts. Despite this, the Superstore cannont escape from giving out discounts on their products, especially during festivals, end-of-season sales, and clearance sales that are necessary to make space in their warehouses for newer and more current stocks. Instead, Superstore is advised to reduce overall discount levels to minimise losses, and focus on implementing other promotional strategies to ensure increasing profitable sales and consistent future gains in long term customers.","7a211d56":"Moving on to analyse the effect of customer segments on sales and profit :","a34a0d9d":"Data integration is not needed, since only one dataset is used with no schema integrations, and thus no discernable entity identification issues or data value conflicts.\n\nData transformation will check overall range of values for the entire dataset.
