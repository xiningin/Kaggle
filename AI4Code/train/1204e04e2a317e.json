(source:https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Video_game_industry)\nThe reason for the difference with our plotted graph maybe the fact that the dataframe do not include other platforms as mobile games, one of the fast growing market. \nThe shift to the mobile games also can partially explain the decrease in other platforms, but it doesn't mean that Publishers in loss, since the same Publishers produce mobile games.","8bf6029d":"In case of Sports genre we can observe very drastic increases and decreases.
