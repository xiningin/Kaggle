Partition the calculation by `taxi_id`, and order the results within each partition by `trip_start_timestamp`.\n\nSome sample results are shown below, where all rows correspond to the same driver (or `taxi_id`).  Take the time now to make sure that the values in the `prev_break` column make sense to you!\n\n![first_commands](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qjvQzg8.png)\n\nNote that the first trip of the day for each driver should have a value of **NaN** (not a number) in the `prev_break` column.","19611a0c":"### 2) Can you separate and order trips by community area?\n\nThe query below returns a DataFrame with three columns from the table: `pickup_community_area`, `trip_start_timestamp`, and `trip_end_timestamp`.  \n\nAmend the query to return an additional column called `trip_number` which shows the order in which the trips were taken from their respective community areas.  So, the first trip of the day originating from community area 1 should receive a value of 1; the second trip of the day from the same area should receive a value of 2.  Likewise, the first trip of the day from community area 2 should receive a value of 1, and so on.\n\nNote that there are many numbering functions that can be used to solve this problem (depending on how you want to deal with trips that started at the same time from the same community area); to answer this question, please use the **RANK()** function.","8491c5e5":"# Exercises\n\n### 1) How can you predict the demand for taxis?\n\nSay you work for a taxi company, and you're interested in predicting the demand for taxis.  Towards this goal, you'd like to create a plot that shows a rolling average of the daily number of taxi trips.  Amend the (partial) query below to return a DataFrame with two columns:\n- `trip_date` - contains one entry for each date from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017.\n- `avg_num_trips` - shows the average number of daily trips, calculated over a window including the value for the current date, along with the values for the preceding 15 days and the following 15 days, as long as the days fit within the two-year time frame.  For instance, when calculating the value in this column for January 5, 2016, the window will include the number of trips for the preceding 4 days, the current date, and the following 15 days.\n\nThis query is partially completed for you, and you need only write the part that calculates the `avg_num_trips` column.
