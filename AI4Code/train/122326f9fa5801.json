Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused an eventual 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 17 countries (9.6% fatality rate), with the majority of cases in mainland China and Hong Kong. No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004. In late 2017, Chinese scientists traced the virus through the intermediary of civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in Yunnan province.\n\n## - About this notebook\n\nThis notebook consists of EDA performed on dataset on SARS outbreak of 2003 provided by kaggle. This notebook consists of data analysis and data visualtion with graphs and plots.","b15c76e1":"## Adding the data to SQL DB\n\nIn order to add any CSV file to the SQLITE database, we need to: \n1. Firstly read the CSV file using <code>pd.read_csv()<\/code>\n2. Second, we have to create a connection with the sqlite DB using <code>sqlite.connect()<\/code>\n3. Finally, we need to enter the CSV data read using Pandas to the SQL DB in form of SQL table using <code> .to_sql() <\/code>"}}
