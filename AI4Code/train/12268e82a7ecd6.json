However, many of these titles are just French versions of the more common English titles, e.g. Mme = Madame = Mrs.   \n\nWe will use the six most common titles, replacing all other titles with the most appropriate of these six.","f976c1d5":"<a id=\"embarked\"><\/a>\n## 2.3. Impute missing \"embarked\" value\nThere are also just two missing values in the `Embarked` column. Here we will just use the Pandas 'backfill' method.\n","81812af0":"# Titanic challenge part 1\nIn this notebook, we will be covering all of the steps required to wrangle the Titanic data set into a format that is suitable for machine learning.   \nWe will do each of the following:\n  - impute missing values\n  - create new features (feature engineering)\n  \n[**Part 2**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jamesleslie\/titanic-random-forest-grid-search) of this challenge involves fitting and tuning a **random forest** to make predictions.","a2c8f63a":"We can visualize the median ages for each title group. Below, we see that each title has a distinctly different median age. \n> **Note**: There is no risk in doing this after imputation, as the median of an age group has not been affected by our actions.","d959279c":"<a id=\"impute-missing\"><\/a>\n# 2. Imputation \nWe can see above that there are a few columns with missing values. The `Cabin` column is missing over 1000 values, so we won't use that for predictions, but the `Age`, `Embarked` and `Fare` columns are all complete enough that we can fill in the missing values through imputation.   \n<a id=\"age\"><\/a>\n## 2.1. Impute missing age values\nA simple option for the missing age values is to use the median age value. Let's go a little further and use each passenger's *Title* to estimate their age. E.g. if a passenger has the title of *Dr*, I will give them the median age value for all other passengers with the same title.","3b28a493":"<a id=\"loading\"><\/a>\n# 1. Load packages and data\nFirst step, as always, is to import the necessary Python packages and load the input data as a Pandas dataframe.\n\nI chose to combine the train and test set into one. Since we will have to impute some missing age and fare values, I prefer to do this across the entire dataset, rather than separately across train and test sets. ","a0e4b992":"<a id=\"fare\"><\/a>\n## 2.2. Impute missing fare values\nFor the single missing fare value, I also use the median fare value for the passenger's class.   \n\n> Perhaps you could come up with a cooler way of visualising the relationship between the price a passenger paid for their ticket and their chances of survival?","c4523657":"# 4. Save cleaned version\nFinally, let's save our cleaned data set so we can use it in other notebooks.","c93b35f9":"### Extract title from name\nWe can use a regular expression to extract the title from the `Name` column. We will do this by finding the adjacent letters that are immediately followed by a full stop.\n","c07c6166":"<a id=\"feature-engineering\"><\/a>\n# 3. Add family size column\nWe can use the two variables of **Parch** and **SibSp** to create a new variable called **Family_Size**. This is simply done by adding `Parch` and `SibSp` together.","040371e8":"# Table of Contents:\n\n- **1. [Load Packages and Data](#loading)**\n- **2. [Imputation](#impute-missing)**\n  - **2.1.
