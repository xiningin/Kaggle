They are only included in the test set. But they are also strongly represented in the test set, with approximately 2.4 million rows.\n\nMean HasDetections is clearly high for version 1273 and 1275, and lower for 1265 through 1271.\nThis is really interesting as these versions represents most of the observations in the train set.\n\nWith significant differences between mean values for HasDetections for very large parts of the dataset, AvSigVersion is clearly important for modelling.\n\nThe trend here is surprising. I would expect newer version of AntiVirus to protect better against virus, not worse. Or maybe it is an interaction effect - newer antivirus is better at detecting virus? Also the trend is clearly non-linear, so it is really hard to interpolate.\n\nIn conclusion I think the most interesting hypothesis is an interaction effect where newer AntiVirus is both better at protecting against malware and detecting malware.\n\n","167709d2":"# Combining data\n\nThere is probably a cleaner way to do this, I just did something quick and dirty","a606b5a6":"Cleanup...","65850912":"# Discussion\n\n","5bb9a641":"# Create the plot\nOk, let's start plotting","3c0c7999":"# Data input","44d853ca":"In this kernel we will investigate AvSigVersion. \nMost likely the top culprit for the differences between leaderboard and CV scores.\nHere we will look at the first four digits of AvSigVersion, and see what that gets us.\n\nIn this Kernel we will quickly do some data digestion and wrangling, plot the key results then discuss."}}
