Especially given the deficit of information in 2010. \n- However, observing the Inter Quartile Range of the price range, there does not seem to be a huge difference accross years. Therefore, this data can ive a good starting point to predict prices BUT new data is always more relevant.","8c52b6a1":"## Step 2: Review The Data\nUse the command you learned to view summary statistics of the data.

So essentially we have just 4 years of data. \nAlso, the number of houses sold in 2010 is ridiculously less.","6e9e485e":"## Think About Your Data\n\nThe newest house in your data isn't that new.  A few potential explanations for this:\n1. They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.\n1. The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.\n\nIf the reason is explanation #1 above, does that affect your trust in the model you build with this data? What about if it is reason #2?\n\nHow could you dig into the data to see which explanation is more plausible?\n\nCheck out this **[discussion thread](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn-forum\/60581)** to see what others think or to add your ideas.\n\n# Keep Going\n\nYou are ready for **[Your First Machine Learning Model](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/your-first-machine-learning-model).**\n","97421492":"## Step 1: Loading Data\nRead the Iowa data file into a Pandas DataFrame called `home_data`.","62cc9e8c":"## The Buying Period  \n\nIt can be noticed that the buying is very active during the second and the thrid quarters.

To ensure you can apply these techniques on your own, you will have to apply them to a new dataset (with house prices from Iowa).\n\nThe exercises use a \"notebook\" coding environment.  In case you are unfamiliar with notebooks, we have a [90-second intro video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4C2qMnaIKL4).\n\n# Exercises\n\nRun the following cell to set up code-checking, which will verify your work as you go."}}
