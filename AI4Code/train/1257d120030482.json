It can be found right away at [Part 2](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/zikazika\/initial-approach-earthquake-prediction-part-2) I am sorry for the inconvenience.","277aea1d":"# **Implications of EDA**\n\nThis EDA helps us actually with **feature engineering**. If we look at the **first** graph(yellow) and the same thing we could have noticed before is that acoustic_data has a huge spike in value just before the earthquake is about the happen. So a new variable could be a column that assigns a big value (say 100) when this huge values occurs (say 3 points of standard deviation) and 0 otherwise. We hope that te algorithm will pick up this indicator and it will help with predictions. We can test this later on with Variable Importance using lgbm.\n\n**Second** graph gives us another theory. We see that we have multiple (atleast 2) distinct centers where time_to_failure values are centered. That  also wasnt hard to spot from the graph before that. We see that the red line decreases linearly towards zero, than it has a sharp jump towards another count-down time until the next earthquake. Hence we can see that there are atleast two jumps\/differences between time_to_failure values. First one is the slow linear differences as we approach the 0, and the next one is the steep jump. Implication is easy, create a feature that represents these categorical differences in time_to_failure\/target variable.","554d2838":"# **Dask or Pandas**\nFrom the simple analysis above we can already see trade-offs in these two different approaches. It is different, it seems that values are differently stored, it is a different object type after all and a more efficient way to acces these values has to be out there. And run-time is horrible. As I said somethings are not implemented and user has to think about a work around. One can think about Dask as new pandas, with a bit more complicated synthax but upside regarding memory.\n\n","842bac36":"Very intersting (again for the first 150 000 observations) it seems that (yellow=accoustic_data) follows normal distribution with some outliers.
