While bar charts distinguish between every \"type\" of point line charts mushes them together. So a line chart asserts an order to the values on the horizontal axis, and the order won\u2019t make sense with some data.

In fact, a histogram is special kind of bar plot that splits your data into even intervals and displays how many rows are in each interval with bars. The only analytical difference is that instead of each bar representing a single value, it represents a range of values.\n\nHowever, histograms have one major shortcoming (the reason for our 200$ caveat earlier). Because they break space up into even intervals, they don't deal very well with skewed data:","c14ef359":"The frequency of Pokemon by HP stat total:","0d847b24":"## Interval data\n\nLet's move on by looking at yet another type of data, an **interval variable**.\n\nExamples of interval variables are the wind speed in a hurricane, shear strength in concrete, and the temperature of the sun. An interval variable goes beyond an ordinal categorical variable: it has a *meaningful* order, in the sense that we can quantify what the difference between two entries is itself an interval variable.\n\nFor example, if I say that this sample of water is -20 degrees Celcius, and this other sample is 120 degrees Celcius, then I can quantify the difference between them: 140 degrees \"worth\" of heat, or such-and-such many joules of energy.\n\nThe difference can be qualitative sometimes. At a minimum, being able to state something so clearly feels a lot more \"measured\" than, say, saying you'll buy this wine and not that one, because this one scored a 92 on some taste test and that one only got an 85. More definitively, any variable that has infinitely many possible values is definitely an interval variable (why not 120.1 degrees? 120.001? 120.0000000001? Etc).\n\nLine charts work well for interval data. Bar charts don't\u2014unless your ability to measure it is very limited, interval data will naturally vary by quite a lot.\n\nLet's apply a new tool, the histogram, to an interval variable in our dataset, price (we'll cut price off at 200$ a bottle; more on why shortly).","1ad18232":"## Conclusion and exercise\n\nIn this section of the tutorial we learned about the handful of different kinds of data, and looked at some of the built-in tools that `pandas` provides us for plotting them.\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nFor these exercises, we'll be working with the Pokemon dataset (because what goes together better than wine and Pokemon?).","128da70f":"California produces almost a third of wines reviewed in Wine Magazine!\n\nBar charts are very flexible: The height can represent anything, as long as it is a number. And each bar can represent anything, as long as it is a category.\n\nIn this case the categories are **nominal categories**: \"pure\" categories that don't make a lot of sense to order. Nominal categorical variables include things like countries, ZIP codes, types of cheese, and lunar landers. The other kind are **ordinal categories**: things that do make sense to compare, like earthquake magnitudes, housing complexes with certain numbers of apartments, and the sizes of bags of chips at your local deli.\n\nOr, in our case, the number of reviews of a certain score allotted by Wine Magazine:","4d95d5b5":"## Line charts\n\nThe wine review scorecard has 20 different unique values to fill, for which our bar chart is just barely enough.
