Sungay, E. Cakti & M. Erdik\n\nThose terms have been used in a variety of manners in literature. \nIn their Pressure and Release Model that has first been introduced in 1994, Wisner et al (2004) suggest to interpret risk as a function of hazards and vulnerability that is caused by various conditions authors present. In this model, lack of conditions that build resiliency is also taken into consideration besides conditions that increase vulnerability. Authors underline the need of a multidisciplinary evaluation of the term risk, and suggest to cover socio-economic fragility and lack of resilience as aggravating factors besides physical risk.\n\nBilling and Madengruber (2006) mention that coping capacity is a key concept in vulnerability assessments. They relate vulnerability and coping capacity as two sides of the same coin. They developed a model to compare coping capacity of the countries. The index they propose, consist of four main indicators; the level of institutional preparedness, level of mitigation measures taken, number of IFRC volunteers, and modified UNDP Disaster Risk Index as a composite indicator, for each country. https:\/\/www.iitk.ac.in\/nicee\/wcee\/article\/WCEE2012_2508.pdf","9f3c99e5":"#Vulnerability and Coping Capacity: Two Sides of the Same Coin.\n\n![](https:\/\/ars.els-cdn.com\/content\/image\/1-s2.0-S2211464512000565-gr1.jpg)sciencedirect.com","94787c30":"#The potential impact of vulnerability and coping capacity on the pandemic control of COVID-19\n\nAuthors: Martin CS Wong; Jeremy YC Teoh;; Junjie Huang;; Sunny H Wong.\n\nPublished:May 28, 2020     DOI:https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jinf.2020.05.060\n\n\n\n#Reducing vulnerability and enhancing capacity to cope\n\nFindings imply that reducing vulnerability and enhancing capacity to cope could potentially mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the components of the two predictor variables are modifiable, countries that aim to increase their capability to combat the COVID-19 pandemics could make reference to the detailed subcategories under these two dimensions.\n\nThe government could consider to take active steps in enhancing the resilience of the society and availability of measures that could protect the vulnerable population. Limitations of the study: There may be other confounders that could not be controlled for, including personal behaviour and the stringency of Governmental policies, such as measures related to social distancing, school closure, supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as quarantine and containment strategies.\n\nIn addition, the COVID-19 vulnerability used was developed in 2018, and they assumed that the index of each country did not change before the beginning of the pandemic in 2019. Also, the authors emphasized that these are preliminary findings, and the cause-and-effect relationships are yet to be further examined by larger-scale studies. https:\/\/www.journalofinfection.com\/article\/S0163-4453(20)30337-6\/fulltext","af958374":"#Categorical features(handling missing data)","a8003272":"#The meaning of Vulnerabilities\n\nAnalysis of the INFORM COVID Risk Index suggests that factors that make individuals vulnerable to COVID-19, like age and specific pre-existing conditions,drive vulnerability and risk in higher income countries. However, in countries with the highest risk of humanitarian crisis as a result of COVID-19, which are overwhelmingly low and lower-middle income countries, factors of vulnerability that are highly specific to COVID-19 are less important than broader socio-economic factors or those associated with vulnerable groups like the food insecure, people in poor health and displaced persons.\n\nAlthough this conclusion partly arrives from the way risk index is conceptualised, it suggests that at least in the preparedness and early response phase of the pandemic in countries at high risk of humanitarian crisis risk can be reduced by addressing broader vulnerabilities through \u2018no regrets\u2019 type interventions.\n\nThis is also important because impacts on humanitarian operations and the secondary impacts of the pandemic are also likely to have wide ranging humanitarian consequences beyond the direct health impacts of the disease. https:\/\/reliefweb.int\/sites\/reliefweb.int\/files\/resources\/INFORM%20COVID%20Risk%20Index%20V012%20Report.pdf","1bc20b01":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS7qm_11NiJGSBsT3UJk9nxYoPfmzl9Cw1DHw&usqp=CAU)publications.europa.eu","23f12fa3":"#Label Encoding & Hot Encode (dummies)","d483f37c":"#Vulnerability in countries from different income groups\n\nThe Vulnerability dimension of the INFORM COVID Risk Index requires a specific analysis.\n\nThe two sub-dimensions, COVID-specific vulnerability (e.g. age, comorbidities, movement) and hazard-independent vulnerability (broad vulnerability to all hazards e.g. poverty, inequality, food insecurity, insecure living conditions) are negatively correlated (cc -0.7). In other words, countries with high COVID-specific vulnerability generally have low broader vulnerability.\n\nCOVID-specific vulnerability and hazard-independent Vulnerability contribute similarly to the overall Vulnerability (cc 0.31 vs 0.44).

If you focus solely on COVID-19 and forget about other diseases, you create opportunities for more outbreaks to emerge\" \"The moment you lose sight of routine immunization you create serious problems in the health system\"- Emmanuel Lansana.

The numbers grow steady and slowly. When it arrived to the poor communities the society loses interest in it. That's one reason for high income countries don't have any BCG policy or have immunization as mandatory, since they don't have many (or any) cases. And those are restrict to people in vulnerable conditions."}}
