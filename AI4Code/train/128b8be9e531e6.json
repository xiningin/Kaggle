This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019. This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions.<br>\n\nThis data contains 16 columns, 47905 unique values(samples). Imported all necessary files and libraries, We removed unnecessary data from the datset like last review, reviews per month and host name as they donot support the data required. We filled the null values with zero constant and did the visualization using seaborn, pyplot, matplotlib.<br>\n\n#### Variables\nid: listing ID<br>\nname: name of the listing<br>\nhost_id: host ID<br>\nhost_name: name of the host<br>\nneighbourhood_group: location<br>\nneighbourhood: area<br>\nlatitude: latitude coordinateslatitude: latitude coordinates<br>\nlongitude: longitude coordinates<br>\nroom_type: listing space type<br>\nprice: price in dollars<br>\nminimum_nights: amount of nights minimum<br>\nnumber_of_reviews: number of reviews<br>\nlast_review: latest review<br>\nreviews_per_month: number of reviews per month<br>\ncalculated_host_listings_count: amount of listing per host<br>\navailability_365: number of days when listing is available for booking<br>\n\nWe will perform data visualization for linear Regression on this dataset.\n\n\n","46b69fb2":"### Observation\n\nWe can obeserve that many people skipped giving reviews which affected the data. We can observe that maximum room prices are around 1000 usd only. Also there are lot of rooms in Manhattan which is costlier than any other place. Williamsburgh in Manhattan has many rooms there. The price of single room is very less compared to a whole apartment. The second highest place containing the rooms is brooklyn. Shared rooms are cheaper but are less available in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Highest no of reviews were given in manhattan and it looks like people like manhattan than any other place. The availability of single rooms is higher and is ever ready. But the entire suits are available only in particular days. The latitude and longitude gives the distribution of price over NYC.\n","366c1356":"We leave the null values as is, as it doesn't effect the visualization."}}
