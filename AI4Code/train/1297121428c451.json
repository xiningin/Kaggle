a lot in any domain. So it's not fruitfull to do analysis on car names as these are names just like product id and seems to hold no important insights.\n    \nBut one thing to be noticed here is that each car name starts with a company name, so maybe the case that there are very few companies in the dataset and it will be fruitful to extract them as seperate feature and do analysis on that. So let's do it.\n\nWe will create a new attribute named as car_company by extracting the first word from all names. We also remove the car company from each car name because it is not needed now, and also we rename column `name` to `car_name`.

So it's not fruitfull to do analysis on that as it is unique for most of the points and also in most cases names are safe to be avoided as they doesn't have correlations with other.\n* We then create an artificial attribute named `car_company` by extracting company names from car names. We find that there are much few car companies as compared to car names (around 8 times less).\n* We then found that the distribution of `car_company` is not uniform and most of the proportion is covered by top 15 car companies.

In all cases most of the data is comprised of top few categories.\n* Although `model_year` is not perfectly uniform but we can think it as `uniform-like distribution`. This is a digestible assumption for two reasons, first we can clearly see in plot that indeed the distribution is `uniform-like` and also this is not the entire population but a sample of it so may be in large run it will converge to `uniform` which may be the true population distribution (**Law of Large Number**).","58fd69f1":"    We are done with the analysis of categorical attributes and found lots of interesting things and answered many unknown questions.

Plotly plots are not only visually awesome but are also interactive and due to this they take much more memory specially scatter plots (as they need to store every data-point info. to enable intractivity). That's why I didn't included any plotly plots.\n\nIn the next part we will do some [**Statistical Analysis**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/gauravsharma99\/statistical-analysis-on-mpg-data).\n\n<span style=\"color:red\">**If you like this notebook then please upvote and also share with others.**<span>","f9a9e809":"We will create an artificial categorical attribute named `mpg_level` which categorizes `mpg` into `low`, `medium` and `high`. This is done for two reasons, first it will help a lot in EDA i.e., we can bifurcate plots on the basis of mpg and secondly this is easy to understand as compared to numbers in `mpg`.\n\nWe are dividing `mpg` into three regions as,<br>\n[min, 17) -> low<br>\n[17, 29) -> medium<br>\n[29, max) -> high\n\nAlso the choice of the range is analytical and can be anything till it seems to be reasonable.\n\n<sup>Note: This is feature-engineering and mostly done in predictive modelling but it makes sense to introduce it here.<sup>","7659d738":"**Now we analyze relationship between numerical and categorical attributes**\n\n<sup>Note: We are using boxen and violin plots for this but we can also use stripplot.<sup>","fd1bfe02":"We now make two distinct list for categorical and numerical column names as the analysis differ for both the types. For that we introspect the datatypes of each column and if it is of type `object` then it's categorical and else numerical.\n\nWe will use these two lists heavily throughout the analysis.","77fb67ad":"This is **part 1** ie., EDA. We won't stretch this part long and do following things in sequential manner.\n\n1. **Preprocess the data**, this includes dealing with missing values, duplicate data if any and then align the data.\n2. **EDA on categorical attributes**, this includes analysing their distributions and relations with other cat. attributes.\n3. **EDA on numerical attributes**, this includes analysing their distributions and relations with other num. attributes.\n4. Then we will analyse the **relation b\/w num. & cat. attributes**.\n\nI make use of **seaborn** heavily throughout the notebook, so it is also a good goto notebook for those who are looking for EDA using seaborn.","f72c4262":"### Analysis on Numerical Attributes\n\nOur analysis includes both descriptive stats and EDA.","8e727869":"    We will first slice out the categorical columns from original dataframe and then do analysis on it keeping the original data untou-ched, and at the end incorporate needed changes in our original dataframe.","21f690e2":"    We will first import the data into a pandas dataframe and inspect it's properties.","244c6ed1":"As `origin` and `name` consists of text data so it needs some preprocessing. We will remove all extra spaces from each string, otherwise the same string with different spacings will be treated as different categories which should not be the case.","e4d04327":"### Insights\n* vehicles of `usa` has less mpg on an average as compared to japan & europe.\n* vehicles of `usa` has more displacement, horsepower and weight as compared to japan & europe.\n* all vehicles has relatively same acceleration irrespective of the origin but distribution of acceleration from `usa` is more spreaded due to the fact that it comprises a lot vehicles compared to other.","5b45dc42":"**Now we analyze relationship between different numerical attributes**","b78794d1":"    Let's analyse car_company\n    \nAs `car_company` contains a lot categories and most of them has very low proportion so we will analyse only the top 15 car companies.","86518474":"### Conclusion\n* Japan is leading in case of mpg level with most of it's vehicles having high mpg_level. It has more than twice vehicles with high mpg compared to other origins.\n* **It seems like as number of cylinders increases mpg decreases generally.**","560c7d23":"### Insights\n* `acceleration` is the only distribution which is gaussian. There are few values in acceleration which lie outside the whiskers(the bars extending outwards from the box), these are fliers\/outliers.\n* distributions of `mpg` & `weight` seems to be `right-skewed gaussian`.\n* distributions of `displacement` & `horsepower` seems to be far from gaussian.\n\nCurrently we are analysing the distributions just from plots, in the next phase(statistical analysis) we will do hypothesis testing for the normality of these distributions.","78bdc60e":"### Insights\n* `origin` is highly imbalanced, `usa` alone consists of 62.5% of data whereas `japan` & `europe` are having similar proportion. We will see this dominance in future analysis. `We will try to find the reason for this in our further analysis.`\n* `cylinders` is highly imbalanced, `4` alone consists of 50.77% of data. Whereas `8` & `6` are nearly in same proportion but `3` & `5` collectively accounts for only 7 entries i.e., 1.8% of entire data. We will see this huge proportional imbalance in `cylinders` in future analysis.\n* `mpg_level` is highly imbalanced, `medium` alone consists of 52.3% of data while `low` & `high` are in the same proportion. This dominance is due the fact of our thresholding while manufacturing this feature because the medium range is broader hence it consists of more data points. It won't be there in original `mpg` feature as it is continous.\n* `model_year` is considerably balanced which is good.","0b862ade":"### Insights\n* In every region there is a positive relation b\/w weight & horsepower.\n* vehicles with low mpg has high weight & horsepower.\n* vehicles with more cylinders has high weight & horsepower.","d1d7f1eb":"### Data Description\n\nThe data we are using for EDA is the [auto mpg](https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/auto+mpg) dataset taken from UCI repository.\n\nInformation regarding data<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Title:** Auto-Mpg Data<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Number of Instances:** 398<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Number of Attributes:** 9 including the class attribute<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Attribute Information:**\n    1. mpg:           continuous\n    2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete\n    3. displacement:  continuous\n    4. horsepower:    continuous\n    5. weight:        continuous\n    6. acceleration:  continuous\n    7. model year:    multi-valued discrete\n    8. origin:        multi-valued discrete\n    9. car name:      string (unique for each instance)\n    \n    All the attributes are self-explanatory.\n\nThis data is not complex and is good for analysis as it has a nice blend of both categorical and numerical attributes.\n\n<sup>[data source](https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/auto+mpg)<sup>","864a0fea":"    Great this is what we wished and indeed we get.
