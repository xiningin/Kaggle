The rest will be replace with median values.","cd3072f1":"Low income countries tend to have a higher level of wasting. As we all know, wasting is caused by numerous factors and one of them is low energy intake. \nPeople in these countries tend to survive on less than 3 meals and hence suffer from severe malnutrition. Their bodies switched to survival mode and their muscles are striped off to preserve energy.","708a23de":"We can see that a huge portion of countries fall between upper middle incoome and lower middle income.","b997d12e":"## Stunting\n- Stunting is the impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. ","a27c4ee1":"![](https:\/\/i.makeagif.com\/media\/11-19-2015\/Tzr09f.gif)\n# Introduction\nAccording to World Health Organisation (WHO), malnutrition comes in numerous forms. This includes:\n* Undernutrition caused by wasting, stunting and underweight\n* Inadequate vitamins and minerals \n* Overweight and obesity\n\nAn estimate of 1.9 billion adults were overweight or obese, while approximately 462 millions of them were underweight. WHO also estimated that 45% death among children were caused by undernutrition. This mostly happen in low and middle-income countries. Shockingly, the amount of obesity and overweight issues were on the rise in these same counties. In this exploratory data analysis, we will dive deeper into the topic and identify key issues that lead to the prevalance of malnutrition across the world.
