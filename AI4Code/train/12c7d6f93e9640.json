They in fact belong to the image segmentation problem. That is, not only the roofs need to be detected but also the entire roof regions need to be segmented from the rest.","53408e41":"About a year ago I applied for a deep learning position in computer vision and I was assigned a task. The task is to detect house roofs on satellite images. Back then I was a newbie in computer vision and I had absolutely no idea that it was an object detection problem. \n\n\nWhen I received the task, I was given sets of images. One set is the label and the other one is the original images. They look like this.\n\n"}}
