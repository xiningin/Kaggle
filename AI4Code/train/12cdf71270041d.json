Though most models these days will be built on top of a pretrained base, it certain circumstances a smaller custom convnet might still be preferable -- such as with a smaller or unusual dataset or when computing resources are very limited. As you saw here, for certain problems they can perform just as well as a pretrained model.\n\n# Keep Going #\n\nContinue on to [**Lesson 6**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ryanholbrook\/data-augmentation), where you'll learn a widely-used technique that can give a boost to your training data: **data augmentation**.","fe3ba7a0":"# Design a Convnet #\n\nLet's design a convolutional network with a block architecture like we saw in the tutorial. The model from the example had three blocks, each with a single convolutional layer. Its performance on the \"Car or Truck\" problem was okay, but far from what the pretrained VGG16 could achieve. It might be that our simple network lacks the ability to extract sufficiently complex features. We could try improving the model either by adding more blocks or by adding convolutions to the blocks we have.\n\nLet's go with the second approach. We'll keep the three block structure, but increase the number of `Conv2D` layer in the second block to two, and in the third block to three.\n\n<figure>\n<!-- <img src=\".\/images\/2-convmodel-2.png\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Diagram of a convolutional model.\"> -->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Vko6nCK.png\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Diagram of a convolutional model.\">\n<\/figure>\n\n# 1) Define Model #\n\nGiven the diagram above, complete the model by defining the layers of the third block."}}
