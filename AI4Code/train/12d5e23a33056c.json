Data and science are our tools; law enforcement and communities are our partners. Our aim is to bridge the divide created by communication problems, suffering and generational mistrust, and forge a path towards public safety, community trust, and racial equity.\n\nPolice departments across the United States have joined our National Justice Database, the first and largest collection of standardized police behavioral data. In exchange for unprecedented access to their records (such as use of force incidents, vehicle stops, pedestrian stops, calls for service, and crime data), our scientists use advanced analytics to diagnose disparities in policing, shed light on police behavior, and provide actionable recommendations. Our highly-detailed custom reports help police departments improve public safety, restore trust, and do their work in a way that aligns with their own values.","5a947b07":"#### We are trying to find the insights from given data.

We look for factors that drive racial disparities in policing by analyzing census and police department deployment data. The ultimate goal is to inform police agencies where they can make improvements by identifying deployment areas where racial disparities exist and are not explainable by crime rates and poverty levels. The biggest challenge is automating the combination of police data, census-level data, and other socioeconomic factors.","10e96409":"*  Loading important library for projects","dc478eb8":"## Now let us load the File For Dept_11-00091\n#### Loading the Poverty File","d1f0a553":"### Reading the Data from Files"}}
