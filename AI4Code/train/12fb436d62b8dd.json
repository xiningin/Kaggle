Despite its simplicity, KNN can outperform more powerful classifiers and is used in a variety of applications. The idea behind KNN classifier algorithm is to find K predefined number of training samples that are closest in the distance to a new point & predict a label for our new point using these samples.","f07078df":"### Importing packages","7ce283ea":"### Data Spliting"}}
