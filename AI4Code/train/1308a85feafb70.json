This very well reflects his balanced overall game","6b313a15":"This may be an obvious fact but more minutes played generally means more points scored for all three players. \n\nWhile all three players have averaged heavy amount of minutes in the playoffs, Kobe had many games where he logged short minutes early in his career (leading to lower points scored)","11d95ddf":"First we must separte the win\/loss plus\/minus values to just win or loss","ad16335f":"All three players have dominated scoring in the playoffs. ","51975d9a":"True shooting percentage is a statistic that is used to find a more accurate representation of a player\u2019s shooting percentage than the more basic stats. The formula to calculate this is as follows\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)","57e86f6f":"Even in the NBA Finals, the three players have delivered elite scoring performances. \n\n*Some Observations*:\n* **Jordan**: Winning 6 for 6 in his NBA Finals, it seems that Jordan's scoring averages dipped as he aged during his second threepeat (still very impressive numbers)\n* **Kobe**: we can clearly see the difference when Kobe was the second option to Shaq in his first 4 NBA Finals compared to when he was the first option in his next 3\n* **LeBron**: LeBron has always been the man for his team but he seems to improve his scoring in the Finals as his career progresses\n\nIn the visualizations we can recall some memorable games:\n* **Jordan**'s 55 points versus the Pheonix Suns in game 4 of 1993 NBA Finals\n* **Kobe**'s 2 points after suffering an ankle injury in 9 minutes versus Indiana Pacers in game 2 of 2001 NBA Finals (forced to miss game 3)\n* **Kobe**'s 40 points (Kobe's Finals career high) against Orlando Magic in game 1 of 2009 NBA Finals. He was on a mission that year\n* **LeBron**'s 51 points versus the Golden State Warriors in game 1 of 2018 NBA Finals (lol JR Smith) \n* **LeBron**'s 8 point dud versus the Dallas Mavericks in game 4 of 2011 NBA Finals \n\n","e8f4983d":"# Clean data and concatenate tables\nFrom the raw tables above, we see that the date column is incorrectly named (column names are currently set as each player's first playoff year) \n\nA player name column must be added as well to allow us to identify each player's rows for when we eventually concatenate the tables to make comparisons\n\n","c821a46e":"LeBron James has played the most amount of Playoff games (thanks largely to his impressive streak of 8 straight NBA Finals appearances from 2011 to 2018)","f630dc64":"Since early in their careers, these three players have participated in multiple playoff games. \n\nWe will observe the changes of scoring numbers throughout the years","76148afc":"we also notice that the home vs. away column is currently unnamed. we replace *null* values with '**home**' and *@* values with '**away**'","87dbdfc9":"Some observations: \n* **Jordan**: MJ put up monsterous scoring numbers in his early years but those early averages are on a small sample size as his teams would be eliminated in early rounds. As he adopted the triangle offense system which emphasized player and ball movement, his playoff scoring averages dipped but it resulted in multiple deep runs (and championships) in the 90's \n* **Kobe**: unlike the other two players, we can clearly see that Kobe Bryant was *not* the number 1 scoring option for his team in his early years (beginning of Kobe\/Shaq era) but became a brute force as he gradually reached his prime. We can see the Black Mamba taking his scoring to another level after Shaquille O'Neal left the Lakers in 2004 \n* **Lebron**: LeBron's playoff scoring averages have been fairly consistent compared to the two above and continues to be dominant even to this day","fe39f83c":"## iiii) Scoring vs. Home\/Away\nIn this section, we will see if playing in home games versus away games have any impact on the scoring performances of these three players "}}
