One question on my mind draws circles: **What happened to the loss after each batch during one epoch?** Does it converge? Has our model started to learn or does nothing happen? Currently we obtain a history after calling fit_generator, but this history only contains the loss of train and validation data after one epoch.

The train data is splitted into k chunks and each chunk is used once for testing the prediction performance whereas the others are used for training. As our targets show relationships seemed to be grouped somehow the performance per test chunk probably highly depends on the target distribution per test chunk. For example there could be chunks with very seldom targets that may obtain a bad score and some chunks with very common targets and a very good score. To reduce this effect, we will **repeat the K-Fold several times** and look at scoing distributions in the end.","d8fb466e":"### Our goal\n\n* Predict various protein structures in cellular images\n* there are 28 different target proteins\n* multiple proteins can be present in one image (multilabel classification)\n* 27 different cell types of highly different morphology","813c7c95":"## Loading packages and data","78541f20":"Ok, great, now we can directly work with binary target values. Let's create a dataframe for the test ids as well that we will use later to make our submission.","f7eae727":"### Dropout Layer\n\nI often read that dropout helps to avoid overfitting but for me it seems that there is one more useful advantage: Imagine the cat-problem above - Given a batch full of cats we only compute gradients for making the predictions of cats better. And this can be done to the detriment of the dogs as both classes share weights. Hence changing the weights with batches of imbalanced classes can lead to jiggles. \n\nNow let's consider a dropout-layer: It randomly selects a given percentage of input neurons and drops them during the current training step. Taking a look at [this paper](http:\/\/www.jmlr.org\/papers\/volume15\/srivastava14a\/srivastava14a.pdf) (linked at keras documentation) you can see that the forward and backward propagation is done only with this reduced, thinned kind of network. In our case this means that each learning step some weights will be untouched and not used to compute gradients. This is great as this would mean that some weight that could be good for predicting dogs will not change after we process a batch with cats only. ;-)\n\nConsequently if you have a **problem with overfitting** (learning too much out of your training data and loosing generalization performance) **or you have very small, imbalanced batches you should consider dropout** as a strategy. But before turning happy and starting to use dropout frequently, we should think about its downside: Dropping neruons during training and learning with a thinned kind of networks means that **we freeze learning each step a bit**. And the randomness of frosty the dropout snowman can turn to a problem difficult to graps: Which neurons should be dropped, are there some for which dropping is good and some for which it is bad? After which layer in our network does it make sense to use it?Perhaps it would have been better to use some neurons that were dropped a random dropout session during one batch learning step... we don't know. Perhaps we have prevented the success of a learning step given one batch and improved learning given another batch. The information flow through the network is somehow a blackbox for us and this randomness of thinned network learning makes it more difficult to understand what's going on. \n\nYou can see that in my baseline model I'm already using dropout. This choice was somehow arbitrarily as I used an example network that can be found to classify mnist digits as a starting point.

For these classes the prediction will be very difficult as we have only a few examples that may not cover all variabilities and as our model probably will be confused during ins learning process by the major classes.

We gained more learning speed but payed with a reduced gradient quality. Before increasing the batch size again and waiting too long for predictions we might improve by choosing another way:\n\n1. Weight regularization\n2. Gradient clipping\n\nThese two will be the next improvement steps. Nonetheless, one question remains: Has our model started learning?

It looks like if the cells are of different types. This is just an assumption but perhaps one could use the red channel information to reveal cell types. \n* Clicking this code tab again with other targets you can observe that the images can contain different cell densities. **Sometimes the whole image is covered with cells and sometimes there are only a few**. In addition we can see that **some images have higher values whereas others are sallow with overall low values**.

Thank you very much! We can easily add it to our model.\n* But even with that score we should be careful! We have 28 different classes that are **very different in their frequency of being present**.  In addition we have to deal with **highly imbalanced classes per single target**. Even for the most common target nucleoplasm there are only 40 % of samples that show it and 60 % not. This imbalance becomes even more dramatic for seldom targets like rods and rings. We should **attach more importance to true positives**. \n* Well, there is **one problem with the competition score** that we can use to measure the performance of our model: **The f1 mean**. The mean is not robust towards outliers and consequently not very informative to understand the distribution of f1 scores for each target class. Perhaps we will make nice predictions for Cytosol but bad ones for Nucleoplasmn... who knows?

For this purpose we're going to extend the class we have already written. Taking a closer look at the base generator you can see that there is just one line code in def data_generation(self, list_IDs_temp) we have to change, namely the part with y[i] = ... inside the for loop over temp list ids (image identifiers of the batch). To make things easier, I added a small method to the DataGenerator we already had:\n\n```\ndef get_targets_per_image(self, identifier):\n        return self.labels.loc[self.labels.Id==identifier].drop(\n                [\"Id\", \"Target\", \"number_of_targets\"], axis=1).values\n```\n\nThis method just avoids the direct pass to y[i], the targets per image in a batch.

Consequently in original gradient descent we need to pass the whole dataset once for just one single update step of gradient descent. As our initial weights are not sufficent to solve the classification task we need many such update steps. **But what if the dataset it too large to wait a long time just for one of these steps?**\n\nPerhaps it would be sufficient and already good to use only some $M < N$ of the $N$ samples to compute the gradients $\\partial_{w_{i,j}} E$:\n\n$$ \\partial_{w_{i,j}} E = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\partial_{w_{i,j}} E_{m} $$\n\nThis way **we could use only a batch of samples, compute the gradients and perform the update of weights**. After that we continue by computing the gradients with the next batch. This could be done in sequence of samples or random with replacement. This means that we already start learning without passing the whole dataset. In my case I chose a batch_size of 200. With a total number of samples of around 20000 in my training set this means that I have already done 200 weight updates. **After doing so I have used each sample once and this means the whole dataset was passed through gradient descent**. As far as I know this means, **one epoch**. In addition we can now say that we want to shuffle the samples before doing weight updates after each batch again in the next epoch. This way our model sees a different set, computes some other gradients and hence the loss minimziation could be more robust.

All probabilities are close to zero and there are only a few with targets where our model predicted a protein structure with higher than 10 %.\n* If we take a look at the true target label count we can see that most of our targets are filled with zero. This corresponds to an absence of corresponding target proteins. This makes sense: For each image we have a high probability to contain either 1 or 2 target protein structures. Their label values are one whereas all others are zero. \n* Consequently our high accuracy belongs to the high correct prediction of the absence of target proteins.

Looking into the data description of this competition we can find that:\n\n* Each image is actually splitted into 4 different image files. \n* These 4 files correspond to 4 different filter:\n    * a **green** filter for the **target protein structure** of interest\n    * **blue** landmark filter for the **nucleus**\n    * **red** landmark filter for **microtubules**\n    * **yellow** landmark filter for the **endoplasmatic reticulum**\n* Each image is of size 512 x 512","1f16f411":"Let's try to visualize specific target groups. **In this example we will see images that contain the protein structures lysosomes or endosomes**. Set target values of your choice and the target group iterator will collect all images that are subset of your choice:","5cf93c97":"### More epochs!!! \n\nImprove! :-) We can already see that we might need **more than 1 epoch to learn the pattern in the data**. Computing the gradient with batches is a stochastic process: Depending on the batch samples the gradients may sometimes lead to some good update directions in weight space that points to some minimum of loss.... and sometimes they could lead to the opposite. Well this really depends on the samples within one batch. This becomes more robust with **more samples per batch.** But then we will **need even more epochs** as we make less weight updata aka learning steps! But even if this stochastic gradient descent looks wiggly it has an advantage too: It can escape from local minima of the loss function. That's nice. \n\nBefore we improve the model using more epochs and smaller batches, let's **implement a new feature: a loss callback**. This way we can see if the loss decreases during weight update steps! And we can see if we need more epochs or if the loss has already converged and settled down. ","438c0538":"## Which targets are correlated?\n\nLet's see if we find some correlations between our targets. This way we may already see that some proteins often come together.","c778b623":"## How can we tackle gradient jiggles?\n\nLet's try to dive deeper into the problem. We compute the gradients with respect to the weights after processing each batch this way:\n\n$$ \\partial_{w_{i,j}} E = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\partial_{w_{i,j}} E_{m} $$","59420e44":"## How many targets are most common?","cb227165":"In addition we like to make predictions for the validation data and for the test submission data. For the test submission data we need to create a new instance of an ImagePreprocessor with same model parameters. During call of predict generator its basepath of the images is changed from train to testpath:","526c54b5":"Next we have to setup our data generators: We need two during training, one for the train images and one for the validation images. This way we can pass both to the model and observe how the validation performance changes during training on the train images. This way we can see the point of change, when train loss is decreasing and validation loss is increasing. In this situation the model learns too much details out of the training images. It suffers under overfitting and looses it's ability to make good predictions on the validation images. ","ea7c7664":"## Extract train targets","b792261c":"Jeahy! This looks far better than the distributions we obtained with the baseline model! :-) **Thus increasing epochs while decreasing the batch size helped our model as we made more learning steps.** But... we can see a lot of noise after 100 batches during loss decrease. Consequently we make large jumps in weight space with each update step batch per batch. That's not nice! Sometimes these jumps could even lead to exploding losses as well. Then the jump was so big that we escaped from nice regions that lead to a local minimum of loss. ","ad2c30af":"### Collecting ideas\n\nNext we need to setup a simple baseline model. This need not be very complex or very good. Its our first attempt to play with and to figure out how to improve. For this purpose let's use the deep learning library [keras](https:\/\/keras.io\/). This tools makes it easy for us to build and train neural networks. First of all, we should collect some ideas:\n\n* To **stay simple let's use only the green channel image of our images per id**. The competition says that it shows the stained target proteins and consequently it's hopefully the most informative one. The other images are like references showing microtubules, nucleus and endoplasmatic reticulum. We don't acutally now how informative they are and in our current state they would blow up our neural network with a huge amount of network weigths that we might not need.\n* Let's use **generators to only load data images of our batch and not all in once**. Using keras fit_generator, evaluate_generator and predict_generator we can directly connect them to keras without worrying much about how keras does its job. For this purpose I highly follow a descprition of a post in the www for which you will find the link below.\n* It could be advantegous to write a **small class that does simple preprocessing per image.** This way we can easily change something of this phase without producing chaos in the model itself or during data loading.   \n* I'm going to use a **small class that hold parameters that are used or shared between the data loader, the image preprocessor and the baseline model**. Passing an instance of this class to them reduced the risk of setting different parameters and obtaining mismatch errors for example during build & compile of the network layers. \n","062d5895":"You can see that we have lost a lot of information by downscaling the image!","4e22f2da":"Ok, now we will create an instance of this class and pass it to the DataGenerator, the BaseLineModel and the ImagePreprocessor.","1d9b5d0e":"Looking at the sum we can see one disadvantage... it's mainly driven by high contributions. **An image in the batch that causes very high positive or negative gradients for the weight $w_{i,j}$ have more impact on the overall gradient than images with low absolute values**. This can be bad especially in the case of outlier images that are not representative to explain the pattern in the data. Consequently our model may try to learn from exotics. In addition we have to be very **careful with small batches as its target distribution might not reflect the overall pattern**. Imagine we would try to distinguish dogs from cats. With a batch size of 10 we are likely to fill up these places with imbalanced targets. For example it could be occupied with cats only. This would yield gradients that try to improve the detection of cats thereby changing the weights we might need to identify dogs. Hence beside image outliers the target distribution itself influences the learning as well. This can cause jiggles as well. One step we try to improve nucleoplasmn and the next perhaps cytosol but with a downgrade of the nucleoplasmn predictions and the next steps it could be the other way round. \n\nHow to solve this jiggle-wiggle problem?\n\nWell, first of all we might choose a higher batch_size again :-) Decreasing the batch size we made a tradeoff: We increased the learning speed but increased the risk of low quality gradients. Hence before playing with further strategies, we should make a step backwards again. With a batch_size of 128 and number of epochs 10, we obtain these losses:","21af10ff":"Our last losses were obtained by using dropout with high percentage (25 % and 50 %) of dropped neurons. **What will happen if we do not use our dropout layers?**\n","9469fd5f":"### Lysosomes and endosomes\n\nLet's start with these high correlated features!"}}
