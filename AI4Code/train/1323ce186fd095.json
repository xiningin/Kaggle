Combinations of classes\n\nWe already have a feeling for the volume of images with a single class. What do the combinations of these classes look like? ","0f241ff3":"Now looking at the sample submission, we realize this is actually not a multi-label classification, but instead an instance segmentation task. For each image, we are being asked to segment each single cell contained in the image, identify the class of that cell, and submit a string containing:\n1. The class of each cell\n2. Confidence of the class prediction\n3. Segmentation mask for each cell, encoded in a fancy scheme\n\nThe fact that our training data is image-level classes, and our task is to predict cell masks and their corresponding classes, explains why the organizers call it a *weakly supervised multi-label classification problem*.\nAlso, the following comments from the organizers are important: \n- some cells can be associated with multiple classes - in that case, we need to predict separate detections for each class using the same mask\n\nBased on an early comment by the host, I had initially assumed that confidence is not relevant and can always be set to 1.

Looking at the chart below, we can see it's an imbalanced dataset and labels 11 and 18 are going to be especially problematic. ","06946222":"What do these labels represent? The descriptions below are taken from [this notebook shared by the organizers](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/lnhtrang\/single-cell-patterns).\n\n| Label | Name | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| 0. | Nucleoplasm | The nucleus is found in the center of cell and can be identified with the help of the signal in the blue nucleus channel. A staining of the nucleoplasm may include the whole nucleus or of the nucleus without the regions known as nucleoli (Class 2). |\n| 1. | Nuclear membrane | The nuclear membrane appears as a thin circle around the nucleus. It is not perfectly smooth and sometimes it is also possible to see the folds of the membrane as small circles or dots inside the nucleus. |\n| 2. | Nucleoli | Nucleoli can be seen as slightly elongated circular areas in the nucleoplasm, which usually display a much weaker staining in the blue DAPI channel. The number and size of nucleoli varies between cell types. |\n| 3. | Nucleoli fibrillar center | Nucleoli fibrillary center can appear as a spotty cluster or as a single bigger spot in the nucleolus, depending on the cell type. |\n| 4. | Nuclear speckles | Nuclear speckles can be seen as irregular and mottled spots inside the nucleoplasm. |\n| 5. | Nuclear bodies | Nuclear bodies are visible as distinct spots in the nucleoplasm. They vary in shape, size and numbers depending on the type of bodies as well as cell type, but are usually more rounded compared to nuclear speckles. |\n| 6. | Endoplasmic reticulum | The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is recognized by a network-like staining in the cytosol, which is usually stronger close to the nucleus and weaker close to the edges of the cell. The ER can be identified with the help of the staining in the yellow ER channel. |\n| 7. | Golgi apparatus | The Golgi apparatus is a rather large organelle that is located next to the nucleus, close to the centrosome, from which the microtubules in the red channel originate. It has a folded ribbon-like appearance, but the shape and size can vary between cell types, and in response to cellular various processes. |\n| 8. | Intermediate filaments | Intermediate filaments often exhibit a slightly tangled structure with strands crossing every so often. They can appear similar to microtubules, but do not match well with the staining in the red microtubule channel. Intermediate filaments may extend through the whole cytosol, or be concentrated in an area close to the nucleus. |\n| 9. | Actin filaments | Actin filaments can be seen as long and rather straight bundles of filaments or as branched networks of thinner filaments. They are usually located close to the edges of the cells. |\n| 10. | Microtubules | Microtubules are seen as thin strands that stretch throughout the whole cell. It is almost always possible to detect the center from which they all originate (the centrosome). And yes, as you might have guessed, this overlaps the staining in the red channel. |\n| 11. | Mitotic spindle | The mitotic spindle can be seen as an intricate structure of microtubules radiating from each of the centrosomes at opposite ends of a dividing cell (mitosis). At this stage, the chromatin of the cell is condensed, as visible by intense DAPI staining. The size and exact shape of the mitotic spindle changes during mitotic progression, clearly reflecting the different stages of mitosis. |\n| 12. | Centrosome | This class includes centrosomes and centriolar satellites. They can be seen as a more or less distinct staining of a small area at the origin of the microtubules, close to the nucleus. When a cell is dividing, the two centrosomes move to opposite ends of the cell and form the poles of the mitotic spindle. |\n| 13. | Plasma membrane | This class includes plasma membrane and cell junctions. Both are at the outer edge of the cell. Plasma membrane sometimes appears as a more or less distinct edge around the cell, occasionally with characteristic protrusions or ruffles. In some cell lines, the staining can be uniform across the entire cell. Cell junctions can be observed at contact sites between neighboring cells. |\n| 14. | Mitochondria | Mitochondria are small rod-like units in the cytosol, which are often distributed in a thread-like pattern along microtubules. |\n| 15. | Aggresome | An aggresome can be seen as a dense cytoplasmic inclusion, which is usually found close to the nucleus, in a region where the microtubule network is disrupted. |\n| 16. | Cytosol | The cytosol extends from the plasma membrane to the nuclear membrane. It can appear smooth or granular, and the staining is often stronger close to the nucleus. |\n| 17. | Vesicles and punctate cytosolic patterns | This class includes small circular compartments in the cytosol: Vesicles, Peroxisomes (lipid metabolism), Endosomes (sorting compartments), Lysosomes (degradation of molecules or eating up dead molecules), Lipid droplets (fat storage), Cytoplasmic bodies (distinct granules in the cytosol). They are highly dynamic, varying in numbers and size in response to environmental and cellular cues. They can be round or more elongated. |\n| 18. | Negative | This class include negative stainings and unspecific patterns. This means that the cells have no green staining (negative), or have staining but no pattern can be deciphered from the staining (unspecific). |","9cf1ae57":"[](http:\/\/)# Human Protein Atlas - Single Cell Classification EDA \n\n\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u7c7b","e6449d9f":"Let's again try to understand the image data provided, and see if we can visualize it. All images have 4 channels: \n- Red (Microtubules)\n- Green (Protein of interest)\n- Blue (Nucleus)\n- Yellow (Endoplasmic reticulum)\n\nWhat does [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cytoskeleton) tell us these channels represent?\n- **Microtubules** are polymers of tubulin that form part of the cytoskeleton and provide structure and shape to eukaryotic cells. Microtubules can grow as long as 50 micrometres and are highly dynamic. The microtubule cytoskeleton is involved in the transport of material within cells, carried out by motor proteins that move on the surface of the microtubule. They are involved in maintaining the structure of the cell and, together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments, they form the cytoskeleton...\n- **Nucleus** is a membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others including osteoclasts have many. The cell nucleus contains all of the cell's genome, except for the small amount of mitochondrial DNA. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression. The nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell.\n- The **endoplasmic reticulum** (ER) is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell, and has many other important functions such as protein folding. It is a type of organelle made up of two subunits \u2013 rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). The endoplasmic reticulum is found in most eukaryotic cells and forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs known as cisternae (in the RER), and tubular structures in the SER.\n- **Protein of interest** - I still need to understand this better, I assume the researchers are interested in certain types of proteins, which are not disclosed, and these proteins are marked in this channel.\uff08\u5176\u5b9e\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u522b\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u6e05\u695a\u7684\u77e5\u9053\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u610f\u601d\uff09\n\nLet's see an example of each channel below. \n\n\nR\u8868\u793a\u5fae\u7ba1\uff0cB\u8868\u793a\u7ec6\u80de\u6838\uff0cY\u8868\u793a\u5185\u8d28\u7f51\uff0cG\u8868\u793a\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28","bf1286e9":"Here's a link to [some tips on mAP from @its7171](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/hpa-single-cell-image-classification\/discussion\/217158):\n>* The lower the confidence threshold, the higher the mAP we will get. \u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u8d8a\u4f4e\uff0cmAP\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff1f\n>* Class dependence is linear. \n>* small sample class is equaly important as bit class. \u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5927\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7c7b\u522b***\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981***","d74e23ea":"# 5.

However, the dataset comprises 17 different cell types of highly different morphology, which affect the protein patterns of the different organelles. All image samples are represented by four filters (stored as individual files), the protein of interest (green) plus three cellular landmarks: nucleus (blue), microtubules (red), endoplasmic reticulum (yellow). The green filter should hence be used to predict the label, and the other filters are used as references.

That is to say, each training image contains a number of cells that have collectively been labeled as described above and the prediction task is to look at images of the same type and predict the labels of each individual cell within those images. As the training labels are a collective label for all the cells in an image, it means that each labeled pattern can be seen in the image but not necessarily that each cell within the image expresses the pattern. This imprecise labeling is what we refer to as weak. During the challenge you will both need to segment the cells in the images and predict the labels of those segmented cells.

So you are correct in assuming that the labels only apply to the cells where green is present (as the green is the protein). If there are 4 cells and 3 have green staining and the image-level labels are Mitochondria, and Nucleoplasm.\nCell 1: Green looks to be in the Mitochondria. Therefore, the cell level is Mitochondria.\nCell 2: Green looks to be in the Nucleoplasm. Therefore, the cell level is Nucleoplasm.\nCell 3: Green looks to be in the Nucleoplasm and Mitochondria. Therefore, the cell level label is Nucleoplasm and Mitochondria\nCell 4: No green or green is not present in any organelle. Therefore, the cell level label is Negative.

For example, the first image in this section has image-level label Nucleoplasm & Mitochrondria, and all the single cells in this image display both patterns. For other images (especially in the test set), each cell will have only a part of the image-level label, or completely new label (18 Negative). For example, the middle image in this section has image-level label ER & Golgi, but the single cells in this image have either only ER or only Golgi (part of image-level label). And the first image in this section has image-level label Nucleoplasm, Cytokinetic bridge and Mitotic spindle. However, many individual cells only have Nucleoplasm as label, and many don\u2019t have green staining, hence they are Negative.

This is called single cell variability (SCV), and has been observed across images in HPA and been described in numerous scientific publications. The phenomenon of how genetically identical cells can show functional heterogeneity (for example in response to drug treatment), is poorly understood. We want to study this observed variation to better understand the functional heterogeneity of cells. Therefore a single cell classifier is more helpful than a whole image classifier (as developed in the previous challenge).

We grow cells in our lab and take some of them for each imaging experiment. This means that we will have multiple images from the same cell line. It does not mean that we have the same cells between images, as different cells will be sampled for experiments. \nAs for if characteristics of the cell line would improve the classification accuracy, that is certainly an interesting theory. In one of our previous papers (https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/nbt.4225), we did show that including different cell lines in our training data helped accuracy across the board (Figure 5C of that paper). This could mean cell line information may be helpful for a neural network, but we have not tested, much less proved, that theory. If you think it will be helpful, feel free to try it.

In fact this is what happens in the biological image analysis space right now with individual deep learning models for Mitochondria, Golgi etc. There are more considerations that we took into account when designing this challenge. We want to study the integrated cell, with organelles in relation to it. Cell segmentation task can be considered an auxiliary task (depending on your approach to modelling of course) on a generalized deep learning model of the cell.

This duplication only happens with the 9, 13, & 17 labels (Actin Filaments, Plasma Membrane, & Vesicles) >>>> In this competition, we merged some spatially similar (and functionally related) patterns into the same class. This was mentioned on the Single Cell Pattern notebook. The duplicates simply results from conversion code. For example, if an image has image-level label as Vesicles and Peroxisomes, then the code results in 17|17.

During annotation, the image-level labels are set per sample (i.e per a group of up to 6 images from the same sample). This means that the labels present in the majority of the images will be annotated. For negative samples it is not uncommon that lets say 4 images show no staining, while the remaining 2 show some unspecific staining or some granular pattern. If you compare the image-level label with the precise pattern observed in any given cell from this group of images, the label will be correct for the vast majority of cells, but perhaps not for all of them (as in your example 1 and 3 above).

Hence the accuracy of these labels is much better, and will be correct for each cell in every image. The statement below made by Trang Le, @lnhtrang, in our notebook explaining the patterns is correct for how the test set was annotated. *This class (Negative) includes negative stainings and unspecific patterns. This means that the cells have no green staining (negative) or have staining but no pattern can be deciphered from the staining (unspecific).* [link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/hpa-single-cell-image-classification\/discussion\/220748)\n\n> More negative images can be found in the HPA public image data (external data), where they are annotated as \"No Staining\". [link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/hpa-single-cell-image-classification\/discussion\/220748)\n\n> How to recognize unspecific patterns Unspecific patterns arise from the use of antibody reagents that do not function well, and do not bind to their intended target protein, but rather to all cellular structures (sometimes excluding the nucleolus). The second example from the top, and the cells of weaker intensity in the top image, are text-book examples of this.
