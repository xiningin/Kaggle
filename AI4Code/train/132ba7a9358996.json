With one probe attached is the best data. This is what we should plan to use from now on for recordings. That was all I wanted to do in this notebook, but I'll look at some more specific portions of the one probe recordings to see how clear background rhythms are.","788f1fcc":"The recording lasts about 1:40 minutes.

At first, there are no probes attached, so any variation is random environmental changes. Then, one probe is attached. Later, two probes are attached. This is the part of the dataset I'm interested, though afterwards, there are still potentially points of interest.\n\nI'm using this notebook to determine whether one probe or two probes is better. I'll have to separate the data visually, because there are large voltage spikes when a probe is added.
