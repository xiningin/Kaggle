Take your time with these, Matplotlib can be tricky to understand at first. These are relatively simple plots, but they can be hard if this is your first time with matplotlib, feel free to reference the solutions as you go along.\n\nAlso don't worry if you find the matplotlib syntax frustrating, we actually won't be using it that often throughout the course, we will switch to using seaborn and pandas built-in visualization capabilities. But, those are built-off of matplotlib, which is why it is still important to get exposure to it!\n\n** * NOTE: ALL THE COMMANDS FOR PLOTTING A FIGURE SHOULD ALL GO IN THE SAME CELL. SEPARATING THEM OUT INTO MULTIPLE CELLS MAY CAUSE NOTHING TO SHOW UP. * **\n\n# Exercises\n\nFollow the instructions to recreate the plots using this data:\n\n## Data","1d62e2e7":"** Now use x,y, and z arrays to recreate the plot below.
