In fact, a histogram is special kind of bar plot that splits your data into even intervals and displays how many rows are in each interval with bars. The only analytical difference is that instead of each bar representing a single value, it represents a range of values.\n\nHowever, histograms have one major shortcoming (the reason for our 200$ caveat earlier).

However, it can do more than load and transform your data: it can visualize it too! Indeed, the easy-to-use and expressive pandas plotting API is a big part of `pandas` popularity.\n\nIn this section we will learn the basic `pandas` plotting facilities, starting with the simplest type of visualization: single-variable or \"univariate\" visualizations. This includes basic tools like bar plots and line charts. Through these we'll get an understanding of `pandas` plotting library structure, and spend some time examining data types.","f98c12f3":"## Conclusion and exercise\n\nIn this section of the tutorial we learned about the handful of different kinds of data, and looked at some of the built-in tools that `pandas` provides us for plotting them.\n\nNow it's your turn!\n\nFor these exercises, we'll be working with the Pokemon dataset (because what goes together better than wine and Pokemon?).","4eaf45f9":"[Click here to move on to \"Bivariate plotting with pandas\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/bivariate-plotting-with-pandas\/).\n\nYou may also want to take a look at [the addendum on pie charts](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/data-visualization-addendum-pie-charts\/).","4bf0a7cc":"What does this plot tell us?

The easiest is to just do what I did: cut things off at a sensible level.\n\nThis phenomenon is known (statistically) as **skew**, and it's a fairly common occurance among interval variables.\n\nHistograms work best for interval variables without skew. They also work really well for ordinal categorical variables like `points`:","df74047f":"A line chart can pass over any number of many individual values, making it the tool of first choice for distributions with many unique values or categories.\n\nHowever, line charts have an important weakness: unlike bar charts, they're not appropriate for nominal categorical data. While bar charts distinguish between every \"type\" of point line charts mushes them together. So a line chart asserts an order to the values on the horizontal axis, and the order won\u2019t make sense with some data. After all, a \"descent\" from California to Washington to Tuscany doesn't mean much!\n\nLine charts also make it harder to distinguish between individual values.\n\nIn general, if your data can fit into a bar chart, just use a bar chart!","0ac64a87":"The frequency of Pokemon by HP stat total:","b274c34c":"## Quick break: bar or line\n\nLet's do a quick exercise. Suppose that we're interested in counting the following variables:\n\n1. The number of tubs of ice cream purchased by flavor, given that there are 5 different flavors.\n2. The average number of cars purchased from American car manufacturers in Michigan.\n3. Test scores given to students by teachers at a college, on a 0-100 scale.\n4.

In this context, they can be used interchangably.","57ed0d21":"## Interval data\n\nLet's move on by looking at yet another type of data, an **interval variable**.\n\nExamples of interval variables are the wind speed in a hurricane, shear strength in concrete, and the temperature of the sun. An interval variable goes beyond an ordinal categorical variable: it has a *meaningful* order, in the sense that we can quantify what the difference between two entries is itself an interval variable.\n\nFor example, if I say that this sample of water is -20 degrees Celcius, and this other sample is 120 degrees Celcius, then I can quantify the difference between them: 140 degrees \"worth\" of heat, or such-and-such many joules of energy.\n\nThe difference can be qualitative sometimes. At a minimum, being able to state something so clearly feels a lot more \"measured\" than, say, saying you'll buy this wine and not that one, because this one scored a 92 on some taste test and that one only got an 85. More definitively, any variable that has infinitely many possible values is definitely an interval variable (why not 120.1 degrees? 120.001? 120.0000000001? Etc).\n\nLine charts work well for interval data. Bar charts don't\u2014unless your ability to measure it is very limited, interval data will naturally vary by quite a lot.\n\nLet's apply a new tool, the histogram, to an interval variable in our dataset, price (we'll cut price off at 200$ a bottle; more on why shortly).","38d2d4d1":"## Bar charts and categorical data\n\nBar charts are arguably the simplest data visualization.

Nominal categorical variables include things like countries, ZIP codes, types of cheese, and lunar landers. The other kind are **ordinal categories**: things that do make sense to compare, like earthquake magnitudes, housing complexes with certain numbers of apartments, and the sizes of bags of chips at your local deli.\n\nOr, in our case, the number of reviews of a certain score allotted by Wine Magazine:"}}
