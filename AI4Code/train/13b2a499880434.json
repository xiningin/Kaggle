This statistic is based on a Harvard Business School study . In a study by Statistic Brain, Startup Business Failure Rate by Industry, the failure rate of all U.S. companies after five years was over 50 percent, and over 70 percent after 10 years. \n\n- This study also asked company leadership the reason for business failure, giving a list of four main reasons for failure with sub-categories below those.\n\n    - Lack of focus\n    - Lack of motivation, commitment and passion\n    - Too much pride, resulting in an unwillingness to see or listen\n    - Taking advice from the wrong people\n    - Lacking good mentorship\n    - Lack of general and domain-specific business knowledge: finance, operations, and marketing\n    - Raising too much money too soon\n    - All of these focus on the decision-making of the entrepreneur and general business knowledge.\n\n\n- In another study, CB Insights looked at the post-mortems of 101 startups to compile a list of the Top 20 Reasons Startups Fail. The focus was on company level reasons for failure. I think this list is instructive, but each of these reasons for failure is due to a failure in leadership at some level.
