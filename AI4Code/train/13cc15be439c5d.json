However, instead of the text in each document being a string, we need the texts to be formatted as a list of words that make up the document. (Ideally, we would want real words and not numbers that stand for citations so we probably should clean this next step up eventually, but cest la vie). In other words, We are making a list of documents and then in the list of documents is lists of words in all_text_list. Just so you know the cool computational lingo, each words is also known as a token. ","50354f1e":"Now that all our libraries are loaded we need data.

For each document, we convert all the words into a vector based on the model. We then make a list of these word vectors and store them in the object `word_vector`. Since each word vector is of the same length, we take the average of all the vectors in each document to get a single vector to represent the document. We set this averaged vector to the document's paper id in the dictionary `document_dict`.

Using the context of each word, it predicts a vector that represents how it is used contextually. In other words, the vectors created by word2vec are highly dependent on the texts it is trained on.
