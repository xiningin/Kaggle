The rate of vaccination of this country is better than many countries like Japan, Vietnam or Thailand, but it is still not that much compared to countries like the UK, Germany, Israel,and the USA.","001b38fa":"As you can see from the graph, the daily cases peaked around April this year, which is the thrid wave following May 2020 and in the new year. The cases have been decreasing since the vaccination started recently. According to the news article I read, 60% of the eligible Canadians have gotten the vaccine and that is why the new daily cases decrease. \nSource: https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/7893216\/canada-covid-cases-may-25-2021\/","29e2d1af":"# Colored Tables\n\nThe coloured tables down below shows the cumulative number of cases, daily new cases, active cases, cumulative deaths, and daily new deaths.
