If the correlation between two variables is +1, it means that the value of one variable increases by 1 unit, if the other variable increases by 1 unit and vice versa.

If the correlation between two variables is -1, it means that the value of one variable decreases by 1 unit if the other variable increases by 1 unit and vice versa. This is called Negative Correlation.\nYou can understand Positive Correlation as direct proportionality & Negative Correlation as inverse proportionality.\nImportance of determining correlation: As I mentioned earlier, correlation is very helpful in Feature Selection.

In those cases, coefficients related to the two highly correlated variables will be unreliable.**","d24d6f18":"> Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.","a54d8d8a":"# 5.
