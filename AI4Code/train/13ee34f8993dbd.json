Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables. One is independent variable and other is dependent variable. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous or real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, etc.**"}}
