Unlike all previous and subsequent influenza pandemics, the 1918 to 1919 pandemic seems to have spread in up to three distinct \u201cwaves\u201d within a 9-months period.\n\nNot all influenza pandemics have had such prominent recurrences, and those that did tended to return at yearly intervals (e.g., 1889\u20131893), making them difficult to distinguish in kind if not in impact from normal seasonal influenza. \n\nGlobally, the first wave of the 1918 pandemic (W1), as measured by pneumonia and influenza mortality, occurred in only a few mostly Northern European countries in the summer of 1918 (as recognized in the Northern hemisphere), largely in July and August, and was associated with modest mortality. The two following waves in summer to autumn 1918 (W2) and winter 1918 to 1919 (W3) were seen in most of the world. Both were more deadly than the first wave, perhaps because of higher attack rates or higher case-fatality rates.\n\nAs noted, almost all countries experienced only one or two waves (approximately October 1918 and February\u2013March 1919), although several other confusing patterns also were seen, including summer to autumn 1918 epidemics with very low mortality and fatal waves delayed for several years beyond 1918.\n\nThe effect of season on pandemic virus transmission is incompletely understood. Conceivably, viral, host, and environmental factors may interact in complex ways, e.g., a changing balance between aerosol vs. droplet\/contact\/fomite transmission during different seasons, expressed in the context of gradual virus evolution and growing population immunity.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3180813\/","95e2f7c8":"<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Preventing M and M in Future Pandemics<\/p>\n\n\nSince the 1918 pandemic, pharmaceutical advances in both antibacterial and antiviral therapy have included two classes of antiviral drugs (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) proven clinically effective against most influenza viruses. \n\nHowever, antiviral resistance has appeared fairly rapidly in both seasonal and pandemic viruses, and development of resistance during the 2009 pandemic is possible. Almost all severely ill and hospitalized patients are treated with antivirals, but the clinical effects have been modest, and their utility in reducing mortality in a pandemic is unclear.\n\nBecause studies are still ongoing to determine the optimal doses and the effect on outcome, decisions about antiviral prophylaxis or treatment need to be individualized based on a variety of factors, including the patient\u2019s risk status for influenza illness, complications, and transmission to others at risk.\n\nThe care of severely ill patients continues to evolve. Hospital and critical care have improved greatly since 1918, but many aspects of such advanced care are controversial, including studies evaluating the treatment of systemic inflammatory response syndrome with drug interventions such as steroids and activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa), ventilator management strategies such as limited use of sedation and low tidal volumes, and other interventions such as tight glucose control and newer modes of ventilation such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The continued ongoing careful evaluation of critical care medicine techniques will likely have a further positive impact on future patients in whom severe disease develops.\n\nBecause of concern about the spread of H5N1, efforts over the past decade by both the US government and international health agencies have improved pandemic preparedness with stockpiles of antivirals, vaccines, and antibiotics, as well as increasing surge capacity of hospitals and emergency medical facilities.\n\nWe are better-prepared than we ever have been, but providing widespread access to medications and medical care, particularly in impoverished regions, is still a sobering challenge. So far, the 2009 pandemic has been neither as explosive nor as fatal as many earlier pandemics. Furthermore, the age distribution of cases, concentrated in children and young and middle-aged adults, has spared the elderly.\n\nUndoubtedly, improved standards of living and quality health care constitute the best hope for lowering global pandemic influenza deaths, especially for persons in developing regions of the world, and more so when supplemented by the development and stockpiling of broadly efficacious vaccines. \n\nTruly universal influenza vaccines based on either immunogenic antigens shared by all influenza viruses or multivalent HA and neuraminidases, both currently undergoing development, would provide broad protection. \n\nIn the meantime, multidisciplinary approaches that include preventive medicine, treatment of acute and chronic disease, and good public health measures remain important components of any pandemic preparedness strategy. Furthermore, efforts must be directed toward prevention based on improved understanding of pandemic risks, increased surveillance, development of countermeasures, logistic planning, and an aggressive and broad research agenda. https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3180813\/","1d9c3952":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:black; background-color:#424ef5\">\n          The 1918 influenza pandemic: Lessons for 2009 and the future\n     <\/h2>\n    \nCitation: Morens DM, Taubenberger JK, Harvey HA, Memoli MJ.

(In 2005 \"The year of bird flu\") H5N1 avian influenza epizootics associated with sporadic human fatalities have heightened concern that a new influenza pandemic, one at least as lethal as that of 1918, could be developing.\n    \nIn early 2009, a novel pandemic H1N1 influenza virus appeared, but it has not exhibited unusually high pathogenicity. Nevertheless, because this virus spreads globally, some scientists predict that mutations will increase its lethality. Therefore, to accurately predict, plan, and respond to current and future influenza pandemics, we must first better-understand the events and experiences of 1918.\n    \nAlthough the entire genome of the 1918 influenza virus has been sequenced, many questions about the pandemic it caused remain unanswered.\n    \nIn this review, the authors discussed the origin of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, the pandemic\u2019s unusual epidemiologic features and the causes and demographic patterns of fatality, and how this information should impact our response to the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic and future pandemics.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">In 2020 it's 103 yrs of Research!<\/p>\n    \nAfter 92 years of research (In 2020 it's 103 yrs of Research!), fundamental questions about influenza pandemics remain unanswered.

Even today, a significant number of deaths caused by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic likely can be directly attributed to this mechanism of disease.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">U-shaped Curves: High mortality in the very young and the very old<\/p>\n\nCurves of influenza mortality by age at death are typically U-shaped, reflecting high mortality in the very young and the very old, with low mortality at all ages between.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">W-shaped Mortality Curves: Third mortality peak in healthy young adults <\/p>\n\nThe 1918 to 1919 pandemic and succeeding winter epidemic recurrences in 1919 and 1920 instead produced W-shaped mortality curves, which featured a third mortality peak in healthy young adults that accounted for approximately half of the total influenza deaths, including the majority of excess influenza deaths. https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3180813\/","038c30d5":"<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Predicting Influenza Pandemics<\/p>\n\nLong ago, experts concluded that influenza pandemics occur in cycles, with accepted intervals varying from as long as 31 years (as articulated in 1792) to as short as 10 yrs (as articulated in 1841). After the 1889 to 1893 pandemic, interest in examining such influenza recurrence patterns was renewed but the unexpected emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has again demonstrated difficulties in prediction of cycles.\n\nBy the 1950s, cumulative historical information seemed to confirm the notions of early 18th and 19th century observers that pandemics appear in regular cycles. \n\nAt that time, this seemed to make biological sense. Before the current pandemic, the most recent pandemics (in 1889, 1918, and 1957) had apparently been caused by different viruses with novel HA genes imported from a large, naturally existing avian pool.\n\nAt approximately the same time, high population immunity seemed to pressure postpandemic viruses to drift antigenically, and surface protein-encoding genes potentially could mix with other HA and neuraminidase genes, to which humans lacked immunity. Given these facts, it was reasonable to assume that such an intimate viral\u2013immunologic relationship would have a predictable life span.\n\nThe events of 2009 have complicated the picture even further. We now find ourselves in an era in which a direct descendant of the 1918 H1N1 virus circulates endemically, along with two of its progeny: the postpandemic 1968 H3N2 reassortant virus, which had been updated at least twice by avian influenza genes before reaching humans, and the 2009 swine-origin pandemic influenza virus, which apparently jumped from pigs to humans after \u201ctriple\u201d reassortment-associated updating by avian, other swine, and human influenza genes. \n\nInfluenza authorities now express fading belief in pandemic cycles. There is no predictable periodicity or pattern of major influenza epidemics and \u2026 all differ from one another\u201d. Without pandemic cycles, there can be little basis for predicting pandemic emergence.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Pandemic emergence: Three different mechanisms<\/p>\n\nAlthough other scenarios have been suggested, pandemic emergence can probably result from at least three very different mechanisms: de novo emergence of a unique avian-descended virus (as perhaps occurred in 1918), modification of a circulating human-adapted virus by importation via genetic reassortment of a novel HA, and adaptation to humans of nonhuman mammalian adapted viruses (2009 H1N1).\n\nThere is no reason to suppose that these three different pandemic mechanisms could produce the same cyclic intervals or that other competing adaptation mechanisms, such as reassortment with closely related HA or viral drift caused by changing population immunity induced by natural infection and increasing use of immunologically complex vaccines, could not disrupt cycles that might otherwise occur. Several \u201cpseudopandemics\u201d (pandemics by definition as applied to other infectious agents) have occurred by these mechanisms. Despite a large catalog of naturally occurring influenza surface protein genes theoretically capable of causing new pandemics, only three of 16 known HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two of nine neuraminidases (N1 and N2) are known to have done so in the past 120 years.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3180813\/","721968ef":"The 1889 to 1893 pandemic was the first influenza pandemic to be widely studied scientifically. To older physicians in 1918, obvious similarities to the 1889 pandemic included its highly contagious nature, with clinical attack rates typically ranging between 20% and 60%.\n\nIn both pandemics, most deaths resulted from respiratory complications, usually pneumonia with bacterial invasion; however, in 1918 some observers suggested new and severe clinical forms of disease.\n\nMany 1889 pneumonia deaths had been attributed to familiar conditions such as subacute bacterial lobar pneumonia, whereas this background influenza mortality was seemingly augmented in 1918 by more frequent cases of aggressive fatal bronchopneumonia and deaths associated with progressive cyanosis and collapse.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">In 1918, Cytokine Storms<\/p>\n\nSome modern scientists have theorized that such 1918 deaths might be immunopathogenic in nature (e.g., caused by \u201ccytokine storms\u201d), although many data from that era suggest that almost all deaths resulted from secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia of a clinical type, spectrum, course, and lethality characteristic of pneumonias not associated with influenza.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Seasonal Reappearances and Recurring \u201cWaves\u201d<\/p>\n\nIn a pattern remarkably different from that of the 1889 to 1893 pandemic, which made at least three successive annual and largely seasonal reappearances, the 1918 pandemic spread in one to three rapidly recurring \u201cwaves\u201d over a 9-months period before settling into an annual pattern of seasonal recurrence. \n\nMost countries experienced waves only in October 1918 and February 1919, but a few countries, mostly Northern European, had an additional earlier wave in summer 1918.\n\nSome countries documented single waves of disease, a delay in initial pandemic detection of up to 3 yrs beyond 1918, or, in rare cases, documented no illness at all. Furthermore, mortality rates in the latter two of the three 1918 to 1919 waves were much higher than in 1889 for all ages except the elderly, and the 1918 to 1919 pandemic also featured an enormous still-unexplained mortality in healthy young adults, an age group believed to have been at low risk for death in most other pandemics up to that time.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3180813\/","2116bc06":"<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Immunoprotection through the Pandemics<\/p>\n\nThe pandemics of the 1830s and of 1847 might help explain 1918 H1N1 protection in individuals older than age 70 yrs, but only if they had been caused by an H1 or, less likely, an N1 virus that was closely related antigenically to the 1918 virus. \n\nEvidence is consistent with the possibility that the influenza pandemics of 1830 to 1831, 1833 to 1834, and 1836 to 1837 could have been caused by one pandemic virus whose recurrences spanned 2-years intervals, and that the restricted 1847 pandemic may have represented a return of that pandemic virus. \n\nThe 1847 pandemic appears to have been inter-regional but not global, sparing the Western hemisphere, at least from 1847 to 1849. The 1889 pandemic was too recent to have offered protection only for older individuals in 1918 and may have been caused by an H3 influenza virus. \n\nThe possibility of immunoprotection mediated in 1918 by neuraminidase, rather than by HA, is intriguing, but few data support this possibility because the identity of the 1889 neuraminidase is unknown.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3180813\/","fec7bc08":"<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">1957 and 1968 Flu Pandemics Descendants of the 1918 virus<\/p>\n\n\nFor purposes of comparison, the 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics, both caused by descendants of the 1918 virus, produced relatively low mortality rates overall, did not produce rapidly successive waves or multiple annual recurrences of high mortality, and settled more quickly into familiar patterns of annual seasonal endemic circulation. \n\nAlthough there is some similarity in the younger age group primarily affected by the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and the 1918 virus, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection is currently more like that of the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 in its production of severe and fatal disease.\n\nFor purposes of comparison, the 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics, both caused by descendants of the 1918 virus, produced relatively low mortality rates overall, did not produce rapidly successive waves or multiple annual recurrences of high mortality, and settled more quickly into familiar patterns of annual seasonal endemic circulation (23\u201325).

Information was compiled from historical references and scientific publications from 1889 to the present (not cited). \n\nInterpandemic intervals are noted on the top of the figure. Pandemics are associated with abrupt and widespread epidemicity in multiple locales in two or more geographic regions, rapid progression through large open populations, high clinical illness rates affecting a broad age range, and no other pandemic activity within 5 years (to adjust for the possibility of slow and interrupted pandemic spread before the mid 19th century).\n\nEspecially before 1697, pandemics may be difficult to verify and track because of slower spread as a result of slower and less frequent human travel. Some cited sources suggest different interpretations than those presented here. The 1977 re-emergence and global spread of an \u201cextinct\u201d descendant of the 1918 pandemic virus is included here as a pandemic emergence, although it might also be considered to reflect continuing spread of the original pandemic virus.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3180813\/","89229aa7":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:black; background-color:#424ef5\">\n          Thresholding, Binarization and Adaptive Thresholding         \n","24a4be67":"<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Influenza Infections Symptoms<\/p>\n\nTypical seasonal influenza infections cause classic symptoms, such as 4 to 5 days of fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness, and sometimes upper respiratory symptoms and cough.\n\nOther influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or vague symptoms. Influenza usually does not kill healthy children and adults, but severe complications and deaths can occur, especially in infants, the elderly, and individuals with chronic health conditions, such as cardiac disease, respiratory disease, or immunosuppression.\n\nAmong the most severe influenza complications is pneumonia, typically associated with secondary or coinfection with bacterial agents.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3180813\/","aeeeaa32":"#That paper is from 2010.
