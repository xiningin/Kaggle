Introduction to Time-Series Analysis** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n\n- A **time-series** data is a series of data points or observations recorded at different or regular time intervals. In general, a time series is a sequence of data points taken at equally spaced time intervals.  The frequency of recorded data points may be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually.\n\n\n- **Time-Series Forecasting** is the process of using a statistical model to predict future values of a time-series based on past results.\n\n\n- A time series analysis encompasses statistical methods for analyzing time series data. These methods enable us to extract meaningful statistics, patterns and other characteristics of the data. Time series are visualized with the help of line charts. So, time series analysis involves understanding inherent aspects of the time series data so that we can create meaningful and accurate forecasts.\n\n\n- Applications of time series are used in statistics, finance or business applications. A very common example of time series data is the daily closing value of the stock index like NASDAQ or Dow Jones. Other common applications of time series are sales and demand forecasting, weather forecasting, econometrics, signal processing, pattern recognition and earthquake prediction.\n\n\n\n### **Components of a Time-Series**\n\n\n- **Trend** - The trend shows a general direction of the time series data over a long period of time. A trend can be increasing(upward), decreasing(downward), or horizontal(stationary).\n\n\n- **Seasonality** - The seasonality component exhibits a trend that repeats with respect to timing, direction, and magnitude. Some examples include an increase in water consumption in summer due to hot weather conditions.\n\n\n- **Cyclical Component** - These are the trends with no set repetition over a particular period of time. A cycle refers to the period of ups and downs, booms and slums of a time series, mostly observed in business cycles. These cycles do not exhibit a seasonal variation but generally occur over a time period of 3 to 12 years depending on the nature of the time series.\n\n\n- **Irregular Variation** - These are the fluctuations in the time series data which become evident when trend and cyclical variations are removed. These variations are unpredictable, erratic, and may or may not be random.\n\n\n- **ETS Decomposition** - ETS Decomposition is used to separate different components of a time series. The term ETS stands for Error, Trend and Seasonality.\n\n\n- In this notebook, I conduct time series analysis of video game sales over time.","7e580fc2":"## **10.2 Reasons to convert a non-stationary series into stationary one before forecasting** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"10.2\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nThere are reasons why we want to convert a non-stationary series into a stationary one. These are given below:\n\n\n- Forecasting a stationary series is relatively easy and the forecasts are more reliable.\n\n\n- An important reason is, autoregressive forecasting models are essentially linear regression models that utilize the lag(s) of the series itself as predictors.\n\n\n- We know that linear regression works best if the predictors (X variables) are not correlated against each other. So, stationarizing the series solves this problem since it removes any persistent autocorrelation, thereby making the predictors(lags of the series) in the forecasting models nearly independent.","50e81747":"# **3. Time Series terminology** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nThere are various terms and concepts in time series that we should know. These are as follows:-\n\n1\t**Dependence**- It refers to the association of two observations of the same variable at prior time periods.\n\n\n2\t**Stationarity**- It shows the mean value of the series that remains constant over the time period. If past effects accumulate and the values increase towards infinity then stationarity is not met.\n\n\n3\t**Differencing**- Differencing is used to make the series stationary and to control the auto-correlations. There may be some cases in time series analyses where we do not require differencing and over-differenced series can produce wrong estimates.\n\n\n4\t**Specification** - It may involve the testing of the linear or non-linear relationships of dependent variables by using time series models such as ARIMA models. \n\n\n5\t**Exponential Smoothing** - Exponential smoothing in time series analysis predicts the one next period value based on the past and current value.  It involves averaging of data such that the non-systematic components of each individual case or observation cancel out each other.  The exponential smoothing method is used to predict the short term prediction.\n\n\n\n6\t**Curve fitting** - Curve fitting regression in time series analysis is used when data is in a non-linear relationship.\n\n\n7\t**ARIMA** - ARIMA stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average.\n","7ac6523d":"# **14.

Seasonal difference the series (subtract the value of previous season from the current value).\n\n- 3. Divide the series by the seasonal index obtained from STL decomposition.\n\n\n\nIf dividing by the seasonal index does not work well, we will take a log of the series and then do the deseasonalizing. We will later restore to the original scale by taking an exponential.\n","dc0ab529":"# **4.

There are multiple approaches of doing this as listed below:\n\n\n1. Subtract the line of best fit from the time series. The line of best fit may be obtained from a linear regression model with the time steps as the predictor. For more complex trends, we may want to use quadratic terms (x^2) in the model.\n\n2. We subtract the trend component obtained from time series decomposition.\n\n3. Subtract the mean.\n\n4. Apply a filter like Baxter-King filter(statsmodels.tsa.filters.bkfilter) or the Hodrick-Prescott Filter (statsmodels.tsa.filters.hpfilter) to remove the moving average trend lines or the cyclical components.\n\n\nNow, we will implement the first two methods to detrend a time series.","43811d0c":"# **12.

There is a strong seasonal pattern, the ACF plot usually reveals definitive repeated spikes at the multiples of the seasonal window.","a13a6c5e":"## **Moving Average** \n\n\n- **Moving average** is the average of a rolling window of defined width. We must choose the window-width wisely, because, large window-size will over-smooth the series. For example, a window-size equal to the seasonal duration (ex: 12 for a month-wise series), will effectively nullify the seasonal effect.\n ","41367522":"### **I hope you find this notebook useful and your <font color=\"red\"><b>UPVOTES<\/b><\/font> keep me motivated.**","9fcb8a4f":"## **10.1 Introduction to Differencing** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"10.1\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- If Y_t is the value at time t, then the first difference of Y = Yt \u2013 Yt-1. In simpler terms, differencing the series is nothing but subtracting the next value by the current value.\n\n\n- If the first difference doesn\u2019t make a series stationary, we can go for the second differencing and so on.\n\n\n  - For example, consider the following series: [1, 5, 2, 12, 20]\n\n\n  - First differencing gives: [5-1, 2-5, 12-2, 20-12] = [4, -3, 10, 8]\n\n\n  - Second differencing gives: [-3-4, -10-3, 8-10] = [-7, -13, -2]","438035bb":"Alternately, if we want a statistical test, the [CHTest](https:\/\/alkaline-ml.com\/pmdarima\/modules\/generated\/pmdarima.arima.CHTest.html#pmdarima.arima.CHTest) can determine if seasonal differencing is required to stationarize the series.","24187d58":"## **11.1 Augmented Dickey Fuller test (ADF Test)** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"11.1\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- **Augmented Dickey Fuller test or (ADF Test)** is the most commonly used test to detect stationarity. Here, we assume that the null hypothesis is the time series possesses a unit root and is non-stationary. Then, we collect evidence to support or reject the null hypothesis. So, if we find that the p-value in ADF test is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n- Feel free to check the following links to learn more about the ADF Test.\n\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Augmented_Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test\n\nhttps:\/\/www.machinelearningplus.com\/time-series\/augmented-dickey-fuller-test\/\n\nhttps:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/time-series-data-stationary-python\/\n\nhttp:\/\/www.insightsbot.com\/augmented-dickey-fuller-test-in-python\/\n\nhttps:\/\/nwfsc-timeseries.github.io\/atsa-labs\/sec-boxjenkins-aug-dickey-fuller.html\n\nhttps:\/\/www.statisticshowto.com\/adf-augmented-dickey-fuller-test\/\n\n","2a37ccf4":"# **19. Granger Causality Test** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"19\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- **Granger causality test** is used to determine if one time series will be useful to forecast another. It is based on the idea that if X causes Y, then the forecast of Y based on previous values of Y AND the previous values of X should outperform the forecast of Y based on previous values of Y alone.\n\n\n- So, **Granger causality test** should not be used to test if a lag of Y causes Y. Instead, it is generally used on exogenous (not Y lag) variables only. It is implemented in the statsmodel package.\n\n\n- It accepts a 2D array with 2 columns as the main argument. The values are in the first column and the predictor (X) is in the second column. The Null hypothesis is that the series in the second column, does not Granger cause the series in the first. If the P-Values are less than a significance level (0.05) then we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the said lag of X is indeed useful. The second argument maxlag says till how many lags of Y should be included in the test.","441c798d":"# **6. Patterns in a Time Series** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"6\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- Any time series visualization may consist of the following components: **Base Level + Trend + Seasonality + Error**.\n\n\n### **Trend**\n\n- A **trend** is observed when there is an increasing or decreasing slope observed in the time series. \n\n\n### **Seasonality**\n\n- A **seasonality** is observed when there is a distinct repeated pattern observed between regular intervals due to seasonal factors. It could be because of the month of the year, the day of the month, weekdays or even time of the day.\n\n\nHowever, It is not mandatory that all time series must have a trend and\/or seasonality.

Additive and Multiplicative Time Series** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"7\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- We may have different combinations of trends and seasonality. Depending on the nature of the trends and seasonality, a time series can be modeled as an additive or multiplicative time series. Each observation in the series can be expressed as either a sum or a product of the components.\n\n\n### **Additive time series:**\n\nValue = Base Level + Trend + Seasonality + Error\n\n\n### **Multiplicative Time Series:**\n\nValue = Base Level x Trend x Seasonality x Error","b981ce46":"\n\n# **10.

These transformation may include:\n\n\n1. Differencing the Series (once or more)\n2. Take the log of the series\n3. Take the nth root of the series\n4. Combination of the above\n\n\n- The most commonly used and convenient method to stationarize the series is by differencing the series at least once until it becomes approximately stationary.","4eb04e3b":"### **Cyclic behaviour**\n\n- Another important thing to consider is the **cyclic behaviour**. It happens when the rise and fall pattern in the series does not happen in fixed calendar-based intervals. We should not confuse 'cyclic' effect with 'seasonal' effect.\n\n- If the patterns are not of fixed calendar based frequencies, then it is cyclic. Because, unlike the seasonality, cyclic effects are typically influenced by the business and other socio-economic factors.","6eac480f":"- Since all the values are positive, we can show this on both sides of the Y axis to emphasize the growth."}}
