They also consume more fuel and adds to the weight of the car which means the gas mileage is reduced as a result of this. However they offer more acceleration than relatively smaller engines. \n\n- Smaller Engines on the other hand consume lesser fuel and offer better gas mileage but lesser acceleration. It is important to note that the advent of turbocharged engines has made smaller engines more powerful than some larger ones.\n\n- Our expectation as in line with reality is that engines with larger size should be rather more expensive than smaller ones. ","f7405eac":"Assuming the reference year is 2020, a car produced 12 years earlier(2008)with mileage of 323,000miles which is higher that the expected average of 144,000miles and tolerable limit of 150,000miles indicates that such car has most likely experienced much wear and tear, and should be avoided.","47acce09":"The most expensive audi car in the dataset appears to have an engine size of 5.2 implying that it consume large fuel and this corroborated by the mpg value of 21.

Mileage basically tells you the distance a car can travel with a specific amount of fuel. \n\n- Petrol engines typically have worse fuel economy that diesel cars\n\n- Cars that can travel good amount of distances on low fuel are regarded as high fuel efficient or with good mileage. The surge in prices of fuel has necessitated the need to focus more on cars with good mileage.\n\n- The higher a car's mpg, the more efficient it is\n"}}
