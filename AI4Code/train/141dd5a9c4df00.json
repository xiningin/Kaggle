Peanuts are widely used largely in food and beverage industry in the form of oil, flour, snacks, and peanut butter.\n- China is the world's leading producer of peanuts, accounting for nearly 41% of the total output. In the year 2019, China was the biggest peanut producer with a production of 17.5 million metric tons. India, Nigeria, and the United States followed with about 6.8, 3, and 2.5 million metric tons each. The production of peanuts decreased in the year 2018 in India, United States, and Senegal, due to adverse weather conditions, especially delayed and irregular rainfall. Major importers of peanuts are Netherlands, Indonesia, Russian Federation, Germany, and China. China exported peanuts to countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan. These countries imported 43,791 metric tons, 19,833 metric tons, and 15,117 metric tons in 2018 from China. The increased demand from other countries has led China to increase its production which grew from 17.1 million metric tons in 2017 to 17.5 million metric tons in 2019. The market growth will bolster over the forecast period, globally owing to the demand from the processed industries, such as, peanut snacks which are widely consumed snacks in the Asia-Pacific region.\n![](https:\/\/s3.mordorintelligence.com\/peanuts-market\/1608725851974_peanuts-market_Global_Peanuts_Market%3A_Market_Size_by_Region%2C_2019.png)","a9805e4f":"# Install Klib.\n[From here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sripaadsrinivasan\/klib-library-python)","9dcc310e":"# Predict Using Leader Model","16d40227":"# Imports","5b6757f0":"# Smoothing techniques\n**(helps reduce the effect of random variation and shows the seasonality, trend, residual components of the series)**\n","bf9c8af0":"# H2O.ai AutoML","e054f781":"- In this notebook I explore the global prices of peanuts using Klib, Forecast using facebook prophet and train model using H2O.ai AutoML ","7e884efb":"# Missing Values","3467039a":"# Correlation Matrix","4a52b571":"# Seasonal Decomposition"}}
