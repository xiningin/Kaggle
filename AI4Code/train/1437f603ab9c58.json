They are easier to cook than beans and they have a nutty flavor which I love. Cooking lentils might be a little tricky because you don\u2019t want them to be boring. So anytime I am making lentils i try to use as much herbs and spices as I can so they have some extra flavors on them. I came up with this recipe because every time we used to have Bean Stew at my family\u2019s, we added a tablespoon of red wine vinegar wen the hot plate of bean stew was served and it was incredibly tasty! The vinegar made it extra delicious and every time I add vinegar to my stews, it always reminds me of home. The best part of this Vinaigrette Lentil Stew is the lovely aroma that comes from the herbs cooking with onion in olive oil and vinegar.\n\nThis stew has all the good things you want from e delicious and hearty stew. It has lentils, vegetables, spices, greens and rich flavor. It is best served warm with fresh parsley and chopped spring onions. We used the leftovers in a tortilla wrap the other day and it was delicious combined with fresh tomatoes and green peppers. How do you like to eat your Vinaigrette Lentil Stew ?
