But although the Japanese government says it has the capacity to carry out 3,800 tests a day, only 8,111 tests had been conducted as of March 4, according to the country's Health Ministry. \n\nOn Wednesday, Japan recorded 33 new cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, its highest one-day increase since the outbreak began, according to numbers released by the Health Ministry. The overall total now stands at 1,023, of which 706 are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. \nBut Japan's coronavirus figures are likely already much higher than reported, with the infection rate suspected to be just the \"tip of the iceberg,\" according to Masahiro Kami, the executive director of Japan's Medical Governance Research Institute, a non-profit group.\nKami says for every one patient tested, there are many more who remain undiagnosed. But as most of these people are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms they don't go to a clinic to get checked out. https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2020\/03\/05\/asia\/japan-coronavirus-infection-levels-hnk-intl\/index.html","7ec66794":"scmp.com - Japan bans coronavirus infected after outcry over lax https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/week-asia\/health-environment\/article\/3048384\/japan-bans-coronavirus-infected-after-outcry-over-lax","c375d3d6":"thegoaspotlight.com  - Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games? \n\nThe cancellation of Tokyo olympic is going to have a vast impact on japan economy and Tokyo Olympic cancellation will be wasted on Japan, the economy will be on the big bearing.\nhttp:\/\/thegoaspotlight.com\/2020\/03\/01\/cancellation-of-tokyo-olympic-is-going-to-have-a-vast-impact-on-japan-economy-and-tokyo-olympic-cancellation-will-be-wasted-on-japan-the-economy-will-be-on-the-big-bearing-sports-news-quote\/\n\nOlympic coronavirus disruption would be 'heartbreaking,' says athlete"}}
