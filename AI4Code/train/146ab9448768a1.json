Each of these contain the MRI scans taken via 4 different techniques which are the folder names. The data also contains a \"train_labels.csv\" file which has the subject code and the label \"1\" - \"presence of MGMT Biomarker\" and \"0\"-\"absence of MGMT Biomarker\". <\/p>\n\n![Screenshot from 2021-08-10 03-44-02.png](attachment:956d8ddf-4dba-4def-a430-ad87029e2571.png)","6fac2e89":"<h2> Problem Description <\/h2>\n<p>A malignant tumor in the brain is a life-threatening condition. Known as glioblastoma, it's both the most common form of brain cancer in adults and the one with the worst prognosis, with median survival being less than a year. The presence of a specific genetic sequence in the tumor known as MGMT promoter methylation has been shown to be a favorable prognostic factor and a strong predictor of responsiveness to chemotherapy.<\/p>\n\n<p> Traditional medical approaches require biopsy and careful study of the tissue sample. Machine Learning approaches might help save thousands of lives. In this competition we are required to predict the presence of this BioMarker. For this purpose, we are provided with MRI scans of many diffee patients taken via 4 different methods : Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) , T1-weighted pre-contrast (T1w) , T1-weighted post-contrast (T1Gd) , T2-weighted (T2). Along with these, we are prrvided with a csv file which contains the data about whether the biomarker is present in the individual or not.<\/p>\n\n<p>  So, this essentially boils down to a binary classification problem with the two classes being \"Biomarker Present\" , \"BioMarker Absent\". <\/p>\n\n![Screenshot from 2021-08-10 04-04-17.png](attachment:d85ea624-c707-4757-a052-d1e65e5ee894.png)","2543f421":"<h2> MRI <\/h2>\n<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from CT and PET scans. MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications, such as NMR spectroscopy.<\/p>\n<img src = \"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/49\/6d\/95\/496d952e43d6a3b9aa87ef63a73e11fe.gif\">","d3797876":" I have tried to create a simple script to convert the dicom images into png images and save them in folders separated by the labels for the [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification) challenge    \n\n<p> P.S.
