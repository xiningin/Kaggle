Newer submissions will be prioritized for games over older ones. Your team is limited in the number of succesful submissions per day so we highly recommend testing your bot locally before submitting.","2d88cf36":"## Suggestions \/ Strategies\n\nThere are a lot of places that could be improved with the agent we have in this tutorial notebook. Here are some!\n\n- Using the build city action to build new cities and thus build new units\n- Having cities perform research each turn to unlock new resources\n- Writing collision-free code that lets units move smoothly around and through each other when navigating to targets\n- Mining resources near your opponent's citytiles so they have less easy access to resources\n- Using carts to deliver resources from far away clusters of wood, coal, uranium to a city in need\n- Sending worker units over to the opponent's roads and pillaging them to slow down their agent\n- Optimizing over how much to mine out of forests before letting them regrow so you can build more cities and get sustainable fuel","7f9111bf":"Next, we have to import the `make` function from the `kaggle_environments` package","85811316":"## Additional things to check out\n\nMake sure you check out the Bot API at https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\/tree\/master\/kits\n\nThis documents what you can do using the starter kit files in addition to telling you how to use the annotation debug commands that let you annotate directly on a replay (draw lines, circle things etc.)\n\nYou can also run the following below to save a episode to a JSON replay file. These are the same as what is shown on the leaderbaord and you can upload the replay files to the online replay viewer https:\/\/2021vis.lux-ai.org\/\n\n\nFor a local (faster) version of the replay viewer, follow installation instructions here https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Viewer-2021","06130044":"The `make` function is used to create environments that can then run the game given agents. Agents refer to programmed bots that play the game given observations of the game itself. \n\nIn addition to making the environment, you may also pass in special configurations such as the number of episode steps (capped at 361) and the seed.\n\nNow lets create our environment using `make` and watch a Episode! (We will be using the seed 562124210 because it's fun)","5e242e78":"Unfortunately it's not that easy. This agent will eventually lose and all units and cities will fall to darkness! We will need to write something to help the agent first find resources and then collect them.\n\nLet's first run a game with our empty agent, which will populate the `game_state` variable and we can now work with it and look into how we would proceed with finding resources.","b1567a24":"# Lux AI Season 1 Python Tutorial Notebook\n\nWelcome to Lux AI Season 1!\n\nThis notebook is the basic setup to use Jupyter Notebooks and the `kaggle-environments` package to develop your bot. If you plan to not use Jupyter Notebooks or any other programming language, please see our [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021). The following are some important links!\n\n- Competition Page: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/\n\n- Online Visualizer: https:\/\/2021vis.lux-ai.org\/\n\n- Specifications: https:\/\/www.lux-ai.org\/specs-2021\n\n- Github: https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\n\n- Bot API: https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\/tree\/master\/kits\n\nAnd if you haven't done so already, we **highly recommend** you join our Discord server at https:\/\/discord.gg\/aWJt3UAcgn or at the minimum follow the kaggle forums at https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/discussion. We post important announcements there such as changes to rules, events, and opportunities from our sponsors!\n\nNow let's get started!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nWe assume that you have a basic knowledge of Python and programming. It's okay if you don't know the game specifications yet! Feel free to always refer back to https:\/\/www.lux-ai.org\/specs-2021.\n\n## Basic Setup\n\nFirst thing to verify is that you have **Node.js v12 or above**. The engine for the competition runs on Node.js (for many good reasons including an awesome visualizer) and thus it is required. You can download it [here](https:\/\/nodejs.org\/en\/download\/). You can then verify you have the appropriate version by running\n","5d852644":"Ok now that our agent finds and collects resources but our citytile was consumed by darkness! What now? Well units can only carry so much resources before they can't collect anymore. And to keep your City alive, you must move your unit on top of any CityTile that is in that City. (Recall that a City is composed of connected CityTiles)","f05eda26":"We will also need Kaggle Environments","89e29a57":"Ok so woah, what just happened? We just ran a match, that's what :)\n\nThere's a number of quality of life features in the visualizer, which you can also find embedded on the kaggle competition page when watching replays or on the online visualizer when using replay files. \n\nIf you find this replay viewer slow, you can also download a local copy of this replay viewer in addition to lowering the graphics quality, see https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/LuxViewer2021 for instructions.\n\nAt this point, we recommend reading the [game specifications](https:\/\/www.lux-ai.org\/specs-2021) a bit more to understand how to build a bot that tries to win the game.","538faa54":"## Create a submission\nNow we need to create a .tar.gz file with main.py (and agent.py) at the top level. We can then upload this!"}}
