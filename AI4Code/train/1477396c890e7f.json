In a typical machine learning application, the typical stages (and sub-stages) of work are the following:\n1. Data preparation\n  * data pre-processing\n  * feature engineering\n  * feature extraction\n  * feature selection\n2. Model selection\n3. Hyperparameter optimization (to maximize the performance of the final model)\n\nMany of these steps are often beyond the abilities of non-experts. **AutoML** was proposed as an artificial intelligence-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying machine learning. \n\nSome of the notable platforms tackling various stages of AutoML are the following:\n* [auto-sklearn](https:\/\/automl.github.io\/auto-sklearn\/stable\/) is a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization layer on top of [scikit-learn](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/).\n* [TPOT](https:\/\/github.com\/EpistasisLab\/tpot) (TeaPOT) is a Python library that automatically creates and optimizes full machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.\n* [TransmogrifAI](https:\/\/github.com\/salesforce\/TransmogrifAI) is a Scala\/SparkML library created by [Salesforce](http:\/\/salesforce.com\/) for automated data cleansing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization.\n* [H2O AutoML](http:\/\/docs.h2o.ai\/h2o\/latest-stable\/h2o-docs\/automl.html) performs (simple) data preprocessing, automates the process of training a large selection of candidate models, tunes hyperparameters of the models and creates stacked ensembles.\n* [H2O Driverless AI](https:\/\/www.h2o.ai\/products\/h2o-driverless-ai\/) is a commercial software package that automates lots of aspects of machine learning applications. It has a strong focus on automatic feature engineering. \n\n"}}
