This is the train dataset, it contains time series of features store_nbr, family, onpromotion, and target sales.\n    - store_nbr identifies the store at which the products are sold.\n    - family identifies the type of product sold.\n    - sales gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).\n    - onpromotion gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date.\n   \n- **Stores** . Store metadata, including city, state, type, and cluster (grouping of similar stores).\n\n- **Oil**. Daily oil price (Includes values during both the train and test data timeframes!)\n\n- **Holiday**. Holidays and Events, with metadata\n\n\n- **Transactions**.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Ecuador is an oil-dependent country and it's economical health is highly vulnerable to shocks in oil prices.\n\n2. Transferred colum in holidays. A holiday that is transferred officially falls on that calendar day, but was moved to another date by the government. A transferred day is more like a normal day than a holiday. To find the day that it was actually celebrated, look for the corresponding row where type is Transfer. Additional holidays are days added a regular calendar holiday, for example, as typically happens around Christmas (making Christmas Eve a holiday).\n\n\n3. Wages in the public sector are paid every two weeks on the 15 th and on the last day of the month. Supermarket sales could be affected by this.\n\n4. A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Ecuador on April 16, 2016. People rallied in relief efforts donating water and other first need products which greatly affected supermarket sales for several weeks after the earthquake.","0e1ba7b9":"## 2.
