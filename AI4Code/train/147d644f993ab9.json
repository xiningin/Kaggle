The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in \nDecember 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss \nof smell and taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who \nare infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as \npatients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms\n(dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, \nshock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue \nto experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-\nyear studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.","93d7cee1":"# <h1> <font face=\"Lucida Calligraphy\" size=10 color=008080> Total Covid-19 Cases world<\/font><\/h1>","4c297978":"Transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.
