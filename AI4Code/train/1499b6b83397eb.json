About 134 million smartphones were sold across India in the year 2017 and is estimated to increase to about 442 million in 2022. India ranked second in the average time spent on mobile web by smartphone users across Asia Pacific. The combination of very high sales volumes and the average smartphone consumer behaviour has made India a very attractive market for foreign vendors. As per Consumer behaviour, 97% of consumers turn to a search engine when they are buying a product vs. 15% who turn to social media. If a seller succeeds to publish smartphones based on user\u2019s behaviour\/choice at the right place, there are 90% chances that user will enquire for the same. This Case Study is targeted to build a recommendation system based on individual consumer\u2019s behaviour or choice. \n\u2022 DATA DESCRIPTION: \n\u2022 author : name of the person who gave the rating \n\u2022 country : country the person who gave the rating belongs to \n\u2022 data : date of the rating \n\u2022 domain: website from which the rating was taken from \n\u2022 extract: rating content \n\u2022 language: language in which the rating was given \n\u2022 product: name of the product\/mobile phone for which the rating was given \n\u2022 score: average rating for the phone \n\u2022 score_max: highest rating given for the phone \n\u2022 source: source from where the rating was taken  \n\n\u2022 PROJECT OBJECTIVE: We will build a recommendation system using popularity based and collaborative filtering methods to recommend mobile phones to a user which are most popular and personalised respectively.. ","6fe43124":"12.  In what business scenario you should use CF based Recommendation Systems ? \nAns. Collaborative Filtering is used to building intelligent recommender systems that can learn to give better recommendations as more information about users is collected. It isa personalised recommender system , recommendations are made based on the past behaviour of the user. Most websites like Amazon, YouTube, and Netflix use collaborative filtering as a part of their sophisticated recommendation system.","d351a60f":"# Case Study : Recommendation on Smart Phones","d5e301f9":"# Build a collaborative filtering model using kNNWithMeans from surprise using User based model","975c4407":"13.
