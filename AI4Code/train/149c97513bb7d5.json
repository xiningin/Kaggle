Does the date and time of pickup affect the fare?**","6bcead3f":"**PART 2 --> MODELLING AND PREDICTION**\n\nFINALLY! Data cleansing is done! Now to split the x and y variables and proceed to modelling. I shall use the random forest method for prediction","902e8836":"From scenario 2, I can understand that the distance is 0, but the fare is all the minimum fare of $2.5. This could be because the passenger booked the cab but ended up cancelling to pay the base fare (not sure how this works in NYC, but I'm assuming that's how it is)","c652e69f":"# Thank you","5d36a03b":"Check the H_Distance fields which are greater than 200 kms cause there is no way that people would travel more than 200 kms at the most in NYC in a CAB!"}}
