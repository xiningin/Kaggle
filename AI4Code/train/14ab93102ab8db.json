The Data\nThe Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) has been collecting records of inbound crossings at the US borders (Canada & Mexico) since 1996. The data specifies the port of entry (with its respective port code), State, date, as well as the mode of entry. This pandas tutorial will serve as an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive insights from this vast amount of data."}}
