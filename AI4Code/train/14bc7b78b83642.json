If there is very high correlation between two features, keeping both of them is not a good idea most of the time not to cause overfitting.** For instance, if there is overfitting, we may remove sqt_above or sqt_living because they are highly correlated. This relation can be estimated when we look at the definitions in the dataset but to be sure the correlation matrix should be checked. However, this does not mean that you must remove one of the highly correlated features. For example bathrooms and sqrt_living.

However it does not show that high story building are more expensive, may be other factors like total size of property or location is also playing the major role in deciding the price of property.","3d5af430":"We build Sequential model that has two densely connected hidden layer to make it Deep Learning Network with the same number of neurons as input attributes (20). The network uses good practices such as the rectifier activation 'relu' function for the hidden layer. No activation function is used for the output layer because it is a regression problem and we are interested in predicting numerical values directly without transform.\n\nThe efficient ADAM optimization algorithm is used and a mean squared error loss function is optimized. This will be the same metric that we will use to evaluate the performance of the model. It is a desirable metric because by taking the square root gives us an error value we can directly understand in the context of the problem (thousands of dollars).","7439eba1":"**Below are the category of the features:**\n\n1.

Some data is randomly selected and kept aside for checking how good the model is. This is known as Testing Data and the remaining data is called Training data on which the model is built. Typically 70% of data is used as Training data and the rest 30% is used as Tesing data.","b857c9e6":"### Feature Engineering from columns containing year","4aafadfe":"# **Comparing with LinearRegression**","0be4b2a2":"# Bringing features onto the same scale\n\n* While using distance based methods like KNN we must attempt to scale the data, so that the column(feature) with lesser significance might not end up dominating the objective function due to its larger range. like a column like age has a range between 0 to 80, but a column like salary has range from thousands to lakhs, hence, salary column will dominate to predict the outcome even if it may not be important.\n* In addition, features having different unit should also be scaled thus providing each feature equal initial weightage. Like Age in years and Sales in Dollars must be brought down to a common scale before feeding it to the ML algorithm\n* This will result in a better prediction model.\n\n\n### Normalization i.e. Min-Max scaling\n\nAn alternative approach to Z-score normalization (or standardization) is the so-called **Min-Max scaling** (often also simply called \"normalization\" - a common cause for confusion!).  \nIn this approach, the data is scaled to a fixed range - usually 0 to 1.  \nThe cost of having this bounded range - in contrast to standardization - is that we will end up with smaller standard deviations, which can suppress the effect of outliers.\n\nA Min-Max scaling is typically done via the following equation:\n\n\\begin{equation} X_{norm} = \\frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max}-X_{min}} \\end{equation}","239578cd":"#### Waterfront of property vs property price","62b16d45":"There was no duplicate data in this dataset.","74a37d4c":"There was no price differentiation based off longitude.

If we keep zipcode as it is, then model will pretend that zipcode 98103 is greater than 98038, which is not the case. So apply some kind of feature engineering like by creating dummy variable, but it will create 70 more features which is too much for us.

We also pass the validation data  \nso that after each epoch of training on the training data will quickly run the test data and check our loss on the test data, so that way we can keep a tracking of how well performing not just on our training data but also on our test data.\n\nNote that this test data will not actually affect the weights or biases of our network. So Kares isn't going to update the model based on the test data or validation data. Instead it will only use the training data as it's updating the weights and biases and continue to check how well model is doing and not just the training data but also the validation data.\n\nIt is a larger data set so we're going to feed in our data in batches and we're gonna call batch size of 128. It's very typical to do batch sizes in powers of two so 64, 128, 256.  The smaller the batch size, the longer training is going to take but the less likely we're going to overfit to data because we're not passing in the entire training set at once.","66dd3d2e":"### Categorical vs Continuous Features","fe99bd54":"And the same behavior seems for latitude also.
