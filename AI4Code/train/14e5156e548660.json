This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.\n\nIt contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the original features and more background information about the data is not provided. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.\n\nSource: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mlg-ulb\/creditcardfraud","10f5e049":"This notebooks covers,\n\n1.

For perspective, in 2017 both PayPal's and Mastercard's revenue was only $10.8 billion each.\n\n\n**Objective:** In this session, given the credit card transactions, we will build a simple neural network (i.e., Multilayer perceptrons) for Fraud Detection using Keras."}}
