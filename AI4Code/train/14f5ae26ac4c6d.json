The four leaf nodes (depth=2) each predicts a class - two of them predict class_2, one predicts class_1 and one predicts class_0. You can also see other node attributes such as \"gini\"and \"value\" shown in the graph. These attributes are explained below:\n\n* In each node, **\"samples\"** represents how many training instances fall in that node. For example, there are 67 samples that has proline > 755.0. \n* The attribute **\"value\"** gives how many instances fall in each class for each node. For example, in the leftmost leaf node, there are 0 instances in class_0, 6 instances in class_1, and 40 instances in class_2. \n* Each node is also assigned a **\"class\"** based on which class has the majority of the instances in that node. Therefore, even though the root node has comparable number of instances in each of the three classes, the root node's class label is \"class_1\" since 71 > 59 > 48. \n* **To make a prediction, you keep going along the tree until you reach a leaf node.

The splitting criterion consists of a feature $k$ and a threshold for this feature $t_k$, which are selected by minimizing an impurity cost function:\n<center>\n    $J(k, t_k) = G_{\\mathrm {left}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {left}}}\/{m}+ G_{\\mathrm {right}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {right}}}\/{m}$\n<\/center>\nThis is a **weighted sum of the gini impurity of the left and right child node**. Here $G_{\\mathrm {left}}$ ($G_{\\mathrm {right}}$) is the gini impurity of the left(right) child node, $m_{\\mathrm {left}}$ ($m_{\\mathrm {right}}$) is the number of samples in the left (right) child node, and $m$ is the number of samples in the parent node $m = m_{\\mathrm {left}} + m_{\\mathrm {right}}$. The algorithm will first split the root node into two, then split each of the two children nodes into two, and so on. The process usually stops if the tree has reached its user-defined maximum depth, or if the after-split impurity $G_{\\mathrm {left}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {left}}}\/{m}+ G_{\\mathrm {right}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {right}}}\/{m}$ is bigger than the partent node's impurity $G_{\\mathrm{parent}}$, but other stopping criteria exist, too.\n\nThere are several things I'd like to point out about this algorithm and sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier:\n* The CART algorithm is a greedy algorithm that searches for **locally optimal decisions**. Optimal split is searched at each node, *without* considering whether it leads to a globally smallest impurity at the bottom of the tree. This is also mentioned in DecisionTreeClassifier's [documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/tree.html#tree).\n* Given the algorithm, which DecisionTreeClassifier follows if using default settings, a deterministic result is expected given a certain training set (i.e. no randomness). However, **DecisionTreeClassifier does display randomness even at default settings**. This is because the classifier will randomly re-order all features and then test each of them. If two splits are tied, the one that happened first will be selected. More discussion can be found on this [github page](https:\/\/github.com\/scikit-learn\/scikit-learn\/issues\/8443).\n* To accelerate to training, you may set max_features of DecisionTreeClassifier to be smaller than the total number of features. In this case, the algorithm will search the best split from a randomly sampled subset of features.\n\n","6e017a53":"# Decision Trees\n## Decision tree classification\n### Introdution\nAssume that we have an input dataset $X$ with $n$ features (feature 1,2,...,n), and each instance of the dataset has a classification (say, class A, B, and C).

The algorithm still works by dividing a node into two children nodes at a time with a feature $k$ and its threshold $t_k$, but with a different cost function:\n<center>\n    $J(k, t_k) = \\mathrm {MSE_{left}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {left}}}\/{m}+ \\mathrm {MSE_{right}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {right}}}\/{m}$\n<\/center>\nwhere\n<center>\n    $\\mathrm {MSE_{left (right)}} =\\frac{1}{m_{left(right)}} \\sum_{i\\in \\mathrm{left (right)}}(\\hat{y}_{\\mathrm {left (right)}}-y^{(i)})^2$    \n<\/center>\n<center>\n    $\\hat{y}_{\\mathrm{left(right)}} = \\frac{1}{m_{\\mathrm{left(right)}}} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathrm{left(right)}} y^{(i)}$\n<\/center>\nThe training process is explained step by step below to help understand the above equations:\n* The algorithm chooses a feature $k$ and a threshold $t_k$ and splits samples in the parent node into a left node ($k$ values <= $t_k$) and right node ($k$ values > $t_k$).\n* The predicted $y$ value for the left node $\\hat{y}_{\\mathrm{left}}$ is the mean of $y$ values of all samples in the left node.

Gini impurity decribes how \"pure\" the sample composition is in a node. For example, if a node has 0 samples in class_0 and class_1, but 20 samples in class_2, Gini impurity will be 0.

","75ff6a05":"# Random Forests\n## What is a random forest?\n**A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees. In a random forest, each decision tree is trained on a random subset of the training set, usually sampled with replacement, with sample size equal to training set size.  In case of classifications, the class with the highest mean probability across all trees is selected. In case of regressions, the predicted $y$ value is the mean of predicted $y$ values across all trees. **\n\nIn Scikit-learn, [RandomForestClassifier](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) is used for random forest classification and [RandomForestRegressor](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) is used for random forest regression. As the [documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/ensemble.html#forest) mentioned, \"(because of the random subsampling in training) the bias of the forest usually slightly increases (with respect to the bias of a single non-random tree) but, due to averaging, its variance also decreases, usually more than compensating for the increase in bias, hence yielding an overall better model.\" **Therefore, random forest is generally preferred over a single tree**. **The documentation also noted that unlike DecisionTreeClassifier, at default, RandomForectClassifier does not search all features for the best split, but only a random subset of them.** According to [RandomForestClassifier's documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), max_features is default to sqrt(n_features). \n\nLet's try a random forest classifier on the Red Wine Quality dataset:","db10bfc1":"## Pruning\nDuring tree training, we can give up on splitting if all possible gain is negative. However, this might be too local of a decision, since further splits after the current split can have positive gain and overall decreases the cost. To address this issue, trees are typically grown until certain stopping criteria is met (e.g. maximum number of leaf nodes is reached). During the growing period, an optimized split with maximized gain is carried out at each step, even if the gain is negative. **After tree growing, nodes with negative gain are removed in a bottom-up fashion, thus further reduces the overall cost**. This technique of cutting back the tree is called **pruning**.","a5f4b9bd":"### Example\nLet's reuse the wine recognition dataset that comes with sklearn.

According to the [documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html), by default, max_depth=None, meaning \"nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples\".

Once the best model is found, GridSearchCV train the best model on the whole train data (X_train,y_train), and it is this trained best model that will be used for further prediction.\n\nHere, we will choose AUC (area under the ROC curve) as the score of interest.

The content of this Appendix is based on [this Master thesis](https:\/\/brage.bibsys.no\/xmlui\/handle\/11250\/2433761) by Didrik Nielsen.\n\n**The CART algorithm trains the tree by splitting a node into two children nodes at a time. Among all the possible splits at each step (node to split, feature to split on, threshold of feature), the one that minimizes the training error is chosen**. \n\nA tree can be expressed as follows: \n<center>\n$f(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{T} w_j {\\mathrm I}(x\\in R_j)$\n<\/center>\nWhere $w_j$ is called the **weight** of *j*th leaf node, and $\\{R_j\\} ( j=1,2,...,T)$ is called the **structure** of the tree. The $T$ is the number of leaf nodes of this tree. The ${\\mathrm I}(x\\in R_j)$ equals one if sample $x$ belongs to area $R_j$, and zero otherwise. Therefore, $f(x)$ will predict $w_j$ if the sample $x$ falls in area $j$. In the figure below, we have $T=4$. The sample space is divided into four disjoint areas: $R_1=\\{x: x\\leq 1.21\\}$, $R_2=\\{x: 1.21 < x\\leq 2.31\\}$, $R_3=\\{x: 2.31 < x \\leq 3.185 \\}$, and $R_4=\\{x: x>3.185 \\}$. Here $x$ is the flavanoids value. The weights for the four areas are: $w_1=647.889$, $w_2=525.357$, $w_3=882.193$, and $w_4=1204.35$.\n<img src=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/YDuPS3X.png\" width=\"500px\"\/>","812777e0":"This is certainly better than the overfitting regressor, but would you say that it is a good fit? **One of the major characteristics of a decision tree is that it does not make any assumptions about your data**. This can be a problem sometimes. **A decision tree can be sensitive to outliers**, for example, as you can see in the above figure where the prediction line drops down just to fit the rightmost data point. If the data is noisy, **decision tree might not be able to distinguish between noise and signal**, since there is no underlying model (e.g. linear model, polynomial model) to guide the regression. \n\nRegularizing the tree can help with the above issues, but in some cases decision tree regessors just don't work well. In practice, it is a good idea to just try several possible regressors (decision tree, polynomial...) and choose the one that performs the best. An ensemble of decision trees (random forests) also tend to work better than individual trees, which we will talk about next.\n\n**For more on the CART algorithm for tree training: see the newly added Appendix.**"}}
