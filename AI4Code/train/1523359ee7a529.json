Creation of Citation Network\n\nHere we want to collect all references for each document and create a network data using NetworkX.","6745021f":"## Objective: \nIn this notebook we want to provide an intriductory idea to create citation network from research publication -COVID19 corpus. \nWe want request you to see **I - COVID19-NLP-Data-Parsing** notebook for better understanding of data accessing and cleaning. In this notebook, we directly focus to gather Bib-entries for each of the documents and try to provide a demo for network analysis.","17362289":"#### Q: What is the data content in each network node? Let's look at this:","4c3b61fc":"### 2.1 Preparing network node and edge data\n\nThe main idea behind network of citation is that, we can put a publication information (e.g., ID, title, year published) in node data and connect that node with other reference nodes chich are cited in the publication. In the code below, 'doc' ia single document where all reference node data are being collected in 'bibEntries' list.\n\n- For every document, we collect 'title' and 'paper-id'. \n- For every bib-entries, we are taking 'DOI' as the reference id, title,year,and journal(venue).","00fadfce":"#### Q: Can we find the document which cites maximum references for 'virus'? Yes, we can measure the degree centrality and select the node which has maximum centrality.","005c60cc":"### Sample Network Visualization\n\nWe can not create a network with ~0.15 million nodes for visualization. For visualization purpose, we are selecting 200 publications and restricting the references which has 'virus' term in the title.","47a02345":"We are bringing more update soon....\n","378fed8f":"### 3.1 Network Analysis\n\nWhat are the benefits of performing network analysis over citation network? Well, just by viewing a network visualization may not be interesting. But, if we consider a specific objective for example targeting 'virus' related pubication, we can get interesting insight.","215b5bff":"### 2.2 Create Network with NetworkX\n\nAfter preparing citation network data, we expect that some references are also cited in other documents. This offers a beautiful scenario in the network like structure of the citation among several documents.\n\n - First, we iterate over each documents and create node for each document and references. \n - Next, we create edge between document and references.\n \n ***Note: Are same nodes for references repeated over many documents? No, once a reference with 'DOI' as node id is created, it becomes unique. Rather, one reference could have many document connected.***"}}
