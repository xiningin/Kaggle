There are some interesting correlations between the columns: <br>\n<br>\n    Average Driving Distance and Rough Tendency are positively correlated. The makes sense that as you tend to hit is farther your accuracy suffers. This also holds true as you move to additional categories such as hit fairway %. \n<br>\n<br>\n    Another positive correlation that makes sense is the relationship between the percentage of sand saves and the average number of 1 putts per round. If you're making sand saves (a par out of the bunker after a missed green in regulation) you will have to be making 1 putts for par. \n<br>\n<br>\n    And lastly the postive correlation that we saw before of Total 1 putts per round and Total birdies.
