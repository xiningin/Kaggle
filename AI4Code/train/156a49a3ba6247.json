Non-anginal chest pain is more closely associated with &lt;50% diameter narrowing and a minimal ST depression value. <\/div>\n\nNow let's find out the relationship of the thalium stress test (thal). The thalium stress test involves injecting a nuclear tracer, thalium, into a patients heart and exert stress on the heart through making them exercise. Healthy heart muscles clls should absorb the tracer, which can then be detected through nuclear imaging. If the heart muscles absorb the tracer at rest but not during exercise, the patient will be classified as \"reversible defect\". If the tracer is not absorbed at all, the patient will have a \"fixed defect\" (\"Cardiac Stress Testing Review\", n.d.).\n\nNote that the data does not match the given data dictionary.

A depression of the ST phase could indicate hypokalemia or cardiac ischemia (Kashou et al).","234c2124":"## Discussion","ca5a0ea6":"Now let's examine the relationship between sex and chest pain type","eac85eb2":"# Beginner (first) data science project on understanding what leads to heart diseases","99dc8cb5":"This notebook analyzed the factors that give rise to artery diameter narrowing, which is an indication for significant heart disease, and how the factors differed between males and females. It appeared that some diagnostic procedures such as ECG results and thalium stress tests are highly indicative of diameter narrowing. Interestingly, physiological factors such as cholesterol level and blood pressure do not provide much insight on predicting heart disease, however this may be affected by limiting data for females. The biggest difference between males and females discovered in this notebook is cholesterol level, where females haev much higher cholesterol levels than males. Note that cholesterol can be in the form of <u>low density lipoprotein (LDL)<\/u> or <u>high density lipoprotein (HDL)<\/u>. LDL is harmful to the body as it leads to plaque building up in arteries, however HDL is beneficial to the body. Females have higher cholesterol levels because oestrogen boosts HDL levels, however HDL levels fall after menopause and LDL level rises (Michos, E.D.). Therefore, a better way to show cholesterol level would be to show the LDL and HDL levels individually.\n\nIn addition to understanding the factors affecting heart disease, this notebook also constructed a decision tree model to classify whether a patient has significant heart disease. The model only achieved a ROC score of 0.78. Although the prediction could be affected by limited data, other machine learning and statistical models can be used to determine the best way to predict heart disease.","4775febf":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">ST depression levels appear to be similar between male and females, and quite different across diameter narrowing.<\/div>\n\nNow let's compare ST depression with chest pain type again, this time without filtering the gender.","1959bd7f":"Row 164 is duplicated with another row.

However, this is limited by the small sample size, and most of the female samples lie between the age 50-70 years, with only one female sample having an age less than 50. ","3e92c7a2":"There were a lot more females between age 55-60 who had chest pain 1 (typical angina) and had significant heart condition (>50% narrowing). Interestingly, females that have chest pain 2 and 3 had no significant heart condition. Remember that chest pain types are: -- 1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic. \n\nAccording to the research conducted by Hermann et al, a typical angina is when \"(1) Substernal chest pain or discomfort that is (2) Provoked by exertion or emotional stress and (3) relieved by rest or nitroglycerine (or both)\" (Hermann et al). An atypical angina is when 2 out of 3 criterias are met. Asymptomatic chest pain is when the chest pain is uneither causing nor exhibiting symptoms (\"The MSDS HyperGlossary: Asymptomatic\", n.d.). In my understanding this could be due to problems in other organs near the heart eg. lung disorders.","59db6368":"After exercise, the slope of the ST depression should become slightly upwards (reminder that 0 = downsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = uploping), however an elevation of 1mm is considered abnormal (Hill and Timmis). \n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">It can be seen that upsloping correlates with &lt;50% narrowing and no exercised induced angina, and vice versa for a flat slope.

Since the two rows are right next to each other, it is likely that they are both from one person, and the data is accidently copied. Entry 164 should be deleted.","c3a11a3c":"Note that sex, cp, fbs, restecg, exang, slope, ca, thal, and target are categorical types. ","26706e00":"Heart rate decreases with age for individuals with <50% narrowing. Reasons for this is still under research, however it is partially due to the lowered firing of sinoatrial myocytes (SAMs) (Larson et al), which are responsible for generating action potentials through the heart to initiate a heart beat. For individuals with >50% narrowing, the data is once again affected by the limited female samples of younger ages.","d646554b":"It appears that most patients with >50% narrowing have abnormal ST-T waves at rest. Let's examine ST depression values of patients after exercise","d04bf480":"The plot revealed blood pressure increases with age for both males and females, and males with &lt;50% narrowing had slightly higher blood pressure compared to females. This matches with early studies comparing the blood pressure of healthy males and females, showing that healthy males had slighly higher blood pressre than healthy females. (Wiinberg et al).\n\nLet's do a t-test to further confirm this.","38455778":"## Introduction\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women. In the US, 610,000 people die from heart diseases every year, which is equivalent to 1 in 4 deaths. Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease, which is reduced blood flow to the heart, causing 370,000 deaths every year. Several physiological factors can give rise to heart diseases, such as high cholesterol levels and high blood presure (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). \n\nThe dataset presented in this notebook contains patients and information on various variables as well as a target variable that specifies whether a patient has more than 50% of arteries that leading to the heart occluded. The 50% threshold is an indication for significant narrowing, and is a sign for cardiologists and other physicians to perform further diagnosis (Harris et al, 1980). This notebook analyzes the different variables in the dataset and answer the following questions:\n\n1. How much are the individual variables associated with diameter narrowing? (Related findings highlighted in blue)\n2. How do the variables between males and females? (Related findings highlited in yellow)\n\nIn addition, this notebook will present and compare using a decision tree to predict whether or not a patient has >50% narrowing.","5d8c4130":"Currently, the decision tree has a max depth of 10, branches are continuously split even when there are less than 3 samples, and leaves with only 1 or two samples are present. Let's change these parameters.","1b6988ce":"No null values, the dataset appears to be cleaned.\n\nCategorical columns 'ca' and 'thal' have more value types than described on the dataset. 'Ca' is supposed to have 4 values (0-3), while 'thal' is supposed to have 3 (1 = fixed defect, 2 = normal, 3 = reversed defect).","4ac89f3d":"The above 2 plots showing resting blood pressure and maximum heart rate both had the same outlier for target = 0. Let's find out where this datapoint is located in the dataframe."}}
