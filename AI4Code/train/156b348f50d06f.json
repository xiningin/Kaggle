predict which employees will quit. To compensate for this, the SMOTE technique was used to generate synthetic data to compensate for the lack data from employees who quit. \n\nI recommend using this tool carefully because it generates synthetic data around a cluster, which is not always good.","5f2f711d":"## 1.5 Overtime and attrition\n\nThe emotional burnout that the job can generate is also a major factor in the employee quitting no matter what their salary and position in their job.\n\nBurnout can be generated by overtime, so it is very important to find out what the relationship is between overtime and quitting.","718655bb":"# 0. Introduction","9c3b639e":"## 1.6 Quick overview\n\nThe five factors analyzed have a relationship with the employee's attrition, but there is no compelling reason which causes an employee to resign. This is because, in order for an employee to resign, several factors must be combined.\n\n","100d5265":"Other binary features are \"Over18\", \"OverTime\" and \"Gender\":\n\n- Over18 : Specifies if the worker is over 18 years old.\n\n- OverTime: Specifies if the worker is working overtime.\n\n- Gender: Specifies the worker gender.","6d3eedfc":"## 1.2 Bored and Unchallenged by the Work Itself\n\nNo one wants to be bored and unchallenged by their work. \n\nEmployees want to enjoy their job. They spend more than a third of their days working, getting ready for work, and transporting themselves to work.\n\nThis approach is related to job satisfaction.","9a0cb5ab":"When analyzing the data set, it can be seen that most of the columns are  integer (numerical) type and only nine of them are categorical. Also, there are no missing data, which helps to decrease the time spent on data cleaning. \n\nWe know that the Attrition column is our target variable but it is categorized, we need to convert it to numerical.","d5d737a3":"## 3.3 SMOTE Data \nFor the SMOTING technique I only followed one golden rule: \n\nDON'T PUT SYNTHETIC DATA IN YOUR TEST DATA!!!","18ba88d4":"A majority of employees are grouped between quartile 1 and 2 which corresponds to a lower satisfaction rating with co-workers","7cd5594c":"A high degree of attraction can be observed when job satisfaction is low, but also when the value it's high. This means that employees must leave the company for other reasons.","cc50341c":"## What is employee attrition?\n---\n\nFrom \"Tech Funnel\": _\"Employee attrition is a gradual but deliberate reduction in the number of employees in a company or business organization. Employees will at some point in time look to change their job places for a number of reasons. It might be for professional or personal reasons but it does happen.\"_\n\nThis definition give us a key point: \"Employees change their jobe places for a number a reasons\". So, now the question is: **What are the reasons why an employee quits?**\n\nPersonally I think that this question is very important for any company, this is because the hiring process is expensive in most of the cases.\n\nSusan Heathfield explains in her article [Top 10 Reasons Why Employees Quit Their Jobs](https:\/\/www.thebalancecareers.com\/top-reasons-why-employees-quit-their-job-1918985) the next reasons:\n\n1. Relationship With the Boss\n2. Bored and Unchallenged by the Work Itself\n3. Relationships With Coworkers\n4. Opportunities to Use Their Skills and Abilities\n5. Contribution of Their Work to the Organization\u2019s Business Goals\n6. Autonomy and Independence on the Job\n7. Meaningfulness of the Employee's Job\n8. Knowledge About Your Organization\u2019s Financial Stability\n9. Overall Corporate Culture\n10. Management\u2019s Recognition of Employee Job Performance\n\nIn this notebook I'll concentrate on prove the relationship between relation with the boss, bored and unchallenged, relationships with coworkers, salary, overtime and employee attrition.\n","3510a088":"A short analysis reveals the following key points:\n\n\n- For people who leave the company (on average):\n\n    - They are younger: 33 years\n    - They live further from their work: 11km\n    - Less satisfaction with the work environment: 2\n    - Lower level of work: 1\n    - Less satisfaction with work: 2\n    - Lower monthly salary: $ 4800.00\n    - Work more overtime: 0.5\n    - Less years in the company: 5\n    - Fewer years in current position: 2\n    - Fewer years with current manager: 2.8","62b62843":"## 1.1 Relationship With the Boss\nThe employee does not necessarily have to establish a friendly relationship with the boss, but it is necessary that good communication exists.\nAccording to many sources: _\"A bad boss is also the number one reason why employees quit their job.\"_\n\nIn te data set, we do not have a characteristic that qualifies the relationship with the boss, but we do have a column that quantifies the years with the current manager.","a5e34b59":"# 4. Conclusions","42d20211":"It is a fact that the number of employees who quit is higher when the employee works overtime","d584948d":"With the SMOTE technique it is possible to get a better precision in the attrition cases (62 %)","e57aaf24":"We can see that the model predicts quite well the \"none quite employees\" (94% accuracy) but it doesn't predict as well the \"quite employees\" (53% accuracy).
