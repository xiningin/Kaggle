I intend to create tutorials with several machine learning algorithms from basic to advanced. I hope I can help you with this data science trail.

Ronald Fisher has well known worldwide for his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It was in this paper that Ronald Fisher introduced the Iris flower dataset.\n\nThe iris database consists of 50 samples distributed among three different species of iris. Each of these samples has specific characteristics, which allows them to be classified into three categories: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica, and Iris versicolor. In this tutorial, we will use multilayer perceptron to separate and classify the iris samples.\n","09ba8fe9":"## Loading decision tree classifier","e593a8e4":"## Cross validation in sklearn","99f942a6":"## Loading sklearn","886f64b9":"## Loading the dataset","70d39421":"## Training the decision tree classifier ","4d51ffa5":"## Showing parameters the tree classifier"}}
