these following layers, activation functions and optmizer and loss function:\n\n* Input Layer : Takes input  \n* Dense Layer : Dense layer is the regular deeply connected neural network layer.\n* BatchNormalization Layer : Batch normalization applies a transformation that maintains the mean output close to 0 and the output standard deviation close to 1.\n* The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1\/(1 - rate) such that the sum over all inputs is unchanged\n* Activation function: An activation function in a neural network defines how the weighted sum of the input is transformed into an output from a node or nodes in a layer of the network.\n\n* Regularization :  Regularization is a technique which makes slight modifications to the learning algorithm such that the model generalizes better. This in turn improves the model's performance on the unseen data as well.\n\n\n\n### Activation Function : \n  \n * ReLU :The rectified linear activation function or ReLU for short is a piecewise linear function that will output the input directly if it is positive, otherwise, it will output zero,\n * Sigmoid : Sigmoid activation function, sigmoid(x) = 1 \/ (1 + exp(-x)).\n    Applies the sigmoid activation function. For small values (<-5), sigmoid returns a value close to zero, and for large values (>5) the result of the function gets close to 1.\n \n### Regularization :\n * L1 regulazier : In L1 norm we shrink the parameters to zero.\n \n### Adam Optimizer : \n * Adam is a replacement optimization algorithm for stochastic gradient descent for training deep learning models. Adam combines the best properties of the AdaGrad and RMSProp algorithms to provide an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients on noisy problems.\n \n### SGD Optimizer : \n  * Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple yet very efficient approach to fitting linear classifiers and regressors under convex loss functions such as (linear) Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression.\n \n### Binary Crossentropy Loss: \n * Cross-entropy is the default loss function to use for binary classification problems.\n   It is intended for use with binary classification where the target values are in the set {0, 1}.","38c2d766":"### **Here we tried to use Neural Network for binary classification.  Neural Networks work best when there is a lot of data. In this scenerio, the dataset was relatively small. But we acheived a quite a good model with some Hyperparameter tunings like using L1 regularization, using several optimizers(AdamW, RMSprop, SGD) with various learning rate. We used callbacks to stop overfitting our model. We also used some normalization technique like Batch normalization, Dropout to prevent overfitting as Neural Nets are very much prone to overfit when the dataset is quite small.**","d6dd6718":"## Splitting the dataset into Train and Test sets","b9aa92d3":"## Data preprocessing","47f74fcd":"## Data Analysis","bbcf8674":"### Evaluation on Test Dataset","8727a119":"#### Glance at the head of Train sets","feb259af":"#### There is no null values","6c3bb980":"#### Compiling the model","50fdd4b9":"### Evaluation on Train Dataset","7697a7cd":"### Checkinng for any null values","cc2c8e96":"#### Overview of the Model (including total parameters)","da5b5719":"### Normalizing the values using Maximum Absolute Scaler","ffdcab39":"## Conclusion"}}
