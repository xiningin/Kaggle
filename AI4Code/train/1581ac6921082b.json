The easiest part was the input and print statements. I didn't have any peer feedback. I threw my plan together quickly so there were a lot of problems. For one, I didn't use int, I also didn't incorporate the '%' function. I planned as well as I could've with my understanding at the time. Except for forgetting int, that wasn't very good. I think that my idea was simple enough. It could have been expanded upon, but I think that it's fine as it is. I would've added more units to convert to and I would have maybe used a conditional statement asking what the user wanted to convert from inches. I would have also fixed the grammar, maybe using conditional statements or something. Reason I didn't do any of this even though I could've is because as you probably know already I am in quarantine and feeling like garbage.","6b5789a1":"#Project: Converter"}}
