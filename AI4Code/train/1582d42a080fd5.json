Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states, and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region. The Council of Europe, which has 47 member states, has sought to abolish the use of the death penalty by its members absolutely, through Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, this only affects those member states which have signed and ratified it, and they do not include Armenia, Russia, and Azerbaijan. Although most nations have abolished capital punishment, over 60% of the world's population live in countries where the death penalty is retained, such as China, India, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, Iran, among all mostly Islamic countries, as is maintained in Japan and Sri Lanka. <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Capital_punishment\">Learn more<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This dataset includes information on criminals executed by Texas Department of Criminal Justice from 1982 to November 8th, 2017\n<br\/><br\/>The dataset consists of 545 observations with 21 variables.
