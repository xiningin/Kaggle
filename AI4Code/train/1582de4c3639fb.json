However, if you notice, as the COVID-19 deaths crosses the 100,000 Mark in the US, the engagement index slowly decreases. Also, it is around the same time that schools declare Summer breaks. Hence, it is a bit difficult to say, what is the exact reason. \nI'd urge you to take a closer look at the data trends, observe any sharp falls, this may be because of the Winter, Spring breaks which are usually a week in February or March and March or April. Notice the sharp fall in November due to Thanksgiving. <\/p>\n<h1 style = \"font-family: Roboto,serif; font-size: 2.1em; text-align: left; margin-top:4%;\"><b>How will the state of Online and Digital Learning evolve in the future?<\/b><\/h1>\n<p style = \"font-family: Roboto, serif; font-size: 1.5em; text-align: justify; font-color:gray; margin-top: 2%\">\nAfter the evaluation and analysis of the data, I believe that the picture looks good for the Online and Digital Learning in Future.

If you take a look at the graph above you can easily see the upward motion of the graph indicating the increase in engagement of student in online learning at the end of the year.

In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among America\u2019s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style = \"margin-top:4%\"> Understanding the Impact <\/h2>\n<p style = \"font-family: Roboto, serif; font-size: 1.5em; text-align: justify; font-color:gray; margin-top: 2%\">\n  We have three basic sets of files. \n    <ul style = \"font-family: Roboto, serif; font-size: 1.45em; text-align: justify; font-color:gray; margin-top: 2%\">\n    <li>The engagement data are based on LearnPlatform\u2019s Student Chrome Extension.

Hence, I have decided to drop the column.    <\/li>\n    <li>\n       We have the engagement data for 236 districts however for most of the districts the data is not complete.

Rising death rates, daily increasing number of cases may have affected the psychological well-being of students leading to lesser focus on studies.\n<\/p>\n\n<h1 style = \"font-family: Roboto,serif; font-size: 2.1em; text-align: left; margin-top:3%\"><b> Digital Learning in States <\/b><\/h1>\n<p style = \"font-family: Roboto, serif; font-size: 1.5em; text-align: justify; font-color:gray; margin-top: 2%\">\nConnecticut, Utah, Massachusetts are the top 3 states in terms of total page-load events per one thousand students.
