Let's go!","0d2c20e2":"### Mushroom Features Glossary\n* Cap (Pileus): the expanded, upper part of the mushroom; whose surface is the pileus\n* Cup (Volva): a cup-shaped structure at the base of the mushroom. The basal cup is the remnant of the button (the rounded, undeveloped mushroom before the fruiting body appears). Not all mushrooms have a cup.\n* Gills (Lamellae): a series of radially arranged (from the center) flat surfaces located on the underside of the cap. Spores are made in the gills.\n* Mycelial threads: root-like filaments that anchor the mushroom in the soli.\n* Ring (Annulus): a skirt-like ring of tissue circling the stem of mature mushrooms. The ring is the remnant of the veil (the veil is the tissue that connects the stem and the cap before the gills are exposed and the fruiting body develops). Not all mushrooms have a ring.\n* Scale: rough patches of tissue on the surface of the cap (scales are remnants of the veil).\n* Stalk (or Stem, or Stape): the main support of the mushroom; it is topped by the cap. Not all mushrooms have a stalk (stem) <sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\">[4]<\/a><\/sup>.\nAnother feature to consider when identifying mushrooms is whether they bruise or bleed a specific color. Certain mushrooms will change colors when damaged or injured. Cutting into a mushroom and observing any color changes can be very important when trying to determine what it is <sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\">[5]<\/a><\/sup>.\n\nA universal veil is a temporary membranous tissue that fully envelops immature fruiting bodies of certain gilled mushrooms. The developing Caesar\u2019s mushroom (Amanita caesarea), for example, which may resemble a small white sphere at this point, is protected by this structure. The veil will eventually rupture and disintegrate by the force of the expanding and maturing mushroom, but will usually leave evidence of its former shape with remnants. These remnants include the volva, or cup-like structure at the base of the stipe, and patches or \u201cwarts\u201d on top of the cap <sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\">[6]<\/a><\/sup>.\n\nA partial veil (also called an inner veil, to differentiate it from the \u201couter\u201d veil, or velum) is a temporary structure of tissue found on the fruiting bodies of some basidiomycete fungi, typically agarics. Its role is to isolate and protect the developing spore-producing surface, represented by gills or tubes, found on the lower surface of the cap. A partial veil, in contrast to a universal veil, extends from the stem surface to the cap edge. The partial veil later disintegrates, once the fruiting body has matured and the spores are ready for dispersal. It might then give rise to a stem ring, or fragments attached to the stem or cap edge. In some mushrooms, both a partial veil and a universal veil may be present <sup id=\"fnref:7\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\">[7]<\/a><\/sup>.","02fcd6d6":"## Machine Learning with Classification Methods\nBefore we start training, we need to analyze and process data a little more.","b68fa06a":"Here we took LinearRegression model with 6 features and RFE gave feature ranking as above, but the selection of number \u20186\u2019 was random.

These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.\n\nForms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as \u201cbolete\u201d, \u201cpuffball\u201d, \u201cstinkhorn\u201d, and \u201cmorel\u201d, and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called \u201cagarics\u201d in reference to their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term \u201cmushroom\u201d can also designate the entire fungus when in culture; the thallus (called a mycelium) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms; or the species itself.\n\nIdentifying mushrooms requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic structure. Most are Basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level the basidiospores are shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a spore print, is used to help classify mushrooms and can help to identify them. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.\n\nMushrooms are used extensively in cooking, in many cuisines (notably Chinese, Korean, European, and Japanese). Separating edible from poisonous species requires meticulous attention to detail; there is no single trait by which all toxic mushrooms can be identified, nor one by which all edible mushrooms can be identified. Many mushroom species produce secondary metabolites that can be toxic, mind-altering, antibiotic, antiviral, or bioluminescent. Although there are only a small number of deadly species, several others can cause particularly severe and unpleasant symptoms. Toxicity likely plays a role in protecting the function of the basidiocarp: the mycelium has expended considerable energy and protoplasmic material to develop a structure to efficiently distribute its spores<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\">[3]<\/a><\/sup>.","34e2fba1":"## Refferences","9912d8c8":"<div class=\"footnotes\">\n  <ol>\n      <li id=\"fn:1\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/mushroom\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> UCI Machine Learning Archive \u2013 Mushroom Dataset<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n    <li id=\"fn:2\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/datascienceplus.com\/mushrooms-classification-part-1\/\">Mushrooms Classification \u2013 Part 1<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/datascienceplus.com\/author\/giorgiogarziano\/\">Giorgio Garziano<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n      <li id=\"fn:3\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mushroom\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia \u2013 Mushroom Tutorial<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n      <li id=\"fn:4\">\n       <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.enchantedlearning.com\/subjects\/fungi\/label\/mushroom\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mushroom Anatomy<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:4\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n      <li id=\"fn:5\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mushroom-appreciation.com\/identifying-mushrooms.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Identify Mushrooms<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:5\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n      <li id=\"fn:6\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Universal_veil\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia \u2013 Universal Veil<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:6\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n      <li id=\"fn:7\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Partial_veil\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia \u2013 Partial Veil<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:7\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n      <li id=\"fn:8\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usask.ca\/biology\/fungi\/glossary.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mushroom Glossary<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:8\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n      <li id=\"fn:9\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/3.1.1\/gallery\/lines_bars_and_markers\/barchart.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Grouped bar chart with labels<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:9\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n      <li id=\"fn:10\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/feature-selection-with-pandas-e3690ad8504b\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Feature Selection with sklearn and Pandas<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/@abhini.shetye\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Abhini Shetye<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:10\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n      <li id=\"fn:11\">\n       <p><a href=\"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/11218477\/how-can-i-use-pickle-to-save-a-dict\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">How can I use pickle to save a dict?<\/a> answer by <a href=\"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/users\/464744\/blender\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blender<\/a><a href=\"#fnref:11\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;<\/a><\/p>\n    <\/li>\n      <br\/>\n  <\/ol>\n    <p><a href=\"https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/building-a-perfect-mushroom-classifier-ceb9d99ae87e\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Building a Perfect Mushroom Classifier<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/@marcopeixeiro\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Marco Peixeiro<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n    <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/turksoyomer\/classification-methods-on-mushroom-dataset\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Classification Methods on Mushroom Dataset<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/turksoyomer\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Omer Turksoy<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","e613c357":"Now we have to expand the categories, operation unmelt, this is easily achieved with the pandas function _get_\\__dummies_.","6a6a1bf7":"<img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/mGdcxkv\/title.jpg\">"}}
