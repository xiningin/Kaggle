Python\/phosphorus recognizes a few such operators, but most  functions in python appear in *prefix* position, with their arguments in parentheses. Python provides some extra math functions in a *package* that extends basic python called \"math\", as shown below. Notice that even these functions are interpreted as phosphorus types, numbers in this case.","2a2ada8c":"Here are my notes about this. ","90c909ca":"### Functions for Sets and Lists\n\n* `in` or `\u2208` tests for membership in a set or a list. If you type `\\in` plus tab, this will be converted to \u2208.\n* `len` returns the size of a set or list. Notice the special notation for ranges of numbers: `1...10` or `1..10` represents all the counting numbers from 1 to 10.\n* `union` or `\u222a` (also `|`) and `intersection` or `\u2229` (also `&`) follow their standard definitions for sets. To type `\u222a`, enter `\\cup` plus tab; for `\u2229`, enter `\\cap` plus tab.\n* `+` combines two lists.\n* `.append` adds an item to a list.\n* Brackets index single items (like `[0]`) or *slices* (like `[5:7]`) of a list. Notice that lists start at index 0.","bfd48c1f":"# Complex Expressions in Phosphorus\n\n### Numerical Expressions & Operators\n\nSimple values in phosphorus may be put together into larger expressions, which evaluate to some simple value after calculations are run, basically relying on the underlying behavior of the python language. The next cell contains some numerical examples. Notes:\n* To test for equality, use double equal signs `==`. A single equal sign assigns a value to a variable.\n* `%` is modulo."}}
