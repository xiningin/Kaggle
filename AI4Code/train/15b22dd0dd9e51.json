However, based on this two pie chart, we can see that there's a slight decrease (~ 4%) in promoted from junior programmer \/ data scientist towards senior data scientist. I personally think that passion and hardwork are the key ingredients in being a successful programmer \/ data scientist. ","6aac3897":"There could be tons of algorithm to learn and you might be overwhelmed. Based on the survey above, we can see that SVM (support vector machine), clustering algorithm (k-means) and regression are among the most popular algorithm. Perhaps you can start from here because these algorithms are proven to be generate effective results and easy for beginners.","af5ba0ca":"However, 59% of the **junior data scientist** are working in a company that have models in production. This shows that you are required to at least be familiar with ML methods in order to work as a data scientist. \n\nPersonal Thoughts:\nYou should at least be familiar with the basic of most of the ML methods (Linear Regression, Random Forest etc..) in order to become a data scientist. On the other hand, if you knew what the company is specialised in, you can just dive deep into that field (NLP, Computer Vision etc...)","b1b1a0a1":"## 4.

In addition, these languages have various tutorial all over the internet including books. They are easy to pick up and there is plenty of forums and discussion on problems that you might get stuck while learning. So, don't be afraid to start. Helps are everywhere! As long as you pick one and start now, nothing is too late!","a846ace4":"Being a data scientist requires constant update on hot topics or discussion at the moment. This survey provides us a clear idea where to look for these media sources. As you can see that LinkedIn is the most frequent source for data scientist to visit despite most people including me thought that LinkedIn is only for job searching\/application platform. On the other hand, Medium is an obvious source for data science topics as I constantly find myself looking through medium to learn most of my data science skill sets. Besides tutorials provided, most of the social media have their own specific groups for data scientist to gather and communicate with each other to learn the hottest or latest topics. You can even ask questions or get help from there. \n\n*Don't be shy!*","0bd51f9e":"# Does gender matters?

Python, Matlab and SQL are the most common programming languages for data science. Jupyter or Jupyter Notebook is the place where you work on your code or analyse your data. I can explain all these frameworks one by one and so on but that would not provide you the exictment to explore your favourite framework. So my personal favourites are:\n1. Python\n2.

One of the main reason is that people requires you to be efficient and effective. You can't just keep google on how to do the basic stuff and learn as you go. Basic analysis or plotting should be memorized as the first step to become a senior data scientist. ","613aab7e":"## 2.

I usually go to youtube or medium to learn data science. Those who haven't start or still half way through, these platforms are well chosen by our fellow survey participants. This means they most probably provide a high quality content. After looking at this bar graph, I can say that the mlcourse.ai are one of the top platforms to learn data science. No wonder most people go for that!","e6e5e1ea":"# Different perspectives\n\nWe start off by looking at the age distribution among the survey participants. ","4de67456":"One of the most common questions that has been asked. \n\nThe survey shows that if you were to become a senior data scientist, YES you need one and at least a Master's Degree. Over 70% of the survery participants that were a senior data scientist requires a Master's degree of above.\n\nBeing a junior data scientist requires you to have at least a Bachelor's Degree or persuing one. The reason why this is true for most people is because that university of college will provide you some sort of basic math understanding and other related programming skills in order to solidify your core data science skill. \n\n#### Personal Comment: \nNowadays, huge number of online courses have been quite popular to help you start your journey to become a data scientist. All these online courses fee cost less than being in college or university. The only tradeoff to me is that you are required to be self descipline. In unversity, you have deadlines and assignments etc. But for online courses, they provide you the flexibility to learn whenever and wherever you want. So you might procastinate and forget about it soon or later.","621f45d7":"We can't really split the job scope for junior and senior so we will inspect the overall job scope of being a DS. Based on the word cloud, most of these data scientist jobs are related to research, data and model. Data is the most common word that was found in everyone's answer because dealing with data is the main task for a data scientist. Task such as **data visualisation, data analysis, preparing dataset, cleaning data** etc... are what data scientist do most of the time.
