And while it may seem obvious that this sport can do extraordinary damage to brains and bodies, it\u2019s taken far too long for the NFL, the medical community, and football fans to fully reckon with this.\"\n\n\"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a degenerative brain disease caused by repetitive hits\nCTE is not about single concussions. It\u2019s the result of repeated concussions \u2014 and even head impacts that are not quite as severe \u2014 which can result in lasting structural changes in the brain.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.vox.com\/science-and-health\/2018\/2\/2\/16956440\/super-bowl-2020-concussion-symptoms-cte-football-nfl-brain-damage-youth","795847f8":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRQBi2h6qhE5YEbZ5KFTAsPzf3rVg2g2w7_4A&usqp=CAU)pt.slideshare.net","9deec604":"#Checking the Label Encoder (if it worked)","ba4b220a":"CTE Risk More Than Doubles after Just Three Years of Playing Football\n\nBoston University Researchers discover a strong link between time of football play and rising chance of getting the disease\n\n\"For every year of absorbing the pounding and repeated head collisions that come with playing American tackle football, a person\u2019s risk of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a devastating neurodegenerative disease, increases by 30 percent. And for every 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubles.\"\n\n\"As part of their analysis, the researchers also looked at other potential variables, including the total number of concussions, football positions played, a person\u2019s age at first exposure to tackle football, their participation in other contact sports, their race, and the presence of other diseases, to see whether those factors had any influence on a person\u2019s CTE risk, or if they were diagnosed with CTE, the severity of their CTE symptoms. They found no associations between these other variables and CTE risk or severity.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bu.edu\/articles\/2019\/cte-football\/","f7d7f4cc":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE)<\/span><\/h1><br>\n\n\"CTE can only be conclusively diagnosed in autopsy (though progress is being made in diagnosing via MRI).
