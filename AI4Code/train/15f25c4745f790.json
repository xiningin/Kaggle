every week and every month.","4f624f27":"In the last step, we tried to see whether there exist a relation between day of week and reorderings or not.","644f036d":"From above tables, we can have some idea about future usage of each file for purpose of train our model. In this dataset, our main goal is predicting future transactions. We need to think about which attributes are convenient to work on it and which are not. Reducing unnecessary attributes decreases time and computation costs. But before going into dimension reduction, Lets check \"orders.csv\" which keeps all of the data train and test data.","8561e349":"Most ordered products are fruits and diaries.","0eb48625":"In this work, I will try to analyze data for better exploration and different prediction analysis will be applied to compare them.\n1. **Introduction**\n\nThis competition is basically prepared for prediction future transaction of a sample customer by using transaction past of that customer. Our dataset has information about transaction, reordering, ordering date and information about ordered product.\n\n2. **Data Visualization**\n\nFirst, we load our libraries and dataset.","13c60d39":"Above graph also prooves that most of the products sold are from vegetables and fruits. This attribute is highly correlated with number of orderings of a specific product. \n\nIt might be helpful for analyzing a departments size and reorderings from departments for visualyzing if any relation exist.","7ac0a4b0":"Same situation for training data, probability is 0.06.","89d92b15":"Above graph indicates that most of the transactions are consist of 4 different products. Maximum element for a transaction in this dataset is 100.","a54030ac":"Above graph shows number of products in a single order. On average people buy 5 different products.\n\nAfter now, we will merge some files for analyzing and visualizing relations better.","34273019":"On the 'x' axis 0 is saturday, 1 is sunday and so on... It is clear that most of the transactions are done in weekend and number of  orders for wednesday is the lowest. Actually, remaining part of this file is not important for us. Order days and hours are irrelevant for predicting next order. Since we do not know and we can not predict which day it will be for a specific customer. We can develep a model for predicting the product for given day, but in here it can be any day and any hour.\n\nThere are some more in this file to observe. Now, we can check how frequently people buy products. ","38247f45":"From above graph, we can observe that we have 3214874 transactions. We have 131209 customers' transaction for train our model and 75000 customers' transaction for testing model.","88477dc3":"For train orderings file, products are almost 60% reordered. It is clear that it is more likely to be reordered for a product.","8500a89d":"Weekend day times are the most order having periods.\n\nFrom now on, let's check ordered products. But first to observe all prior and train transactions, we can concanate order_products_train_data and order_products_prior_data.","e300fbde":"Visual representation of the graph is almost the same with the \"DoW and Number of Orders\" graph. This is because of there is not exist any significant relation between them.","fc854f86":"In the prior orderings file, probability of a product to be reordered is almost 0.59","01a83eb2":"Biggest departments are \"produce\", \"diary eggs\" and snacks, but relation between size of a department and reordering seems to be unrelated. Because, \"breakfast\", \"alcohol\" and \"bakery\" are small departments but they have also high reordering rates. Above graph is also informative for detecting which departments have higest reordering ratio. For instace, alcohols are not placed in top 20 products but they have high reordering rates.\n\nBelow, aisle wise reordering is analyzed.","e859307d":"Let's check most ordered products.","b774fe46":"People generally buy their products mostly in day time.","e18aa3f9":"Again we can see that beverages, breakfast, fruit and vegetables are most reordered products. People who orders weekly might be buying thiese kind of products.\n\nAdd-to-cart order is another feature given in the dataset. This is an interesting feature because people might act to add mostly ordered products first. In one of above graphs, we see that people generally buy 5 products in an order but in below, we see that there is a peak at 1. This might proove the hypothesis we have. Another peaks in the graph might be because of low number of instances that has more than 50 products. This misleads the ratio since number of samples are much lower."}}
