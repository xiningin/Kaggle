The goal of our problem statement is a little bit different, we want to focus on the stage in which the project is not launched yet and identify if it will successful or not. Additinaly, find the most important features (and the feature values) that influence this output. So we perform some pre-processing in this step which includes the following: \n\n- Get rid of unwanted columns (active stage columns)  \n- Feature Engineering (driven from our hypothesis generation)    \n- Remove Duplicates  \n- Handle Missing Values  \n- Encode the Categorical Features  ","b7e693d5":"> From the above plot, we can identify that the maximum degree centrality nodes are - duration, syllable count, goal etc. From the network perspective, it means that if we remove these nodes from the network (high degree centrality nodes), this will lead to network disruption.

In this section, we will go a little deeper and understand which features has the biggest impact on the model predictions (in absolute sense). One of the ways to identify such behaviour is to use permutation importance. \n\nThe idea of permutation importance is very straightforward. After training a model, the model outcomes are obtained. The most important features for the model are the ones if the values of those feature are randomly shuffled then they lead to biggest drops in the model outcome accuracies. Let's look at the permutation importance of features of our model.","45177fe0":"From the partial dependency plot for project category, we observe that the accuracy of model predicting the project success increases if it belongs to \"Music\", \"Comics\",  \"Theater\", or \"Dance\" categories.

Final Conclusions<\/font>  \n\nAfter applying these different techniques we understood that there are certain factors which increases or decreases the chances of a project successfully able to raise the funds. Both from project owner's and the company's perspective it is important to set the optimal values of project goal and the duration. A large duration or a very large amount may not be able completely successful. At the same time it is important to choose right number of words and characters in the name of the project. For example, a project having very few or very large number of words and characters may become less intutive and less self explanatory. Similarly, the project category also plays a crutial role, There will be some categories on the platform in which total number of projects are very large, these are so called popular categories. The chances may be higher if the project is posted in a popular category rather than a rare category. \n\nIn this kernel, I shared a general framework which I follow while solving any data science or analytics problem. This framework can be applied to many other different use-cases as well. The main focus of this kernel was different techniques related to machine learning explanability. Mainly, I used relative feature importance, permutation importance, partial dependecies, and shap values. In my opinion, here are some pros and cons of these techniques. Apart from these techniques, there are other alternatives as well (such as skater, lime). \n\n<table>\n    <tr><td>Technique<\/td> <td>Pros<\/td> <td>Cons<\/td><\/tr>\n    <tr><td>Feature Importance<\/td> <td>1.

A high or a medium-high project goal may almost lead to the case of failure. Additionally, number of characters used in the project title will also affact if the project will be succeeded or failed.   \n> - **What does this mean for the company?** The company can identify the projects with high importance based on their meta - features such as length of the project.    \n\nBy applying this approach, we primariy obtained the factors to look at a high level, But still we need to answer, what are the optimal values of these features. This will be answered when we apply other techniques in the next sections. Before moving on to those techniques, I wanted to explore a little more about relative feature importance using a graph theory perspective.  \n\n<br> <h2><font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">A Graph Theory Perspective : Relative Feature Importances<\/font>   <\/h2>\n\nThe idea of relative feature importance is very simple (more the times a feature appear in the decision tree splits, it is important) but many a times people forget an underlying important concept that these importances are \"relative\". This means that in comparison to other features what is the importance of a particular feature. \n\nBut a question here is - Even if it is relative, what if some features from a set of features are removed, do we still obtain the same feature importances ? This problem can infact be formulated as graph problem. Consider a graph based structure, in which every feature (of the dataset) is a node, and the edges are defined between two features (nodes) if the two features appers in the *top 10 important features of the individual decision tree*. \n\n**But, What is the benefit?** Well, Some of the problems when viewed as network or graph problems can help to identify the solutions quickly and easily. For instance, using the graph properties one can identify which is the most important node of the network. A node having higher degree centrality (connections) indicates that the node is highly connected to the network. Which means that if a node is removed from the network, a large majority of the network will be disrupted. \n\nThis idea can be applied to relative feature importances, a feature which is highly important, which appears in most of the decision tree's top 10 feature can be clearly identified from the feature importance network graph. If this feature is removed from the dataset then the predictions will be affacted. Let's plot this network. ","b4e84f06":"> We observe that the projects having fewer number of words (<= 3) in the name does not show any improvement in model success. However, if one start increasing the number of words in the project name, the corresponding model improvement also increases linearly. For all the projects having more than 10 words in the name, the model becomes saturate and shows similar predictions. Hence, the ideal word limit is somewhere around 7 - 10.  \n","1676b938":"> From the feature definition, category count is a feature which act as the proxy of popularity of a project category. For example, if in Travel category a large number of projects are posted then its category_count will be higher so it is a popular category on Kickstarter. On the other hand, if in the Entertainment category, very rarely someone adds a project, its category_count will be lesser and so is its popularity. From the plot, we can observe that chances that a project will be successful will be higher if it belongs to a popular category. Also holds true for main category. \n\n### <font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">How about specific categories ?<\/font>   \n\nBy ploting the pdp_isolate graph we can also identify the effect of specific project categories. ","d1fafc1d":"For Category and Main Category, I have used LabelEncoder, Some people may argue that LE may not be a perfect choice for this rather OneHot Encoder should be used.

For this purpose we will use of SHAP values which are the average of marginal contributions of individual feature values across all possible coalitions. **Let's try to understand this in laymen terms**, Consider a random project from the dataset with following features:\n\n* Title contains 8 words  \n* Title contains \"machine learning\"   \n* Project goal is US 10000 dollars   \n* Project is launched on a weekday   \n\nThe trained model predicts that this project is likely to be successful with a probability of 75%. But, someone asks the question: **Why this project has the success probability of 75% not the 95% ?** To answer this question, we obtain the shap values for the prediction made by the model for this project. Shap values indicate the amount of increase or decrease in model outcome value from the average value of the predictions in the entire dataset. For example: \n\n* The average prediction value for this project would have been 45% without any model. \n* Due to the presence of 8 keywords in the project title the success probability is increased to 60%.  \n* Since, the title contains the bigram \"machine learning\", the success probability is further increased to 88%.   \n* Since the project is launched on a weekday, the success probability is increased by 2% to 90%  \n* However, since the project goal is too high (as compared to the average of the universe), the success probability is decreased from 90% to 75%.  \n\nLet's see the model predictions on the entire dataset.

This implies that crowdfunding projects related to games or entertainment such as love or fashion may not be very successful as compared to the ones related to art, design etc. \n\n**Note -** It is possible to get different results when run again, thus it is recommended to use this approach on a much bigger dataset.

Kickstarter has hosted more than 250,000 projects on their website with more than $4 Billion collective amount raised.  \n<br>\n\n![](https:\/\/people.safecreative.org\/viewimage\/viewmagazine?path=kickstarter-patreon.jpg&defaultPath=)\n\n<br>\nWhile it is true that crowdfunding is one of the most popular methods to to raise funds however the reality is that **not every project is able to completely reach the goal**. Infact, on KickStarter, only about 35 percent of the total projects have raised successful fundings in the past. This fact raises an important question - **which projects are able to successfully achieve their goal?**. In other words, can project owners somehow know what are the key project characteristics that increases the chances of success. \n\nIn many studies, Researchers and analysts have used the descriptive analysis methods on the crowdfunding data to obtain insights related to project success. While many others have also applied predictive modelling to obtain the probability of project success. However, these approaches have the fundamental problems: \n\n- Descriptive analysis - only gives surface level insights    \n- Predictive analysis - models act as the blackboxes    \n\n### About this Kernel  \nIn this kernel, I have shared a hybrid analysis approach that uses the concepts of both types of analysis enriched with the concepts of **machine learning explainability** which can be used to answer the key questions related to the success (or failure) of any crowdfunding project. The framework uses the interpretations derived from a trained machine learning model. Unlike descriptive analysis to find key insights, the focus in this approach is to make use of model behaviours and characteristics such as : Relative Feature Importances, Partial Dependencies, Permutation Importances, SHAP values. I have explained the intuition behind every approach in layman terms.

Understanding the Business Use Case<\/font>   <\/h2><br>\nThe essential business use-cases in the crowdfunding scenario can be considered from two different perspectives - from the project owner's perspective and the companies perspective. \n\n1. From the **project owner's perspective**, it is highly beneficial to be aware about the key characteristics of a project that greatly influence the success of any project. For instance, it will be interesting to pre-emptively know about following questions:   \n\n     - What is an ideal and optimal range of the funding goal for my project ?  \n     - On which day of the week, I should post the project on Kickstarter ?  \n     - How many keywords should I use in my project title ?  \n     - What should be the total length of my project description ?     \n\n\n2. From the **perspective of companies** which hosts the crowdfunding projects such as DonorsChoose.org, Patreon, and Kickstarter, they receive hundreds of thousands of project proposals every year. A large amount of manual effort is required to screen the project before it is approved to be hosted on the platform. This creates the challenges related to scalability, consistency of project vetting across volunteers, and identification of projects which require special assistance. \n\nIt is due to these two perspectives, there is a need to dig deeper and find more intutive insights related to the projects success. Using these insights, more people can get their projects funded more quickly, and with less cost to the hosting companies. This also allows the hosting companies to optimize the processes and channel even more funding directly to projects.   \n\n<div id=\"2\"><\/div>\n<h2><font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">2. Hypothesis Generation <\/font>   <\/h2> <br>\nHypothesis Generation is very powerful technique which can help an analyst to structure a very insightful and a relevant solution of a business problem. It is a process of building an intuitive approach of the business problem without even thinking about the available data. Whenever I start with any new business problem, I try to make a comprehensive list of all the factors which can be used to obtain the final output. For example, which features should affect my predictions. Or, which values of those features will give me the best possible result. In case of crowdfunding, the question can be - which features are very important to decide if a project will be successful or not.  \n\nSo, to generate the hypothesis for the use-case, we will write down a list of factors (without even looking at the available data) that can possibly be important to model the project success.   \n\n1. **Total amount to be raised** - More amount may decrease the chances that the project will be successful.  \n2. **Total duration of the project** - It is possible that projects which are active for very short or very long time periods are not successful.  \n3. **Theme of the project** - People may consider donating to a project which has a good cause or a good theme.  \n4. **Writing style of the project description** - If the message is not very clear, the project may not get complete funding.  \n5. **Length of the project description** - Very long piecies of text may not perform good as compared to shorter crisp texts.  \n6. **Project launch time** - A project launched on weekdays as compared to weekends or holidays may not get complete funding amount.  \n\nSo this is an incomplete list of possible factors we can think at this stage that may influence the project success. Now, using machine learning interpretability, not only we can try to understand which features are actually important but also what are the feature values which these features can take. \n\n<div id=\"3\"><\/div>\n<h2><font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">3.
