Kdnuggets is the most used programming language in data science with 65.5% according to Analytics data. Open source is free and free software. Python is a programming language that supports the object-oriented programming paradigm. Web, mobile and socket programming etc. is a scripting language with many features. However, it can operate independently on every platform. This is an indispensable programming language for data scientists and other programmers thanks to their diversity. In addition, it has a clear and easy-to-read format compared to other programming languages. With its wide library, it helps us in all kinds of software works. All software will be written in this programming language.<\/p><br>\n\nLink: https:\/\/www.python.org\/downloads\/ <br\/><br\/>\n\n<li><p id='2'><b>Why Python Programming Language?<\/b><\/p><\/li>\n<p>It is one of the most used programming languages by data scientists. Because there are developers all around the world. In this way, a wide variety of operations are performed. In addition, very few transactions can be performed with very little code. More than one operation is performed.Python is a powerful programming language that is easy to learn. It has a simple but effective approach to effective high-level data structures and object-oriented programming. Python's exquisite syntax and dynamic writing, combined with its interpreted nature, has made it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development across many platforms.\n\nThe Python interpreter can be easily expanded with new functions and data types implemented in C or C ++ (or other languages that can be called from C). Python is also available as an extension language for customizable applications.<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<li><p id='3'><b>Required Libraries<\/b><\/p><\/li>\n<ul>\n    <li>Numpy<\/li>\n    <p>It is a Python library that allows us to perform multiple operations on arrays, including multidimensional arrays, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices) and lots of mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, sorting, discrete Fourier. Statistical procedures and simulations can be performed using NumPy. NumPy library with C ++ does not cause any loss of performance.<\/p><br>\n    <li>Pandas<\/li>\n    <p>Pandas is an open source, BSD licensed library, offering high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. It is a library designed to work with data, allowing you to run your non-structural data as in structural databases. Pandas is designed for fast and easy data processing, collection and visualization. Therefore, it is a very preferred library for data scientists. In addition, with its own data-editing functions, you can convert your data into any format. Thanks to Pandas, we make preliminary work for our model and make it ready for the model. As a preliminary study, it is necessary to carry out editing studies by detecting missing, slingshot, incompatible and repetitive data. In this way, you can train your model smoothly and get the results properly. To use the Pandas library, we need to upload it to Anaconda.<\/p><br>\n    <li>Scikit-Learn<\/li>\n    <p>It includes many machine learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, size reduction, model selection and data removal. It is an open source library with BSD license. Together with the algorithms it contains, it creates a fast and secure coding structure. It includes the functions of expressing frequently used mathematical and physical problems in computer environment. In addition, thanks to its own web site you can look at the working principle of the algorithm you want. However, you can learn the mathematical infrastructure of the algorithm. In this way, according to your own data set you can develop the mathematical model of the algorithm yourself. By applying the model you have made on the data set, results can be obtained. Which of these results is effective in the mathematical model you will make out. In addition, you must install the scikit-learn library to Anaconda to use it.<\/p><br>\n    <li>Seaborn<\/li>\n    <p>Seaborn is a library in Python for making interesting and informative statistical graphs. Built on Matplotlib, numpy has been tightly integrated with the PyData stack, providing support for statistical templates from scipy, statsmodel, pandas data structures. It is used for graphs depicting general distributions that summarize data as in heat maps. Thanks to the many methods included in the content of high-level analysis can be made. However, the user can perform analyzes in interactive and animation structure. Today's data scientists put the seaborn library in place where the matplotlib library is missing. Thanks to Seaborn, interactive plots can be removed. In this way, we will show the dimensions of inter-feature interaction more clearly. Thanks to the different types of plots within itself, we are able to make analyzes in every format.<\/p><br>\n    <li>Matplotlib<\/li> \n    <p>Matplotlib graphical drawing package is one of the most important tools of scientific programming. With Matplotlib, a very powerful package, data can be visualized interactively, and high quality printouts are available for publishing. Both two- and three-dimensional graphics can be created. However, it is very simple to use. In addition, there are a lot of information about this package on the internet, but for data scientists can take all kinds of analysis. As a result of your analysis, you can save the resulting graph as output. You can then add it as an addition to the report you made later. It will be used to explain the results obtained from various analyzes and evaluations in the application orally and graphically. So much so that we use the algorithm to show us the most accurate results. In this way, we will guide us for further analysis.
