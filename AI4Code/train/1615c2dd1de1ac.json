an its Significance`\nOne of the most important steps on the way to building a great machine learning model\n\n`What is a feature and why we need to engineer it?`\n* determine which features are most important with mutual information\n* invent new features in several real-world problem domains\n* encode high-cardinality categoricals with a target encoding\n* prepare proper input dataset, compatible with machine learning algorithm requirements\n* improve performance of machine learning models\n\nAccording to a survey in Forbes, data scientists spend 80% of their time on data preparation. That's why we need feature engineering for extracting useful features from raw data using maths, statistics and domain knowledge\n\nThe best way to achieve expertise is practicing different techniques on various datasets and observing their effect on model performances.
