On the contrary, when a midfielder shoots, it is always a \"specialist\", who probably trains this exercise a lot when off the pitch.","30d31534":"We now know the percentage of success in each of the situations in which a player takes a penalty.\n\nWe can for example try to see if there is a correlation between the success rate of the penalty and its \"decisiveness\". LTD & DTW are considered as decisive, and LND & WND as non-decisive.","c6c693f8":"We can see that decisive penalties have a success rate of 70,69%, while non-decisive ones have a success rate of 76,47%. So this is a quite strong correlation, even stronger than in PL, nearly 6% of difference.\n\nToo much pressure on the shooters?\n\nWe can now try to see if there is a link with the team being home or away.","cd704245":"We can see that 71 penaltys were scored in 19-20 season of Premier League, which represent 74,74% of success.\nNow let's try to see the success regarding the score of the game when the penalty is taken.\n\nltd = from lose to draw (the team is losing by one goal)\n\ndtw = from draw to win (the game is currently a draw)\n\nlnd = lose not decisive (the team is already losing by 2 goals or more)\n\nwnd = win not decisive (the team is already winning)","96a17ef8":"We can see that 18,9% of penaltys are shot in a Lose to Draw situation, 43,1% in a Draw to Win, etc.\nWe can note that there were only 8 penaltys taken in Premier League this season when the team was already losing by more than one goal.\n\nWe would now like to study the success for each of these \"types\" of penalties.","64121d15":"There seems to be a huge correlation between the Home\/Away situation of the team, and the success in the penalty: **95,74% of Home penalties** were scored last season in the Premier League, and only **54,17% of Away** ones.","c984ddcb":"After this test above, let's now try to gather some useful information about the penaltys in Premier League.","238ada74":"So in France, there were a majority of penalties that were given to the home team, but the number for away team is still important.\n\nAnd Home teams succeed more often, but the difference is quite low, around 4%, which is low compared to the Premier League.","90a6e846":"Now we can study other parameters such as the position of the players shooting, using the same method.","7e0721aa":"We can see that attackers (strikers and wingers) are by far the players who shoot the penalties more often.\n\nNow let's see if they are more successful than the other players!","63f92c0a":"We can see that 22,8% of penaltys are shot in a Lose to Draw situation, 40,2% in a Draw to Win, etc. We can note that there were only 7 penaltys taken in Ligue 1 this season when the team was already losing by more than one goal.\n\nWe would now like to study the success for each of these \"types\" of penalties."}}
