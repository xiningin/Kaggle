","83752da8":"## 2.2 Group products, calculate the mean of reorders\n\nNow to calculate the reorder probability we will use the aggregation function mean() to the reordered column. In the reorder data frame, the reordered column indicates that a product has been reordered when the value is 1.\n\nSo the mean() calculates how many times a product has been reordered, divided by how many times has been ordered in total. \n\nE.g., for a product that has been ordered 6 times in total, where 3 times has been reordered, the ratio will be:\n\n![example ratio](https:\/\/latex.codecogs.com\/gif.latex?\\bg_white&space;mean=&space;\\frac{0&plus;1&plus;0&plus;0&plus;1&plus;1}{6}&space;=&space;0,5) \n\nNow we calculate the ratio for each product.

Our goal is to find how many products are included in each order.\n\nTo achieve this, we follow a procedure that consists of two steps:\n1. Split our DataFrame into groups: The groups are created based on the different values that can be found on a specific column (in our case different order numbers in the column \"order_id\"). Note that the column has categorical data rather than actual values.\n2. Apply an aggregation function on them: Aggregation functions are actually all these functions that can turn the values of a column of group into a single value. Some aggregation functions are the mean, count, sum, max & min.\n\nIn our case we use count() aggregation function which returns the number of values found on a column (in our case product_id). Subsequently, we will get the number of products placed on each order.","465033bc":"# 2. Which products have the highest probability of being reordered?\nIn this section we want to find the products which have the highest probability of being reordered. Towards this end it is necessary to define the probability as below:\n![Probability](https:\/\/imgur.com\/VLgKGeY.png)\nExample: The product with product_id=2 is included in 90 purchases but only 12 are reorders.
