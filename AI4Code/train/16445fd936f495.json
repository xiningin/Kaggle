Based on this a bot can answer simple queries but sometimes fails to answer complex queries.\n\nSelf-Learning Approach \u2013 These bots follow the machine learning approach which is rather more efficient and is further divided into two more categories.\n\nRetrieval-Based Models \u2013 In this approach, the bot retrieves the best response from a list of responses according to the user input.\n\nGenerative Models \u2013 These models often come up with answers than searching from a set of answers which makes them intelligent bots as well.","765efb4d":"# Work in Progress...\n## many more to Come..........","006e57e1":"## Creating object of ChatBot class with Logic Adapter","ed089f49":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","5c80742a":"## Chatbot Testing\n\nFor testing its responses, we will call the get_responses() method of Chatbot instance."}}
