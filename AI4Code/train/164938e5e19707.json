It was put together in a couple of hours. \nThis also serves as some self-deprecating humour as I'm pretty single as a person can get and am still a virgin. (But, I am not depressed or am not over\/under weight. I can vouch for that.)\n\nThere are a lot of other questions that can be asked to follow up the analysis. Questions such as : How many over\/underweight people joined a gym to improve themselves? \nCan shed some more light into the world of single men and women. ","9296b3af":"A few things pop out on looking at the result above:\n1. There seem to be more than one answer per responder\n2. The answers are all separated by a comma.\n3. There are a few custom answers. I guess that these people had a lot of time on their hands (self-evident. They're single XD ).","069ec200":"Whuuut?! The relationship between virginity and bodyweight doesn't seem to deviate too much from the actual relationship. If so, then why do so many people join the gym as a means to improve themselves? It's pretty counter intuitive.  \nMan alive, this is a cool finding. ","af0e1068":"Well, the observed relationship does seem to differ from what it's supposed to be. Now, if assume that their depression is not caused by any other factor (we might ignore these since trying to measure them is too much work), we can ask a follow up question: Are the virgins single because they are depressed? Or are they depressed because they are single? \n\nEven though we ignored other causes of depression, it's more likely that the people who are depressed have a hard time finding a partner because of their depression, which makes it hard for them to communicate. Cool. ","623a677c":"Ok. We can see that there are a few discrepancies with the results. But, these don't inhibit the interpretability of the result. So, I won't write any code to fix them. (The problem is that there are leading\/trailing whitespaces in the column names). \n\nOn first look, it seems that most people are looking for a wingperson. On second look, it becomes clear that most people are looking for a person to set them up on dates. \n\nThe top three favours that these guys want from others are:\n1. Set up with dates.\n2. A wingperson.\n3. Date coaching.\n\nWe did exclude some bravehearts who said that they don't want any help. Well, good for you.","4fa2e64b":"Next up, **what is the most common self-improvement method that these guys have opted for?**\n\nI'll follow the same method to answer this question too.","900c82e7":"Joining a gym seems to be the most common option to improve oneself. \nHonestly, I don't understand these people? Why join a gym when you can craft the bod-of-your-dreams at your local park with calisthenics? I bet that it's a sure fire way to get more people to notice you. ","126fd38b":"There are 469 rows and 12 variables.  And, all of it is string data. There a couple of fields that can be converted to bool. But, we'll leave these as objects.\n\nThere seem to about 13 missing values in the job_title column. Since this column isn't a part of our analysis, we'll just drop it. ","e2754189":"# Konnichiwa!\nHere's the deal? Are you single? Are you a virgin? There's a 52.66% chance that you're depressed. (If you aren't single, or aren't a  virgin or aren't depressed, more power to you.)\n\nThis is a rather jovial attempt to find out some facts about virginity and losing it. Nothing else. Let's get right into it. ","2b0483ee":"So, there will be more follow ups to this. Maybe incorporate some ML into this too. But, this is it for now. \nIf you enjoyed reading this, then awesome. I really did enjoy working on this. So, this is it for now. \nSayonara!","93354096":"As with the previous categorical relationship, we'll check if the observed relationship is different from the actual. \n[I've calculated the expected values by hand. The formula for calculating expected values is\n    E(i, j) = (T(i) * T(j)) \/ N\n    where E(i, j) is the expected value in the ith row and jth column\n    T(i) is the total for the ith row\n    T(j) is the total for the jth column\n    and N is the overall total.\n]","b5826f05":"There seem to be more depressed people among virgins. There seem to be more depressed people among non-virgins. Overall, there seem to be more depressed people. \n\nBut, if we look at the percent differences in each of the categories, clearly, the difference is higher amongst the people who are virgins. This difference is 25% in the non-virgin group and a staggering 135% in the virgin group. ","1948be18":"My aim with this kernel is two-fold: Answer 4 questions that popped up in my head when I first saw this dataset and practice a little Py4DS (since I'm new to Py4DS).\n\nIn that spirit, these are the 4 questions that popped into my head:\n1. What is the most common way in which people try to improve themselves?\n2. What is the most common favour that people want?\n3. Is there a relationship between depression and virginity?\n4. Is there a relationship between bodyweight and virginity?","73b12f08":"The last question: Is there a relationship between bodyweight and virginity?\nThis is a pretty interesting one. We saw earlier that the most common choice for self-improvement was to join a gym. Assumably, this has something to do with weight  and\/or appearance. People who are over weight are looking to lose the love handles, while those who are underweight are probably looking to get healthy. While those who are in the normal range might want to shape their bodies properly to attract more potential partners.\n\nEnough talk. Let's get to the code.","48fc0e38":"The third question: What's the relationship between depression and virginity?\nThis is a pretty cool question. Seeing how reports of depression are reaching sky-high levels, this might shed some light into the problem.","deb14442":"The first two questions are simple aggregations. They don't need a lot of thinking about. The nex three however, need a little more code and they do produce some rather unexpected results. So, let's start!","87f2f1ca":"So here's what we'll do:\n1. We'll split based on the comma\n2. We'll get the counts of each of the entries.\nAlso, there's this entry \"I don't want help\". We'll ignore that.\n\nWe can do this programatically. But, there's another (pandas) method to help us do this: .get_dummies()","822aa051":"So, let's get on with the analysis. First up, **which is the most common method of help that people want from others?**\nTo answer this, we'll need to look at the what_help_from_others column.","97875dd0":"But, is this the true relationship? Is there a deviation from the expected value and is this deviation significant? Let's check it out."}}
