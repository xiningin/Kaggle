The problem is that these probabilities are usually unknown in real-world problems. Luckily there are control techniques that can work in these unknown environments. These techniques don't leverage any prior knowledge about the environment's dynamics, they are model-free.","39636749":"### Reinforce\n- The reinforce object contains the algorithms for solving move chess\n- The agent and the environment are attributes of the Reinforce object","6357a22d":"# 2.3 TD-lambda\n**Theory**  \nIn Monte Carlo we do a full-depth backup while in Temporal Difference Learning we de a 1-step backup.
