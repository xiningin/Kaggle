Fully vaccinated people who test positive for COVID-19 more than 2 weeks after their completed vaccine dose series are called \"breakthrough infections.\" No vaccine is 100 percent effective, and as such we expect to see some fully vaccinated people test positive for COVID-19. Breakthrough cases typically report mild illness or no symptoms\"\n\n\"Your likelihood of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 is determined by many factors, which include vaccinations, but also include the level of transmission and vaccine coverage in your community, whether you or others wear masks as recommended, the number of people you have close contact with, and more. On average, fully vaccinated individuals are less likely to be infected, hospitalized, and die from COVID-19 compared to unvaccinated individuals.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dhs.wisconsin.gov\/covid-19\/vaccine-status.htm#summary","b5a0366e":"\"These charts show the rate of confirmed and probable cases, deaths per 100,000 amongst fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated people by month. It also displays the percent of the population who completed their COVID-19 vaccine series by the first of the month for added context on how Wisconsin statewide vaccination efforts have progressed. Viewing case, death data as rates allows the two groups to be compared directly while accounting for differences in population size across groups, especially as the proportion of fully vaccinated people increases.\"\n\n\n<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">Breakthrough Infections<\/span><\/h1><br>\n\n\"Fully vaccinated people who test positive for COVID-19 more than 2 weeks after their completed vaccine dose series are called breakthrough infections. Breakthrough infections shown in the data only include those that meet the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) vaccine breakthrough infection definition(link is external).

This allows them to match person records between COVID-19 cases and vaccination status.
