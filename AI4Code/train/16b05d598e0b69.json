Africa with over 50 countries regarded as less developed ranks last on the log.\n\n* Why is this data\/ranking important? \nIt is important because in the ranking by continents from the general dataset below, which considers all age groups is different from this middle-aged dataset.

If you combine this with the 17.3 percent who have between 3 to 5 years of experience then, you have a relatively a large number of middle-aged people (47 percent of middle-aged people currently in the profession) just coming into the data science space. It is expected that at age between 45 and 59, you should be at the twilight of your career. Why are many middle-aged people coming into the data science space?\n\nThe main dataset for all age groups shows that we have more youthful people than middle-aged people right now in the data science career space. Some questions comes to mind\n\nIs data science an enduring career? Will the youths entering the space right now retire as data scientists? Is there a Data Science lure for young people? How sustainable is this lure - do young data scientist get disenchanted along the way before the Middle Ages? Is there any transitional or fail-safe mechanism in place to help youths navigate the Data Science space during their middle ages?\n\nData science is largely still evolving and the need to learn new topics is constantly increasing. Two important questions comes to mind based on the foregoing. Therefore, is there any truth in the myth that says as you grow in age the drive to learn new things slows down? Can we do away with the experience of the middle-aged people just because they might be slowing down?\n\nIs the middle-aged period an endangered period for data scientist? Are the middle aged data scientists endangered? Will they have a fair chance for job openings like their youthful counterparts?\n\nI fall within this group as I am less than a year old in data science.
