In the latter half of the 20th century, rockets were developed that were powerful enough to overcome the force of gravity to reach orbital velocities, paving the way for space exploration to become a reality. We have been venturing into space since October 4, 1957, when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. In this notebook let's explore more on the various space missions happended since 1957.#####","a4567280":"#### RVSN USSR has the maximum launches.

The RVSN was first formed in the Soviet Armed Forces, and when the USSR collapsed in December 1991, it effectively changed its name from the Soviet to the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces or Strategic Missile Troops.","3843231d":"#### The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) has the maximum number of active space missions followed by Arianespace. \n\n#### Though USSR has the maximum launches, it was active from the 1930s until the state's collapse in 1991. Hence, none of their missions are active.
