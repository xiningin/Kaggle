You can get a result from the slot machine by calling `play_slot_machine()`. The number it returns is your winnings in dollars. Usually it returns 0.

Don't worry, we'll send you the bill later.\n\nOn average, how much money can you expect to gain (or lose) every time you play the machine?  The casino keeps it a secret, but you can estimate the average value of each pull using a technique called the **Monte Carlo method**. To estimate the average outcome, we simulate the scenario many times, and return the average result.\n\nComplete the following function to calculate the average value per play of the slot machine.","83a5b216":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
