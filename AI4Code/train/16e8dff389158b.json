The two-week lockdown, which could be extended if the spread of the virus continues, restricts public gatherings and bans family and holiday gatherings. Citizens over 65 are expected to stay home, but others are allowed to exercise outdoors on their own.\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases in Kazakhstan has grown tenfold since the first lockdown measures began to be lifted. By May 11, the last day of the state of emergency and lockdown, Kazakhstan had registered 5,207 coronavirus cases and 32 deaths. As of July 13, there were 59,899 confirmed coronavirus cases and 375 deaths in the country. But the situation is evolving quickly and could be a lot worse than this.\n\nSerious concerns have been raised about the pneumonia data. Between July 1 and 8, Kazakhstan registered 56,809 cases of pneumonia \u2013 on top of the confirmed cases of COVID-19. These pneumonia cases included the \u201cusual pneumonia\u201d \u2013 viral (7,348) and bacterial (9,759) \u2013 as well as 39,702 \u201cunspecified\u201d viral pneumonia cases which have a similar course of disease as coronavirus, according to the health minister. Pneumonia patients with negative coronavirus tests are not included in the government\u2019s official statistics of coronavirus.https:\/\/theconversation.com\/coronavirus-kazakhstan-denies-unknown-pneumonia-reports-but-has-imposed-second-national-lockdown-142523","9c39528a":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata   @mpwolke ","42d1cfb6":"#Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis\n\n#Estimating the future burden of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in India, the Philippines, Russia, and South #Africa: a mathematical modelling study.\n\nAuthors: Sharma A,  Hill A Kurbatova E et al. - Lancet Infect Dis. 2017; 17: 707-715\n\nMultidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis are emerging worldwide. The Green Light Committee initiative supported programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis in 90 countries. We used estimates from the Preserving Effective TB Treatment Study to predict MDR and XDR tuberculosis trends in four countries with a high burden of MDR tuberculosis: India, the Philippines, Russia, and South Africa.\n\nThe model forecasted the percentage of MDR tuberculosis among incident cases of tuberculosis to increase, reaching 12\u00b74% (95% prediction interval 9\u00b74\u201316\u00b72) in India, 8\u00b79% (4\u00b75\u201311\u00b77) in the Philippines, 32\u00b75% (27\u00b70\u201335\u00b78) in Russia, and 5\u00b77% (3\u00b70\u20137\u00b76) in South Africa in 2040. It also predicted the percentage of XDR tuberculosis among incident MDR tuberculosis to increase, reaching 8\u00b79% (95% prediction interval 5\u00b71\u201312\u00b79) in India, 9\u00b70% (4\u00b70\u201314\u00b77) in the Philippines, 9\u00b70% (4\u00b78\u201314\u00b72) in Russia, and 8\u00b75% (2\u00b75\u201314\u00b77) in South Africa in 2040. Acquired drug resistance would cause less than 30% of incident MDR tuberculosis during 2000\u201340. Acquired drug resistance caused 80% of incident XDR tuberculosis in 2000, but this estimate would decrease to less than 50% by 2040.\n\nMDR and XDR tuberculosis were forecast to increase in all four countries despite improvements in acquired drug resistance shown by the Green Light Committee-supported programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Additional control efforts beyond improving acquired drug resistance rates are needed to stop the spread of MDR and XDR tuberculosis in countries with a high burden of MDR tuberculosis.https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/article\/S0140-6736(19)31882-3\/fulltext#back-bib88","e910ff01":"#Diagnostic and treatment algorithm for presumptive multidrug-resistant TB cases registered at four sites in Kazakhstan from 1 August 2012 to 31 May 2013. \nFigure posted on 16.07.2015, 00:11 by Sanne Christine van Kampen Aigul Tursynbayeva Aliya Koptleuova Zauresh Murzabekova Lyazzat Bigalieva Moldir Aubakirova Svetlana Pak Susan van den Hof\n\n\n![](https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/ppreviews-plos-725668748\/2179271\/preview.jpg)https:\/\/plos.figshare.com\/articles\/_Diagnostic_and_treatment_algorithm_for_presumptive_multidrug_resistant_TB_cases_registered_at_four_sites_in_Kazakhstan_from_1_August_2012_to_31_May_2013_\/1485997","673d7899":"Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. With the targets of the WHO End TB Strategy set, the need for effective prevention and treatment is even more urgent. Despite the many challenges faced in tuberculosis research, including low capacity for human efficacy testing of vaccines, multidrug-resistance, and poor links between diagnosis and treatment of children with tuberculosis, there has been substantial progress.\n\nIn this Series, they present how diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis can be improved, how drug regimens could be used to best treat different patient populations, and future perspectives for management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. They highlight the gap in knowledge surrounding children with tuberculosis and how testing can be improved. They also present the latest insights into the field of tuberculosis vaccine development, looking at clinical and preclinical trials, the challenges that remain to be overcome, and how controlled human infection models and tools, such as in-vitro functional killing assays, can facilitate vaccine selection.https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/article\/S0140-6736(19)31882-3\/fulltext","7e34e33e":"#Drug-resistant TB\n\n![](http:\/\/www.unrussia.ru\/sites\/default\/files\/p2eng.png)http:\/\/www.unrussia.ru\/en\/un-in-russia\/news\/2017-03-24","9f9e3099":"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis)\n\nIt' s a major public health concern in many countries. Over the past decade, the number of patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to the most effective drugs against tuberculosis (ie, rifampicin and isoniazid), which is called multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, has continued to increase.\n\nGlobally, 4\u00b76% of patients with tuberculosis have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but in some areas, like Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Ukraine, this proportion exceeds 25%. Treatment for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is prolonged (ie, 9\u201324 months) and patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have less favourable outcomes than those treated for drug-susceptible tuberculosis.\n\nIndividualised multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment with novel (eg, bedaquiline) and repurposed (eg, linezolid, clofazimine, or meropenem) drugs and guided by genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing can improve treatment outcomes. Some clinical trials are evaluating 6-month regimens to simplify management and improve outcomes of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

It also introduced a substantial package of financial measures to fight the pandemic, and monthly payments for people who lost their income during the state of emergency in April and May.\n\nBut once the quarantine measures eased, many Kazakhstani citizens began to ignore social-distancing guidance. Many underestimated the risks of the virus: they hurried to offices, cafes, pubs, parks and fitness centres. Families gathered for large weddings, birthdays and funerals. Soon, initial optimism about the government\u2019s handling of the virus would be replaced with panic, helplessness and disillusion.\n\nAs a result of the spike in coronavirus and pneumonia cases, citizens have complained about overcrowded hospitals, lack of COVID-19 tests, long queues for testing laboratories and pharmacies, and a deficit of medicines.\n\nPanic-buying of medicines has led to speculation and the sale of drugs on the black market at much higher prices. At the outbreak of the pandemic, Kazakhstan received international humanitarian support, including from the US, China and Russia. Now social media has been flooded with photos of medicines bought at pharmacies with stickers showing they were donated as humanitarian aid and so should not be for sale.https:\/\/theconversation.com\/coronavirus-kazakhstan-denies-unknown-pneumonia-reports-but-has-imposed-second-national-lockdown-142523","abed638c":"#`source_rr_new`\",\"Estimates\",,\"Method used to estimate proportion of new TB patients with rifampicin-resistant TB\"\n\n#\"`e_rr_pct_new`\",\"Estimates\",,\"Estimated percentage of new TB cases with rifampicin resistant TB"}}
