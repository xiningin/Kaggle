Hint: strings are `str` in native Python.","26c1460d":"**Exercise 5**: A neat property of boolean data types, like the ones created by the `isnull()` method, is that `False` gets treated as 0 and `True` as 1 when performing math on the values. Thus, the `sum()` of a list of boolean values will return how many times `True` appears in that list.\nCreate a `pandas` `Series` showing how many times each of the columns in the dataset contains null values.

Create a `Series` counting the number of times each value occurs in the `region_1` field. This field is often missing data, so replace missing values with `Unknown`. Sort in descending order.
