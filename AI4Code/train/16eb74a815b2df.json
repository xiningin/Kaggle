Write a query to get the average number of riders per station for each year in the dataset and order by the year so you can see the trend. You can use the `EXTRACT` method to get the day and year from the start time timestamp.

BigQuery is especially efficient with large datasets, so you'll use BigQuery-ML (called BQML) to build your model. BQML uses a \"linear regression\" model when predicting numeric outcomes, like the number of riders.\n\n## 1) Training vs testing\n\nYou'll want to test your model on data it hasn't seen before (for reasons described in the [Intro to Machine Learning Micro-Course](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-machine-learning). What do you think is a good approach to splitting the data? What data should we use to train, what data should we use for test the model?","2e939824":"# Stocking rental bikes\n\n![bike rentals](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/a0\/Bay_Area_Bike_Share_launch_in_San_Jose_CA.jpg\/640px-Bay_Area_Bike_Share_launch_in_San_Jose_CA.jpg)\n\nYou stock bikes for a bike rental company in Austin, ensuring stations have enough bikes for all their riders. You decide to build a model to predict how many riders will start from each station during each hour, capturing patterns in seasonality, time of day, day of the week, etc.\n\nTo get started, create a project in GCP and connect to it by running the code cell below. Make sure you have connected the kernel to your GCP account in Settings.","998c7c15":"Write your query below:","4f83b00b":"## 8) What do your results tell you?\n\nGiven the daily average riders per station over the years, does it make sense that the model is failing?","49ea0467":"### This exercise is designed to pair with [this tutorial](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rtatman\/bigquery-machine-learning-tutorial).

Share your ideas on the [Kaggle Learn Forums](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn-forum)! (I'll pick a couple of my favorite ideas & send the folks who shared them a Kaggle t-shirt. :)","6171b25b":"## 4) Exercise: Model evaluation\n\nNow that you have a model, evaluate it's performance on data from 2018. \n\n\n> Note that the ML.EVALUATE function will return different metrics depending on what's appropriate for your specific model. You can just use the regular ML.EVALUATE funciton here. (ROC curves are generally used to evaluate binary problems, not linear regression, so there's no reason to plot one here.)","ec310325":"You should see that the r^2 score here is negative. Negative values indicate that the model is worse than just predicting the mean rides for each example.\n\n## 5) Theories for poor performance\n\nWhy would your model be doing worse than making the most simple prediction based on historical data?","ea5a6321":"## Model creation\n\nNow it's time to turn this data into a model. You'll use the `CREATE MODEL` statement that has a structure like: \n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE MODEL`model_dataset.bike_trips`\nOPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg') AS \n-- training data query goes here\nSELECT ...\n    column_with_labels AS label\n    column_with_data_1 \n    column_with_data_2\nFROM ... \nWHERE ... (Optional)\nGROUP BY ... (Optional)\n```\n\nThe `model_type` and `optimize_strategy` shown here are good parameters to use in general for predicting numeric outcomes with BQML.\n\n**Tip:** Using ```CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL``` rather than just ```CREATE MODEL``` ensures you don't get an error if you want to run this command again without first deleting the model you've created.","729725a6":"## 3) Exercise: Create and train the model\n\nBelow, write your query to create and train a linear regression model on the training data.","a8ae2bdb":"## 6) Exercise: Looking at predictions\n\nA good way to figure out where your model is going wrong is to look closer at a small set of predictions.

You can use the public Austin bike share dataset from the `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` table. You predict the number of rides based on the station where the trip starts and the hour when the trip started. Use the `TIMESTAMP_TRUNC` function to truncate the start time to the hour."}}
