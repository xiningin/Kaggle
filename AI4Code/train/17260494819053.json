Printable version of report can be made by saving it to file\n* Allows customization of report\u2019s sections and their look\n* Has a parameter that allows to work with large datasets, though it disables some sections of report\n\n\n### Dataprep pros\n* Report\u2019s sections are on one long output section. Better for making print copy of the report\n* Allows to show separate sections of a report without printing the whole\n\n\n### Significant difference (for the same dataset)\n#### General features\n* Dataprep shows details about section or some plot detail when holding mouse over.\n\n#### Overview section\n* Total size in memory shown in Dataprep is 10 times larger than in PP.\n* Additional type of variable in Dataprep \u2013 GeoGraphy.\n* PP doesn\u2019t show that price variable is skewed.\n* Dataprep doesn\u2019t show correlations.\n* 3 variables are shown as uniformly distributed in PP, only one in Dataprep. In both cases these are text variables.\n\n\n#### Variables section\n* PP duplicates info from Warnings section (from Overview) for each variable \u2013 distribution, correlations.\n* Dataprep\u2019s histogram is larger, easier to read. It shows top ten counts, while in PP there are top five and Others due to different plot orientation.\n* Both have the same fields in statistical description of a variable.\n* Memory size for each variable shown in PP is the same, seems to be wrong. Column with IDs can\u2019t occupy the same memory as the description does with it\u2019s long text fields.\n* Dataprep shows the percentage of that top ten when holding mouse over. That can be useful.\n\n#### Variable details (textual)\n* Both show stats for words\u2019 lengths (min\/max and mean) and their distribution, total characters, word frequency.\n* Dataprep contains pie chart for words and wordcloud (what for?).\n* PP shows letter frequency. Can be useful when determining the language.\n\n#### Variable details (numeric)\n* Both contain quantiles and descriptive statistics.\n* Details is the place where PP hides the adequate plot for frequency (I mean plot\u2019s size). Besides, here we can see common and extreme values. Can be useful.\n* PP shows the [Median Absolute Deviation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Median_absolute_deviation)\n* Dataprep shows the KDE and Q-Q plots and a boxplot\n\n#### Interactions between numeric variables\n* Scatterplot in Dataprep\n* Hexbin plot in PP\n\n#### Correlations between numeric variables\n* Both show Pearson, Spearman and Kendall.\n* PP shows Phi coefficient and Cramer\u2019s V coefficient (with descriptions of what they are).\n\n#### Missing values\n* Both show barcharts, heatmaps and dendrograms.\n* Matrix chart in PP with too small size to interpret something\n* Spectrum chart in Dataprep has percentage of total missing values and mouseover shows it for distinct data parts (i.e. IDs from 0 to 6498, from 6498 to 12996 etc.). Interesting, that the edge values come into this plot twice, at least it seems to be so.\n* Heatmaps. PP shows values straight on the plot, while Dataprep requires to move mouse over.\n* Dendrograms. Honestly, I do not know for now, how to interpret them in the case of missing data, but Dataprep has a typo. Dendogram.\n\n#### Samples\n* PP shows the first ten and the last ten rows of data.\n* Dataprep does not, but we have head(10) and tail(10), ok?\n\n### My resume after that? I will use Dataprep. It seems to me comfortable in using, at least for now. I am not a very experienced data analyst.\n","fdd6303d":"# Package 2.
