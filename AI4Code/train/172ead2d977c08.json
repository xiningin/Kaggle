'sub-district' pronounced: up\u00f4jela), formerly called thana, is an administrative region in Bangladesh. They function as sub-units of districts. Their functionality can be seen to be analogous to that of a county or a borough of Western countries. Rural upazilas are further administratively divided into union council areas (Union Parishads). https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Upazila","4f023823":"#Rohingya Refugee Crisis\n\nThe Rohingya people have faced decades of systematic discrimination, statelessness and targeted violence in Rakhine State, Myanmar. Such persecution has forced Rohingya women, girls, boys and men into Bangladesh for many years, with significant spikes following violent attacks in 1978, 1991-1992, and again in 2016. Yet it was August 2017 that triggered by far the largest and fastest refugee influx into Bangladesh. Since then, an estimated 745,000 Rohingya\u2014including more than 400,000 children\u2014have fled into Cox\u2019s Bazar.\n\nIn Myanmar, entire villages were burned to the ground, families were separated and killed, and women and girls were gang raped. Most of the people who escaped were severely traumatized after witnessing unspeakable atrocities. These people found temporary shelter in refugee camps around Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, which is now home to the world\u2019s largest refugee camp.\n\nAs of March 2019, over 909,000 stateless Rohingya refugees reside in Ukhiya and Teknaf Upazilas. The vast majority live in 34 extremely congested camps, including the largest single site, the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, which is host to approximately 626,500 Rohingya refugees.\n\n A Joint Response Plan was launched in February 2019, requesting US$ 920.5 million to provide life-saving assistance to 1.2 million people, including Rohingya refugees who fled Myanmar to Bangladesh and local host communities. As of 17 April, the appeal is 17 per cent funded. The priority needs in the plan, which covers the January-December 2019 timeframe, include food, water and sanitation, shelter, and medical care. https:\/\/www.unocha.org\/rohingya-refugee-crisis"}}
