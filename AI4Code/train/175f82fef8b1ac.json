Then we trace out predicted outcomes (on the vertical axis). To have a more robust representation, we make this process to multiple rows of data, and plot the average predicted outcome.","312b80b4":"#### Train","aa99622d":"### Now we can finally take some insights from our model.\n\n#### Let's begin with permutation importance, XGBoost already give us a nice way to visualize feature importance base on F score, let's take a look.","2edab327":"So, the values can go from green to red, being the greener the more important the feature is (top features) and the whiter, less important the feature is (bottom features).\n\nThe first number in each row shows how much model performance  (in this case, using \"accuracy\" as the performance metric) decreased with a random shuffling with a confidence interval (variance from the multiple shuffles).\n\nNegative values (red) means that the shuffling actually improved the model performance, so those features don't really matter but the shuffling (fake data) improved them.\n\nIn this case the top 2 features (the 2 most important) were the same that we got from XGBoost feature importance method, but here \"Pclass\" seems to be as important as \"Age\", another interesting thing here is that \"Sex_female\" and \"Sex_female\" have the same importance, this may seem strange at first but remember that they are true\/false features, and the opposite of the other, so actually this make all sense.","9d3f511d":"### Feature engineering","6bb582f2":"### SHAP values\n* SHAP Values (an acronym from SHapley Additive exPlanations) break down a prediction to show the impact of each feature.\n* It can be used to help explain how the model got to one prediction, e.g. a model says a bank shouldn't loan someone money, and the bank is legally required to explain the basis for each loan rejection.\n* SHAP values interpret the impact of having a certain value for a given feature in comparison to the prediction we'd make if that feature took some baseline value.","ba553ad6":"Here we have something interesting, again people from higher classes had more chance to survive, but for people from the 3rd class females seems to had less chance to survive, what may be the cause?","b7e78e4b":"The second plot show the interaction from \"Pclass\" and \"Sex_female\", this on is pretty clear as well, we can see that the people with the higher chance to survive were female (Sex_female = 1) and from the 1st class (Pclass = 1), and the ones with the lowest chances were the opposite, males from the 3rd class.\n\nThis kind of plot give us a good understanding of what our model learned, and how features behaves according to it, one good idea would be to validate this insights with the domain expert and see if everything is going as expected.","fb93531f":"Based on this graph we can see that age and fare values were the most important features (older and people who paid more had a higher chance to survive), also females had more chance than males to survive.","cfa7c0a4":"About the plot\n* The y axis is interpreted as change in the prediction from what it would be predicted at the baseline or leftmost value.\n* A blue shaded area indicates level of confidence\n\nHere we have a strange behavior, on the first few points, this may be because of the small dataset and some noisy data, but if we smooth that line, we can see that the higher the fare is more it contributes to higher predictions, this is true to around fare = 60, from this point it seems that increasing fare has no impact in predictions. Anyway the impact seems to be small.\n\n### Let's try on \"Pclass\"","48c0dd97":"### Split data","e5a76acf":"#### Validation","365eaf22":"### Now we can try permutation importance.\n* Permutation importance is a cool technique that give us another angle evaluation feature importance.\n* It's calculated after a model has been fitted.\n* Basically we ask the following question: If I randomly shuffle a single column of the validation data, leaving the target and all other columns in place, how would that affect the accuracy of predictions in that now-shuffled data?\n* This way if a feature has high importance shuffling it should lower our model metrics, on the other hand if shuffling don't impact the metrics too much that feature has low importance (it doesn't really matter to the model).\n\n\n###### Important note here for anyone trying to use eli5's PermutationImportance on XGBoost estimators, currently you need to train your models using \".as_matrix()\" with you input data (X and Y), otherwise PermutationImportance won't work.","78ec509d":"* Each dot represents a row of the data.\n* The horizontal location is the actual value from the dataset.\n* The vertical location shows what having that value did to the prediction.\n* Color show the values of another feature, to help we see how they interact.\n\nHere we can see how \"Pclass\" and \"Fare\" interact together affecting the predictions, it's clear that higher fares means lower class (1st class), and in general people who paid more had more chance to survive.\n\nLet's try another one.","00431f88":"### Model\n* Model really isn't the focus here so I won't try to build something super good, but I think it's good to leave a clear and organized code anyway.","296c35e5":"Feature values causing increased predictions are in pink, and their visual size shows the magnitude of the feature's effect. Feature values decreasing the prediction are in blue. The features that more increase prediction values were \"Sex_female\" and \"Sex_male\" (the person here was a female) here seems clear that having both \"Sex_female\" and \"Sex_male\" is redundant, as they mean the same. And the feature that decreased more the prediction was \"Pclass\" that in this case was 3.\n\nIf you subtract the length of the blue bars from the length of the pink bars, it equals the distance from the base value to the output.","d7e661f4":"#### And finally because this is a kernel from a competition, let's make our predictions and output results.","3f7e76ae":"### Dependencies","82f4e31b":"### Advanced Uses of SHAP Values\n\n### SHAP summary plots\n* These plots will give us a more detailed view of feature importance and what is driving it.","e4c8f9ff":"### Load data"}}
