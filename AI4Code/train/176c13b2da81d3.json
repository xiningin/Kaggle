Retaining car value against what?\n    - Milage is probably the best value to measure against, as it tracks the level of usage regardless of when the car is produced.\n    - However, running a simple regression puts us at risk getting of getting influenced by small number of samples that exist at either extremes of mileage values.\n    - Instead of running a regression, I will be assigning cars a label based on their mileage percentiles and compare their medians.\n2. Should same model of cars produced in different year be considered a different entity?\n    - It is true that carmakers make minor adjustments to cars produced in later years. However, changes tend to be relatively minor. I will use model as the only distinct category in this analysis.\n3. This is a used car dataset. How would you estimate the value retained after a new car is bought?\n    - Unfortunately, the data pertains only on used car sales. Therefore, this analysis would be applicable for used cars only, regardless of its milage. It will not be able to capture the discount between brand new cars versus used cars.\n    - Meanwhile, dataset contains data on used cars with extremely low mileage, and they are going to be used as a benchmark when comparing the value retained after gainin mileage.","29755767":"## Multi-variable examination","8d0af168":"Nothing looks off from the initial printout","720bf17d":"Potential second option is to increase the order of polynomial which the regression is ran on. \n\nIn that case, a 2nd order may seem like a potential candidate. ","bbffcd78":"Greater milage yields lower price, but almost no car price is dropping below certain threshold (>9000), which suggest that the relationship between mileage and price is probably not a linear one. \n\nThen, how do we capture the magnitude of relationship between mileage and price? We need to start by analyzing residual plots.\n\nMost often, residual plots are used to determine whether two variables are good fit to be used for regression.\nResidual plot visualizes the following: \n1. Difference between the predicted price and the actual price on y-axis (residuals)\n2. Mileage on x-axis.\n\nIf our estimator is a good fit, we would expect residuals to be distributed evenly across the y=0 line, above and below y=0 throughout the range of price. This suggest that we are capturing the relationship between mileage and price, without overshooting or undershooting .\n\nHowever, if distribution of residual is uneven across y=0 line, we would then look for different variable candidates by maniuplating their scale. In this case, we may square\/log\/... the mileage variable. \n\nFrom earlier exercises, we discovered that distribution of ln(price) closely matched the normal distribution.
