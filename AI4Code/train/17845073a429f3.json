Datasets regarding this particular condition isn't available much as of now, and majority of the literary references found point to study of only a certain restticted number of population groups, where the sample size is very less. This notebook wrangles all available datasets and visualizations that are built over the dataset under a single house, to study the effect of COVID-19 on cancer patients.\n\nThis notebook would be updated by me as I find newer analyses into this subject.

As per multiple reports the figures of deviation of the above data is prominent in lung cancer. i.e. Similar symptoms are observed in Lung Cancer as seen in Covid-19 cases.\n\n# Getting to know the details\n\n<H3> 1. The count of blood components <\/H3>\n\nPatients tested positive for COVID-19 show significantly lower levels of platelets, leukocytes and eosinophils. We can also observe lower levels of calcium and magnesium, but significantly higher concentrations of ferritin, in comparison to patients tested negative for COVID-19.\n\nThe decrease in white blood cells (leukocytes) can either be a direct result of the COVID-19 infection or other pre-existing conditions. This decrease lowers patient immunity against COVID-19 and other infections in general. Additionally, electrolytes and minerals such as potassium, magnesium and zinc play a critical role in maintaining vitality, repairing cell damage, as well as immunity.\n\n<H3> 2. The Associations <\/H3>\n\nBy extracting clinical data from the literature, we can examine the abnormalities in blood tests in patients diagnosed with cancer and patients testing positive for COVID-19. Blood test results for multiple minerals were extracted for patients with lung cancer and compared with levels seen in COVID-19 patients. [1,2]\n\nBecause the clinical data available for patients tested for COVID-19 is normalised, measurements retrieved for cancer patients were also normalised using blood concentration in control groups as the mean. The published data has reported the mean and standard deviation of the measurements instead of idividual readings, we use these metrics to simulate mineral concentrations in cancer patients assuming a normal distribution. The measurements retrieved from studies were for Magnesium, Ferritin and Zinc in both cancer patients as well as control groups.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/3WgqNGV\/2.png\" alt=\"2\" border=\"0\">","33db9540":"<h3> The next big steps <\/h3>\n\nWe analyzed and found out for roughly 17% of the deaths in COVID-19 Cancer plays a role. We found out certain medical parameters that can contribute to confirmed cases of COVID-19. Research needs to be implemented to find out if any of the factors mentioned above leads to Cancer or is a clinical figure if a person is suffering from cancer. I'll love to further investigate into this and use this notebook as a base to deploy other notebooks on COVID-19 Concern.\n\nThis notebook would be regular updated by me to check for much newer and diverse data to analyze more trends in spread of COVID-19 and understand it through the terms of spread in Cancer Patients. I would love to further test on more datasets across countries. Would update the notebooks with the new findings.\nContact LinkedIn - https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/amankumar01\/\n\nDo upvote and comment if you like or wish to suggest something."}}
