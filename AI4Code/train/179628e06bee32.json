A property that describes the shape of a distribution\n2. If the values extend farther to the right, it's \"right skewed\" and if the values extend left, it's \"left skewed\"\n\nIn our histograms, plotted above, both our histograms are left skewed. We can verify the same using a function that will compute the skewness of the data. ***In this case, the sign of the skewness must be negative because they are both left skewed.***","103bf104":"***Why use Moments?***\n\n1.

The skewness in the marks of female students is more than that of the male students.\n2. In both the cases the skewness is very small, indicating that both the distributions are nearly normal.\n\n***What if the distributions were not normal?***\n\n1. One explaination might be that the Maths exam was either too easy or too difficult.\n2. Other explanation: The checking was either very strick or very loose."}}
