Are the markets advertised on the web\/social media? i.e how do people find out about them\n #### 5. Are markets clustered in particular geographical subregions of the US?\n #### 6. Average prices for commodities? (How accessible is their pricing?)\n \n\n- Based on the available data, we can work with metrics 1, 3, 4 and 5.","df958847":"# Maps of the US with the per capita income and density of farmers markets indicated","5a8dfa86":"- Interestingly at the county level, a few obscure locations have the highest farmers markets per capita, like the red county near Billings Montana","5328863b":"# Conclusions\n\n- We established that per capita income was moderately linearly correlated (Pearsons r 0.43 p=0.0015) with per capita farmers markets at the state level but not at the county level\n- Population showed more correlation with market counts and markets per capita at a state level, than the various wealth metrics such as per capita income. This makes sense as farmers markets will do more business and therefore be more attactive for people to set up, in areas where there are more people and generally more wealth\n- At a county level, farmers market density is far more strongly correlated with population, than the wealth metrics. Again this make sense, as more markets will pop up where there are more people and therefore more demand for food in general\n- From the maps above we can see that farmers markets are widespread across the counties and states of the US and commonly located near population centres\n- An overlay of population and agricultural production on the some of the maps above, might indicate if farmers markets are more accessible (by the metric of farmers markets per capita) in \"rural\" areas of the US, where there tends to be more agriculture and fewer people\n- Farmers market per capita is probably not the best metric of accessibility in many ways, as it doesn't really take into account how close people are to the market. A vast, less populated state will have more farmers markets per capita but they may not be easily accessible if the average journey time to a market is prohibitive\n- It would be nice to do some multivariate clustering or correlation to see if there are any other more complex higher dimensional correlations, between the total or per capita farmers markets in each of the US states or counties and combinations of the available features in the data\n","9dfd431b":"- Looking at the county level, it seems population correlates strongly with the count of markets in a county (Market_Count), but much less with the wealth metrics\n- Markets per capita (market_per_capita) on the other hand, shows little correlation with population or wealth metrics","055aebcb":"- Per capita income at a county level is higher around cities, where there are more jobs, more big companies and higher salaries\n- There are a few missing counties in the income data here, I'll have to check if this is due to anything I have done or whether data for these counties are missing","af3e59a0":"## Other possibilities\n- Make a correlation matrix. Is there any ( linear or almost linear?) correlation between markets per capita and the other numerical variables (particularly the wealth and sociological metrics) in the dataset at all\n\n- A map of the US with a heatmap of per capita markets\/per capita income, may reveal some geographical correlations\n\n****** I'd like to try making some maps so I'm going to do the last option ******\n","49e0c578":"### From the above charts and stats...\n\n- There is moderate positive correlation between per capita income and per capita farmers markets at a state level (Pearsons r of 0.43 with a two-tailed p-value of 0.0015)\n- Perhaps if we look at the county level, per capita income will correlate differently with markets per capita?","ea0e9249":"### APROACH\n\n- The columns \"county\" and \"state\" can be used to join the two dataframes and doing a groupby on these and counting the \"MarketName\" column will give a markets per county\/state column\n- The \"per capita income\" column in counties should be sufficient to answer the more wealth == more farmers markets question\n- You could use the \"population\" and \"number of households\" columns, to get a farmers markets per capita\/household figure\n- To visualise the geographical relationship, I'm thinking of several maps of the US, with heatmaps to visualise income, population and farmers market density, per county or state\n- To test the hypothesis, \"are markets more common in wealthier areas?\" implied by the task, I can assess the correlation between wealth indicators and farmers market\/per capita data\n\n#### Additional points\n- The produce columns (\"Beans\" Y\/N etc) could be one hot encoded and used as categorical variables or summed to give a produce diversity metric for a given market, if we wanted to use them\n- The \"Season Date\" columns could be converted and summed to give an overall \"time frame available\" metric but this data appears to be incomplete\n- The social media links could be used to get a sense of how well advertised the markets are\n- The x and y columns are latitude and longitude values allowing granular plotting of geographical distributions if desired\n- The 'Credit\tWIC\tWICcash\tSFMNP\tSNAP' columns indicate available payment methods, the more payment methods the more accessible the market I suppose?\n- We also have \"median household income\"\t\"median family income\" columns, which should track with \"per capita income\" but would allow you to be more granular in a sociological sense (differentiating \"families\" and \"households\")","3e914cab":"# Things to improve\/reflect upon\n- The naming of dataframes and groupby objects needs to be clear to avoid confusion\n- Do you need to use sets to find common column values in multiple dataframes or can you do it within Pandas?\n- Pearson r measures linear correlations, Spearmans and Kendall correlation test might tell you something about non-linear relationships\n- The normalised overlayed barplot of \"per capita income\" vs \"markets per capita\" is redundant, if you have a pairplot with a linear model, confidence interval and pearsonsr. Though I suppose it gives you a sense of if the linear relationship between per capita income and per capita markets is strong enough to see by eye.\n- Working with maps inevitably requires external data, the veracity\/completeness of which you have to be careful with. I think the map figures would benefit from consolidation and the addition of data selection widgets as discussed\n- Using more functions to organise and reuse code blocks for plotting, groupby and variable formatting operations on data frames, would make things quicker to develop and easier to read back over. I will have try to remember to do this from the beginning of my next analysis\n\n"}}
