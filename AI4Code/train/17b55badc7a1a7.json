Background on this method can be found in this [Medium article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/building-a-sentence-embedding-index-with-fasttext-and-bm25-f07e7148d240) and an existing repository using this method [codequestion](https:\/\/github.com\/neuml\/codequestion).\n\nThe embeddings index takes each COVID-19 tagged, non-labeled (not a question\/fragment) section, tokenizes the text, and builds a sentence embedding. A sentence embedding is a BM25 weighted combination of the FastText vectors for each token in the sentence. The embeddings index takes the full corpus of these embeddings and builds a [Faiss](https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/faiss) index to enable similarity searching. \n\nImportant source files to highlight\n\n* Indexing Process -> [index.py](https:\/\/github.com\/neuml\/cord19q\/blob\/master\/src\/python\/cord19q\/index.py)\n* Tokenizer -> [tokenizer.py](https:\/\/github.com\/neuml\/cord19q\/blob\/master\/src\/python\/cord19q\/tokenizer.py)\n* Embeddings Model -> [embeddings.py](https:\/\/github.com\/neuml\/cord19q\/blob\/master\/src\/python\/cord19q\/embeddings.py)\n* BM25 Scoring -> [scoring.py](https:\/\/github.com\/neuml\/cord19q\/blob\/master\/src\/python\/cord19q\/scoring.py)\n\nFastText vectors trained on the full CORD-19 corpus are required. A [dataset with pre-trained vectors](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/davidmezzetti\/cord19-fasttext-vectors) is included and used in this notebook. Building the vectors takes a couple of hours when locally trained and would most likely take much longer within a notebook. \n\nVectors can optionally be (re)built by running the following command with the project and articles.sqlite database installed locally:\n\n```\npython -m cord19q.vectors\n```\n\nThe following code builds the embeddings index using fastText vectors trained on the full CORD-19 dataset. Alternatively, any [pymagnitude vector file](https:\/\/github.com\/plasticityai\/magnitude#pre-converted-magnitude-formats-of-popular-embeddings-models) can be used the build the sentence embeddings.","d2568873":"## Exploration Takeaways\nGiven the urgency to find any data to help, many of the tagged articles are recent.

A series of tasks were explored to identify relevant articles and help find answers to key scientific questions on a number of COVID-19 research topics. \n\n*An example result snippet using this method is shown below for one of the task questions.

This project uses [SQLite](https:\/\/www.sqlite.org\/index.html) to aggregate and store the merged content.\n\nThe ETL process transforms the csv\/json files into a SQLite database. The process iterates over each row in metadata.csv, extracts the column data and ensures it is not a pure duplicate (using the sha hash). This process will also load the full text if available. \n\n## Tagging\nArticles are tagged based on keyword matches. The only tag at this time is COVID-19 and articles are tagged with this if the article text contains any of the following regular expressions. \n\n>2019[\\-\\s]?n\\s?cov, 2019 novel coronavirus, coronavirus 2019, coronavirus disease (?:20)?19, covid(?:[\\- ]19)?, n\\s?cov 2019, sars-cov-2, wuhan (?:coronavirus|pneumonia)\n\nCredit to [@ajrwhite](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ajrwhite) and his [notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ajrwhite\/covid-19-thematic-tagging-with-regular-expressions) in helping to develop this list.\n\n## Study Design\nAdditional metadata is parsed out of the article to derive information on the study design.\n\n### Design Type\nThe full text is analyzed to determine a design type for the backing study in the article. This logic is pessimistic and will assign the largest number (lowest level of confidence). The process builds a feature vector of counts for keywords in each design type category. It also has minimum count required to be considered a member of a category. Titles are also analyzed for design type matches.\n\nCredit to [@savannareid](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/savannareid) for developing the keywords to use with this method. The keywords can be found in this [domain dictionary](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1t2e3CHGxHJBiFgHeW0dfwtvCG4x0CDCzcTFX7yz9Z2E\/edit#gid=389064679). More details on deriving a study design can be found in [this discussion](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/discussion\/139355). \n\n### Sample Size\nThe full text is also analyzed to determine the sample size for the backing study in the article. This logic uses Natural Lanuage Processing (NLP) to find tokens that look to represent a sample. For example, for a Systematic Review, the logic looks for the word studies and determines if it has a number associated with it. That full sentence is used as the sample to give context to the sample size.\n\n## Grammar Labels\nThe title, abstract and full-text fields are tokenized into sentences. Linguistic rules are used to label each sentence to help identify concise, data-driven statements. \n\nFor the linguistic rules process, it has two basic rules right now.\n\n1. *QUESTION*: Sentence ending in a '?' mark\n2. *FRAGMENT*: Less informative\/incomplete statements. Acceptable sentences have the following structure.\n  - At least one nominal subject noun\/proper noun AND\n  - At least one action\/verb AND\n  - At least 5 words\n\nImportant source files to highlight\n- ETL Process -> [execute.py](https:\/\/github.com\/neuml\/cord19q\/blob\/master\/src\/python\/cord19q\/etl\/execute.py)\n- Study Design rules -> [design.py](https:\/\/github.com\/neuml\/cord19q\/blob\/master\/src\/python\/cord19q\/etl\/design.py)\n- Sample Size Detection rules -> [sample.py](https:\/\/github.com\/neuml\/cord19q\/blob\/master\/src\/python\/cord19q\/etl\/sample.py)\n- Linguistic rules -> [grammar.py](https:\/\/github.com\/neuml\/cord19q\/blob\/master\/src\/python\/cord19q\/etl\/grammar.py)\n","76dcd139":"## Word Embeddings\nThe foundation of sentence embeddings are word embeddings.
