Ice, for example, allows us to observe past snow accumulation, air temperature, and air quality. Ice cores serve as recorders of past climate and atmospheric concentration. Much like rock strata, snow accumulates onto ice sheets providing a record of past environmental conditions which can be measured moving deeper through layers of the core. Shallow ice cores are typically 100-200 m. depth whereas deeper cores can range up to 3000 m. Though ice cores can be taken all over the world, ice cores in polar regions, namely Antarctica and Greenland, provide the best resolution due to relatively stable temperatures and high rates of snow accumulation which best preserve isotopic and atmospheric data. Today, we will work with data from ice cores taken from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and Greenland, namely Dome C, Dome Fuji, and GRIP cores as well as a composite deep time record in order to explore earth's past climate and glacial cycles. \n\nLet's explore a map of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and Greenland from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. \nGo to: http:\/\/nsidc.org\/data\/atlas\/news\/ice_core_additions.html Determine the location of the Dome Fuji and GRIP cores. \n\n_Stable Isotopes_\n\nStable isotopes are integrators and recorders of biogeochemical signals. Isotopes are atoms which contain the same number of protons and a different number of neutrons. Stable isotopes, unlike radiogenic isotopes do not decay, and their concentrations can be used to determine environmental conditions. Stable isotopes are reported as a ratio of heavy to light isotopes relative to a standard known as delta notation ($\\delta$). In ice cores, $\\delta  ^{18}O$ stable isotopes can be used as a proxy for temperature. For example, snow falls over Antarctica and is converted to ice, preserving $\\delta  ^{18}O$ values within different depths of an ice sheet. Generally, periods of evaporation result in vapor that is depleted in $\\delta  ^{18}O$ whereas condensation results in precipitation that is enriched in $\\delta  ^{18}O$. Therefore, periods of glaciation are associated with more negative $\\delta$ values and periods of warming are associated with greater $\\delta$ values. With this knowledge, we can interpret changes in temperature from the ice core record using $\\delta  ^{18}O$ as a proxy. \n\nEquation:  \n$T={{13.7 + \\delta  ^{18}O}\\over {0.67}} \\quad (1) $  \n\n_Past Greenhouse Gases_\n\nIce cores also contain gas bubbles which directly sample the atmosphere at a given period of time. This provides thorough records of $CO_2$, methane, and nitrous oxide concentrations at given points in earth's history. We will explore chronologies of $CO_2$ emissions in the ice core record and its relevance to temperature. \n\n_Global Climate Cycles_ \n\n_Milankovitch Cycles_  Over geologic time (millions of years), earth's temperature has oscillated between warm and cold periods. Typically our planet experiences rapid periods of warming (between 10,000 and 20,000 years) and relatively long, stable periods of cooling (between 90,000 and 100,000 years). These fluctuations in global climate are owed to Milankovitch cycles which are produced from changes in the earth's pattern of orbit, axial tilt, and wobble. _Eccentricity_ is an elliptical change in the earth\u2019s orbit around the sun which occurs every 100,000 years. When the earth\u2019s orbit is more elliptical, the earth spends less time close to the sun in the span of a single year, indicating global cooling. _Axial Tilt_ is another process associated with Milankovitch cycles which occurs on a 41,000-year timescale. There is a change in the tilt of the earth\u2019s axis, termed obliquity, of approximately 2.5\u00b0. Increased obliquity typically causes summers to be warmer and winters to be colder. _Wobble_ is the final climate process associated with Milankovitch Cycles and occurs every 26,000 years. This wobble is caused by tidal forces and impacts the northern and southern hemisphere differently. The hemisphere closes to the sun will enjoy warmer summers and cooler winters. Currently, our planet is in a warm period, following the Last Glacial Maximum approximately 12,000 years ago. \n\n_Dansgaard Oeschger Events_ (DO) are smaller climate fluctuations which occur within larger glacial cycles. This process relates to ocean circulation and affects the northern and southern hemispheres differently. For example, while the northern hemisphere experiences rapid warming over a few decades followed by a longer period of cooling, the southern hemisphere experiences much slower warming and changes in temperature fluctuation. These processes are mediated by global ocean circulation. Ice core records from Antarctica and Greenland reveal that there is a lag time between DO events in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere, likely attributed to oceanic and atmospheric circulation.","3f59032c":"Below we generate a plot of Greenland $\\delta^{18}O$ as a function of time. \n","81ff9513":"<a id='1949'><\/a>\n# Part 4.

","d97ffc79":"Rebuttal: \"This statement does not tell the whole story. The initial changes in temperature during this period are explained by changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun, which affects the amount of seasonal sunlight reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. In the case of warming, the lag between temperature and CO2 is explained as follows: as ocean temperatures rise, oceans release CO2 into the atmosphere. In turn, this release amplifies the warming trend, leading to yet more CO2 being released. In other words, increasing CO2 levels become both the cause and effect of further warming. This positive feedback is necessary to trigger the shifts between glacials and interglacials as the effect of orbital changes is too weak to cause such variation. Additional positive feedbacks which play an important role in this process include other greenhouse gases, and changes in ice sheet cover and vegetation patterns.\"  \n--https:\/\/skepticalscience.com\/co2-lags-temperature.htm","e798479a":"### Pause for Analysis\n1.
