That's because the \"predict\" method always expects a 2D array as the format of its inputs. And putting our values into a double pair of square brackets makes the input exactly a 2D array.\n\n**Important note 2:** Notice also that the \"France\" country was not input as a string in the last column but as \"1, 0, 0\" in the first three columns. That's because of course the predict method expects the one-hot-encoded values of the state, and as we see in the first row of the matrix of features X, \"France\" was encoded as \"1, 0, 0\". And be careful to include these values in the first three columns, because the dummy variables are always created in the first columns.","1b33e2f7":"### Making the Confusion Matrix","3873eb09":"### Importing the libraries","a87e67df":"## Part 1 - Data Preprocessing","897abb18":"### Adding the second hidden layer","db03651a":"### Adding the output layer","b4d7b368":"One Hot Encoding the \"Geography\" column","aa171c9e":"### Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set","bab4a5a3":"### Predicting the Test set results","b2330a77":"### Initializing the ANN","20ebc673":"## Part 3 - Training the ANN","29b0c812":"### Predicting the result of a single observation","de1aa5f6":"# Artificial Neural Network","c4b3b478":"### Encoding categorical data","9e94d6c6":"**Solution**","70480e93":"### Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer"}}
