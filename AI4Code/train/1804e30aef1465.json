Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play.  Recommendation Systems are a type of **information filtering systems** as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are realted to the search history of the user.  \n","e206da03":"![](https:\/\/i.kinja-img.com\/gawker-media\/image\/upload\/s--e3_2HgIC--\/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800\/1259003599478673704.jpg)","8059a8be":"# **Collaborative Filtering**\n\nOur content based engine suffers from some severe limitations. It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.\n\nAlso, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who she\/he is.\n\nTherefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers.\nIt is basically of two types:-\n\n*  **User based filtering**-  These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity.\nThis filtering technique can be illustrated with an example. In the following matrixes, each row represents a user, while the columns correspond to different movies except the last one which records the similarity between that user and the target user. Each cell represents the rating that the user gives to that movie. Assume user E is the target.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*9NBFo4AUQABKfoUOpE3F8Q.png)\n\nSince user A and F do not share any movie ratings in common with user E, their similarities with user E are not defined in Pearson Correlation. Therefore, we only need to consider user B, C, and D. Based on Pearson Correlation, we can compute the following similarity.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*jZIMJzKM1hKTFftHfcSxRw.png)\n\nFrom the above table we can see that user D is very different from user E as the Pearson Correlation between them is negative. He rated Me Before You higher than his rating average, while user E did the opposite. Now, we can start to fill in the blank for the movies that user E has not rated based on other users.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*9TC6BrfxYttJwiATFAIFBg.png)\n\nAlthough computing user-based CF is very simple, it suffers from several problems. One main issue is that users\u2019 preference can change over time. It indicates that precomputing the matrix based on their neighboring users may lead to bad performance. To tackle this problem, we can apply item-based CF.\n\n* **Item Based Collaborative Filtering** - Instead of measuring the similarity between users, the item-based CF recommends items based on their similarity with the items that the target user rated. Likewise, the similarity can be computed with Pearson Correlation or Cosine Similarity. The major difference is that, with item-based collaborative filtering, we fill in the blank vertically, as oppose to the horizontal manner that user-based CF does. The following table shows how to do so for the movie Me Before You.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*LqFnWb-cm92HoMYBL840Ew.png)\n\nIt successfully avoids the problem posed by dynamic user preference as item-based CF is more static. However, several problems remain for this method. First, the main issue is ***scalability***. The computation grows with both the customer and the product. The worst case complexity is O(mn) with m users and n items. In addition, ***sparsity*** is another concern. Take a look at the above table again. Although there is only one user that rated both Matrix and Titanic rated, the similarity between them is 1. In extreme cases, we can have millions of users and the similarity between two fairly different movies could be very high simply because they have similar rank for the only user who ranked them both.\n\n","4ae2aba6":"So, the mean rating for all the movies is approx 6 on a scale of 10.The next step is to determine an appropriate value for m, the minimum votes required to be listed in the chart. We will use 90th percentile as our cutoff. In other words, for a movie to feature in the charts, it must have more votes than at least 90% of the movies in the list.","5d9e5c0d":"The next step would be to convert the names and keyword instances into lowercase and strip all the spaces between them. This is done so that our vectorizer doesn't count the Johnny of \"Johnny Depp\" and \"Johnny Galecki\" as the same.","47889ef3":"For movie with ID 302, we get an estimated prediction of **2.618**. One startling feature of this recommender system is that it doesn't care what the movie is (or what it contains).

","5cd5fbdd":"## **Credits, Genres and Keywords Based Recommender**\nIt goes without saying that the quality of our recommender would be increased with the usage of better metadata. That is exactly what we are going to do in this section. We are going to build a recommender based on the following metadata: the 3 top actors, the director, related genres and the movie plot keywords.\n\nFrom the cast, crew and keywords features, we need to extract the three most important actors, the director and the keywords associated with that movie. Right now, our data is present in the form of \"stringified\" lists , we need to convert it into a safe and usable structure","4edb4219":"> *  **Collaborative Filtering**- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.","00e98240":"We see that over 20,000 different words were used to describe the 4800 movies in our dataset.\n\nWith this matrix in hand, we can now compute a similarity score. There are several candidates for this; such as the euclidean, the Pearson and the [cosine similarity scores](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cosine_similarity). There is no right answer to which score is the best. Different scores work well in different scenarios and it is often a good idea to experiment with different metrics.\n\nWe will be using the cosine similarity to calculate a numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies. We use the cosine similarity score since it is independent of magnitude and is relatively easy and fast to calculate. Mathematically, it is defined as

sparsity issue created by CF is to leverage a **latent factor model** to capture the similarity between users and items. Essentially, we want to turn the recommendation problem into an optimization problem. We can view it as how good we are in predicting the rating for items given a user. One common metric is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). **The lower the RMSE, the better the performance**.\n\nNow talking about latent factor you might be wondering what is it ?It is a broad idea which describes a property or concept that a user or an item have. For instance, for music, latent factor can refer to the genre that the music belongs to. SVD decreases the dimension of the utility matrix by extracting its latent factors. Essentially, we map each user and each item into a latent space with dimension r. Therefore, it helps us better understand the relationship between users and items as they become directly comparable. The below figure illustrates this idea.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*GUw90kG2ltTd2k_iv3Vo0Q.png)","3fd850ab":"Finally, let's sort the DataFrame based on the score feature and output the title, vote count, vote average and weighted rating or score of the top 10 movies.","d8c3b8ae":"> *  **Content Based Filtering**- They suggest similar items based on a particular item.
