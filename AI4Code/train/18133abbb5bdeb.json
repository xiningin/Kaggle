Python will implicitly treat them as their corresponding boolean value:","46a9251b":"# Booleans\n\nPython has a type of variable called `bool`. It has two possible values: `True` and `False`.","bbac3881":"(Click the \"output\" button to see the answer)\n\nTo answer this, you'd need to figure out the order of operations. \n\nFor example, `and` is evaluated before `or`. That's why the first expression above is `True`. If we evaluated it from left to right, we would have calculated `True or True` first (which is `True`), and then taken the `and` of that result with `False`, giving a final value of `False`.\n\nYou could try to [memorize the order of precedence](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/reference\/expressions.html#operator-precedence), but a safer bet is to just use liberal parentheses. Not only does this help prevent bugs, it makes your intentions clearer to anyone who reads your code. \n\nFor example, consider the following expression:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or rain_level < 5 and have_hood or not rain_level > 0 and is_workday\n```\n\nI'm trying to say that I'm safe from today's weather....\n- if I have an umbrella...\n- or if the rain isn't too heavy and I have a hood...\n- otherwise, I'm still fine unless it's raining *and* it's a workday\n\nBut not only is my Python code hard to read, it has a bug. We can address both problems by adding some parentheses:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or (rain_level < 5 and have_hood) or not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday)\n```\n\nYou can add even more parentheses if you think it helps readability:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))\n```\n\nWe can also split it over multiple lines to emphasize the 3-part structure described above:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = (\n    have_umbrella \n    or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) \n    or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))\n)\n```","951e2694":"# Conditionals\n\nBooleans are most useful when combined with *conditional statements*, using the keywords ``if``, ``elif``, and ``else``.\n\nConditional statements, often referred to as *if-then* statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition.\nHere's an example:","9e478602":"## Comparison Operations\n\n| Operation     | Description                       || Operation     | Description                          |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------||---------------|--------------------------------------|\n| ``a == b``    | ``a`` equal to ``b``              || ``a != b``    | ``a`` not equal to ``b``             |\n| ``a < b``     | ``a`` less than ``b``             || ``a > b``     | ``a`` greater than ``b``             |\n| ``a <= b``    | ``a`` less than or equal to ``b`` || ``a >= b``    | ``a`` greater than or equal to ``b`` |\n\n","7de54ee4":"## Boolean conversion\n\nWe've seen `int()`, which turns things into ints, and `float()`, which turns things into floats, so you might not be surprised to hear that Python has a `bool()` function which turns things into bools.","06a9395f":"Comparisons frequently work like you'd hope","cf5f43bd":"# Your Turn\n\nYou probably don't realize how much you have learned so far.
