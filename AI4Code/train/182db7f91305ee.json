It means that both ways of determination of resistance are correct. Whereas, it is hard to say which one is better, because sometimes mean squared error is lower for mean method and sometimes for regression method.","be5b0f48":"## Resistance calculation\nAfter collecting the measurment results it is possible to find the resistance value and compare them to real resistance value and the calculated one.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law the resistance is \n\n$R = U\/I$\n\nWhere:\n* $R$ - resistance [Ohm]\n* $U$ - voltage [V]\n* $I$ - current [A]\n\n### First way of finding resistance\nFirst way of finding resistance is to calculate the mean of all measurements:\n\n$R = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{U_i}{I_i}}{n}$\n\n"}}
