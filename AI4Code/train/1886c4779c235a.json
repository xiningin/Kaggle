Think of it as a greatly condensed, opinionated, version of [the official indexing documentation.](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/indexing.html#).\n\nWe'll start by loading Pandas and the data:","8f7df856":"We get a series of the results of the boolean. Passing that series into a dataframe gives us the subset of the dataframe where the boolean evaluates to `True`.","7f33e749":"We can only access the 'Park Code' column by passing its name as a string in brackets, like `df['Park Code']`. I recommend either always using that approach or always converting your column names into a valid format as soon as you read in the data so that you don't have to mix the two methods. It's just a bit tidier.\n\nIt's a good practice to clean your column names to prevent this sort of error. I'll use a very short cleaning function here since the names don't have any odd characters. By convention, the names should also be converted to lower case. Pandas is case sensitive, so future calls to all of the columns will need to be updated.","f1c3ef0f":"### Indexing: Multiple Rows\nIf we need multiple rows, we can pass in multiple index values.

Note that first row is zero, just like list indexes.","ff7eaf28":"You can also use more complicated expressions, including lambdas.","e47a2407":"### Less Common Methods\nPandas offers many more indexing methods. You should probably stick to a few of them for the sake of keeping your code readable, but it's worth knowing they exist in case you need to read other people's code or have an unusual use case:\n\n- There are other ways to slice data with brackets. For the sake of readability, please don't use of them.\n- `.at` and `.iat`: like `.loc` and `.iloc` but much faster in exchange for only working on a single column and only returning a single result.\n- `.eval`: fast evaluation of a limited set of simple operators. `.query` works by calling this.\n- `.ix`: deprecated method that tried to determine if an index should be evaluated with .loc or .iloc. This led to a lot of subtle bugs! If you see this, you're looking at old code that won't work any more.\n- `.get`: like `.loc`, but will return a default value if the key doesn't exist in the index. Only works on a single column\/series.\n- `.lookup`: Not recommended. It's in the documentation, but it's unclear if this is actually still supported.\n- `.mask`: like boolean indexing, but returns a dataframe\/series of the same size as the original and anywhere that the boolean evaluates to `True` is set to `nan`.\n- `.query`: similar to boolean indexing. Faster for large dataframes. Only supports a restricted set of operations; don't use if you need `isnull()` or other dataframe methods.\n- `.take`: equivalent to `.iloc`, but can operate on either rows or columns.\n- `.where`: like boolean indexing, but returns a dataframe\/series of the same size as the original and anywhere that the boolean evaluates to `False` is set to `nan`.\n- [Multi-indexing](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/advanced.html): potentially useful for small to mid sized heirarchical datasets. Slow on larger datasets.","e5054d29":"Some of the logical operators are different:\n- `~` replaces `not`\n- `|` replaces `or`\n- `&` replaces `and`\n\nIf you have multiple arguments they'll need to be wrapped in parentheses.
