For example the standard Fibonacci sequence is:\n\n\\\\[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... \\\\]\n\nwhere the first number is \\\\( F_0 = 0 \\\\) and the second number is \\\\( F_1 = 1 \\\\)\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence for \\\\( F_0 = 3 \\\\) and \\\\( F_1 = 9 \\\\) is:\n\n\\\\[ 3, 9, 12, 21, 33, 54, 87, ... \\\\]","28d00328":"## Setup Instructions\n\n1. Fork this kernel\n2. Confirm that the `pada1ds` dataset is copied in your new forked kernel as well.\n    * In the right sidebar, navigate to the Workspace section and confirm the folder `pada1ds` exists.\n3. Use the code in the next cell to import data from `fib1.csv` and confirm that the data has been saved in the variable `seq`\n4. Confirm whether the sequence is indeed a Fibonacci sequence. Print out a message that says whether the sequence is a proper Fibonacci sequence.\n5. Check the other sequences in the other files `fib2.csv` and `fib3.csv`.\n"}}
