When an analytic model fits a dataset, a large amount of data can be summarized using a small set of parameters. \n\nAt the same time, it is important to be aware of the fact that no model is perfect. \n\"Models are useful if they capture the relevant aspects of the real world and\nleave out unneeded details.

A lot of things can be done on this kind of dataset, but as someone rightly pointed out; \"many a little makes a mickle\", understanding concepts in little portions and applying them in real world is the best way to learn. That sais, I wish to come up with more notebooks in tandem with my work on these datasets.\n\nPlease give your valuable feedback :)","83821eea":"Let's say we have a sample of 10 values and we want to find the percentile rank of a number 'x' that may appear in the sample, then we say that the percentile is the percentage of values in the sample that are less than or equal to that of 'x'. \n\nA cumulative distribution function is a normalized percentile rank. That is, we define the CDF on a scale of 0-1, whereas the percentile rank is measured on a 0-100 scale.\n\nWe can use the following function to define calculate the cdf of a sample.

In that case, I leave it for my generous audience to find out the rather ambiguous applications of each of the normal and lognormal distributions. This will end up in a lot of brainstorming but that will be fun. I liked investing time in this exercise.  ","27c9218e":"To employ the dictionary meaning of distribution, it is; \"the way in which something is shared out among a group or spread over an area\". Histograms, mean, variance, effect size are a few examples of distribution. One thing that is common in these kind of distributions is that they are based on empirical observations. These along with Probability mass functions and Cumulative distribution functions are known as empirical distributions.\n\nIn contast to empirical distributions, the analytic distributions are the ones that are charcterized by a CDF or a PDF. The analytic distribution can be used to model the empirical distributions. Some examples of analytic distribution are normal distribution, exponential distribution, lognormal distribution, etc. In this notebook, I'm going to model certain variables from the dataset and check if that model fits in any of the analytic distribution. That said, I may wave hands at many of the concepts and use the concept quite implicitly, for that is the purpose of the notebook.","74ff0eb4":"# 2. Importing the libraries"}}
