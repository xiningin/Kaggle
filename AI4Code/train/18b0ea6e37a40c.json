Unsupervised learning means that there is no outcome to be predicted, and the algorithm just tries to find patterns in the data. \n- In k means clustering, we have the specify the number of clusters we want the data to be grouped into. \n- The algorithm randomly assigns each observation to a cluster, and finds the centroid of each cluster. Then, the algorithm iterates through two steps:\n    1. Reassign data points to the cluster whose centroid is closest. \n    2. Calculate new centroid of each cluster. \n\n\n- These two steps are repeated till the within cluster variation cannot be reduced any further. \n- The within cluster variation is calculated as the sum of the euclidean distance between the data points and their respective cluster centroids.","d1db4780":"##### Observation:\n- From the distplot and the descriptive analysis run on the dataset, it is visible that the age column contains values that are almost normally distributed.
