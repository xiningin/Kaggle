Introduction\n\nIt's \"economy time that nobody asked for, but I'm still giving it to you.\"\n\nSome quick back stories before we begin:\n\n1. **US Treasury Yield Curve** is a line that plots on the X axis the \"Years of Maturity\", meaning the amount of time it takes for a debt to be paid and on the Y axis the value of the \"Yield\" (or the interest rate).\n\n2. **Years of Maturity**: the debt can be made, as any debt, on different periods of time: could be made for 1 month, or it could be made for 30 years.\n\nHow does the picture usually look like? Naturally, the interest *rates are small for short periods of time and long for longer periods of time*, right? (I'll insert a photo for your refference below, look at the blue line).\n\n![image.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5e5tjUZ.png)\n\nBut, sometimes, this \"naturality\" inverts itself (red line), meaning that the interests are bigger for short period debts and smaller for longer periods.\n\n### This phenomena is widely thought by the economists being a **prediction for a recession**. But how good of a prediction?","b8b6f396":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<p><p>\n<p>If you liked this, don't be shy, upvote! \ud83d\ude01<p>\n<b>Cheers!<b>\n<p><p>\n<\/div>","a0b7cec6":"The graph above shows the yield curves on 23 of August 2018 and respectively 2019. They are for sure inverted, meaning that interest rates for long term debt are lower, therefore the **investors start to expect a recession**.\n\n# 3. Yield Curves in Time\n\nNow, let's look at the Yield Curve throughout time to understand what's happening. For an easier read, we selected the **values of the yeald curve for 1 and 30 year Maturity, starting 1977 to 2019**. With a **total mean by year**, we can expect to see some moments in time where the 2 yield curves are touching lightly, meaning that year the 2 curves inverted.\n\nEnough gibberish, let's see something concrete.","f481b9e9":"# 2.

Compute Correlation Matrix\n\nNot quite sure if there is a pattern to be discovered, although there can be seen some tendencies.\n\nTo be sure, let's check the *Pearson Correlation Coefficient* (you can see bellow the correlations and their level of confidence, which was very good for all of them).\n\n-Gold was positively correlated (0.33). So **inverstors put their money in gold when times are uncertain**;\n\n-Crude oil is positively correlated (0.44). **Same with oil**, investors store their money here when economy isn't at it's greatest;\n\n-Swiss Franc is negatively correlated (-0.34). Investors run from the Swiss;\n\n-Japanese Yen is negatively correlated (-0.42). They also run from the Japanese.","fa6d7eed":"# 7. What next?\n\nIn conclusion, are we going to have a recession?\n\nEconomists, politicians, analysts already debate this publicly. Even Ray Dalio said that in about 2-3 years we are going to experience another economic crisis.\n\nAnd as can be seen, the yield curve never fails to predict this event, quite accurately I would add.\n\nAll that remains is for us to be prepared when that happens. If you would like a more in depth analysis economy wise, head out to the official article: https:\/\/www.lightstoneinsights.com\/post\/behind-the-scenes-of-the-us-yield-curve\n\n\n### Update:\nThis report was done ~ October 2019. Now it's 17th April 2020. I know Ray Dalio foresaw something... but I don't know if he ACTUALLY foresaw this. \ud83d\ude05\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tghJR3G.jpg)","95bb7489":"## Outcomes:\n\nSo....\n\n1. 1978 - 1981. Wow. The 2 yield curves were on average inverted for 4 years. This is marking the **US Recession that started in 1980**.\n2. Another touch in 1989. This is also marking the **US early 1990 Recession**, which was relatively mild, but still existed. (quite accurate!)\n3. The year 2000. This is starting to look like a very good predictor. The **recessions in 2000** affected mostly the developed countries, and in US was coused by the Market Bubble.\n4. Well this is actually ridiculous! Another touch in **2006**. I don't even need to address that period. US economy and employment had a slowdown, while the debts were rising. It was the climax for the **recession in 2008**.\n\nAnd now we're approaching to the present. And as you can see from the second graph, that line is slowly but surely approaching the 0 line, where the difference between the 30 Yr Maturity and the 1 Yr Maturity is becoming negative. \n\nSeems that we have a big nasty surprise coming towards us.\n\n# 5. Impact on Goods\n\nAnother interesting thing to see was the impact of these inversions on price of goods.\n\nGold, Oil or the Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen currencies need to react in some way to the inversion of the yield curve, right?","39312e57":"# 4.
