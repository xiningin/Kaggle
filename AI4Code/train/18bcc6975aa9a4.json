The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading significant digit is likely to be small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time. Let's see whether this is followed in the dataset","38964b95":"As you can see, the population data follows the Law pretty closely and the zipcode data follows the law loosely, but there is no denying that there is a pattern in the data which is weird but interesting! Feel free to see other data and check whether it follows the pattern or no!\n\n","f813db27":"For the sake of ease, Let's just take the population and zipcode and see if Benford's law is applicable. The zipcode will be an example of uniformly distributed numbers."}}
