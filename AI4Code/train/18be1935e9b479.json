We want to do this early in our project and match these quick correlations with modelled correlations later in the project.\n\n**Completing.**\n\n1. We may want to complete Age feature as it is definitely correlated to survival.\n2. We may want to complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.\n\n**Correcting.**\n\n1.

Cabin feature may be dropped as it is highly incomplete or contains many null values both in training and test dataset.\n3. PassengerId may be dropped from training dataset as it does not contribute to survival.\n4. Name feature is relatively non-standard, may not contribute directly to survival, so maybe dropped.\n\n**Creating.**\n\n1. We may want to create a new feature called Family based on Parch and SibSp to get total count of family members on board.\n2. We may want to engineer the Name feature to extract Title as a new feature.\n3. We may want to create new feature for Age bands.

A sample is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the sample being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n\nKNN confidence score is better than Logistics Regression but worse than SVM.","6eb45f14":"**Analyze by visualizing data**\n\nNow we can continue confirming some of our assumptions using visualizations for analyzing the data.\n\n**Correlating numerical features**\n\nLet us start by understanding correlations between numerical features and our solution goal (Survived).\n\nA histogram chart is useful for analyzing continous numerical variables like Age where banding or ranges will help identify useful patterns. The histogram can indicate distribution of samples using automatically defined bins or equally ranged bands. This helps us answer questions relating to specific bands (Did infants have better survival rate?)\n\nNote that x-axis in historgram visualizations represents the count of samples or passengers.\n\n**Observations.**\n\n* Infants (Age <=4) had high survival rate.\n* Oldest passengers (Age = 80) survived.\n* Large number of 15-25 year olds did not survive.\n* Most passengers are in 15-35 age range.\n\n**Decisions.**\n\nThis simple analysis confirms our assumptions as decisions for subsequent workflow stages.\n\n* We should consider Age (our assumption classifying #2) in our model training.\n* Complete the Age feature for null values (completing #1).\n* We should band age groups (creating #3).","9c9f7b50":"**Completing a numerical continuous feature**\n\nNow we should start estimating and completing features with missing or null values. We will first do this for the Age feature.\n\nWe can consider three methods to complete a numerical continuous feature.\n\n1. A simple way is to generate random numbers between mean and standard deviation.\n\n2. More accurate way of guessing missing values is to use other correlated features. In our case we note correlation among Age, Gender, and Pclass. Guess Age values using median values for Age across sets of Pclass and Gender feature combinations. So, median Age for Pclass=1 and Gender=0, Pclass=1 and Gender=1, and so on...\n\n3. Combine methods 1 and 2. So instead of guessing age values based on median, use random numbers between mean and standard deviation, based on sets of Pclass and Gender combinations.\n\nMethod 1 and 3 will introduce random noise into our models. The results from multiple executions might vary. We will prefer method 2.","320a6f90":"Next we model using Support Vector Machines which are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training samples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new test samples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.\n\nNote that the model generates a confidence score which is higher than Logistics Regression model.","a3bfdd90":"The next model Random Forests is one of the most popular. Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees (n_estimators=100) at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. \n\nThe model confidence score is the highest among models evaluated so far.
