The marginal utility of additional resource availability was steadily diminishing as the resource availability approached the resource requirement for a worst case scenario, in which all regions would be affected. While the budget-based model includes the quantity-based solution as a special case, the former takes advantage of its inherent ability to balance the different relative cost and effectiveness of individual resources. The difference in model performance was particularly noticeable at lower levels of resource availability, which is in accordance with a higher marginal utility of additional availability at that levels. Hence, the budget-based model can be most useful in scenarios with very limited supply of resources.|Low - Lack of reliable data prevented from considering geo-spatial aspects of mixing group formation in the testbed implementation. The impact of public education and use of personal protective measures on transmission was not consdiered.|Low - limited accurate data to support conclusions|Each infected person was assigned a daily travel probability of 0.24%,69 of which 7% was by air and 93% by land. The average value of R0 was 2.54, which represented a high transmissibility scenario. The values of regional IAR averaged 0.538. The curves for all impact measures (average total number of infected, deaths, and total cost) exhibit a downward trend, for both allocation models, as the total resource availability increases. Increased total resource availability not only mediates a regional pandemic impact but also reduces the probability of spread to unaffected regions.|\n|Policies to mitigate the effects on supplies associated with mass testing, including swabs and reagents.|What are current government (FDA) policies or mitigation strategies for covid-19 for fair allocation of medical resources (ration of medical equipment, personal protective equipment, treatment, community services) and testing compared to policies for other respiratory infections like flu, SARS, or MERS?|A predictive decision-aid methodology for dynamic mitigation of influenza pandemics|For both low and high transmissibility scenarios under study, the marginal impact of additional resources on the policy performance reduced steadily. It was observed that while the total budget requirement was arrived at assuming that all regions would be affected, the dynamic predictive allocation strategy decreased the probability of spread from the ongoing regions, thus resulting in reduced need for resources. Compared to the high transmissibility scenario, marginal impact of the vaccine efficacy for the low transmissibility scenario was less significant due to a relatively smaller infected population. The overall pandemic cost was significantly affected by the social distancing conformance, particularly for higher transmissibility scenario. A higher degree of socialdistancing conformance led to a reduction in the contact intensity within the affected region.|High - can be replicated against current policies in place|High - can accommodate varying virus and population dynamics|Factors under consideration included: (a) antiviral efficacy, (b) vaccine efficacy, (c) social distancing conformance, (d) social distancing declaration threshold, and (e) social distancing period. As the value of \u03c4 approaches the value of the maximum base mortality probability (16% for the elderly risk group), the resultant effective mortality probability tends to zero, which explains the converging behavior of the curve representing the total number of mortalities. For higher transmissibility, the curves reach saturation starting from CFR of approximately 0.55%. This can be explained by noting that in this case, the time difference in quarantine declaration using CFR values between 0.55 and 1.0 is insignificant.|\n|Policies to mitigate the effects on supplies associated with mass testing, including swabs and reagents.|What are current government (FDA) policies or mitigation strategies for covid-19 for fair allocation of medical resources (ration of medical equipment, personal protective equipment, treatment, community services) and testing compared to policies for other respiratory infections like flu, SARS, or MERS?|Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic|Mass testing can significantly reduce the percentage of people getting infected and the death toll. Testing every individual without symptoms roughly every 10 days would reduce the reproduction number of Covid-19 to one and thereby stabilize the pandemic, which is very promising. After a while, fewer and fewer infected people (who spread the virus) will be detected.|High - can be replicated and utilized for future models but does not take soical interventions or social determinants of health into consideration|Low - limited population; future research suggests to expand to a larger popuation and the workforce|With hospital treatment, mortality of detected infected people is estimated to be M \u2248 0.05 and the incubation time is assumed to be 5.84 \u00b1 2.98 days. One can see that the death rate kk is constant until the health caresystem is at maximum capacity at \u00afni\/d = 0.0008. Beyond that, it increases and asymptotically approaches a value which is more than two times larger. The model predicts an equilibrium when approximately 53% of the population is immune, which would occur after roughly 150 days. Further it predicts that approximately 2.8% of the initial susceptible population would eventually be killed by the virus.

The mumps and measles outbreaks demonstrate the importance of close collaboration between public health officials and mass gathering organizers to assess health risks to participants. More than half (n = 44, 61%) of the 72 identified outbreaks occurred at state or county agricultural fairs.

By contrast, most illnesses among travelers attending the Olympics were linked to travel, but not to attending the Olympics, and these illnesses\u2019 were mild, which may be due to the physical separation of various sporting events at the Olympics, the propensity to hold the Olympics in high income countries, the relatively short travel duration of attendees and participants, and the relatively young age of participants.

Pandemic preparedness \u2018experts\u2019 working with IOM provided their feedback on the revised version and it was adjusted accordingly. Participants were given a scenario in which they had been in contact with someone sick with influenza. In response, just over half (55%) would agree to take preventative medicine and avoid travelling to places with no signs of outbreak. Avoiding gatherings of five or more people received the most positive responses (54%), followed by avoiding places of entertainment (44%), avoiding department stores, supermarkets and minimarts (39%), avoiding restaurants (38%), limiting contact with family and friends (36%), avoiding public transportation (36%), keeping children from school (34%), avoiding the workplace (31%), avoiding the hospital (31%), and avoiding the public health centre (28%).

One quarter of respondents had used face masks in the past when sick. Slightly less (24%) said they would agree to use a face mask if sick in the future and over half (53%) said they would not wear a face mask.

The most common reasons for not receiving vaccination was that their health was sufficient to forgo the vaccination, and lack of time. There was no significant difference in how either group perceived the threat or adopted preventive behavior. The predictive factors for pandemic influenza vaccination were being elderly (age \u226565 years), prior seasonal influenza vaccination, and chronic medical disease.|High - the study provides efforts to enhance knowldge of preventative behaviors. Though, this was an observational study, which is inherently limited for explaining correlations |High - study does suggest that disseminating accurate information about influenza and the necessity of vaccination by the government or public health organizations appears to be a valuable component for those at high risk. |The survey established that the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccination coverage was 15.5% among adults aged \u226519 years and 58.4% among elderly people aged \u226565 years; in the high-risk group, vaccination coverage was 47.3% among people with chronic medical conditions and those aged \u226565 years. Pandemic influenza vaccination coverage was significantly higher in those at high risk, i.e., people aged \u226560 years and people who had received prior seasonal influenza vaccination. Conversely, there were negative correlations between vaccination coverage and education or income level. The rate of vaccination coverage of the non\u2013high-risk group was 8.0%, whereas that of the high-risk group was 47.3%. The rate of vaccination coverage of the high-risk group was statistically higher even when adjusted according to age, sex, education level, and monthly income (p<0.001).Two-thirds of the vaccinations in the high-risk group were triggered by public health outreach (65.5%), followed by previous experience from seasonal influenza (12.1%), recommendation from healthcare specialists (9.5%), and mass media campaigns (6.1%). In the non\u2013high-risk group, apart from notices from public health organizations, mass media campaigns (22.4%) and previous experience from seasonal influenza (20.6%) were important triggering events. Both the high-risk and non\u2013high-risk groups believed that the pandemic influenza was only slightly more severe than seasonal influenza (32.6% vs. 40.6%, respectively) or similarly severe (31.6% vs. 32.8%, respectively). In addition, about one-fifth of each group believed that the pandemic influenza was significantly more severe than seasonal influenza (high risk vs. non\u2013high risk, 20.8% vs. 19.1%, respectively). However, there was no significant difference between the groups regarding the perceived threat of pandemic influenza (p\u200a=\u200a0.392). The most significant factor influencing vaccination against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was age \u226565 years (OR 5.84). Other factors such as prior seasonal influenza vaccination (OR 3.68) and chronic medical disease (OR 2.08) were also statistically significant.|\n|Policies and protocols for screening and testing|Are vulnerable, high-risk groups who have more socioeconomic barriers compared with those without at risk for screening or testing?|The emerging use of social media for health-related purposes in low and middle-income countries: A scoping review.|A systematic scoping review was selected as the best method for evaluating literature from six seperate databases from from nursing, medicine, allied health, global health, and social, behavioural, computer and engineering sciences.

After developing a research question, the search engine automates each step to allow researchers to quickly begin analyzing articles and begin their own rapid hypothesis testing.\n\n### **Articulating complex information needs using query templates**\n\nWhen researchers use search engines, many questions can go unanswered due to lack of skills in formulating questions, crafting effective search strategies, and identifying the best levels of evidence. Formulating a well-focused question is the first and arguably most important step.  This search engine was designed to help researchers develop well-focused questions from the broad tasks given in the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/tasks) through evidence-based practice. \n\n**Framing tasks into research engine questions**: The PICOT framework is known to help researchers retrieve more precise, relevant results by formatting a question into 5 components:![](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9cEw6YG.png)\n\nIt allows better specificity and conceptual clarity to the tasks given in the challenge because it dissects the questions into smaller components, which are then easier to search. As we aim to solve complex problems, our search engine provides guidance by *nudging* its' users to ask the right questions. \n\n**Table 2.** Query template to help think through refining broad questions into clear, concise ones\n![](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UDaEPaj.png\")","53bff0f7":"![Screen%20Shot%202020-04-16%20at%201.59.11%20AM.png](attachment:Screen%20Shot%202020-04-16%20at%201.59.11%20AM.png)","475a23db":"### Information Retrieval: The Great Search for Knowledge\n\nThe aim of information retrieval (IR) is to make machine-stored data discoverable by filtering specific information from a set of data. While there are various information retrieval models, this engine uses a vector space model where documents and search queries are represented as vectors or matrices. The documents and search queries receive values related to the search term and can be represented as points within the vector space. As vectors are compared to each other, the vector with the content closest to that of the search query will appear first in the result rankings. The advantage of this approach is speed and simplicity: once a document index is built, terms can be searched quickly, and there is no need to train a model or annotate complex datasets. However, the disadvantage is that without boolean operators, no terms can be excluded.\n\n**The gains:** BM25 is a ranking function for information gain used by search engines to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a given search query. It is one of the strongest \u201csimple\u201d scoring functions where BM25 scores combine the query term frequency and the document term frequency, normalized by the ratio of the document\u2019s length, to the average length.\n\n### Evidence-based AI: Automated screening for literature using evidence-based practice query\n\nOnce a research question as been formulated, the search engine provides the most relevant articles with automated screening of PICOT characteristics. The engine will query each PICOT term individually at sentence level to ensure that when searching for multi-words they all appear in the same sentence, then compute the intersection at paper level (all the papers that had at least one sentence found in each PICOT query).\n![](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BdV4Bsb.png)\n\n**Screening Evaluation:** We experimented with different **(P)(I)(C)(O)(T)** combinations, which applied different thresholds for the number of study characteristics needed to be included. In our research, we found that:\n\n- All **(P)(I)(C)(O)(T**) terms performed the worst with very few matches\n- Screening with any 3 **(P)(I)(C)(O)** terms improved recall\n- Screening for 2 terms provided the best precision for relevant search results\n  * **(P)(I)** performed best with the most relevant articles\n  * **(I)(O)** was more precise than using any 2 **(P)(I)(C)(O)**\n- Using **(T)** limited the results as it had the least number of sentence matches\n\n<font size=\"2\" color=\"black\"> This inital evaluation can be used as guiding principles to using the engine since our tool allows researchers to choose their own inclusion\/exclusion criteria for the terms in the final result.
