One of the most famous tragedies in modern history, it inspired numerous stories, several films, and a musical and has been the subject of much scholarship and scientific speculation. If today, it serves to Machine Learning.\n    \nWhy do we use machine learning?\n    \nMachine Learning provides smart alternatives to analyzing vast volumes of data. By developing fast and efficient algorithms and data-driven models for real-time processing of data, Machine Learning can produce accurate results and analysis.\n    \nNow, I will  visualize with Titanic dataset. Data visualization is an important skill in applied statistics and machine learning. Statistics does indeed focus on quantitative descriptions and estimations of data. Data visualization provides an important suite of tools for gaining a qualitative understanding. Visual information help us comprehent result or causal events or happenings. My goal for this visualization is to see if there is any meaning among the available data when on the way to machine learning.\n\n\n\n<font color = \"blue\">\nContents: \n\n 1.
