The parameters of these new neurons are initialized with Xavier initialization.","4172c980":"# Fine-Tuning with PyTorch\n\nThroughout this notebook, we use the <a href='https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/cifar-10\/overview'>CIFAR-10<\/a> dataset from Kaggle, a popular computer-vision dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images to be classified in one of ten classes, with 6000 images per class.

We compute a mean and stdev value batch-by-batch to avoid loading the entire dataset in memory, and then compute the mean of the means and of the stdevs.  \n**NOTE**: if you have enough RAM (or memory on the GPU), you can use a batch_size equal to the entire train_dataset length, it will provide a more accurate estimation of the means and stdevs by channel.","7c168831":"The train and train+validation DataLoaders use a smaller `batch_size` as we will also need to keep track of gradients in memory. Furthermore, we shuffle the dataset each epoch to avoid loading the batches in the same order.\nThe valid and test DataLoaders use a larger `batch_size` and do not required to shuffle the dataset as we want deterministic results.\n\nThe number of workers is generally set to `2 * num_gpus` as a rule of thumb for Kaggle, with `pin_memory = True` to speed up data transfer to the GPU."}}
