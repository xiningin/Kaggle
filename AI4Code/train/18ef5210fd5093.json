The final output from the model is a vector of probabilities that the image is of each class.  Such as :\n[0.01, 0.05, 0.04, 0.06, 0.50, 0.20, 0.04, 0.00, 0.03, 0.07].

By improved performance we mean having the model not overfit the training data and perform poorly on the testing data.\n\nThere are serveral common techniques to fix this problem.  These include:\n\n1.   Reducing Model Complexity - removing neurons or layers\n2.   Dropout - Randomly removing the contributions from some neurons\n3.   Early Stopping - Terminating training as early as possible\n\nWe will try these below.\n\n","d82e90d4":"### Implementing Early Stopping\n\nEarly stopping involves having the training stop when the model has been trained enough.  \n\nOften training is slow in terms of time, and expensive in terms of compute time on big clusters or a cloud service.  So it is useful to be able to stop training as soon as reasonable.  And reasonable is usually when the metric like lose quits decreasing.  So the question is, how can we know when the loss quits decreasing?  \n\nWe could run a bunch of trials and use a tool like TensorBoard to plot curves.  But it is tedious to write a model with 20 epochs, run it, see loss was decreasing, then repeat that with 40 epochs, etc.  Worse, if we change the model or it's parameters, like adjusting the dropout percentage, the number of epochs required to see when the loss stops decreasing might be different.\n\nSo what we need is an automated way to detect when training has quit improving and terminate training.  And fortunately Keras has an early stopping feature that does just this!","1818ed54":"Fashion-MNIST is one of the datasets provided with Keras in Tensorflow.

After it loads we can start making inference requests using REST.  There are some important parameters:\n\n* `rest_api_port`: The port that you'll use for REST requests.\n* `model_name`: You'll use this in the URL of the REST requests.  It can be anything.\n* `model_base_path`: This is the path to the directory where you've saved your model.\n\nWe need to define these as Python variables and as shell environment variables.
