We'll come back to how the model does that soon.\n\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/op9Maqr.png)\n\nBut looking closely at convolutions and how they are applied to your image will improve your intuition for these models, how they work, and how to debug them when they don't work.\n\n**Let's get started.**\n\n# Exercises\nWe'll use some small utilty functions to visualize raw images and some results of your code.

But you could have larger convolutions. They could be 3x3, 4x4, etc.  They don't even have to be square. Nothing prevents using a 4x7 convolution.\n\nCompare the number of visual patterns that can be captured by small convolutions. Which of the following is true?\n\n- There are more visual patterns that can be captured by large convolutions\n- There are fewer visual patterns that can be captured by large convolutions\n- The number of visual patterns that can be captured by large convolutions is the same as the number of visual patterns that can be captured by small convolutions?\n\nOnce you think you know the answer, check it by uncommenting and running the line below.","144bbb30":"**[Deep Learning Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/deep-learning)**\n\n---\n","9e36164c":"---\n**[Deep Learning Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/deep-learning)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
