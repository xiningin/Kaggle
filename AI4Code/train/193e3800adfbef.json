Examples of an intervention could be a treatment in medicine, or the introduction of a policy or new law, or the effect of an advertising campaign on sales. Examples of responses could be\n\n* no effect at all\n* an immediate effect only, seen as a change in the level\n* a long term effect only, seen as a change in the slope\n* both an immediate and long term effect, seen as a change in both the level and the slope\n\nSome assumptions are \n\n* the relationship between covariates and treated time series remains stable throughout the post-period\n* the covariates were not themselves affected by the intervention\n* no other event took place simultaneously\n\nWhat we are essentially doing is calculating the counterfactual: extending the time series as if  nothing had ever happened, *i.e.* forecast the data from the moment of intervention using the data prior to the intervention. We then compare the counterfactual time series with the real time series data, and examine the difference between the two.\n\n## Example\nFor this example we shall use the [Carbon Dioxide Levels in Atmosphere](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ucsandiego\/carbon-dioxide) dataset, which we looked at previously in the notebook [\"*Time series decomposition: Naive example*\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/carlmcbrideellis\/time-series-decomposition-naive-example). We then artificially introduce, starting in 2005, the hypothetical policy change that all combustion engine cars are  globally replaced by zero emission electric cars, leading to an immediate reduction in CO$_2$ by 10 ppm. \n\nNote that we first [de-trend the time series in order to make it stationary](https:\/\/www.statsmodels.org\/dev\/examples\/notebooks\/generated\/stationarity_detrending_adf_kpss.html).","181253bb":"Install the [Causal Impact](https:\/\/github.com\/dafiti\/causalimpact) package"}}
