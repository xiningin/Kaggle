It takes its name from the Greek word for a rainbow, which is also the name for the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris. Iris is also widely used as a common name for all Iris species, as well as some belonging to other closely related genera. Iris is extensively grown as ornamental plant in home and botanical gardens.
