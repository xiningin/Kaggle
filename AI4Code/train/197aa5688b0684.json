The mask parameter takes the image that I imported and will fit the wordcloud within its bounds. It took me some time to find one that worked well, but it seems like having an image with a white background does the trick. The image itself does not have to be black and white. I also had trouble getting it to work with .png files and images with a smaller size."}}
