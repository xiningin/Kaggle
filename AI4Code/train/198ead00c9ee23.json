I select 0.4 threshold. Because it have a better recall and good precision. We should see what we need. Here recall is more important for me.","f1ebac5d":"### A Data Science Framework\n\n\n\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\n\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are \u201cdrowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \"dirty data\" to \"clean data.\"\n\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn \u201cwild\u201d data into \u201cmanageable\u201d data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\n\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\n\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that\u2019s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\n\n\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset.\n\n\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \"bionic man\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your \u201ccurrency exchange\" rate.\n\n*Source : [A Data Science Framework: To Achieve 99% Accuracy](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ldfreeman3\/a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy)*","bb0ae747":"### Try to Select Best Model\nWe know we can change precision to have better recall.

Well we can select a const random seed. I use `sklearn` for this which used random strategy. ","b53a9396":"But before that we should add some hyperparamters.

We examine all models and select some of them to optimise and make them better. \n","edd5fa5c":"For this goal we write a sklearn transformer to use it with our pipelines in future.","cc89cdc8":"#### Correcting and Completing\nWe should first review our data and see if there is not to be unaccaptable features and datas. Also there is null values in our data some algorithms can handle null values but it's better to handle these null values.\n\nFor this first see our data informations. ","90c80e7f":"#### Delete Stop Words and Punctuations\n**stop word** is a commonly used word (such as \u201cthe\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, \u201cin\u201d) that a search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query.\n\n","16992175":"First let join X and y to can analys data","1e3f6ec1":"First we split labels from other datas","3b90075b":"\nFrom these plots we recognize we should select one of navie bayes.\n\nThese kind of models have an aplha parameters which is very important. So let select three of them.","510a8982":"## Step1: Define the Problem\nIn this problem we want to find all spams using classification problems. There is some significant words in spams which can be used to find spams. ","e4154412":"### Try to Select Best HyperParameters \nFor this goal we use grid search. It means try some possible hyperparameters of model but using sklearn tools. \n\nWe use recall scoring. because recall is more important for us.","7775e1c2":"##### Creating Sparse Matrix\nto find out spam messages there is a way to get all possible words in messages and create a sparse matrix of existence of word in message or not. Then train classifier on this sparse matrix.\n\nFor that we write a transformer which convert our messages to corresponding sparse matrix.","46ea9a9f":"### Creating\nTo create new features that can help us to solve this problem we should first analys our data to find out important words. then we can use them to create a `sparse matrix` of existence of these words in message.","ae581177":"First See how much of them are spams\n","77e7ed5c":"#### Change Numbers and Urls\nIn this section we change numbers to string `NUMBER` and change urls to `URL`. Because existence of url or number is important for us. Not that number or url itself.\n","0b083eab":"As you see we can select a bernoli navie bayes with low alpha to have great score in both recall and precision.

Now let see dataframe **before** this transform :","5aa9635e":"We add length to find out if it is important or not.","70810cc4":"Our error scoring use precision, recall and f1_score. If you don't know what they are you can find usefull informations [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Precision_and_recall). \n\nFirst we define all of our models in an array. \n","96abb730":"Now lets select a good threshold to have both good recall and precision. ","25e8cb4a":"And **after** :","b00c7e35":"Then Split them.","41a99a30":"Then compute every score for all of them.","bcd4f817":"## Optimise and Strategize \nNow we should see what is important for us. Well in spam problem it is important to block all spams and recognize not spam messages. But we can say it is more important to block all spams. So we can say `precision` and `recall` are both important. but `recall` is more important than `precision`.\n\nSo if model have a low f1 it is not good for us. it also should have a recall more than 90. \n\nOk. We select `multinomial navie bayes`. Also we can select `random forest` because it has a high precision and we can sacrifise it to get more recall. "}}
