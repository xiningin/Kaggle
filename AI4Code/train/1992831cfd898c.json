When we keep a threshold (usually equal to 0.5), we can obtain binary values, 0 and 1.

The representation has to be meaningful in such a way that each vector captures a dimension of the word's meaning, and semantically similar words have similar vectors.\n\nRead more - https:\/\/medium.com\/@jayeshbahire\/introduction-to-word-vectors-ea1d4e4b84bf\n\nThere are two ways to obtain these vectors (also called word-embeddings):-\n\n(1) We can simply create a word-dictionary of all the existing words in our data, where each word is mapped with a number. Then we create an embedding matrix with the dimensions (num_words, length_of_each_embedding_vector). This matrix is essentially a look-up table, where for every word's index number in the dictionary, the matrix returns the embedding vector for that word. During the training process, the contents of this matrix are updated as well.\n\n(2) In this method too, we have an embedding matrix. But this time, the matrix contains word-embeddings that are already trained on some other corpus. We may choose to either keep the values of this matrix forzen during the training process, or train it to tweak the values a little so as to suit our data better.","8f32c762":"<a id=\"25\"><\/a>\n### Bidirectional LSTM","1506657e":"<a id=\"20\"><\/a>\n# Deep Learning models","268698d5":"> In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.

Even though, the last hidden state is dependent on all the previous hidden states as well, the dependence is usually weak with hidden states from the initial steps.
