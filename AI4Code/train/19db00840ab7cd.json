After recognising the correlation I took a deeper dive into it to see how different the scores were between genders.\n\nOnly in the Math Scores do the Males of the data have an edge.

You can clearly see a great number of correlations between some of the different value streams.\n\nGenerally speaking, females do better than males, with the exception of Maths, where males slightly excel. \n\nOut of the ones that took the Maths test, someone taking a standard lunch was more likely to achieve a higher result whether male or female.\n\nGroup C's ethniicty values with a standard lunch meant that they were far more likely to get a higher score when compared with their writing scores.\n\nI think it goes without saying that there are very clear correlations.\n\nGender and maths test with the lunch values as a hue is a fantastic graph to point out how clear this correlation really is.\n\n\n","4dd6a1f4":"<a id = \"2\"><\/a><br>\n# Checking The Data","d8938b73":"Now this is much mor visually pleasing. \n\nSo I can see that there are good correlations that would require further investigation. \n* Reading and writing score VS gender provides a negative correlation to quite a high degree.\n* Math, Reading and Writing scores have a highly positive correlation.\n","f69063f4":"<a id = \"6\"><\/a><br>\n### Scatterplots and Relplots","2e445f1f":"<a id = \"7\"><\/a><br>\n### Boxplots","98e4f87b":"Not getting a great deal from this heatmap so I'll transform the data into all numerical data and see what kind of heatmap i can generate.","f36f515c":"<a id = \"1\"><\/a><br>\n# Loading The Nessecary","98c9c07c":"<a id = \"5\"><\/a><br>\n### Histograms","93ff31e2":"Thanks for reading through this EDA.
