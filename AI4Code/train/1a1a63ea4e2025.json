Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. This is true in all areas of the world except few. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s. This heart disease classifier uses historical dataset of patients to classify heart disease. Various features available in the dataset are used for prediction of heart disease.\n\n\n\nAbout the Dataset\n\nThis database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 13 of them.The \"target\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 which means presence of no hear disease and 1 means presence of disease. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence i.e value 1 from absence (value 0).\n\nThe data includes 303 patient level features including if they have heart disease at the end or not. Features are like; Age: Obvious one.\n\n    Sex:\n\n    0: Female\n    1: Male\n\n    Chest Pain Type:\n\n    0: Typical Angina\n    1: Atypical Angina\n    2: Non-Anginal Pain\n    3: Asymptomatic\n\n    Resting Blood Pressure: Person's resting blood pressure.\n    Cholesterol: Serum Cholesterol in mg\/dl\n    Fasting Blood Sugar:\n\n    0:Less Than 120mg\/ml\n    1: Greater Than 120mg\/ml\n\n    Resting Electrocardiographic Measurement:\n\n    0: Normal\n    1: ST-T Wave Abnormality\n    2: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy\n\n    Max Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved\n    Exercise Induced Angina:\n\n    1: Yes\n    0: No\n\n    ST Depression: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.\n    Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment:\n\n    0: Upsloping\n    1: Flat\n    2: Downsloping\n\n    Thalassemia: A blood disorder called 'Thalassemia':\n\n    0: Normal\n    1: Fixed Defect\n    2: Reversable Defect\n\n    Number of Major Vessels: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.\n","1d965504":"Let's improve our test accuracy by using random forest classifier"}}
