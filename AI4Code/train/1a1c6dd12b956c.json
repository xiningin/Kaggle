However, the average of the world top 10 billionaires drops to 60 years old while in Brazil the average go up to 67 years old.\n\nThe countries with the highest number of billionaires are United States and China. Brazil, a developing country, appears in front of Canada and United Kingdom, developed countries. But of course the total population of Brazil is way bigger than the population of Canada and UK. \n\nThe vast majority of the billionaires are married. Looking only to top 10, the pattern is the same.\n\nIn Brazil, the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro are the two universities which the billionaires studied the most. Both are public universities.\n\nBetween the brazillians, is possible to observe that the banking sector is the most frequent, followed by retail, hospital and beer.","409af38d":"Now, let's take a look at brazilian billionaires"}}
