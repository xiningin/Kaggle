Introduction\n\nThis is a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive. Firstly, I will prepare the data (handwritten digits images) then i will focus on the CNN modeling and evaluation.\n\nThis Notebook follows three main parts:\n* The data preparation\n* The CNN modeling and evaluation\n* The results prediction and submission\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/img1.imagilive.com\/0717\/mnist-sample.png\" ><\/img>","8ae1c3e0":"## CNN architecture\n1. Conv2D (8 filters with 4*4 convolution) with Relu activation\n2. MaxPool (2*2 pooling)\n3. Conv2D (16 filters with 2*2 convolution) with Relu activation\n4. MaxPool (2*2 pooling)\n5. Flatten\n6. Dense NN with Relu activation\n7. Dense NN with Softmax\n\nI used the Keras Sequential API, where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\nThe first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 8 filters for the first conv2D layers and 16 filters for second one. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important. \n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\nDropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting. \n\n'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network. \n\nThe Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional\/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end, I used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just a neural networks (NN) classifier. In the last layer(Dense(10,activation=\"softmax\")) the net outputs distribution of probability of each class.","8240cae9":"## 2.3 Normalization","a1ff5e8e":"For the data augmentation, i choosed to :\n   - Randomly rotate some training images by 10 degrees\n   - Randomly  Zoom by 10% some training images\n   - Randomly shift images horizontally by 10% of the width\n   - Randomly shift images vertically by 10% of the height\n   \nI did not apply a vertical_flip nor horizontal_flip since it could have lead to misclassify symetrical numbers such as 6 and 9.\n\nOnce our model is ready, we fit the training dataset .","f4011992":"# 4. Evaluate the model\n## 4.1 Training and validation curves","49095c1a":"I choosed to split the train set in two parts : a small fraction (10%) became the validation set which the model is evaluated and the rest (90%) is used to train the model.\n\nSince we have 42 000 training images of balanced labels (see 2.1 Load data), a random split of the train set doesn't cause some labels to be over represented in the validation set. Be carefull with some unbalanced dataset a simple random split could cause inaccurate evaluation during the validation. ","7696b38e":"Labels are 10 digits numbers from 0 to 9.

We reshape all data to 28x28x1 3D matrices. \n\nKeras requires an extra dimension in the end which correspond to channels. MNIST images are gray scaled so it use only one channel. For RGB images, there is 3 channels, we would have reshaped 784px vectors to 28x28x3 3D matrices. ","d59bb875":"**Basic CNN result :** The accuracy I have got here on validation set (with batch_size = 100 and epoch = 10) is 99.52. But the validation accuray is 98.71 which is less than training accuray. It means that the model is overfitting the training data. We need to try some methods to reduce overfitting.\n\n**CNN with dropout:** After applying droput of 0.25 after both pooling layer, I am getting 99.1 accuracy in both training and validation set.  Now it looks pretty descent. But to increase overall training and validation set accuracy, we probably need more training data. Lets try out data augmentation menthod to generate more training data and re-train our model.","60fdc89e":"## 3.2 Set the optimizer\n\nOnce our layers are added to the model, we need to set up a score function, a loss function and an optimisation algorithm.\n\nWe define the loss function to measure how poorly our model performs on images with known labels. It is the error rate between the oberved labels and the predicted ones. We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the \"categorical_crossentropy\".\n\nThe most important function is the optimizer. This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss. \n\nI choosed RMSprop (with default values), it is a very effective optimizer. The RMSProp update adjusts the Adagrad method in a very simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.\nWe could also have used Stochastic Gradient Descent ('sgd') optimizer, but it is slower than RMSprop.\n\nThe metric function \"accuracy\" is used is to evaluate the performance our model.\nThis metric function is similar to the loss function, except that the results from the metric evaluation are not used when training the model (only for evaluation).","aaec7888":"# 3.
