We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.\n\nThis data set contains the following features:\n\n* 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes\n* 'Age': cutomer age in years\n* 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer\n* 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet\n* 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement\n* 'City': City of consumer\n* 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male\n* 'Country': Country of consumer\n* 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window\n* 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad\n\n## Import Libraries\n\n**Import a few libraries you think you'll need (Or just import them as you go along!)**","79054ab6":"## Predictions and Evaluations\n**Now predict values for the testing data.**","4244f1c5":"**Create a jointplot showing Area Income versus Age.**"}}
