Ratings seem high in my opinion, the majority of my animes are close to five rates;\n2.

Since the ratings are an integer from zero to five, people don't vote between those values and we can see those vertical lines representing that.

Because this dataset is cool and i want to share my insights with you, feel free to give me ideas in the comments;\n2. Because I always spend hours reading documentation to plot the same plots I've ploted over years and for some reason I just can't remember the syntax.","6323f5de":"## Read dataset","c501142a":"## Genres"}}
