It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservations, and some minor possessions.[j] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area.[d] The United States shares significant land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, as well as limited maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, and Russia.[22] With a population of more than 331 million people, it is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York.\n\nPaleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Disputes over taxation and political representation with Great Britain led to the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), which established independence. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states; by 1848, the United States spanned the continent. Slavery was legal in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century when the American Civil War led to its abolition. The Spanish\u2013American War and World War I established the U.S. as a world power, a status confirmed by the outcome of World War II.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States fought the Korean War and the Vietnam War but avoided direct military conflict with the Soviet Union. The two superpowers competed in the Space Race, culminating in the 1969 spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole superpower.\n\nThe United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government, including a bicameral legislature. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, and other international organizations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Considered a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, its population has been profoundly shaped by centuries of immigration. The country ranks high in international measures of economic freedom, quality of life, education, and human rights, and has low levels of perceived corruption. However, the country has received criticism concerning inequality related to race, wealth and income, the use of capital punishment, high incarceration rates, and lack of universal health care.\n\nThe United States is a highly developed country, accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP, and is the world's largest economy. By value, the United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods. Although its population is only 4.2% of the world's total, it holds 29.4% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share held by any country. Making up more than a third of global military spending, it is the foremost military power in the world; and it is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[23]'''","f045d745":"doc= nlp(text)","c24e98a1":"doc","b15a4133":"sent1 = list(doc.sents)[0]\nsent1","865eb81e":"import numpy as np\nyour_word = 'office'\nms = nlp.vocab.vectors.most_similar(np.asarray([nlp.vocab.vectors[nlp.vocab.strings[your_word]]]),n=10)\nwords = [nlp.vocab.strings[w] for w in ms[0][0]]\ndistances = ms[2]","17ca609b":"words","3ca30b43":"doc1 = nlp('i like pizzas and burgers')\ndoc2 = nlp('fast foods taste good')\nprint(doc1,'<-->',doc2,doc1.similarity(doc2))","b2aa2d9e":"word1 = nlp('food')\nword2 = nlp('water')\nword1.similarity(word2)","250345ba":"word1 = nlp('food')\nword2 = nlp('burger')\nword1.similarity(word2)","6f68c466":"nlp = spacy.blank('en')","8dcb2b15":"nlp.add_pipe('sentencizer')","02a52b25":"import requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\ns = requests.get(\"https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/ans7870\/6\/6.006\/s08\/lecturenotes\/files\/t8.shakespeare.txt\")\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(s.content).text.replace(\"-\\n\", \"\").replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\nnlp.max_length = 5278439","312c3029":"%%time\ndoc = nlp(soup)\nprint(len(list(doc.sents)))","9cea8960":"nlp.analyze_pipes()","4ecc7800":"import spacy\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')\ntext = 'West Chhesternfieldville was referenced in Mr. Deeds'","c21af8eb":"doc = nlp(text)","063b2f39":"for ent in doc.ents:\n    print(ent.text,ent.label_)","6a3cc10d":"ruler = nlp.add_pipe('entity_ruler')","c042785d":"nlp.analyze_pipes()","f88946d2":"patterns = [{\n    \"label\": \"GPE\",\"pattern\":\"West Chhesternfieldville\"\n}]","018d93de":"ruler.add_patterns(patterns)","84e420c4":"nlp2 = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')\nruler = nlp2.add_pipe('entity_ruler',before='ner')\nruler.add_patterns(patterns)\ndoc = nlp2(text)\n","fcf59fbe":"for ent in doc.ents:\n    print(ent.text,ent.label_)","075fceda":"import spacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher","cfb6a34f":"nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')","ffc28f6e":"matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\npattern = [{'LIKE_EMAIL': True}]\nmatcher.add('EMAIL_ADDRESS',[pattern])","1350790d":"doc = nlp('this is my email we@zeemedia.com')\nmatches = matcher(doc)","ab2fbb87":"print(matches)","de9eaa12":"print(nlp.vocab[matches[0][0]].text)","519b7d4f":"text = ''' Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 \u2013 April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesman and leader in the American civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. King advanced civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. He was the son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr.\n\nKing participated in and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights.[1] King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King helped organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nThe SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.[2] Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963, forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital affairs and reported on them to government officials, and, in 1964, mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.[3]\n\nOn October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities. Allegations that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and the most populous county in Washington State was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.'''","f16715b9":"text","fe05d086":"matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\npattern = [{\"POS\":\"PROPN\",\"OP\":\"+\"}]\nmatcher.add(\"PROPER_NOUNS\",[pattern],greedy='LONGEST')\ndoc = nlp(text)\nmatches = matcher(doc)\nprint(len(matches))","c610cb51":"for match in matches[:10]:\n    print(match,doc[match[1]:match[2]])","693185b7":"# SPACY PIPELINES","be324cc6":"# SPACY ENTITY RULER"}}
