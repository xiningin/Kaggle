It is difficult to compare the energy consumption of two buildings if they are not similar in these ways as it wouldn't be an *apples to apples* comparison. In order to compare buildings of different uses, sizes, and climates -- we have to do a process called `normalization`.\n\n","98016a51":"# Automation of the process of analysis on multiple buildings\n\nNormalization is really about the ability to compare a diverse set of buildings\n\nNow we load 6 buildings to extract and normalize the data. Since the normalization process is most useful on a set of buildings, we will load six of the BDG buildings as an example to showcase the comparison.","7cd54301":"## Extract meta data from another file\n\nYou can see in the meta data file that there are various attributes that we can use to normalize the building consumption -- including `sqm` or size of the building","3c5d9dff":"## The question -- how can we compare the energy consumption of buildings that are different sizes, from different climates, etc.?\n\nTo get started with this task, we can use the the BDG2 data set from several buildings. First we'll load the libraries and data once again.\n","55b81125":"# Normalization based on floor area\n\nOne of the most simple ways of normalization is to simply divide energy consumption by the floor area to create the Energy Use Intensity (EUI). This metric takes energy and simply divides by the floor area (in ft2 or m2)","a8a34b4d":"## Normalized Energy Consumption\n\nHowever, and now normalized data!","c40a292c":"Now we normalize using area by using a vector operation and resampling to monthly data.","d0ed3d70":"## Unnormalized energy consumption\n\nLet's look at unnormalized data from the site."}}
