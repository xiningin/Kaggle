Here's how it works:\n\n- We generate a batch of images using the generator, pass the into the discriminator.\n\n- We calculate the loss by setting the target labels to 1 i.e. real. We do this because the generator's objective is to \"fool\" the discriminator.\u00a0\n\n- We use the loss to perform gradient descent i.e. change the weights of the generator, so it gets better at generating real-like images to \"fool\" the discriminator.\n\nHere's what this looks like in code.","a18907e3":"As one might expect, the output from the generator is basically random noise, since we haven't trained it yet. \n\nLet's move the generator to the chosen device.","b9cf61a8":"## Discriminator Network\n\nThe discriminator takes an image as input, and tries to classify it as \"real\" or \"generated\".

We'll use stride of 2 to progressively reduce the size of the output feature map.\n\n![](https:\/\/github.com\/vdumoulin\/conv_arithmetic\/raw\/master\/gif\/padding_strides_odd.gif)","d9209047":"Now that we have trained the models, we can save checkpoints.","4513e7f8":"# Generative Adversarial Networks in PyTorch\n\nDeep neural networks are used mainly for supervised learning: classification or regression. Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, however, use neural networks for a very different purpose: Generative modeling\n\n> Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. - [Source](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans\/)\n\nTo get a sense of the power of generative models, just visit [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https:\/\/thispersondoesnotexist.com). Every time you reload the page, a new image of a person's face is generated on the fly.

The generator generates a \"fake\" sample given a random vector\/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is \"real\" (picked from the training data) or \"fake\" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs. \n\nGANs however, can be notoriously difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization. In this tutorial, we'll train a GAN to generate images of anime characters' faces.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NaKtJs0.png\" style=\"width:360px; margin-bottom:32px\"\/>\n\n\nWe'll use the [Anime Face Dataset](https:\/\/github.com\/Mckinsey666\/Anime-Face-Dataset), which consists of over 63,000 cropped anime faces.
