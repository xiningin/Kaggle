How many distinct ways are there to climb the staircase? For example, if you wanted to climb 3 steps, you can visualize different combinations as the following:\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nOr, for 4 steps the following distinct numbers of steps, can be taken.\n\n* 1, 1, 1, 1\n* 1, 1, 2\n* 1, 2, 1\n* 2, 1, 1\n* 2, 2","a966e618":"**Solution**\n\nWe'll try to build up a list of solutions for N starting from the smallest staircase. If we want to climb a staircase of 1 step (N = 1), then we can only take 1 step to reach the top. Therefore, the solution when N = 1 is 1. If we want to climb a staircase of 2 steps (N = 2), we can take either 2 steps, or 1 step and 1 step to reach the top. So for N = 2, the solution is 2."}}
