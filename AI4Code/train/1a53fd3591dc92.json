We plotted the data of the months variation of the data \n2. This notebook can be a starter to see if there are true randomness in the variation of average temperatures across the months year by year \n3. We could see that exists a tendency to increase in temperature in the city of Curitiba\n4. Next works may include regression models to find a predictive analysis of the city of  Curititba temperature\n\n\nIf you liked the notebook give it an up and if you can help me improve the analisys feel free to leave a comment. \n\n**THANK YOU**","9e6d74f0":"Now we are going to get the data of the year averages and get the years as the y variable","6080e093":"Here we can see that the data starts to get more sparse comparing the variation year by year.
