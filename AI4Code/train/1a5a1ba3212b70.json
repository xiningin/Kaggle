Yet, given Cyprus' proximity to Syria geographically (off-shore neighbor), I think it is interesting to point out the assylum-seeking counts between 2004 and 2010, which seem to anticipate the overall spikes we observe in 2012. If we look at the history of the region, we observe unrest for many years in advance of the current Syrian emergency, and this Cyprus assylum-seeking increase in the mid-2000s may very well relate to some of that activity.

Understanding the asylum seeking rates of Syrian refugees in countries of residence would help the UNHCR better understand the how best to allocate these resources, and that is the focus of this EDA.
