This allows the focus to be on the running back, as his teammates shouldn't exactly be counting against him. ","8ed7f462":"This notebook is an attempt at reproducing with Python what [Michael Lopez did in R](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/statsbymichaellopez\/nfl-tracking-initial-wrangling-voronoi-areas).  Some of the code is borrowed or modified from [Rob Mula's](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/robikscube\/nfl-big-data-bowl-plotting-player-position) and [SRK's](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sudalairajkumar\/simple-exploration-notebook-nfl) great notebooks.  \n\nI've included the test data collected via this simple notebook: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cpmpml\/save-test\n\nOne initial but tricky issue when working with NFL player tracking data is that sometimes players are moving left to right, and other times they are moving right to left. One recommended technique for working with this data is to standardize play directions, so that the offensive team is always moving in the same direction. This idea is particularly important for this year's Big Data Bowl event on Kaggle, where many participants will look to engineer football-specific features. \n\nTo start off, let's read in the data, creating a dummy variable for plays moving left to right (`ToLeft`), as well as an indicator for whether or not the player is the ball carrier (`IsBallCarrier`). \n\nNext, we add in a few tweaks to account for different factors between the `PossessionTeam`\/`FieldPosition` variables and the `HomeTeamAbbr`\/`VisitorTeamAbbr`.\n\nLast, but not least, we shift direction so that cosine of direction maps to the X axis, and sine of direction maps to the Y axis.  We change both the unit from degrees to radians, but also the direction origin and the way direction increases. We'll see later that this matches what we could see on screen during the play.","7a975774":"This looks nice but there are unbounded Voronoi regions.

This matches to how the arrow is displayed by our code.\n\nLet's look at a second play.","98125a9c":"Taking the above code, we'll play the standardized `X` and `Y` variables, similar to what we did above. We also created the `YardLine_std` variable -- in football language, this is the line of scrimmage. More importantly, we've ensured the `YardLine_std`, unlike `YardLine`, treats each side of the field differently. For example, if `YardLine == 25`, that could mean the possession team has 75 yards to go for a touchdown, or it could mean it has 25 yards to go for a touchdown. \n","9600f19e":"Let's see how our standardised direction is distributed, for the offense teams, and for the defense teams.","b8fd1a3b":"We see that the standardized direction is centered around 0, which is to be expected.\n\n\nPeter Hurford shared an interesting discovery in this notebook when he displayed orientation distribution by season: Peter Hurford 4:38 AM\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/peterhurford\/something-is-the-matter-with-orientation\n\nLet's see what we got here.","c8b29326":"Let's check","3d18edac":"We can now standardise orientation as we did for direction.

This proves that the way I shift direction is the right way.\n\n![](https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/mBwPxbGLGNjpLSpenx\/giphy.gif)\n\nEven though the same team has the ball in the same game as the play above, the offense is now moving right to left (`PlayDirection == \"left\")`. \n\n\nIt's really hard to tell which team is on offense friom the data! Even though the ball carrier is highlighted in black, the inconsistency from one play to the next is less than ideal. Sometimes the away team is on offense, other times the home team is on offense. And they're both potentially moving left or moving right. \n\nOur ultimate goal will be to ensure that the offensive team (`PossessionTeam`) is moving left to right, even if in the raw data, the offense is moving right to left. \n\nThe following set of code will get us there.","099b5638":"In the above plot, the blue team is always on offense, and the red team is always on defense. The blue team is also always moving left to right. The dotted line corresponds to where the play started -- if `Yards == 0`, that means that the ball carrier was tackled on or about the dotted line. If `Yards > 0`, the ball carrier ended the play to the right of the dotted line, and if `Yards < 0`, the ball carrier ended the play to the left of the dotted line."}}
