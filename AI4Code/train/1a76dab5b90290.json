Our opinion is that each environment has good and bad things, and any data scientist should know how to use both in order to be as prepared as posible for job market or to start personal project.    \n\nTo get a feeling of what is going on regarding this hot topic, we refer the reader to [DataCamp's Data Science War](http:\/\/blog.datacamp.com\/r-or-python-for-data-analysis\/) infographic. Their infographic explores what the strengths of **R** are over **Python** and vice versa, and aims to provide a basic comparison between these two programming languages from a data science and statistics perspective.  \n\nFar from being a repetition from the previous, our series of tutorials will go hands-on into how to actually perform different data science taks such as working with data frames, doing aggregations, or creating different statistical models such in the areas of supervised and unsupervised learning.  \n\nWe will use real-world datasets, and we will build some real data products. This will help us to quickly transfer what we learn here to actual data analysis situations.  \n\nIf your are interested in Big Data products, then you might find interesting our series of [tutorials on using Apache Spark and Python](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/spark-py-notebooks) or [using R on Apache Spark (SparkR)](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/spark-r-notebooks).  \n\n## Tutorials\n\nThis is a growing list of tutorials explaining concepts and applications in Python and R. \n\n### [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/machine-learning\/crash-course\/)\n\nMachine Learning ML Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs is highly recommended by Google as it's developed by googlers.\n\n### [Introduction to Data Frames](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/data-science-your-way\/blob\/master\/01-data-frames\/README.md)  \n\nAn introduction to the basic data structure and how to use it in Python\/Pandas and R.  \n\n### [Exploratory Data Analysis](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/data-science-your-way\/blob\/master\/02-exploratory-data-analysis\/README.md)    \n\nAbout this important task in any data science engineering project.  \n\n### [Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/data-science-your-way\/blob\/master\/03-dimensionality-reduction-and-clustering\/README.md)    \nAbout using Principal Component Analysis and k-means Clustering to better represent and understand our data.  \n\n### [Text Mining and Sentiment Classification](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/data-science-your-way\/blob\/master\/04-sentiment-analysis\/README.md)    \n\nHow to use text mining techniques to analyse the positive or non-positive sentiment of text documents using just *linear methods*.  \n\n## Applications  \n\nThese are some of the applications we have built using the concepts explained in the tutorials.  \n\n### [A web-based Sentiment Classifier using R and Shiny](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/data-science-your-way\/blob\/master\/apps\/sentimentclassifier\/README.md)  \n\nHow to build a web applications where we can upload text documents to be sentiment-analysed using the R-based framework [Shiny](http:\/\/shiny.rstudio.com\/).  \n\n### [Building Data Products with Python](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/data-science-your-way\/blob\/master\/apps\/winerama\/README.md)  \n\nUsing a [wine reviews and recommendations website](http:\/\/jadianes.koding.io:8000\/reviews\/) as a leitmotif, this series of tutorials, with [its own separate repository](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/winerama-recommender-tutorial) tagged by lessons, digs into how to use Python technologies such as Django, Pandas, or Scikit-learn, in order to build data products.   \n\n### [Red Wine Quality Data analysis with R](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/data-science-your-way\/blob\/master\/apps\/wine-quality-data-analysis\/README.md)  \n\nUsing R and ggplot2, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis of this reference dataset about wine quality.    \n\n### [Information Retrieval algorithms with Python](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/data-science-your-way\/blob\/master\/apps\/information-retrieval\/README.md)  \n\nWhere we show our own implementation of a couple of Information Retrieval algorithms: vector space model, and tf-idf.  \n\n### [Kaggle - The Analytics Edge (Spring 2015)](https:\/\/github.com\/jadianes\/data-science-your-way\/blob\/master\/apps\/kaggle-analytics-edge-15\/)  \n\nMy solution to this Kaggle competition.

What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.\n\nThe courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start in the [Linear Algebra](#linear-algebra) section and after finishing the first course, start the next one.\n\n**If the course isn't open, do it anyway with the resources from the previous class.**\n\n### Should I take all courses?\n\n**Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here!\n\n### Duration of the project\n\nIt may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular Data Science course, but I can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation\/dedication**!\n\nYou must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours **every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.\n\n> See more about \"Commit to a process, not a goal\" [here](http:\/\/jamesclear.com\/goals-systems).\n\n### Project Based\n\nHere in **Data Science University**, you do **not** need to take exams, because we are focused on **real projects**!\n\nIn order to show for everyone that you **successfully** finished a course, you should create a **real project**.\n\n> \"What does it mean?\"\n\nAfter finish a course, you should think about a **real world problem** that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to **validate** and **consolidate** your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.\n\nThe projects of all students will be listed in [this](https:\/\/github.com\/open-source-society\/data-science\/blob\/master\/PROJECTS.md) file. Submit your project's information in that file after you conclude it.\n\n**You can create this project alone or with other students!**\n\n#### Project Suggestions\n\n\nAnd you should also...\n\n### Be creative!\n\nThis is a **crucial** part of your journey through all those courses.\n\nYou **need** to have in mind that what you are able to **create** with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate **and this is what really matters**!\n\nIn order to show that you **really** learned those things, you need to be **creative**!\n\nHere are some tips about how you can do that:\n\n- **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize\/summarize what you learned.\n- **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.\n\n### Which programming languages should I use?\n\nPython and R are heavily used in Data Science community and our courses teach you both, but...\n\nThe **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.\n\n[Be creative](#be-creative) in order to show your progress! :smile:\n\n### Stay tuned\n\nUPVOTE for futures improvements and general information.\n\n## Prerequisite\n\nThe **only things** that you need to know are how to use **Git** and **GitHub**. Here are some resources to learn about them:\n\n**Note**: Just pick one of the courses below to learn the basics. You will learn a lot more once you get started!\n\n- [Try Git](https:\/\/try.github.io\/levels\/1\/challenges\/1)\n- [Git - the simple guide](http:\/\/rogerdudler.github.io\/git-guide\/)\n- [GitHub Training & Guides](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)\n- [GitHub Hello World](https:\/\/guides.github.com\/activities\/hello-world\/)\n- [Git Immersion](http:\/\/gitimmersion.com\/index.html)\n- [How to Use Git and GitHub](https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)","2c2a3d6f":"### Feature Engineering","3e40ac3f":"# Awesome Data Science for Beginners with Roadmap and Titanic Exploration\n\n### (Start Here) (TBU)\n\n    This kernel has the curated list of Awesome Data Science Beginners's Resources with Roadmap and Some Exploratory Data Analysis of Titanic Disaster \n    \nIf you want to know more about Data Science but don't know where to start this list is for you!\n\nNo previous knowledge required but Python and statistics basics will definitely come in handy.
