So we will need a vector that actually points in said direction. You may remember from vector calculus that the gradient $\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$ is a vector that points in the direction of maximum increase of $J(\\theta)$. To obtain a vector in the direction of maximum decrease we can simply negate $\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$ and then multiply by the 'learning rate' $\\alpha$ to control the magnitude of the step size in $\\theta$-space. The form of the update of each step of gradient descent is then:","2ec0dd5b":"# Using the Gradient to Update Theta","350938ba":"The output above is in seconds. Not too bad but we're going to run into some trouble when we call this function in every iteration of an algorithm with possibly hundreds of steps! The tradeoff for having the ease of use and accessibility of a language like python is that we must sacrifice having a programming language that operates closely with the hardware. Python is a very 'high-level' language which means there's many layers of translation that must occur before the hardware knows what to do. This makes high level object oriented programming possible, but it's unfortunately quite slow. The workaround here is that much of numpy is fundamentally written in C, a much lower level and faster language than python. Taking advantage of it entails implementing a fully 'vectorized' approach which means performing as many computations as possible using the array operations of numpy rather than loops in python. There are still loops involved but they are taken care of by numpy at the C level rather than the high level of python. A very simple example is if we would like to perform the dot product between two vectors. Given two vectors in the form of numpy arrays we could naively compute the dot product using a python list comprehension like so:","ec84acf7":"It's often discussed how being skilled at machine learning requires a strong grasp of matrix operations and linear algebra, and in this section we will begin to see how that is the case. In order to implement a vectorized approach we need to be able to express the operations in naive_compute_probabilities entirely using the array operations of numpy. To this end lets try to express the function $h(x)$ in matrix format using the matrices $X$, $\\theta$ and $H$ as defined above. The rows of $X$ are the feature vectors and the columns of $H$ are the vectors $h(x^{(i)})$. The first step is recognizing that we can obtain the columns of $H$ by elementwise exponentiation of the matrix $\\theta X^T$. Here we're using matrix multiplication which is efficiently computed using numpy's np.matmul operation. The 'c vector' whose entries are the constants $c_i$ for each column of $H$ and the 'summation vector' whose entries are the normalization term for each column of $H$ can be obtained by taking a columnwise maximum and sum of the $\\theta X^T$ and its exponentiated form respectively. Finally, the broadcasting rules of numpy make the rest straightforward:","775aa8c4":"If we'd like our model to include bias we can accomodate offset parameters by simply appending the value $1$ to each feature vector.

We begin by writing a function using numpy, which leads us to our discussion of a potentially costly mistake one must avoid. Let's represent each feacture vector in the training set as the rows of an $(nxd)$ feature matrix $X$ where $n$ represents the number of data points in the training set and $d$ represents the dimension of our feature space. Specifically for MNIST, $n=60000$ and $d=784$. Also notice that for the dot products in $h(x)$ to make sense it must be the case that $\\theta_j$ for $j \\in 1$, $2$, ...$k-1$ is a $d$ dimensional vector. So let's call the associated $(kxd)$ parameter matrix $\\theta$. The following function takes $X$ and $\\theta$ as arguments and returns the matrix $H$ where the $i$th column represents $h(x^{(i)})$ as defined above. More intuitively $H$ is a matrix whose columns are probability vectors for each data point as assigned by the current parameter matrix $\\theta$.

We will also demonstrate a possible way one might fail to utilize the power of numpy when implementing algorithms and how to go about fixing it (this is a real life example of a mistake I made myself).
