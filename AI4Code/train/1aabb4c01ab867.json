(sample or population values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values observed. The RMSE represents the square root of the second sample moment of the differences between predicted values and observed values or the quadratic mean of these differences. These deviations are called residuals when the calculations are performed over the data sample that was used for estimation and are called errors (or prediction errors) when computed out-of-sample. The RMSE serves to aggregate the magnitudes of the errors in predictions for various times into a single measure of predictive power. RMSE is a measure of accuracy, to compare forecasting errors of different models for a particular dataset and not between datasets, as it is scale-dependent.\n\nRMSE is always non-negative, and a value of 0 (almost never achieved in practice) would indicate a perfect fit to the data. In general, a lower RMSE is better than a higher one. However, comparisons across different types of data would be invalid because the measure is dependent on the scale of the numbers used.\n\nRMSE is the square root of the average of squared errors. The effect of each error on RMSE is proportional to the size of the squared error; thus larger errors have a disproportionately large effect on RMSE. Consequently, RMSE is sensitive to outliers.\n\nAny way we've already seen in the previous part that there isn't any outlier, so we can definitively use the RMSE as a metric to compare models accuracies.\n\nReference : [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Root-mean-square_deviation)","5db9e626":"## Using polynomial feature","3b52a312":"Now let's try to deal with date time infos as categorical featues, which is some times the right way to handle such data :","b67a92ad":"## How does the best model behave \nNow we plot the predictions from the GradientBoostingRegressor which seems to be the best model so far.

It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.[...]_\n\nAs mentionned in the documentation :\n\n_[...]Prophet follows the sklearn model API. We create an instance of the Prophet class and then call its fit and predict methods. The input to Prophet is always a dataframe with two columns: ds and y. The ds (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a timestamp. The y column must be numeric, and represents the measurement we wish to forecast.[...]_\n\nReference : [Prophet](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/)","33d0483e":"Side note : prophet seems to be a powerfull library and can certainly be tuned to obtain better forecast.

The GRU is like a long short-term memory (LSTM) with forget gate but has fewer parameters than LSTM, as it lacks an output gate. GRU's performance on certain tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling was found to be similar to that of LSTM. GRUs have been shown to exhibit even better performance on certain smaller datasets._\n\n_However, as shown by Gail Weiss & Yoav Goldberg & Eran Yahav, the LSTM is \"strictly stronger\" than the GRU as it can easily perform unbounded counting, while the GRU cannot. That's why the GRU fails to learn simple languages that are learnable by the LSTM._\n\n_Similarly, as shown by Denny Britz & Anna Goldie & Minh-Thang Luong & Quoc Le of Google Brain, LSTM cells consistently outperform GRU cells in \"the first large-scale analysis of architecture variations for Neural Machine Translation._[...]","6f44c894":"At first we are goiing to use the basic linear regression models : LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet.
