However, although Kaggle has been a very rich source of shared codes, I found that there's extremely rare Kaggle kernels on this exciting domain where Vision meets NLP ... \n\n\n![Image Captioning](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*6BFOIdSHlk24Z3DFEakvnQ.png)\n\nWhen I started learning Deep Learning and exploring Kaggle, this kind of tutorial kernel is the one I was looking for, but could not find practical resources at that time. I hope this tutorial to be a starting point and inspiration for those who want to learn this exciting field of Visio-Linguistic domain!!\n\nWith the release of Tensorflow 2 (the latest version now is TF2.2) and Kaggle free TPU + free GCS (Google Cloud Storage), we all now can access a computational **super power** easily than ever before. I think this is simply a revolution, and this super-feature finally allow laymen like us to attack complicated problems like Image Captioning to another level. All of these inspired me to work and share this tutorial kernel!\n\n\n## Reference and Improvement\nAt the moment when I was writing this kernel, the best source to learn image captioning is TF official tutorial : https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/text\/image_captioning where not only we can learn how to do basic image captioning, we can also learn how to \n\n* How to implement **Attention mechanism** properly! Attention mechanism is a technique to allow us to focus on only-relevant spatial image features when generating each word.\n* How to construct **Keras subclass API** in contrast to normally usage of Function API\n* How to build **custom training loop** in Keras\n\nTo adapt this great tutorial to Kaggle we need to adjust code a bit. For those who are interested in to try this original tutorial in Kaggle, I already did all the jobs for you here : https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ratthachat\/image-captioning-by-effnet-attention-in-tf2-1\n\nIn this kernel, we will go beyond the original tutorial in many directions!!\n\n* ***From GPU to TPU*** : we will increase our computational power by *** > 10 folds*** using Kaggle recent TPU feature! With Tensorflow 2, this requires minimal code changing and requires us to transfer data to GCS, which again Kaggle has generously provided us for free! \n* ***Complexity of data***: we changes training data from COCO to Flickr which is more challenging due to quality of texts describing the images! To get decent model, we increase training data ***almost 20 folds*** from around 8K to 150K from the original tutorial, but all training from scratch to convergence can be done by less than 2 hours with the power of TF2 and TPU!!\n* ***Capability of models*** : we upgrade both CNN encoder (for images) and RNN decoder (for texts). On CNN, we use the current SOTA EfficientNet with \"Noisy-Students\" weights generously provided [here](https:\/\/github.com\/qubvel\/efficientnet) . For RNN, instead of learning word vectors from scratch, we adjusted the code to embed the pretrained Glove vectors directly . \n\nWith all these upgrades we got much better results than the original tutorial. (you can compared this kernel result with the original in Kaggle's link above)\n\n# 0. Outline and Pre-requisite\nThis tutorial consists of 3 main sections\n\n1. Setup everything (TPU\/GPU and input pipeline)\n2. Build and train Model\n3. Predict and visualize image captions\n\nEach section consists of several sub-steps as described in each section . Before we can begin, install the latest tensorflow stable version (TF 2.2) and Qubvel's efficientnet . These two may be auto set up into Kaggle docker in the future, but for now we have to install it manually.","a647f488":"The following code will detect TPU or else use either GPU or CPU.

Previously, in Keras & Tensorflow 1, `data_generator` is the method of choice when using Keras but there's cubersome API, and bottleneck on I\/O & CPU.\n\nTo optimize training speed, efficient data pipeline is needed when you cannot store all your data in the memory.\n\nIn Tensorflow 2, data pipeline becomes very powerful and simple with `tf.dataset` API. `tf.dataset` not only much simplifies the old mechanism of `data_generator`, but it also address the bottleneck by using parallel machanism, prefetching, processing pipeline in GPU\/TPU (instead of a slow CPU) and so on ...

Effectively, we change 2D data from CNN into 1D sequential data for RNN\n* This vector is then passed through the RNN Decoder (which consists of an attention mechanism to look back to this vector in every word prediction).\n* In prediction, RNN (here GRU) using knowledge state (already predicted words) together with original data attended over the image to predict the next word.\n\nGiven an image like the example below, our goal is to generate a caption such as \"a surfer riding on a wave\".\n\n![Man Surfing](https:\/\/tensorflow.org\/images\/surf.jpg)\n\n*[Image Source](https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Surfing#\/media\/File:Surfing_in_Hawaii.jpg); License: Public Domain*\n\n![Prediction](https:\/\/tensorflow.org\/images\/imcap_prediction.png)","0fe3f68d":"### Upload Flickr into Kaggle GCS\n\nWe will use the [Flickr dataset](http:\/\/bryanplummer.com\/Flickr30kEntities\/) to train our model. Originally, the dataset contains more than 30,000 images, each of which has at least 5 different caption annotations. This great dataset is already in Kaggle's dataset; however, if we want to train our model using TPU, we have to upload this dataset into Kaggle GCS so that TPU can be most effectively access them. Note that TPU cannot directly access normal Kaggle dataset, so this step is a must.\n\nKaggle is so great that it provides free GCS for us, and easy API, see KaggleDatasets below. This will automatically select the best GCS zone with free of charges!","8cf79a76":"## 1.2 Processing Captions\nAfter finish preparing data, now we begin to process the captions for all images.

Does it overfit or not? \n\nRemember that we have 5 captions per image. To ensure that our model won't memorize some labels, we will print all captions associated with each image.\n\nNote that the ground-truth captions in Flickr are quite mostly quite non-simple. In contrast to other popular dataset like COCO where it can be much easier for our model.\n\nYou can also see on attention visualization that, by predicting each word in the image, our model most of the time focus on the correct part of the pictures.

Nevertheless, from the validation loss, we got, it seems that our model can explain each valid image as well as that of each training image.\n\nOverall, if we run this prediction many times (each times with 10 random new images), we can see that roughly our model understand many images concept like \"many people\", \"computer\", \"field\", \"dog\", \"girl\", \"mouth\", etc. or even action like \"leaning\", \"sitting\", \"jump\". etc. However, it does not know the grammar so the sentence it produces many time look quite strange!\n\nWe may be able to fix this by sending this incomplete sentence to the sentence-expert like GPT-2 and make it correct for us!","c3bcf966":"## 1.5 Split the data into train and valid set\n\nNote that due to each image have 5 captions, we cannot splitting the data randomly.

Employ `tf.dataset` to construct appropriate input pipeline using data from steps 2.-4.\n - We can also add data transformation (e.g. image augmentation like H-flip) easily in this step","767b3ad1":"## 1.1 TPU\/GPU strategy and GCS transfer","d677dbd9":"## 3.3 BONUS : Prepare all prediction caps for GPT2\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, we may further be able to improve the syntactic quality of the captions by feeding these generated sentences into GPT2. Here as a bonus below codes will save the generated sentences into files to be trained by GPT-2. Actually, I also have this GPT-2 kernel, so if anyone read through this last section, and would like to see, please let me know!!","7fd32c3d":"### 1.4.2 Tokenization\nHere, we do a usual keras text-processing : \n\n- tokenize all captions into list of words, and remember all vocabulary\n- convert list of words into list of \"word-index\"\n- pad each example in the list to have the same length\n\nNote that we can set the number of Vocab to be small to simplify the training process; however, in this kernel, we already employed pretrained word vector power, so we choose the full set of vocab (around 20K words) so that we can produce most natural sentences.","34571bb7":"## 2.1 Define Training Step\n\nFor custom training, we have to define the `train_step` function which taking each training batch as input, and return loss as output. For TPU, we also have to make one extra-effort to call `strategy.run` (previously named `strategy.experimental_run_v2`) to divide the global batch into sub-batch for each TPU processor.\n\nIn `train_step`, here's what we do :\n\n* The encoder output, hidden state(initialized to 0) and the decoder input (which is the  `<start>` token) is passed to the decoder.\n* The decoder returns the predictions and the decoder hidden state.\n* The decoder hidden state is then passed back into the model and the predictions are used to calculate the loss.\n\nNote that we use \"teacher-forcing\" training where we input the correct caption for each input. This is different in actual inference stage, where we don't know the real caption, and have to input the previously-predicted word as input. Teacher-forcing make training easier, but will not be very robust. In some advanced research, some papers suggest to transitition from teacher-forcing to actual-inference training in the middle of training process. In this tutorial, we will only do teacher-forcing.\n\nAfter that we define `valid_step` in a similar way.\n","b2b81d60":"Note that to define Attention block, Encoder, Decoder, we use Keras Subclass API, not the usual functional API. This Subclass API is more powerful as it can handle complex model like encoder-decoder & its training process.","79a0e84e":"# 3. Predict Caption!\n\nSo now the real fun time begin!\n\n* The evaluate function is similar to the training loop, except you don't use teacher forcing here. The input to the decoder at each time step is its previous predictions along with the hidden state and the encoder output.\n* Stop predicting when the model predicts the end token.\n* And store the attention weights for every time step.\n\nFirst let us define all helper functions.","32726641":"Here, we construct the encoder , decoder objects as well as loss function. For TPU custom-training, we have to be careful to create them under  `with strategy.scope():` so that Tensorflow will distribute our training batch to each processor appropriately.\n\nYou can learn more on training strategy [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jKV53r9-H14&list=UU0rqucBdTuFTjJiefW5t-IQ&index=43).","64ff9add":"## 1.4 Setup text-input for RNN decoder (text-input)\n\nHere, we have to tokenize the caption labels so that our RNN can use as input and predict as output (word by word). \n\nIn order to generate good sentence, one key is to have good word vectors, so here we choose to employ the pretrained Glove vectors to improve our captioning process\n\n### 1.4.1 Setup Glove word vectors\n\nthe below function `build_matrix` will return the required word vectors. This function will recieve list of words in the dataset's vocabulary as input. We will tokenize all captions and list all vocabs in the dataset in steps 1.4.2\n\nThis funciton is carefully designed to return meaningful word vectors as best as it could as it can fix many unknown words like two examples below :\n\n**Example1.** Note that as Gloves differentiate between upper and lower cases, sometimes Glove may not know word like `john` but it may know `John`. In this case if our dataset have the word `john` which can happen in informal writing, we still want it to have the `John`'s vector (instead of having a random one due to out-of-vocabulary) \n\n**Example2.** For another case, sometimes our dataset may contain some uncommon words like `deforestization` but Glove will not know this word. However, as this complex word may come from the root like `deforest` where Glove really knows, so it may be better to give `deforest`'s vector to this complex word instead of a pure random one.\n\nBoth examples are done automatically in the `build_matrix` function with this line : \n`for candidate in [word, word.lower(), word.upper(), word.capitalize(), ps.stem(word), lc.stem(word), sb.stem(word) ]:` .\n\nNote that all these sub-words mapping can be done automatically in modern decoder model like GPT-2. However, at this moment, GPT-2 cannot get the image input vectors, so unfortunately we cannot employ the GPT-2 super power into our captioning model.","9463a983":"> I also provide the saved weights for this kernel, if you just want to play around image captioning, without model training, you can set the `USE_PREVIOUS_SAVE = True` . If you set it to be `False`, please remember to turn on your TPU where you have a 30 hours\/week quota.\n\n**NOTE** In notebook version 7, I set this to true, and just use CPU to predict captions. If you want to use a TPU to train this kernel, please see version 6."}}
