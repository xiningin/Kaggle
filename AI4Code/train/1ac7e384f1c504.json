Clean the text using my [Tweet Cleaner](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jdparsons\/tweet-cleaner) notebook\n 2. Send the clean text to GPT-2 using my [GPT-2: fake real disasters](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jdparsons\/gpt-2-fake-real-disasters-data-augmentation) notebook. This generates similar tweets with the same label, which I used to double the size of the training data.\n  * The original training data has 7612 rows, while my augmented version has 14612 rows. My hypothesis is that GPT-2 adds useful signal to the training data that AutoML can learn.\n 3. The current notebook is a fork of the official [AutoML Getting Started Notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/yufengg\/automl-getting-started-notebook) submitted by Google\/@yufengg. Here, I replace the original training data with my GPT-2 augmented version, and replace the test data with my cleaned version. A previous run with the original data took around 4 hours to complete, and cost $26 of GCP usage. I will post a comment at the bottom with the run time and cost when using the augmented data.\n\nCheck this notebook's score to see if AutoML can beat my previous best score of 0.82413 from the notebook [USE + LGB + Grid Search + KFold CV](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jdparsons\/use-lgb-grid-search-kfold-cv)!"}}
