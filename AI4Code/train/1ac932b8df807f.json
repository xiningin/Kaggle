CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is an open standard guide that describes common approaches that are used by data mining experts. CRISP-DM includes descriptions of the typical phases of a project, including tasks details and provides an overview of the data mining lifecycle. The lifecycle model consists of six phases with arrows indicating the most important and frequent dependencies between phases. The sequence of the phases is not strict. In fact, most projects move back and forth between phases as necessary. It starts with business understanding, and then moves to data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment. The CRISP-DM model is flexible and can be customized easily.\n## Buissness Understanding\n\n    Tasks:\n\n    1.Determine business objectives\n\n    2.Assess situation\n\n    3.Determine data mining goals\n\n    4.Produce project plan\n\n## Data Understanding\n     Tasks:\n\n    1.Collect data\n\n    2.Describe data\n\n    3.Explore data    \n\n## Data Preparation\n    \n    Tasks:\n    \n    1.Data selection\n\n    2.Data preprocessing\n\n    3.Feature engineering\n\n    4.Dimensionality reduction\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Data cleaning\n\n            Data integration\n\n            Data sampling\n\n            Data dimensionality reduction\n\n            Data formatting\n\n            Data transformation\n\n            Scaling\n\n            Aggregation\n\n            Decomposition\n\n## Data Modeling :\n\nModeling is the part of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process model that i like best.

In this dataset, you are provided the sender and recipient of a transaction as well as whether transactions are tagged as fraud or not fraud. Your task is to build a fraud detection API that can be called to predict whether or not a transaction is fraudulent.\nYou can download the dataset here:https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/bannourchaker\/frauddetection\n    \nYou are expected to build a REST API that predicts whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not. You are also to assume that the previous API calls are to be stored in order to engineer\nfeatures relevant to finding fraud. The API calls will include the time step of the transaction, so you can assume that a transaction happens sequentially within the same time step.\nFor example, if I make the following transactions in the same time step:  \n    \n![image.png](attachment:c6d681b2-1201-43b2-a5cf-587bd46f7839.png)\n    \nThe first transaction is unlikely to be fraudulent, since anon is initiating a normal transfer.\nHowever, multiple successive transfers of the same amount in the same hour is potentially fraudulent, since anon\u2019s account might have been taken over by a fraudster. On the first API call,your model is unlikely to classify the transaction as fraudulent. However, on the fifth call, it\u2019s likely that it will be tagged as fraudulent.\nThe REST API only has 1 endpoint \/is-fraud that takes in a POST request:\n    \nThe body is expected to receive the following fields(which are also the fields that can be found in your dataset:\nThe following is a sample body when making a POST request to your\n    \n    \n            {\n        \"step\":1,\n        \"type\":\"PAYMENT\",\n        \"amount\":9839.64,\n        \"nameOrig\":\"C1231006815\",\n        \"oldbalanceOrig\":170136.0,\n        \"newbalanceOrig\":160296.36,\n        \"nameDest\":\"M1979787155\",\n        \"oldbalanceDest\":0.0,\n        \"newbalanceDest\":0.0\n        }\n    \n    \nYour API is expected to return a JSON object with a boolean field isFraud.

Your REST API should be public for us to call the API and evaluate the accuracy\n    of your model\n    \n    c. Given the nature of the data, your REST API will likely need to take into account\n    previous transactions, so make sure it is able to take note of transactions from\n    your training dataset as well as previous API calls.\n\n- 2.

Instead of doing k-Fold or other CV technique, you might use a random subset of your training data as a hold-out for validation purposes.\n\nFor example, Keras deep learning library allows you to pass one of two parameters for the fit function that performs training.\n\nvalidation_split: percentage of the data that should be held out for validation\nvalidation_data: a tuple of (X, y) which should be used for validation. This parameter overrides the validation_split parameter which means you can use only one of these parameters at once.\n\nThe same approach is used in official tutorials of other DL frameworks such as PyTorch and MxNet. They also suggest splitting the dataset into three parts: training, validation, and testing.\n\nTraining \u2013 a part of the dataset to train on\nValidation \u2013 a part of the dataset to validate on while training\nTesting \u2013 a part of the dataset for final validation of the model\n\nStill, you can use cross-validation in DL tasks if the dataset is tiny (contains hundreds of samples). In this case, learning a complex model might be an irrelevant task so make sure that you don\u2019t complicate the task further.\n\n**How to choose the best k for cross validation **:\n\nNote:\nLarge K value in leave one out cross-validation would result in over-fitting. Small K value in leave one out cross-validation would result in under-fitting.\n\nIf the training set is relatively small, would it be better to use a lower k?\n\nNo, it's the opposite. If the training set is small, it is better to use a larger k. This simulates having a larger training set. In the extreme case you get leave-one-out cross-validation: train on all but one of the samples, and test on that sample. Repeat for each sample.\n\nThe choice of k involves a tradeoff between efficiency and the accuracy of the error prediction. More folds reduce the bias of the estimate of the generalization error, but they take more time to compute.\n\nDepends on how much CPU juice you are willing to afford for the same. Having a lower K means less variance and thus, more bias, while having a higher K means more variance and thus, and lower bias.\n\nAlso, one should keep in mind the computational costs for the different values. High K means more folds, thus higher computational time and vice versa. So, one needs to find a sweet spot between those by doing a hyper tuning analysis.\n\nAlso, you need to keep the size of your data in mind. If your data is very less, then even using a k-fold crossval wouldn't make sense. So, you might want to use a leave-one-out CV (LOOCV). \n\n\n**Feature engineering and selection within cross-validation iterations**\n\n    Normally, feature engineering and selection occurs before cross-validation\n    Instead, perform all feature engineering and selection within each cross-validation iteration\n    More reliable estimate of out-of-sample performance since it better mimics the application of the model to out-of-sample data\n      \n\n\n\nLet's go more in depth in order to choose our CV Validation strategie. \n\n\n**How to validate a model on chronologically ordered data which also contains groups?**\n\nSince it takes quite some time to get a utility score back for our model, it would be nice to be able to 'locally' calculate an indication of a model's performance; independent of the (time expensive and limited) . This would allow for much better tuning of hyper-parameters or other aspects of the model's training process.\n\nIn this notebook I want to lay out a couple of techniques that can be used to do this. For every step we will see that there is a problem with using it for this particular Data. Fortunately we will provides a solution! .\nCredit:\n\n    Based on the great notebook: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jorijnsmit\/found-the-holy-grail-grouptimeseriessplit\n    \n\n# Create test and train groups\n\nNow we\u2019ve got our dataframe ready we can split it up into the train and test datasets for our model to use. We\u2019ll use the Scikit-Learn train_test_split() function for this. By passing in the X dataframe of raw features, the y series containing the target, and the ************size of the test group (i.e. 0.1 for 10%), we get back the X_train, X_test, y_train and y_test data to use in the model.\n\n\n   ","babc15b6":" # Baseline Pipe :\n This is  the first round to get the best preprocess steps ","27300b74":"<a id=5><\/a>\n<h3 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" style='color:white; background:#1777C4; border:0' role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\">\n<center>Evaluation<\/center><\/h3>\n\n# Model accuracy scoring\n\nThe easiest way to analyze performance is with accuracy. \nIt measures how many observations, both positive and negative, were correctly classified.\n\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t use accuracy on imbalanced problems. Then, it is easy to get a high accuracy score by simply classifying all observations as the majority class. For example in our case, by classifying all transactions as non-fraudulent we can get an accuracy of over 0.9.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    When your problem is balanced using accuracy is usually a good start. An additional benefit is that it is really easy to explain it to non-technical stakeholders in your project,\n    When every class is equally important to you.\n\n# Confusion Matrix\n\n**How to compute:**\n\nIt is a common way of presenting true positive (tp), true negative (tn), false positive (fp) and false negative (fn) predictions. Those values are presented in the form of a matrix where the Y-axis shows the true classes while the X-axis shows the predicted classes.\n\nIt is calculated on class predictions, which means the outputs from your model need to be thresholded first.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    Pretty much always. I like to see the nominal values rather than normalized to get a feeling on how the model is doing on different, often imbalanced, classes.\n\n\n\n# ROC Curve\n\n\nIt is a chart that visualizes the tradeoff between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). Basically, for every threshold, we calculate TPR and FPR and plot it on one chart.\n\nOf course, the higher TPR and the lower FPR is for each threshold the better and so classifiers that have curves that are more top-left side are better.\n\nSince we have an imbalanced data set, Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves are not that useful although it's an expected output of most binary classifiers.\nBecause you can generate a pretty good-looking curve by just simply guessing each one is the non-fraud case.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    You should use it when you ultimately care about ranking predictions and not necessarily about outputting well-calibrated probabilities (read this article by Jason Brownlee if you want to learn about probability calibration).\n    You should not use it when your data is heavily imbalanced. It was discussed extensively in this article by Takaya Saito and Marc Rehmsmeier. The intuition is the following: false positive rate for highly imbalanced datasets is pulled down due to a large number of true negatives.\n    You should use it when you care equally about positive and negative classes.. If we care about true negatives as much as we care about true positives then it totally makes sense to use ROC AUC.\n    \n# ROC AUC score   \nAUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0 classes as 0 and 1 classes as 1. By analogy, the Higher the AUC, the better the model is at distinguishing between patients with the disease and no disease. The ROC curve is plotted with TPR against the FPR where TPR is on the y-axis and FPR is on the x-axis.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    You should use it when you ultimately care about ranking predictions and not necessarily about outputting well-calibrated probabilities (read this article by Jason Brownlee if you want to learn about probability calibration).\n    You should not use it when your data is heavily imbalanced. It was discussed extensively in this article by Takaya Saito and Marc Rehmsmeier. The intuition is the following: false positive rate for highly imbalanced datasets is pulled down due to a large number of true negatives.\n    You should use it when you care equally about positive and negative classes. It naturally extends the imbalanced data discussion from the last section. If we care about true negatives as much as we care about true positives then it totally makes sense to use ROC AUC.\n\n# Recall    \nIt measures how many observations out of all positive observations have we classified as positive. It tells us how many fraudulent transactions we recalled from all fraudulent transactions.\ntrue positive rate\n\nWhen you are optimizing recall you want to put all guilty in prison.\n**When to use it:**\n\n    Usually, you will not use it alone but rather coupled with other metrics like precision.\n    That being said, recall is a go-to metric, when you really care about catching all fraudulent transactions even at a cost of false alerts. Potentially it is cheap for you to process those alerts and very expensive when the transaction goes unseen.\n    \n# Precision\n\nIt measures how many observations predicted as positive are in fact positive. Taking our fraud detection example, it tells us what is the ratio of transactions correctly classified as fraudulent.\npositive predictive value\n\nWhen you are optimizing precision you want to make sure that people that you put in prison are guilty. \n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    Again, it usually doesn\u2019t make sense to use it alone but rather coupled with other metrics like recall.\n    When raising false alerts is costly, when you want all the positive predictions to be worth looking at you should optimize for precision.\n    \n\n\n**Precision vs. Recall for Imbalanced Classification:**\n\nYou may decide to use precision or recall on your imbalanced classification problem.\n\nMaximizing precision will minimize the number false positives, whereas maximizing the recall will minimize the number of false negatives.\n\n    Precision: Appropriate when minimizing false positives is the focus.\n    Recall: Appropriate when minimizing false negatives is the focus.\n\nSometimes, we want excellent predictions of the positive class. We want high precision and high recall.\n\nThis can be challenging, as often increases in recall often come at the expense of decreases in precision.\n\n    In imbalanced datasets, the goal is to improve recall without hurting precision. These goals, however, are often conflicting, since in order to increase the TP for the minority class, the number of FP is also often increased, resulting in reduced precision.\n    \n    \n# PR AUC score | Average precision\n\nSimilarly to ROC AUC score you can calculate the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve to get one number that describes model performance.\n\nYou can also think about PR AUC as the average of precision scores calculated for each recall threshold [0.0, 1.0]. You can also adjust this definition to suit your business needs by choosing\/clipping recall thresholds if needed.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    when you want to communicate precision\/recall decision to other stakeholders\n    when you want to choose the threshold that fits the business problem.\n    when your data is heavily imbalanced. As mentioned before, it was discussed extensively in this article by Takaya Saito and Marc Rehmsmeier. The intuition is the following: since PR AUC focuses mainly on the positive class (PPV and TPR) it cares less about the frequent negative class.\n    when you care more about positive than negative class. If you care more about the positive class and hence PPV and TPR you should go with Precision-Recall curve and PR AUC (average precision).\n    \n# F beta score\n\nSimply put, it combines precision and recall into one metric. The higher the score the better our model is. You can calculate it in the following way:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen choosing beta in your F-beta score the more you care about recall over precision the higher beta you should choose. For example, with F1 score we care equally about recall and precision with F2 score, recall is twice as important to us.\nF beta by beta\n\nWith 0<beta<1 we care more about precision and so the higher the threshold the higher the F beta score. When beta>1 our optimal threshold moves toward lower thresholds and with beta=1 it is somewhere in the middle.  \n\n**When to use it:**\n\n    Pretty much in every binary classification problem. It is my go-to metric when working on those problems. It can be easily explained to business stakeholders.\n    \n for more details see this article:[https:\/\/neptune.ai\/blog\/evaluation-metrics-binary-classification](http:\/\/)    \n \n==>Complete evaluation will be done when we train the model on all data that we have and with the best tuned model.","e5b739a0":"Let's get the result : \n\n    fold 1 : training [1 2 3 4 5], test [6]\n    fold 2 : training [1 2 3 4 6], test [5]\n    fold 3 : training [1 2 3 5 6], test [4]\n    fold 4 : training [1 2 4 5 6], test [3]\n    fold 5 : training [1 3 4 5 6], test [2]\n    fold 6 : training [2 3 4 5 6], test [1].\n    \nAs we see this is a big problem  \n\nIn other words, our model has been trained using information which wasn't yet available at the time of the validation set. **This is clear leakage**; we are predicting the past with knowledge from the future. But our aim is to predict data in the future! This problem has already been addressed by scikit-learn in the form of TimeSeriesSplit. \n\nWhen dealing with time series data, traditional cross-validation (like k-fold) should not be used for two reasons:\n\n1. Temporal Dependencies.\n\n2. Arbitrary Choice of Test Set.\n\n\n**TimeSeriesSplit:**\n\nAn approach that's sometimes more principled for time series is forward chaining, where your procedure would be something like this:\n\n    fold 1 : training [1], test [2]\n    fold 2 : training [1 2], test [3]\n    fold 3 : training [1 2 3], test [4]\n    fold 4 : training [1 2 3 4], test [5]\n    fold 5 : training [1 2 3 4 5], test [6]\n\n\nThe method I use for cross-validating my time-series model is cross-validation on a rolling basis. Start with a small subset of data for training purpose, forecast for the later data points and then checking the accuracy for the forecasted data points. The same forecasted data points are then included as part of the next training dataset and subsequent data points are forecasted.\n\nTo make things intuitive, here is an image for same:\n\n![image.png](attachment:0255116a-7dd5-4171-8436-edab7989b742.png)\n","614fc540":"But what is the problem this time? TimeSeriesSplit does not respect the groups available in the data. Although not clearly visible in this plot, we can imagine that a group can partially fall in the training set and partially in the test set.\n\n\n\nAlready in the first split we can see data from step 96 present in both the training and test set. That would mean that we are training on half of the transactions of a certain step, just to validate their performance on the other half of the transactions  of that step. What we of course want is to train on all transactions  of a particular step, and to validate them on the step that follows! **Otherwise again leaking will occur**.\n# GroupKFold:\n\n","4269e640":"\n## Step 2: Load the data\nComplete guid to read data : \nNext, we'll load the training and test data.","79761c09":" Chronological order is maintained and group separation is respected!","37e71751":"# check that we have all column","9239357e":"# Convert Dtypes :","7894bc57":"# Introduction \n    \nDue to rapid growth in field of cashless or digital \ntransactions, credit cards are widely used in all \naround the world.
