Unfortunatly, I did not think to download it and save it myself.  Thus I rebuilt this book based on the completely pretrained model in transformers.

This gave us a good start point for improving the already well-working Question Answering tool for the COVID challenge.\n\nIn addition, credit for setting up the Anserini + BERT framework goes to [Jimmy Lin](https:\/\/cs.uwaterloo.ca\/~jimmylin\/), Edwin Zhang, and Nikhil Gupta at the University of Waterloo.\nThanks also to [Wonjin Yoon et al.](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1909.08229) for creating and proving the pre-trained BIOASQ model. \n\n## Findings & Results\n\n * In general, the Question Answering results differ only slightly. It is hard for non-experts to determine which results answer a question more accurately. The resulting abstractive summary can be used to see the slight differences on a quick glance.\n * The exact same answer (including span section) is often returned. The resulting confidence is then also the same, as this confidence is computed in both cases using the Universal Sentence Encoder.\n * In other cases, either a complete new result is returned or a result where only the span sections differ. These cases are the ones where the BioASQ model answered a question differently than the BERT-SQuAD. \n\n\n### Example Query - How long is the incubation period for the virus?\n\n#### BioASQ

2 (sars-cov-2), has caused a large outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) in wuhan, china since december 2019. based on the publicly available surveillance data, we identified 21 transmission chains in hong kong and estimated the serial interval (si) of covid-19. methods : index cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. an interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit a gamma distribution function to govern the si of covid-19. findings : assuming a gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of si at 4. 4 days (95 % ci : 2. 9&#226;&#710;&#8217;6. 7) and sd of si at 3. 0 days (95 % ci : 1. 8&#226;&#710;&#8217;5. 8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in hong kong. conclusion : the si of covid-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. given the likelihood that si could be shorter than the incubation period<\/font> , pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the covid-19 outbreak.<\/div><\/td>\n      <td><a
