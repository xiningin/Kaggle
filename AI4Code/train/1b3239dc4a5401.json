If implemented, it can help e.g. to detect sentences that users forgot to finish, or that leave too much room for interpretation. In many applications, this can help tremendously to clean your text data.\n\nWith this dataset, you can build a classification model for such a task.\n\n## The dataset\nEach item consists of a sentence and its target is_finished. Your goal is to predict whether a sentence is finished or not, e.g.:\n\nfinished: \"Kaggle is such a great platform, where Data Scientists from all over the world can share their ideas and data!\"\nnot finished: \"I believe that we should just\" [\u2026 just what?]\n\n## Getting Started\nOur JSON file is records-oriented, so we can easily load it using Pandas","f41e7ddf":"---\n### Your part\nI'm looking forward to the kind of solutions you come up with!","89825398":"Let's look at some examples for unfinished sentences.","747deffb":"And, of course, finished sentences:","3595852f":"Oh, this already seems like a great feature!

Of course, our sentences are much shorter. So can we just implement a simple rule for this?"}}
