Or maybe China has not shared their stats related to how much of their population is vaccinated. \n\nWhat's important to note is that as we've seen above that China has more 'Doses administered per 100 people' which misleads us that 0% of their population is vaccinated and this is further confirmed by the 'Total doses administered' column where China has a higher number.\n\nAs all other countries except China in the column above are African, these countries do not have enough facilities to push the vaccination process forward, so are still far behind most countries\n\nSerria Leone has no track of their population partially vaccinated but yet manages to get 2.9 doses administered per 100 people\n\n\"Sierra Leone has today received the second batch of 96,000 doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine donated by France and delivered by UNICEF through the COVAX Facility\" according to this news site: https:\/\/www.africanews.com\/2021\/08\/09\/coronavirus-sierra-leone-welcomes-the-arrival-of-covid-19-vaccines-shipped-via-covax-facility\/\n. As of now there is an increase in the number of COVID cases over there, and this is due to less availability of vaccinations accross the country\n\nHungary as we've seen before has no values for doses but still shows a higher % of vaccinated population.\n\nPakistan shows 0% partially vaccinated but 3% fully vaccinated population, according to this post:\nhttps:\/\/www.business-standard.com\/article\/current-affairs\/only-3-5-of-pakistan-s-population-vaccinated-against-covid-so-far-report-121070700081_1.html\nThere is a 14% partially vaccinated population in Pakistan","e5025f6c":"**1.

And based on this it should have a higher percentage of vaccinated population.
