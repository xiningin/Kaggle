Therefore from above plot we can see that production number of cars produced are more from **Hyundai Manufacturer** followed by **Toyota Manufacturer** till Volkswagen from first 10 most manufactured brands.","33384df5":"The above plot shows that most cars manufactured or used are of fuel type **\"Petrol\"**.The reason behind usage of more petrol cars is that these cars are cheaper and can be easily converted to **CNG** fuel type.","0530b3bc":"The above plot shows that car colors used mostly are **Black,White,Silver,Grey** because of the fact **White, Black, Grey and Silver 'go with everything,'** and are available on virtually every vehicle. The colors also don't go out of style, unlike some wild choices which might hurt resale values down the road.","279fc0fa":"From above countplot we can conclude that **most of Sedans and Jeeps have Leather interior** in them.But we can also see that categories like **Microbus,Goods Wagon doesn't have Leather interiors**.","6af9cb51":"The above plot shows us production of cars in respective years from about 1965 to 2020. Therefore from above plot we can see that production number of cars produced **increases after year 2008**.","a199dbb3":"The above plot shows us that different categories demands different gear shift box as per usage.We can clearly see that **Jeep,Hatchback,Sedan Categories Uses Automatic the Most** whereas **Microbus,Goods Wagon Categories Used Manual Shifting the most** .","28cdb9ad":"The above plot shows that most of cars have **Front Drive Wheels** in it i.e **66.92%** of cars. Since the weight of the engine is located over the driving wheels, a FWD(Front Wheel Drive) vehicle can maintain better traction in the difficult or tough areas.","ea5afd9f":"The above plot shows that most of cars contains **4.0 cylinders** ","9bb0b6f0":"Our above output shows that production by **Manufacturers Hyundai and Toyota are almost same** showing great love from citizens towards these brands.","b055c3c0":"The above plot shows category of cars loved most between past years is **Sedan**. As Sedans provide better mileage and are more fuel and consequently cost-effective than other Categories. An average sedan can be approximately 30% to 40% more fuel-efficient than another categories.","e25727ad":"The above plot shows that most of cars have **Four Airbags** or **Twelve Airbags**.Moreover Airbags is to provide a vehicle occupant with a soft cushioning and restraint during a collision. It can reduce injuries between the flailing occupant and the interior of the vehicle.","b9ca9ef8":"Above output shows us that all our dataset does not contain any row or column value empty.","426b334a":"From above countplot we can conclude that most of **Jeeps have 4x4 Drive Wheels** as these 4x4 wheels are excellent for offroad drive while mostly **Sedans have Front Drive Wheels** as sedans are used mostly for daily routine usage or for luxorious drive.","162d4a7f":"On comparing price hike for these brands over years, we found that **price of Cars from Toyota remains somehow constant** but **price of cars from Hyundai increased too much after year 2015**.","83e7a83e":"The above plot shows that **price of Goods Wagon is higher** than every category as Goods Wagon require tough material and good built quality for transportation.

Leather interior is offered by manufacturers as it gives a very lush feel and look to a vehicle .Moreover Leather interiors are much easier to clean and very stain-resistant. Leather seats are also resistant to smells that can come with stains and the passengers who cause them.","a45194ca":"The above plot shows that most of these car models contains **Automatic Gear Box type**. **Automatic Gears** greatly reduced the risk of stalling and are easier to use especially in heavy traffic.Moreover these provide accurate and effortless shifting of gears with no clutch replacement cost.\nAlso the plot shows that people nowerdays are becoming even lazier to shift gears!! ","176d1fec":"The above plot shows us that most of these categories used **Petrol or Disesel as Fuel Type** We can clearly see that  **Microbus,Goods Wagon Categories Uses Diesel most** showing that other Fuel Types like **Plug-in-Hybrid,LPG,Hydrogen as useless fuel types**. ","d444680f":"The above plot shows **Engine Volume '2'** of cars is used most than **Engine Volume '2.0 turbo'**."}}
