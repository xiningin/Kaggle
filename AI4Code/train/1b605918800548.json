The above diamond has a height of 10. Here's a 4-line diamond:\n\n```\n \/\\ \n\/\/\\\\\n\\\\\/\/\n \\\/ \n```\n\n(You can assume your function will only be called with even numbers)","1cb96ec3":"We've provided an example height-4 diamond below as a Python string.

For example, if she were looking for the keyword \u201cclosed\u201d, you would not include the string \u201cenclosed.\u201d \n- She does not want you to distinguish upper case from lower case letters. So the phrase \u201cClosed the case.\u201d would be included when the keyword is \u201cclosed\u201d\n- Do not let periods or commas affect what is matched. \u201cIt is closed.\u201d would be included when the keyword is \u201cclosed\u201d.

Analyze a list containing a history of roulette spins. \n\nReturn a dictionary where the keys are numbers on the roulette wheel, and the values are dictionaries mapping numbers on the wheel to probabilities, such that `d[n1][n2]` is an estimate of the probability that the next spin will land on n2, given that the previous spin landed on n1."}}
