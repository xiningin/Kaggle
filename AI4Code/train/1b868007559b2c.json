Vaccines are one of the notable contributions of science to humanity. When living in a pandemic affected era, the majority of people realizes how vital is the vaccine. At the same, some people believe vaccines are against their personal beliefs or are part of conspiracy theories. Accessibility to technology and the social network made it easy for anti-vaccine propaganda generators to preach their philosophy. Surprisingly they made some impressions, and some of the developing countries and developed countries suffered a lot. Measles outbreak happened in 2020 in the USA is one of the recent examples. Alec Helyar, a Kaggler and his collaborators, created a data-set from various social media sites. The current work is an attempt to explore the language and the medium of AntiVaxx propaganda. "}}
