By default, python shows you only the top 5 records.\n2. The shape attribute show the number of rows and columns that are available in the Netflix dataset. I bascially use it to check the dimensions(size) of the dataframe. The netflix dataset has 8807 rows(records) and 12 clomuns which are the headers display in the head function output.\n3. info() is used to check the Information about the data and the datatypes of each respective column. Looking at the data in the head function and in info, I see that the release_year column is the only int64 data type and the rest are objects.\n4. Since release_year column is the only column with numerical values its the only column with an output. As we can see 1925(min) is the earliest relaese year of a movie or a Tv Show and we have the latest(max) release year being 2021.","b4f0859d":"### Sandile D.
