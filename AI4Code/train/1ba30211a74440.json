On the other hand, research and Development have the least attrition rates, which suggests the stability and content of the department, as can be seen from the chart above(13.83%).","373f7948":"**Observation:** We have seen people are more prone to leave the organization in the starting years of their role. When people are in the same position for an extended period, they tend to stay longer to move upward.","a08ae460":"**HR Analytics**\n\nDefinition HR analytics is the process of collecting and analyzing Human Resource (HR) data in order to improve an organization\u2019s workforce performance. The process can also be referred to as talent analytics, people analytics, or even workforce analytics. This method of data analysis takes data that is routinely collected by HR and correlates it to HR and organizational objectives. Doing so provides measured evidence of how HR initiatives are contributing to the organization\u2019s goals and strategies.\n\nNeed of HR Analytics Most organizations already have data that is routinely collected, so why the need for a specialized form of analytics? Can HR not simply look at the data they already have? Unfortunately, raw data on its own cannot actually provide any useful insight. It would be like looking at a large spreadsheet full of numbers and words. Once organized, compared and analyzed, this raw data provides useful insight.They can help answer questions like:\n\n* What patterns can be revealed in employee turnover?\n* How long does it take to hire employees?\n* What amount of investment is needed to get employees up to a fully productive speed?\n* Which of our employees are most likely to leave within the year?\n* Are learning and development initiatives having an impact on employee performance?\n\n**The process of HR Analytics**\n\nHR Analytics is made up of several components that feed into each other.\n\n* To gain the problem-solving insights that HR Analytics promises, data must first be collected.\n* The data then needs to be monitored and measured against other data, such as historical information, norms or averages.\n* This helps identify trends or patterns. It is at this point that the results can be analyzed at the analytical stage.\n* The final step is to apply insight to organizational decisions.\n","f2c0fc43":"***Age***","8a13d7bc":"***Are managers a reason of people resigning?***","436bb2f8":"**Observation:** We notice 3 significant spikes in the attrition rate when we analyse an employee's relationship with their manager. At the very start, where the time spent with the manager is relatively more minor- people tend to leave their jobs- considering their relationship with their previous managers. Then, at an average span of 2 years, when employees feel they need an improvement, they also tend to go for a change. Finally, when the time spent with the manager is slightly higher (about 7 years)- people tend to find their career progression stagnant and go for a change. But when the relative time spent with a manager is very high- people are satisfied with their work. Hence the chances of an employee resigning then are significantly low.","3543c747":"**Observation:** People with poor levels of Work-life balance have adjusted themselves to their jobs, but as seen for the above parameters with a better work-life score, people are more accustomed to the better life and want to go for attrition more. But this trend perishes when the work-life balance is perfect and people are satisfied with the work they are doing","79190099":"**We have checked the data and have come upon to infer the following observations:**\n\n* People tend to switch to different jobs at the start of their careers or the earlier parts. Once they have settled with a family or have found stability in their jobs, they tend to stay long in the same organization- only going for vertical movements in the same organization.\n* Salary and stock options greatly motivate the employees, and people tend to leave the organization much less. In addition, higher pay and more stock options have seen more employees remain loyal to their company.\n* Work-life balance is a significant motivating factor for the employees. However, people with an excellent work-life balance tend to switch in search of better opportunities and a better standard of living.\n* Departments where target meeting performance is very much crucial (e.g. Sales) tend to have a greater chance of leaving the organization as compared to departments with more administration perspective (E.g. Human Resources)\n* People with reasonable Job Satisfaction and Environment satisfaction are loyal to the organization- and this speaks loud for any Organization. However, people who are not satisfied with their current project- tend to leave the organization far more.\n\n**Some highlights on the data:**\n\n* Cleanest data source I have seen to date. Kudos to the creator. It was elementary to start the analysis.\n* The data is not very extended. Only three departments have been presented. It would be better to have more departments and information regarding other organizations to study the pattern more distinctly.","87bbe6c8":"Let's try to predict for all the given inputs; how accurately can we predict whether an employee will be staying in the organization or resigning from it.\n\nAlgorithm applied: Logistic Regression.","9cdd62fd":"**Observation:** With increasing job satisfaction, the attrition rates decrease, as seen in the chart above. Also, from the range 1-2 range, we can infer (as seen above in Environment Satisfaction), the attrition level falls but rises from 2-3, where the people tend to choose better opportunities.","a775aabb":"**Observations:** As seen from the chart above, clearly, employees who started their career with the company- or have switched to the company in the initial years of their career, have a higher chance of leaving the organization to a different company.
