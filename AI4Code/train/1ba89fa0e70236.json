Changes in barometric pressure will cause water levels in some wells penetrating confined or semi-confined aquifers to change. The relationship is inverse. An increase in air pressure will cause water level in the well to fall, and a decrease in air pressure will cause water-level in the well to rise. \n4. <strong><em>Aquifer Deformation.<\/em><\/strong> Water-level changes due to aquifer deformation are commonly due to either Earth tides, or earthquakes.
