This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations.

Essentially, we want to turn the recommendation problem into an optimization problem. We can view it as how good we are in predicting the rating for items given a user. One common metric is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). **The lower the RMSE, the better the performance**.\n\nNow talking about latent factor you might be wondering what is it ?It is a broad idea which describes a property or concept that a user or an item have. For instance, for music, latent factor can refer to the genre that the music belongs to. SVD decreases the dimension of the utility matrix by extracting its latent factors. Essentially, we map each user and each item into a latent space with dimension r. Therefore, it helps us better understand the relationship between users and items as they become directly comparable. The below figure illustrates this idea.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*GUw90kG2ltTd2k_iv3Vo0Q.png)","c665358b":"So, the mean rating for all the movies is approx 6 on a scale of 10.The next step is to determine an appropriate value for m, the minimum votes required to be listed in the chart.

These are the following steps we'll follow :-\n* Get the index of the movie given its title.\n* Get the list of cosine similarity scores for that particular movie with all movies.

Different scores work well in different scenarios and it is often a good idea to experiment with different metrics.\n\nWe will be using the cosine similarity to calculate a numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies.

*  **Collaborative Filtering**- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.","c68f6d1a":"There are basically three types of recommender systems:-\n\n> *  **Demographic Filtering**- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and\/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n\n","73ac0d0c":"# **The Age of Recommender Systems**","23e406f7":"Since we have used the TF-IDF vectorizer, calculating the dot product will directly give us the cosine similarity score. Therefore, we will use sklearn's **linear_kernel()** instead of cosine_similarities() since it is faster.","2b234a01":"# **Collaborative Filtering**\n\nOur content based engine suffers from some severe limitations. It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.\n\nAlso, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who she\/he is.\n\nTherefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers.\nIt is basically of two types:-\n\n*  **User based filtering**-  These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity.\nThis filtering technique can be illustrated with an example. In the following matrixes, each row represents a user, while the columns correspond to different movies except the last one which records the similarity between that user and the target user. Each cell represents the rating that the user gives to that movie. Assume user E is the target.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*9NBFo4AUQABKfoUOpE3F8Q.png)\n\nSince user A and F do not share any movie ratings in common with user E, their similarities with user E are not defined in Pearson Correlation. Therefore, we only need to consider user B, C, and D. Based on Pearson Correlation, we can compute the following similarity.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*jZIMJzKM1hKTFftHfcSxRw.png)\n\nFrom the above table we can see that user D is very different from user E as the Pearson Correlation between them is negative. He rated Me Before You higher than his rating average, while user E did the opposite. Now, we can start to fill in the blank for the movies that user E has not rated based on other users.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*9TC6BrfxYttJwiATFAIFBg.png)\n\nAlthough computing user-based CF is very simple, it suffers from several problems. One main issue is that users\u2019 preference can change over time. It indicates that precomputing the matrix based on their neighboring users may lead to bad performance. To tackle this problem, we can apply item-based CF.\n\n* **Item Based Collaborative Filtering** - Instead of measuring the similarity between users, the item-based CF recommends items based on their similarity with the items that the target user rated. Likewise, the similarity can be computed with Pearson Correlation or Cosine Similarity. The major difference is that, with item-based collaborative filtering, we fill in the blank vertically, as oppose to the horizontal manner that user-based CF does. The following table shows how to do so for the movie Me Before You.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*LqFnWb-cm92HoMYBL840Ew.png)\n\nIt successfully avoids the problem posed by dynamic user preference as item-based CF is more static. However, several problems remain for this method. First, the main issue is ***scalability***. The computation grows with both the customer and the product. The worst case complexity is O(mn) with m users and n items. In addition, ***sparsity*** is another concern. Take a look at the above table again. Although there is only one user that rated both Matrix and Titanic rated, the similarity between them is 1. In extreme cases, we can have millions of users and the similarity between two fairly different movies could be very high simply because they have similar rank for the only user who ranked them both.\n\n","eadfef20":"## **Plot description based Recommender**\n\nWe will compute pairwise similarity scores for all movies based on their plot descriptions and recommend movies based on that similarity score. The plot description is given in the **overview** feature of our dataset. \nLet's take a look...","1283cd8d":"# **Demographic Filtering** -\n   Before getting started with this  -\n* we need a metric to score or rate movie \n* Calculate the score for every movie \n* Sort the scores and recommend the best rated movie to the users.\n\nWe can use the average ratings of the movie as the score but using this won't be fair enough since a movie with 8.9 average rating and only 3 votes cannot be considered better than the movie with 7.8 as as average rating but 40 votes.\nSo, I'll be using IMDB's weighted rating (wr) which is given as :-\n\n![](https:\/\/image.ibb.co\/jYWZp9\/wr.png)\nwhere,\n* v is the number of votes for the movie;\n* m is the minimum votes required to be listed in the chart;\n* R is the average rating of the movie; And\n* C is the mean vote across the whole report\n\nWe already have v(**vote_count**) and R (**vote_average**) and C can be calculated as ","a8906484":"**So let's go!**","c593e532":"Now something to keep in mind is that these demographic recommender provide a general chart of recommended movies to all the users.

","480d841b":"They are used to predict the **rating** or **preference** that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. \nMoreover,  companies like Netflix and Spotify  depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and sucees.","cb9f32a8":"We see that our recommender has been successful in capturing more information due to more metadata and has given us (arguably) better recommendations. It is more likely that Marvels or DC comics fans will like the movies of the same production house.
