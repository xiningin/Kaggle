perception of details of objects in front of you. On the images it appears as a dark spot somewhere near the center. <br>\nMacular degeneration is a medical condition which typically occurs in older people and may result in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field. While it does not result in complete blindness, loss of central vision can make it hard to recognize faces, drive, read, or perform other activities of daily life. <br><br>\nThere are two types of AMD (two characteristic appearances on the images): One form is known as \u201cdry\u201d (most common) and the other is \u201cwet\u201d (severe form). <br>\n\n* In the **dry** form, there is an atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) in the macula. These RPE cells are light sensitive and contain hundreds of photoreceptors. It is characterized by the presence of drusen (dots of yellow crystalline deposits that develop within the macula) and thinning of the macula. <br>\n* With the **wet** form, the membrane underlying the retina thickens, then breaks. The oxygen supply to the macula is disrupted and the body responds by growing new, abnormal blood vessels. These begin to grow through the breaks of the membrane behind the retina towards the macula, often raising the retina. These abnormal blood vessels tend to be very fragile. They often grow, leak or bleed, causing scarring of the macula. This damage to the macula results in rapid central vision loss.
