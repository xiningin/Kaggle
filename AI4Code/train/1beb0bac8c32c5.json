the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.","0ea6f831":"A friend told me that he has noticed that the length of Netflix movies are getting shorter over time. He sent me a list of observations that contains lenght averages over the years. We'll use to it start our analysis. ","4311cb21":"##### Digging deeper\n<p>This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades.<\/p>\n<p>Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Let's filter our DataFrame for movies with a <code>duration<\/code> under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average.<\/p>","4024f466":"Each observation is classified into one of the following genres: Drama, Comedy, Documentary, Action and Internacional Tv","6df12003":"Of the 7787 observations, we have an average of 69 minutes (1h09), the minimum value is 1 minute while the maximum value is 312 minutes (5h12).

But equipped only with our friend's aggregations, we're limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What does this trend look like over a longer period of time?<\/li>\n<li>Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Upon asking our friend for the original CSV he used to perform his analyses, he gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at this directory <code>\"netflix_data.csv\"<\/code>. Let's create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. <\/p>\n"}}
