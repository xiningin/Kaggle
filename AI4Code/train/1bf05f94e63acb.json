The data is only of the actual revenue generation and not at bid level. The dataset has the following columns:\n\n1. **date**\n1. **site_id** : each id denotes a different website\n1. **ad_type_id** : each id denotes a different ad_type. These can be display ads , video ads, text ads etc\n1. **geo_id** : each id denotes a different country. our maximum traffic is from english speaking countries\n1. **device_category_id** : each id denoted a different device_category like desktop , mobile, tablet\n1. **advertiser_id** : each id denotes a different bidder in the auction\n1. **order_id** : can be ignored\n1. **line_item_type_id** : can be ignored\n1. **os_id** : each id denotes a different operating system for mobile device category only (android , ios etc) . for all other device categories, osid will correspond to not_mobile\n1. **integration_type_id** : it describes how the demand partner is setup within a publisher's ecosystem - can be adserver (running through the publisher adserver) or hardcoded\n1. **monetization_channel_id** : it describes the mode through which demand partner integrates with a particular publisher - it can be header bidding (running via prebid.js), dynamic allocation, exchange bidding, direct etc\n1. **ad_unit_id** - each id denotes a different ad unit (one page can have more than one ad units)\n1. **total_impressions** - measurement column measuring the impressions for the particular set of dimensions\n1. **total_revenue** - measurement column measuring the revenue for the particular set of dimensions\n1. **viewable_impressions** - Number of impressions on the site that were viewable out of all measurable impressions. A display ad is counted as viewable if at least 50% of its area was displayed on screen for at least one second\n1. **measurable_impressions** - Impressions that were measurable by Active View out of the total number of eligible impressions. This value should generally be close to 100%. For example, an impression that is rendering in a cross-domain iframe may not be measurable.\n1. **revenue_share_percent** - not every advertiser gives all the revenue to the publisher. They charge a certain share for the services they provide. This captures the fraction of revenue that will actually reach the publishers pocket."}}
