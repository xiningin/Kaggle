Population adjusted we thus expect this to be a smaller difference.\nThere are also a limited number of AEs with Unknown Manufacturer, but it is unclear to me where these come from.","6c7c3c03":"Note that the below count is not population-adjust, so although California currently has the most AE's this could simply be due to more percent of people already vaccined or due to more people in the state in general.\nThe distribution of manufacturers does seem to be similar across states at this moment."}}
