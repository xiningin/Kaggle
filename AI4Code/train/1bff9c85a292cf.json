Let's check if there is any relationship between the toxic comments and the size of the comments.","275b115c":"<a id=\"id1\"><\/a> <br> \n# **1. Problem Definition:** \n\nWhen the Conversation AI team first built toxicity models, they found that the models incorrectly learned to associate the names of frequently attacked identities with toxicity. Models predicted a high likelihood of toxicity for comments containing those identities (e.g. \"gay\"), even when those comments were not actually toxic (such as \"I am a gay woman\"). This happens because training data was pulled from available sources where, unfortunately, certain identities are overwhelmingly referred to in offensive ways. Training a model from data with these imbalances risks simply mirroring those biases back to users.\n\nIn this competition, our challenge is to build a model that recognizes toxicity and minimizes this type of unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities.","01926b23":"Let's take a look at the number of words in the attribute **comment_text**.","5167247d":"# Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification\n<h5>Detect toxicity across a diverse range of conversations<\/h5>\n<h3> Kernel description: <\/h3>\nIn this competition the intention is to detect toxic comments and minimize unintended model bias, for that we to optimize a metric designed to measure unintended bias\n","136d6faa":"<a id=\"id2\"><\/a> <br> \n# **2. Data Background:** \nAt the end of 2017 the Civil Comments platform shut down and chose make their ~2m public comments from their platform available in a lasting open archive so that researchers could understand and improve civility in online conversations for years to come. Jigsaw sponsored this effort and extended annotation of this data by human raters for various toxic conversational attributes.\n\nIn the data supplied for this competition, the text of the individual comment is found in the comment_text column. Each comment in Train has a toxicity label (**target**), and models should predict the **target toxicity** for the Test data. This attribute (and all others) are fractional values which represent the fraction of human raters who believed the attribute applied to the given comment.\n\n** Very Importante! **\n<p style=\"color:red;\">For evaluation, test set examples with target >= 0.5 will be considered to be in the positive class (toxic).<\/p>\n\nThe data also has several additional toxicity subtype attributes.
