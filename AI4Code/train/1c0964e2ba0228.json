This is due to the government policies of lockdown to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Most learners opted for remote learning, thereby, increasing the engagement index.\n* In July, there is decrease in engagement index across all the states. This was due to the pause of learning for holiday.\n* In August, learning resumes and the engagement index started increasing across the states.\n* From 19th December, there is a gradual decrease in engagement index, meaning the learning are breaking for Christmas holiday.\n\nOther specific details will still be drawn from the chart as I continue with analysis."}}
