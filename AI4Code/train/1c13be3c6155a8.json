FUS variants are associated with early onset and juvenile ALS . FUS-ALS is characterized by pathological FUS aggregation, generally reported to occur only in patients with pathogenic variants in the FUS gene. TDP-43 aggregation is not commonly seen in FUS-ALS patients suggesting that the FUS disease pathway is independent of TDP-43.\"\n\n\"FUS encodes a ubiquitously expressed 526 amino acid protein belonging to the FET family of RNA binding proteins. FUS is predominantly localized to the nucleus under normal physiological conditions but crosses over to the cytoplasm, functioning in nucleocytoplasmic transport . FUS shares many physiological roles with TDP-43; playing a role in several aspects of gene expression including transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, RNA transport and translation regulation . Although they share many similarities, TDP-43 and FUS regulate different RNA targets and show different sequence binding specificity. Additionally, FUS is involved in DNA repair mechanisms including both homologous recombination during DNA double-strand break repair and in non-homologous end joining . FUS also plays a role in the formation of paraspeckles providing cellular defense against various types of stress.\"\n\n\"Over 50 autosomal dominant FUS variants have now been identified in ALS patients.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6909825\/","79eea573":"#TDP-43\n\n\"Histological examinations of spinal cord samples had revealed that neuronal cytoplasmic ubiquitinated inclusions were present in the majority of ALS patients. In 2006, a shift in the understanding of ALS pathogenesis occurred with the discovery that the main component of the ubiquitinated protein aggregates found in sALS patients was TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Further histological studies have since confirmed that TDP-43 is present in the cytoplasmic aggregates of the majority of ALS patients including sporadic cases without pathogenic variants in the TARDBP gene, and in those with C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions . The aggregation of TDP-43 in ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions in the brain and spinal cord is now considered a pathological hallmark of ALS.\"\n\n\"TDP-43 is a DNA\/RNA binding protein composed of 414 amino acids, encoded by the TARDBP gene. Although usually concentrated in the nucleus, TDP-43 contains both a nuclear localization signal and a nuclear export signal and shuttles back and forth between the nucleus and cytoplasm . TDP-43 functions as a regulator of gene expression and is involved in several RNA processing steps with roles in pre-mRNA splicing, regulation of mRNA stability, mRNA transport, translation, and the regulation of non-coding RNAs.\"\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6909825\/","e60d7fb6":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Molecular Approaches to Treat ALS<\/h1>\n\n\"RNA targeted therapeutics have entered a new phase of growth with the two main strategies investigated being short interfering RNA (siRNA) and antisense oligonucleotides (AOs). siRNA are double-stranded RNA molecules that can be used to downregulate the expression of target genes to which they are complementary through interactions with the RNA-induced silencing complex. Although there have been several preclinical investigations on the use of siRNA to target ALS genes, none have yet reached clinical trials. The review focuses on potential AO therapeutics for ALS. AOs are short, single-stranded nucleic acids that can bind to RNA through Watson-Crick base pairing and can alter gene expression through several different mechanisms. They can be used to restore or reduce protein expression or to modify protein isoform production through splice switching strategies.\"\n\n\"Therapeutic use of many RNA analog drugs has been slowed by inefficient and poorly targeted delivery. Unmodified single-stranded RNA is unable to cross the cell membrane efficiently unaided, due to its size and negative charge and is susceptible to rapid degradation by nucleases. A range of chemical modifications has helped to address some of these issues. Synthetic RNA-like drugs are commonly delivered to target cells using a nanoparticle delivery platform (usually a cationic polymer or lipid) or through conjugation to a bioactive ligand or cell penetrating peptide. Achieving effective concentrations of AOs in the organ or tissue of interest can be challenging, although treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with AOs may be advantageous in this regard as the AOs can be administered directly to the CNS via intrathecal administration. Once in the nervous system, AOs are readily taken up by neurons and glia. Furthermore, the blood-brain barrier prevents the dispersion into peripheral tissues and subsequent clearance by the kidney and liver, allowing clinically effective concentrations to be more easily reached. This means smaller doses can be used, minimizing any potential toxicity  or systemic off-target effects. Several AO drugs have received FDA approval in recent years to treat a variety of conditions, including Eteplirsen (Exondys 51\u00ae) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy  for spinal muscular atrophy and Inotersen (Tegsedi\u00ae) for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR). Exploration of AO therapeutics has also begun for the treatment of ALS.\"\n\n\"Pre-clinical studies of AOs targeted to C9ORF72 transcripts have also begun. In the case of C9ORF72, researchers have been able to exploit the location of the pathogenic hexanucleotide expansion that occurs in an intron between two alternatively used first exons. AOs utilizing RNase H mediated degradation that targets only HRE containing transcripts or all C9ORF72 transcripts have been developed with both methods reported to reduce RNA foci in patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSCs. HRE targeting AOs have also been able to reduce pathological C9ORF72 RNA in transgenic mice\"\n\n\"With the scope of RNA therapeutics rapidly expanding and the genetic basis of ALS continuing to be uncovered, AOs may be a promising area for future therapeutic developments for subsets of ALS patients.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6909825\/","384095e6":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Genetics of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis<\/h1>\n\n\nAuthors: Mehdi Ghasemi and Robert H.

Many ALS genes highlight loss of protein quality control as a central feature of the disease. Misfolding of proteins may reflect many factors including aberrant folding and quality control at the ER (disturbed ER-associated degradation or ERAD), inherent instability due to mutations, aggregation during residence in stress granules, or imperfect clearance via proteasomes or autophagy. Self-assembly of misfolded proteins may lead to propagated instability and prion-like spreading of pathology.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5932579\/bin\/cshperspectmed-PRD-024125_F3.jpg)\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5932579\/"}}
