It was first released in 1991. Python is a great language for beginner programmers because it was designed with the newcomer in mind. Python was designed to be readable and it has a simple and consistent syntax. Additionally, Python has a very extensive section of mathematical and scientific libraries. These libraries contain code that has already been written to perform specific tasks so you just need to know how to call the library rather than write the code itself. Lastly, Python is free.\n\n\nHere, the basic plan is for you to get used to some of the basics of python usage: how to use it as a fancy calculator, how to make simple plots, and how to debug when you get an error.\n","2af85566":"![banner.jpg](attachment:banner.jpg)","f9eb8679":"We can also use exponents quite easily, though the syntax might be different than what you are used to.","790d2985":"## Post-class reflection:  \n\nIn your ***Lab Notebook***, write a brief definition of the functions *print, linspace, shape, plot, xlabel*, and *ylabel*, and give examples with proper python syntax. Also write down your responses from the \"pause for analysis\" sections. I will be looking for evidence of thoughtful engagement in these entries.\n\nDon't forget to share your Kaggle notebook with me, as I will be looking for evidence of your mastery of the computational methods embedded in the exercise: whether the notebook is complete and your results accurate. \n","9c7b2448":"A few things to note about the cell above: \n<br>\n<br>\n1) We have used the pound symbol (#) a few times in the cell. This symbol is used to indicate a _comment_. Comments are used to annotate your code to make them easier to read and understand. I have placed the comment Addition at the top so that you knew I would be performing that operation in that cell. I have also annotated the next two lines to indicate that I was adding integers and floating point numbers in the 2nd and 3rd lines, respectively. When you use the pound symbol, everything to the right of it is ignored by Python. If I hadn't used the pound symbols and had instead just tried to write Addition, integer, or floating point, Python would have given me an error.\n<br>\n<br>\n2) We got two different answers when using integer and floating point data types. When we summed the two integers 5 and 10, we got 15. When we summed the two floating point numbers 5.0 and 10.0, we got 15.0. Python will output integers as if you perform a mathematical operation on only integers. Python will output floating point numbers if you have at least one floating point number in your calculation.\n<br>\n<br>\n3) I placed a space before and after the plus signs. I would get the exact same answers if the spaces weren't there, but the extra spaces help with code readability.\n","f06849df":"Here's something cool: when you use an array in an algebraic expression, the resulting variable is also an array, of the same length! The cell below calculates $y$ algebraically from $x$. Remember, you have already defined the variables $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, so you won't need to redefine them here. ","37bd98d8":"We got started on this endeavor of making arrays because we wanted to plot $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ from $x = -5$ to $x = 5$. Python has a function, conveniently called plot, which makes 2-D plots. The basic syntax of the plot function is (x,y,formatstring). So the first argument is for the horizontal axis, the second argument is for the vertical axis, and the formatstring argument will let you format your plot. For instance, if you want red circle markers you would type 'ro'. The cell below plots $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ from $x = -5$ to $x = 5$ as a magenta dash-dot line, and labels the x and y axes. Try it!  \n\nAfter you've plotted it, play around with the pan and zoom buttons. ","c6477769":"Now, to test you skill. In the cell below, calculate and plot $y = 4e^{-x ^{2}}$ from $x = -3$ to $x = 3$. To make sure your curve is smooth use at least 100 points. Label your axes as x-axis and y-axis. Add axis labels using the functions xlabel and ylabel.","684efd88":"This is my answer to pause for analysis 1.","11171741":"### Set up\n1. In the upper right, click \"Copy and Edit.\"\n2.

Note that this takes a bit of time and you need to wait for it to finish before proceeding or quitting.\n3. After you've saved, you can leave and come back and work on it later.\n4. Next time you access this notebook, access it from the main Kaggle page by clicking \"Notebooks\" in the left hand bar, then clicking the \"Your Work\" tab in the central bar, followed by clicking on the notebook.\n5.

In the cell below, use the shape function to find the length of your new array $y$.","670b9438":"The last topic we will cover are error messages. Perhaps you have already encountered these above. If you haven't already, you will at some point in the course. Everyone makes mistakes while programming. The key is to learn how to understand the error messages that Python gives and use that information to fix your code. The cells below each contain at least one error. Run them first as they are written to see the error message and then go back and fix the cell.","2ac416ff":"In the cell below create a new variable called x_10 which covers a range from -3 to 4 and has 10 points. Verify that it covers the expected range and does in fact have 10 points by printing it. ","dd00f867":"As mentioned above, strings are the data type used for text. When we want to work with numbers, we will use either integers or floating point numbers. Integers are whole numbers. Floating point numbers are ones where the number of figures to the right of the decimal varies based upon the value of the floating point number. If a whole number is written with no decimal point then Python treats it as an integer. If a number is written with a decimal point then Python treats it as a floating point number. We can easily perform the 4 basic mathematical operations using Python.

You then clicked \"Copy and edit\" in the upper right to allow you to work through it. You will do this and the following steps for each notebook:\n\n1. In the upper left is the name of the Jupyter Notebook. Change the name to replace \"Student\" with your last name (or first and last name).  \n2. In the upper right, there is a button that says \"Share\". Share this notebook with your instructor by clicking it, and then under \"Search for users\" type in your instructor's user name (e.g. DrRachelWade). It will appear below; click on it. Change her privileges from \"read\" to \"write\" if directed.  \n3. In the upper right there is another button that says \"Save Version\". Click this button from time to time to save your progress (note that it takes a few seconds to complete saving).  \n4. At any time, you can press the back button in the upper left to leave the notebook. To get back in, go to the Notebook tab on the left-hand bar, and this time click the tab \"Your work\" in the center panel, and click on the notebook name (try this now;  then proceed to step 5 below).\n5. Work through the notebook by click in each box (called a \"cell\") in turn, completing any instructions, and then pressing shift-enter to execute it. Note that you will execute some cells without modifying them, like the cell below, which brings in libraries needed. ","09f4ad3f":"As can be seen above, you can print strings and the values of variables together in a single line. As a reminder, when you use print with a string you will get the exact text back from Python, when you use print with a variable you will get the value of that variable.  \n\nIn the cell below you should write a code that calculates the average height in inches of you and one other person in the class.

We wanted to print a statement (Hello, world!) and we only needed to type the word print and then put the phrase in quotation marks. The quotation marks are how you make a <em>string<\/em> in Python.

(Make sure to actually put in your first and last names)  \n\nI am excited to learn ___________! ","103390f4":"Python can also make use of variables for computation. A variable can be as many characters long as you want; they can be as simple as single letters, like x or y, or as long as complicated phrases like Atkins_and_dePaula_wrote_my_PChem_textbook. Variables cannot have spaces in their names so dePaula is an acceptable variable, but de Paula is not. Variables are case-sensitive, so x is a different variable than X. There are a number of words, such as print, that Python has reserved for special purposes; you cannot name your variable any of these reserved words. You will know you have typed a reserved word because it will appear green in your Notebook. Once a variable is assigned a value, it retains that value throughout a session until it is changed, thus you can use it in other cells.","99a9d545":"#### Pause for Analysis: Explain the difference between an array and a scalar. Which data type (array or scalar) does the linspace function make?","21ae00b4":"For a variable like x_10, which has a limited number of points, it is easy enough to print it and look at each of them. However, we will sometimes use arrays that have many more points, but we will want to verify that it has the correct number of points. Luckily, Python has a function called _shape_ that will tell us the dimensions of an array. The cell below uses shape to prove that x_10 is in fact a column of 10 numbers. Use shape to prove that the variable $x$ contains a column of 50 numbers.","22a02a0e":"It should be noted that Python follows the standard order of operations that you learned in grade school. So be careful when writing equations with multiple steps. For instance, the example below shows what can go wrong if things are placed in the wrong order. You might anticipate that the following equations all do the same thing, but, as we can see, that is not the case.","96212695":"These variables are called \"scalars\" because there is just one value associated with them. Here are some more scalars: ","248e841a":"So far we have discussed variables just having a single value, but often times we want to repeatedly perform a calculation on an array of numbers. An example of this might be if we wanted to plot the polynomial from the previous cell. Suppose we wanted our plot to cover the range $x = -5$ to $x = 5$. We would need to calculate $y$ at a sufficient number of points (~20) for our plot to be smooth. It would be tedious to input 20 different values of $x$ and perform the calculation one-by-one. Luckily, Python has a few different functions that we can use to create numerical arrays. The one that we will use most frequently is linspace and the cell below introduces this function."}}
