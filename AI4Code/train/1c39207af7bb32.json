To ensure you can apply these techniques on your own, you will have to apply them to a new dataset (with house prices from Iowa).\n\nThe exercises use a \"notebook\" coding environment.  In case you are unfamiliar with notebooks, we have a [90-second intro video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4C2qMnaIKL4).\n\n# Exercises\n\nRun the following cell to set up code-checking, which will verify your work as you go.","3a18ef69":"## Step 2: Review The Data\nUse the command you learned to view summary statistics of the data.

A few potential explanations for this:\n1. They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.\n1. The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.\n\nIf the reason is explanation #1 above, does that affect your trust in the model you build with this data? What about if it is reason #2?\n\nHow could you dig into the data to see which explanation is more plausible?\n\nCheck out this **[discussion thread](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn-forum\/60581)** to see what others think or to add your ideas.\n\n# Keep Going\n\nYou are ready for **[Your First Machine Learning Model](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/your-first-machine-learning-model).**\n","8986250c":"**[Machine Learning Course Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/machine-learning)**\n\n---\n"}}
