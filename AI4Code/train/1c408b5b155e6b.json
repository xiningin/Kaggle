Dense layers take vectors as input (which are 1D), while the current output is a 3D tensor. First, you will flatten (or unroll) the 3D output to 1D,  then add one or more Dense layers on top. CIFAR has 10 output classes, so you use a final Dense layer with 10 outputs and a softmax activation.","ab05bf05":"### Verify the data\n\nTo verify that the dataset looks correct, let's plot the first 25 images from the training set and display the class name below each image.\n","39d7b008":"### Compile and train the model","e6fffb3a":"Let's display the architecture of our model so far.","ad03c3a3":"Above, you can see that the output of every Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layer is a 3D tensor of shape (height, width, channels). The width and height dimensions tend to shrink as you go deeper in the network. The number of output channels for each Conv2D layer is controlled by the first argument (e.g., 32 or 64). Typically,  as the width and height shrink, you can afford (computationally) to add more output channels in each Conv2D layer.","a26b0d48":"The 6 lines of code below define the convolutional base using a common pattern: a stack of [Conv2D](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/keras\/layers\/Conv2D) and [MaxPooling2D](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/keras\/layers\/MaxPool2D) layers.\n\nAs input, a CNN takes tensors of shape (image_height, image_width, color_channels), ignoring the batch size. If you are new to these dimensions, color_channels refers to (R,G,B). In this example, you will configure our CNN to process inputs of shape (32, 32, 3), which is the format of CIFAR images. You can do this by passing the argument `input_shape` to our first layer.\n","f3586134":"##### Copyright 2019 The TensorFlow Authors.","5734b821":"### Evaluate the model","a794f491":"### Import TensorFlow","196469bb":"This tutorial demonstrates training a simple [Convolutional Neural Network](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/machine-learning\/glossary\/#convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) to classify [CIFAR images](https:\/\/www.cs.toronto.edu\/~kriz\/cifar.html).
