The \"State\" column gives us the geographical location information instead of ZIP code. I suspect Provider ID is a unique feature (primary key). Phone numbers don't help much. Planned to drop Provider ID if this feature is used as unique identifier, which is not helpful in the project. Also will drop phone numbers and Zip code.

First, I will do a basic descriptive analysis. ","de559487":"### Based on the graph above, it is safe to assume that the majority of the hospitals in the USA lean toward average to higher rating (average performers and over-achievers) with smaller percentage of them on the low-end side. In general, hospitals are performing better than worse based on CMS requirements with only abur less than a quarter ~21% are under=performing. This does not reflect the true picture of the current hospital performance; over-time tracking is required to see if hospitals are improving or declining.
