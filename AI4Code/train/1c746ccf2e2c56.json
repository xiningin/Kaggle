A Chatting Robot. Building a chatbot is one of the popular tasks in Natural Language Processing.\n\n### What is Information Retrieval?\n> Information Retrieval (or, IR in short) is the task of identifying and collecting the most relevant information from a source based on a pre-defined heuristic. Text data is a good example of unordered data while it is abudant everywhere. It is hard to find the information manually from a huge collection of text data. Since need of information is time-bound in general, a good IR system is always in need. \n\n### Are all chatbots the same?\n> Chatbots fall under three common categories:\n>##### 1. Rule-based chatbots\n>##### 2. Retrieval-based chatbots\n>##### 3. Intelligent chatbots\n\n### Rule-based chatbots\n> These bots respond to users' inputs based on certain pre-specified rules. For instance, these rules can be defined as if-elif-else statements. While writing rules for these chatbots, it is important to expect all possible user inputs, else the bot may fail to answer properly. Hence, rule-based chatbots do not possess any cognitive skills.\n\n### Retrieval-based chatbots\n> These bots respond to users' inputs by retrieving the most relevant information from the given text document. The most relevant information can be determined by Natural Language Processing with a scoring system such as cosine-similarity-score. Though these bots use NLP to do conversations, they lack cognitive skills to match a real human chatting companion. This [Wiki-IR-ChatBot](https:\/\/github.com\/RajkumarGalaxy\/Wiki-IR-ChatBot) falls under this category!\n\n### Intelligent AI chatbots\n> These bots respond to users' inputs after understanding the inputs, as humans do. These bots are trained with a Machine Learning Model on a large training dataset of human conversations. These bots are cognitive to match a human in conversing. Popular Virtual Assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri fall under this category. Further, most of these bots can make conversations based on the preceding chat texts. [Conversational AI ChatBot](https:\/\/github.com\/RajkumarGalaxy\/Conversational-AI-ChatBot), built by [Author](https:\/\/github.com\/RajkumarGalaxy), employs Microsoft's DialoGPT to make intelligent conversations!\n\n### In this project?\n> This project builds an information retrieval (IR) chatbot that can scrape Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup in the topic of user's interest and collect information against user's queries following a heuristic backed by TF-IDF score and cosine-similarity score. This Wiki-IR-ChatBot is user-friendly in permitting users to choose any topic and presenting either crisp and short response or detailed response. It leverages NLTK library to do text processing and scikit-learn library to do modeling. Let's dive deep!\n"}}
