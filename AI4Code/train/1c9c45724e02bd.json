The activation string is the activation function. We dont want just a linear function so we specify relu which is **Rectified Linear Unit**. Finally we will Dropout to reduce the chance of overfitting (large weights overfit more, so dropout just disables a portion of MP neurons randomly). Finally the last Dense layer is the output where we take all the values through a linear function.\n\n* Model.compile() will configure the model for training. It takes the name of an optimizier, an objective function and a list of metrics to measure model performance with. \n\n* Model.fit() will then train the model for a number of epochs (which just amount of time spent\/iterations).
