If a series is significantly autocorrelated, that means, the previous values of the series (lags) may be helpful in predicting the current value. ","1a9cfbf5":"**If you like this kernel please upvote it or if you have any queries or suggestions then leave a comment.**","c0729705":"We will decompose a time series into its components using `seasonal_decompose` in `statsmodel`.","316cd954":"## Introduction\n\nTime series is a sequence of observations recorded at regular time intervals.\n\nTime series analysis is a statistical technique to analyze the pattern of data points taken over time to forecast the future. In this kernel, we will see major components or pattern that are analyzed through time series data.","0fecbfd7":"## Finance\n\nlet's visualize further:\n\n**OHLC Charts**\n\nAn OHLC chart is a type of price chart that shows the open, high, low and close price of a certain period. Open-High-Low-Close Charts (OHLC Charts) are used as a trading tool to visualize and analyze the price changes over time for stocks, bonds etc.","4df8f830":"It is increasing at some point and decreasing at some.\n\nLet's talk about components.\n* **Trends**\n\nIncrease or decrease in the series of data over a longer period.\n\n* **Seasonality**\n\nFluctuations in the pattern due to seasonal determinants over a short period. \n\n* **Cyclicity** \n\nVariations occurring at irregular intervals due to certain circumstances. \n\n* **Irregularity (or noise)**\n\nInstability due to random factors that do not repeat in the pattern. It represents the residuals or remainder of the time series after the other components have been removed.\n\nSometimes the trend and cyclical components are grouped into one, called the trend-cycle component. The trend-cycle component can just be referred to as the \"trend\" component, even though it may contain cyclical behavior.","0b68fbb2":"* There is clearly a downward trend \n* There is a uniform seasonal change in the above plot\n* Residuals are non-uniform which might be an indication of outliers and missing values.","afe13d4f":"First we will see how our target feature relate with the dates.","446b7025":"**Candlestick Charts**\n\nCandlestick chart is used as a trading tool to visualise and analyse the price movements over time for securities, derivatives, currencies, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. Although the symbols used in Candlestick Charts resemble a Box Plot, they function differently and therefore, are not to be confused with one another.","fdaefb22":"Lags are only decreasing after first lag.\n\n- **Partial Autocorrelation (pacf)** can be interpreted as a regression of the series against its past lags. Partial Autocorrelation also conveys similar information but it conveys the pure correlation of a series and its lag, excluding the correlation contributions from the intermediate lags. "}}
