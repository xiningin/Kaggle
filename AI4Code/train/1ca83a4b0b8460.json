PCA provides the advantage reducing computational costs and errors during paramter estimation by reducing the number of dimensions in the data to a subspace which 'best' describes the data. Primarly applications of PCA is for pattern recognition, classification, dimensionality reduction. ","37dc9e97":"### Standardization\/Normalization","9f777e5f":"### Exploratory Analysis","7ce1d794":"## Intuition\n\nImagine an _ellipsoid_; which looks like a sphere which has been scaled on any of its axis. Think of it as a basketball&mdash;with concentric cirlces going from top to bottom like in the picture&mdash;which you can stretch or squeeze both vertically and\/or horizontally but cannot twist or deform it in a way that the lines on its surface no longer remain parallel. It follows the constraints of a linear transformation in that respect. \n\nIf our underlying pattern, or function is found on the tip of the ellipsoid, then imagine all the features spread across the different axeses of the ellipsoid. If an axis is small, then variance of the feature spread on that axis is also small. By omitting that axis and the principal component (feature) associated with that axis, we reduce our feature space and only lose a commensurately small amount of information. \n\nReference: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Principal_component_analysis\n\n**Note**: PCA does **not** improve accuracy. It is a method to reduce dimensions in order to improve computation, reduce noise, and it can also be used as a regularizing method to prevent overfitting. However, it usually does not make any difference when it comes to accuracy. \n\nPCA can also be thought of as an unsupervised algorithm since it ignores the class labels and the goal is to find the principal components (or directions) that maximize the variance in the dataset.\n\n![Ellipsoide](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ehwizHt.png)\n### Linear Algebra\n**Eigen-stuff**: Whenever a linear space goes through a scalar transformation, the vector space only gets scaled or squeezed, there is no rotation or direction change in the vector space which offsets the vectors of their spans. In matrix transformations though the vectors do get knocked off their span because the vector space gets rotated and squished and stretched as well. However, in certain cases of vector transformations, there are some vectors in the vector space which&mdash;despite undergoing a matrix transformation&mdash;do not get knocked off their span and retain it. These vectors are known as Eigenvectors (also known as proper vectors). \n\nThey merely get squeezed or stretched like during a scalar transformation. The magnitude of difference between their length before the transformation and their length after the transformation are known as Eigenvalues.\n\nReference: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g\n\nWe want to use this same principle to find the eigenvectors for the covariance matrix of our dataset. The covariance matrix describes how one feature covaries with respect to the other feature. Finding the eigenvectors of this feature space will help us identify the magnitude of the span of each feature vector (also known as eigenvalues). If the span (axis) is small, then the variance of the feature spread on that axis is also small and we can drop it.","4a03be60":"**Step 2**:  \nSubtract the mean vector from the array of all samples.","d2e2c0f4":"**Step 5**:  \nSort the eigen vectors based on their eigen values.","c2bac4aa":"## Steps\n\n1.

Each of the mutually orthogonal, unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data.\n6. This choice of basis will transform our covariance matrix into a diagonalised form with the diagonal elements representing the variance of each axis.\n7. The proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues.","d325c8e0":"Let's look at the proportions of eigen value distribution amongst the features.","48c21a67":"## Classifying Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars\n\n### Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a project which offers public data of space observations.

Observations have been made since 1998 and have been made accessible to everyone who is interested.\n\nFor this purpose a special 2.5 m diameter telescope was built at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, USA. The telescope uses a camera of 30 CCD-Chips with 2048x2048 image points each. The chips are ordered in 5 rows with 6 chips in each row. Each row observes the space through different optical filters (u, g, r, i, z) at wavelengths of approximately 354, 476, 628, 769, 925 nm.\n\nThe telescope covers around one quarter of the earth's sky&mdash;therefore focuses on the northern part of the sky.\n\n","bca5e9ef":"### Train-Test Split"}}
