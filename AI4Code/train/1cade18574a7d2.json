Using a decisiion tree classifier was able to plot and present catagorised data for easy reading. After getting a prediction for the model the results seem to be what was expected before hand. To be able to veify the data I decided to use a Logistic regressor \n\nAfter using the logisitc regressor to test the data, the model has been trained and tested to have a 90-80% accuracy rate. Which also explains the results from the decision tree classifier with the majority of the results coming back positive. I think the logistic regressor was the best way to verify the data giving a number value for the overall accuracy for the model.","391b1830":"Judging by the displayed data and its predictions it seems to be working succesfully, now the data will be tested to prove its accuracy score through a logisitic regressor.

The best way to find out the accuracy of the data is by using the logistic regressor to use a model score test.","113e480d":"Removed slope since no actual information was providied for what it was, and going through the data didn't have any significant values or change so I removed it, additionally it didnt fit in with the code being used.","f77a1c78":"## Introduction\n\nThe prupose of this model is to be able to predict whether a patient has a higher chance or a lower chance of having a heart attack from commonly recorded health data. With this data it should be able to accurately predict whether a patient is more prone to heart issues. This can be helpful in many ways for doctors who study heart problems and diagnosing patients whether they have serious issues or not. \n\nI think the two best models to use would be a decision tree classifier and a logistic regressor. Using a decision tree classifier is slightly more benefical for this dataset. Since all of the data provided is numerical it makes it easier to recieve a categorical response instead of a number value. Also using a logistic regressor is a good model of recieving an accuracy score for the data provided. It does this because logistic regression is a type of regression analysis."}}
