Natural Language Inferencing (NLI) is a popular NLP problem that involves determining how pairs of sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis) are related.\n\nYour task is to create an NLI model that assigns labels of 0, 1, or 2 (corresponding to entailment, neutral, and contradiction) to pairs of premises and hypotheses. To make things more interesting, the train and test set include text in fifteen different languages! You can find more details on the dataset by reviewing the Data page.","3a74be31":"#### Note to ourself: ***It looks like Multi-Lingual, Multi-Class Problem.***","08bf3b02":"#### Note to ourself: In terms of Labels, it is a **Multi Class Balanced** Dataset Problem."}}
