Then we will add each state's 2 letter code.","ac9a3ae0":"Since we are trying to predict the population in 2020 (and then using that information to figure out how many electoral votes each state is going to get for the 2024 and 2028 elections), we'll only keep columns that contain population information for 2010 and 2019","fc389914":"Now that we know that the Electoral College distorts votes, let's see if that distortion may have affected the results of any recent presidential elections.

Bush the edge over Al Gore. \n\nTo see if the electoral college helped swing the election, we will find how many electoral votes each candidate would have received had all votes been allocated proportionally.

We will do this 435 times: 538 electoral votes - 100 Senate Votes - 3 votes for D.C. \n\nIf this number looks familiar, you are right; it is the number of seats in the House of Representatives (we are really just allocating House seats here). To test our code, we will apportion votes based on 2010 Census data and compare that to the actual allocation of votes that took place","81f9fdd6":"Now let's do the same thing we did in the previous part, but this time, we will use a state's theoretical votes (if they were allocated perfectly proportionally).

It undervalues the people living in states like California, Texas, New York, and Florida, while overrepresenting the people in Wyoming, Vermont, North Dakota, and Alaska.\n\nTo understand this disparity and get a visual of how bad it is, we will look at Census Data from 1960 all the way to our ***previously predicted*** 2020 figures.\n\nOur first step is to load in the data set, get rid of the D.C. data, add 2 letter state codes,and add our predicted population numbers for 2020 to the data set.","4feaee1b":"Now we will predict the population for each state using the formula \\begin{equation*}A=Pe^{rt}\\end{equation*}\n\nwhere \\begin{equation*}t = 1\\end{equation*} \n\n\\begin{equation*}r = (\\frac{1}{9})(\\frac{pop_{2019}}{pop_{2010}} - 1)\\end{equation*} \n\n\\begin{equation*}P = pop_{2019}\\end{equation*}\n\nWe will also account for the fact that the population estimates are as of July 1<sup>st<\/sup> of that year, whereas the Census estimate is based on April 1<sup>st<\/sup> numbers","306bcd68":"We will use the [plotly graph object](https:\/\/plotly.github.io\/plotly.py-docs\/generated\/plotly.graph_objects.Choropleth.html) package to create a visual for our data","21bd48fa":"To get a better picture of how the Electoral College underrepresents some states and overrepresents others, let's create a visual that shows how many people are represented by one electoral college vote in each state.","6393b431":"Turns out Gore would have won the election under this scenario.","acbcad61":"But even the maps we just created make it hard to discern the difference between states. \n\nLet's visualize the same data in a more efficient manner by normalizing it; to do this, let's divide each state's population per electoral vote by the lowest population per electoral vote for that 10 year period (across all states). \n\nSo in 1960, Alaska will have a value equal to 1 (since it has the lowest number for this metric), while California will have a value closer to 5.","30844f60":"#### To see how the distribution of electoral votes by state and region has changed over the course of American history, we will examine the same data set from the previous part","885d5abd":"**Now we will look at some election results from the last 50 years using the [Plotly Express Choropleth](https:\/\/plotly.github.io\/plotly.py-docs\/generated\/plotly.express.choropleth.html) package**","9add7628":"### Let's load the dataset and take a look at the first few rows","aa59f4a4":"If you are having trouble with how to interpret this number, here is an example: In 1960, Alaska has a value of 1 and California has a value of 5.21.
