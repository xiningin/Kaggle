Based on attributes such as blood pressure, cholestoral levels, heart rate, and other characteristic attributes, patients will be classified according to varying \ndegrees of coronary artery disease. This project will utilize a dataset of 303 patients and distributed by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. \n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence is going to have a dramatic impact on the health field; as a result, familiarizing yourself with the data processing techniques appropriate for numerical health data and the most widely used algorithms for classification tasks is an incredibly valuable use of your time! In this tutorial, we will do exactly that. \n\nWe will be using some common Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Furthermore, for the machine learning side of this project, we will be using sklearn and keras. Import these libraries using the cell below to ensure you have them correctly installed. \n\n\n## Update(15.05.2020):\nI applied a few steps to this kernel that I learned from the book \"Deep Learning with Python\". After these steps, model success increased. The important thing here is the need to do these steps. You can find many kernels on the page of Fran\u00e7ois Chollet Github, the author of the book. One of these kernels is the source https:\/\/github.com\/fchollet\/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks\/blob\/master\/4.4-overfitting-and-underfitting.ipynb\n\n### Steps Added\n\n* Stratified Train\/Test-split in scikit-learn\n\n* Normalization\n\n    It would be problematic to feed into a neural network values that all take wildly different ranges. The network might be able to automatically adapt to such heterogeneous data, but it would definitely make learning more difficult. A widespread best practice to deal with such data is to do feature-wise normalization: for each feature in the input data (a column in the input data matrix), we will subtract the mean of the feature and divide by the standard deviation, so that the feature will be centered around 0 and will have a unit standard deviation. \n\n* Adding Dropout \n\n    Dropout is one of the most effective and most commonly used regularization techniques for neural networks, developed by Hinton and his students at the University of Toronto. Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e. setting to zero) a number of output features of the layer during training. \n\n* Adding Weight Regularization\n\n    You may be familiar with Occam's Razor principle: given two explanations for something, the explanation most likely to be correct is the \"simplest\" one, the one that makes the least amount of assumptions. This also applies to the models learned by neural networks: given some training data and a network architecture, there are multiple sets of weights values (multiple models) that could explain the data, and simpler models are less likely to overfit than complex ones.\n\n    A \"simple model\" in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has less entropy (or a model with fewer parameters altogether, as we saw in the section above). Thus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put constraints on the complexity of a network by forcing its weights to only take small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more \"regular\". This is called \"weight regularization\", and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a cost associated with having large weights. This cost comes in two flavors:\n    * L1 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the absolute value of the weights coefficients (i.e. to what is called the \"L1 norm\" of the weights).\n    * L2 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the square of the value of the weights coefficients (i.e. to what is called the \"L2 norm\" of the weights). L2 regularization is also called weight decay in the context of neural networks. Don't let the different name confuse you: weight decay is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization.\n    \n### Here is the result\n![](https:\/\/iili.io\/JEop0x.png)\n\n\n\n# **Content**\n\n1.

To do this, we will make predictions on the training dataset and calculate performance metrics using Sklearn."}}
