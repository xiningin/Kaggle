I thought that there might be some correlation between spotting locations and new vs not-new whales. I don't know if it is worth using (or alowed), but it is a nice novel plaything, good for atleast 5 minutes, so I figured it was worth a share.\n\nNote: Going from original GPS data degree-minute-seconds to decimal might have some small rounding error, so having whales spotted a few hundred meters inland is completely viable.","09f89d93":"green: 'rgb(0,128,0)'\nred  : 'rgb(255,0,0)'","28579fde":"*from plotly*\nSets the latitude coordinates (in degrees North).\nSets the longitude coordinates (in degrees East).\n******\n\n12.55\u00b0 N     is the same as   +12.55\u00b0\n52.12\u00b0 S     is the same as   - 52.12\u00b0\n\n12.55\u00b0 E     is the same as   +12.55\u00b0\n52.12\u00b0 W     is the same as   - 52.12\u00b0"}}
