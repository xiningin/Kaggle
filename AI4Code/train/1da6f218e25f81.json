Specifically, you'll use a special kind of loss function known as the W-loss, where W stands for Wasserstein, and gradient penalties to prevent mode collapse.\n\n*Fun Fact: Wasserstein is named after a mathematician at Penn State, Leonid Vaser\u0161te\u012dn. You'll see it abbreviated to W (e.g. WGAN, W-loss, W-distance).*\n\n### Learning Objectives\n1.   Get hands-on experience building a more stable GAN: Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP).\n2.   Train the more advanced WGAN-GP model.\n\n","b183a241":"For the critic, the loss is calculated by maximizing the distance between the critic's predictions on the real images and the predictions on the fake images while also adding a gradient penalty. The gradient penalty is weighed according to lambda.

Since the changes for WGAN-GP are done to the loss function during training, you can simply reuse your previous GAN code for the generator and critic class. Remember that in WGAN-GP, you no longer use a discriminator that classifies fake and real as 0 and 1 but rather a critic that scores images with real numbers.","45f30e88":"#### Packages and Visualizations","75fa4945":"## Putting It All Together\nBefore you put everything together, there are a few things to note.\n1.   Even on GPU, the **training will run more slowly** than previous labs because the gradient penalty requires you to compute the gradient of a gradient -- this means potentially a few minutes per epoch! For best results, run this for as long as you can while on GPU.\n2.   One important difference from earlier versions is that you will **update the critic multiple times** every time you update the generator This helps prevent the generator from overpowering the critic. Sometimes, you might see the reverse, with the generator updated more times than the critic. This depends on architectural (e.g. the depth and width of the network) and algorithmic choices (e.g. which loss you're using). \n3.   WGAN-GP isn't necessarily meant to improve overall performance of a GAN, but just **increases stability** and avoids mode collapse. In general, a WGAN will be able to train in a much more stable way than the vanilla DCGAN from last assignment, though it will generally run a bit slower. You should also be able to train your model for more epochs without it collapsing.\n\n\n<!-- Once again, be warned that this runs very slowly on a CPU. One way to run this more quickly is to download the .ipynb and upload it to Google Drive, then open it with Google Colab and make the runtime type GPU and replace\n`device = \"cpu\"`\nwith\n`device = \"cuda\"`\nand make sure that your `get_noise` function uses the right device.  -->\n\nHere is a snapshot of what your WGAN-GP outputs should resemble:\n![MNIST Digits Progression](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?id=1Tct8CPqVM5nUrHvA864ntv76XHZKqKUK&export=view)","6af339cd":"## Losses\nNext, you need to calculate the loss for the generator and the critic.\n\nFor the generator, the loss is calculated by maximizing the critic's prediction on the generator's fake images. The argument has the scores for all fake images in the batch, but you will use the mean of them.\n\nThere are optional hints below and a test function in the next block for you to test your solution.\n\n<details><summary><font size=\"3\" color=\"green\"><b>Optional hints for <code><font size=\"4\">get_gen_loss<\/font><\/code><\/b><\/font><\/summary>\n\n1.

The gradient is computed by first creating a mixed image. This is done by weighing the fake and real image using epsilon and then adding them together. Once you have the intermediate image, you can get the critic's output on the image. Finally, you compute the gradient of the critic score's on the mixed images (output) with respect to the pixels of the mixed images (input). You will need to fill in the code to get the gradient wherever you see *None*. There is a test function in the next block for you to test your solution.","b47aa39d":"## Training Initializations\nNow you can start putting it all together.\nAs usual, you will start by setting the parameters:\n  *   n_epochs: the number of times you iterate through the entire dataset when training\n  *   z_dim: the dimension of the noise vector\n  *   display_step: how often to display\/visualize the images\n  *   batch_size: the number of images per forward\/backward pass\n  *   lr: the learning rate\n  *   beta_1, beta_2: the momentum terms\n  *   c_lambda: weight of the gradient penalty\n  *   crit_repeats: number of times to update the critic per generator update - there are more details about this in the *Putting It All Together* section\n  *   device: the device type\n\nYou will also load and transform the MNIST dataset to tensors.\n\n\n"}}
