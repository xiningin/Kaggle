These were Heroin (49.5%), Fentanyl (43.6%), Cocaine (29.8%), Benzodiazepine (26.3%), Ethanol (Alcohol) (24.4%). Nearly all other drugs in the sample were involved in fewer than 10% of overdoses. \n\n***todo:*** code this up to prove it\n\nThe mode number of different drugs in an overdose was 2, making up over 35% of reported overdose deaths in the sample.

I don\u2019t anticipate race having an effect on age of death, and I don\u2019t anticipate any significant interaction between sex, race, and age of death. As age increases, I predict NumDrugs will decrease, because substance abusers who use only one drug at a time may be less likely to die of a drug \u201ccocktail.\u201d From my personal biases, I would predict males use more different drugs at once than women, and I predict higher lifespans for women than men.\n\nThese predictions can be phrased in terms of the models in the following way: \n\n***In the first model:***\n- negative parameter estimates for the Fentanyl and Heroin, \n- statistically insignificant race variables, \n- statistically insignificant interaction variables of race and sex\n- positive parameter estimate for Female.\n\n***In the second model:***\n- negative parameter estimate for age\n- negative parameter estimate for female.","aa11d4d0":"# Cleaning\n\nChanges\/Additions: \n- Female boolean column in place of provided \"male\"\/\"female\" Sex column\n- Changing Y\/N values to 1\/0 values\n- NumDrugs column - from sum of drugs in columns 20-36\n- divided the race column into booleans for ease of analysis","ae6f8e79":"\n\nWhen plotted as in Figure 4, there appears to be a rough trend suggesting that as drugs are involved in higher percentages of overdoses, they typically have younger victims. With this relationship in mind, I grouped the drugs in the following way: \n\n1. Hydromorphone, Tramadol, Hydrocodone, Morphine, Oxycodone, Methadone\n2. Ethanol (Alcohol), Cocaine, Benzos\n3. Heroin, Fentanyl\n4. Amphetamines\n\nGroup 1 drugs are all opiates that are involved in the fewest overdoses. Victims of Group 1 drugs tend to die at older ages. \n\nGroup 2 drugs are involved in 25% of overdoses each, and are common recreational drugs - alcohol, cocaine, and sedatives like Xanax and Valium. \n\nGroup 3 drugs are involved in around 50% of overdoses, and consist of the more deadly opioids heroin and fentanyl. \n\nAmphetamines are an outlier, as they are responsible for a low number of overdoses, but victims are predicted to die at younger ages than any other statistically significant drugs. This makes more sense, however, when considering the variability between amphetamines. Amphetamines often refer to unpredictable, hard drugs like Meth and MDMA, but also includes commonly prescribed medications like Adderall for ADHD and Wellbutrin for depression.","06d11aee":"# Results\n\nThere are fifteen statistically significant variables in the first model.\n\n- The intercept indicated that a white male who overdosed on heroin is predicted to have died at 39.7 years old. \n- Three race variables were statistically significant - Black and Hispanic victims are predicted to live 5.1 and 1.6 years longer than white victims, while Asian victims are expected to live 6.3 years fewer than white victims. \n- Eleven drug variables were statistically significant at 95% CI. \n    - victims that overdosed on Amphetamines and Fentanyl were predicted to live 2.5 and 2.1 fewer years, respectively. \n    - victims that overdosed on the other statistically significant drugs (Benzodiazepine, Cocaine, Ethanol, Methadone, Oxycodone, Morphine, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Hydromorphone) were predicted to live between 1.4 and 6.8 years longer than the intercept drug, heroin. \n\n- Sex has no statistical significance under any reasonable confidence interval in this model.\n\nAs predicted, the modified model that interacts race and sex had no statistical significance.","a707397c":"# Overdose Deaths in Connecticut by Race, Sex, and Age\n\nOriginally written for ECON403: Econometrics I at Rochester Institute of Technology in Fall 2019.\n\nWinner of the RIT Department of Economics Kearse Student Writing Award in 2020.","56514250":"# Exploratory Analysis\n\ntodo: make these graphs readable","87f211df":"I examine five kinds of variables in this analysis. \n1.       the victim\u2019s age at death, age, measured in years.\n2.       sex boolean, female, that indicates whether or not the overdose victim's sex is female. \n3. \\- 7.  boolean variables indicating the victim\u2019s race (Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, and Unknown\/Other)\n8. \\- 23. boolean variables for drugs for which the victim tested positive for after death\n24.

With this in mind, I sought to examine whether some demographic groups were more likely to mix multiple drugs than others. To that end, the third model takes NumDrugs as the dependent variable and sex, race, and age are independent variables. Here, since NumDrugs is linearly dependent on the drug variables, it is impossible to include (or interpret) them in this model. As with the first model, I examined a modified version of this model with race\/sex interaction variables included.","23e6f72d":"The first model agreed with my predictions for lower life expectancy for overdose victims of heroin and fentanyl, though I had not predicted amphetamines to be as lethal as the model predicted.

The female variable was statistically insignificant, contradicting my prediction of a positive parameter estimate.

The turning point for the new model is 45.8 years old, and 41.5% of the sample victims were older than that. At this turning point age of 46 years old, victims are predicted to test positive for 2.27 drugs. ","24a789b3":"# Analysis & Conclusion\n\nIn determining age at death in overdose victims, race and type of drug are predicted to be statistically significant.  The \u201caverage\u201d case is a 39.7-year-old white male who overdosed on heroin. Black and Hispanic overdose victims are predicted to live 5.1 and 1.6 years longer than white victims, respectively, while victims of other races are predicted to live 1.6 years fewer than their white counterparts. Victims who test positive for Hydromorphone are perhaps the \"best off\" of all the other drugs, and are predicted to live nearly 7 years longer than those who overdosed on Heroin. \n\nThe following drugs are all also significant and positively associated with age relative to Heroin: \n- Tramadol (6.6y older), \n- Hydrocodone (5.4y), \n- Morphine (4.3y), \n- Oxycodone (4.2y), \n- Methadone(2.7y), \n- Ethanol (2.4y), \n- Cocaine (1.7y), and \n- Benzodiazepine (1.4y). \n\nOnly two drugs that were negatively associated with age relative to heroin - Fentanyl and Amphetamines, whose victims were expected to live 2.1 and 2.5 fewer years, respectively. In determining the number of drugs in an overdose victim, race and age are significant. Black and Hispanic victims are predicted to overdose on 0.13 and 0.08 fewer drugs than white victims, respectively. Between 0-years-old and approximately 45-years-old, increased age is correlated with increase in number of drugs. The maximum indicates that a 45-year-old white male overdose victim is predicted to test positive for 2.3 drugs. From 45-years-old on, the number of drugs is predicted to decrease as age increases.\n\nBlack and Hispanic victims are predicted to overdose later in life than white victims, and Asian victims are predicted to overdose over 6 years earlier than white victims. My first attempt to explain this change in age at death was to look at [poverty rates by race](https:\/\/talkpoverty.org\/state-year-report\/connecticut-2018-report\/), however these rates have no clear association with the change in expected age at time of death. In a similar econometric study of Connecticut\u2019s overdose statistics, assistant professor of medicine at Yale University Dr. Daniel Tobin [offers the following explaination](https:\/\/overdose.trendct.org\/story\/who), \u201cBeing white or affluent doesn't protect you. In fact, in some cases it might be a risk factor. Affluent communities tend to have better access to prescription pain medications.\u201d This explanation doesn't fit with the reported poverty rates, but several other [healthcare related disparities](https:\/\/www.cthealth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Health-disparities-in-Connecticut.pdf) have been observed in Connecticut may help to explain this phenomenon - Hispanic and Black residents often have less access to insurance and regular health care provider, which could mean fewer prescription drugs circulating in these communities.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising of these results is the lack of significance of biological sex. Physically, I predicted that increased body weight could lower males\u2019 chances of death as fatal doses of most drugs are dependent on body weight. This could be tested by including body weight of victims in future samples. Sociologically, however, I am inclined to generalize male drug users between the ages of 18 and 45 as more impulsive than their female counterparts - and therefore more likely to use more drugs at once or to use too many and overdose earlier in life. The relationship between biological sex, impulse, and drug use is [complex and well-documented](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4012004\/), though the models I observe here have nothing concrete to contribute to these discussions.\n","d1590587":"## Models 1 & 2\nMy first model examined the linear effect of sex, race, and drug of choice on the age of overdose victims. This model takes age as the dependent variable and sex, race, and drugs are independent variables. Since all records in the sample were fatalities, I interpreted age as lifespan of those people who die of overdose. I also examined a modified model that included interaction variables between race and sex."}}
