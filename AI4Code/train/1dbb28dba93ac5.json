The number of recovered and deaths were also reported, which helped us inferred the number of active cases at a given time using the formula Active = Cases - (Death + Recovered) \n\nWe can see that the number of active cases peaked on May 12, 2003 at 3700 cases. This is the point where the number of new SARS cases are outpaced by the number of recovery (instead of the number of death, fortunately, as our graph show). Nevertheless, this timestamp would serve to indicate that the effort to pushback SARS is finally slowing down the spread of the virus \n\nThere are some other timestamp worth noting from this chart as well:\n- May 16, 2003, the number of recovery outpaces the number of active cases. This could indicate that the tide is turning in the battle against SARS, as there are now more resources available to treat active cases as more people have recovered from the disease. \n- June 16, 2003, the number of active cases drop below the number of total deaths. Not sure if this has any significant meaning, but it should at least that more people are recovering rather than dying.\n- April 10, 2003, the number of recovered patients rocketted from 0 to 1337. Was this spike due to not having numbers reported in earlier dates or was it due to some magical cure (not likely)? \n","8bbcce44":"## Preparing the data","4d1ea00a":"Taiwan experienced peak active cases later than the world, at around Jun 2, 2003 at 469.
