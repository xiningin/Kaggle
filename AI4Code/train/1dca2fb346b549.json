However, we cannot use it in its current format. We should represent it with a proper data type which is integer showing number of minutes.\n\nThere are many way to do this task. Feel free to try different methods. I will do it as follows:\n\n1. Split condition column on spaces and expand to a new dataframe with three columns (e.g. 10 \u2014 days \u2014 left)\n2. Convert the second column to appropriate minutes values (e.g. replace days with 1440, hours with 60)\n3.

It measures how much of the variation in the target variables is explained by the independent variables. The closer the R-squared value is to 1, the better the performance of model. R-squared scores of training and test sets are very close so the model is not overfitting. It seems like regularization works well. However, the performance of the model in terms of prediction power is not good enough because R-squared scores are not close to 1.","8eeb69f3":"There are 49 different colors but 90% of cars belong to 6 different colors. We can mark the remaining colors as other like we did in \u201cbrand\u201d column.","f39d4160":"# **Correlation Matrix**","db4ec265":"**Encoding**\n\nWe have categorical features such as brand and color. These features need to represented in a format that a model can process. We cannot just input strings in a model. We first need to convert the categories into numbers (**Label Encoding**). If a categorical variable is not ordinal (i.e. there is not a hierarchical order in them), it is not enough to just do label encoding. We need to represent the categories with binary columns. This can be done using \"**dummy**\" or \"**one hot**\" encoding. For example, we may \u201cDodge\u201d label as 3 and \u201cGMC\u201d as 1. If we just do label encoding on not ordinal categorical variables, a model would think category 3 is somewhat more important than category 1 which is not true. One Hot Encoding represents each category as a column which only take two values, 1 and 0. For a car with \u201cDodge\u201d brand, only the value in \u201cDodge\u201d column becomes 1 and other columns are 0. In this way, we make sure there is not a hierarchy among categories.\n\n**Normalization**\n\nWe also need to normalize the numerical data so that the values are in the same range. Otherwise, the model might give more importance to the higher values. For example, the values in mileage column are much higher than the values in age column. We can normalize these values in the range of [0,1] so that the maximum values for each column becomes 1 and the minimum becomes zero.","db79ee4d":"Title status indicates whether a car is clean or salvage which is definitely a factor in determining the price. Let\u2019s confirm:","e3b89d78":"As the results show, there is significant increase in R-squared score.\n\nThere is a slight difference between the values of training and test sets but I think this is acceptable with the data we have. We can create a model that has an R-squared value very close to 1 on training set but the performance on test set will be very low.\n\nThe main reason is the limited data. For complex models, we normally need lots of data to build a decent and robust model. The categorical variables in the dataset have many categories but not enough data for each category. Therefore, the first thing we should do to improve the model is to look for more data.\n\nAnother way to improve the performance is hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameters define the properties of a model that we can adjust. For example, I tried different values for the following hyperparameters of gradient boosting regressor:\n\n* n_estimators: The number of boosting stages to perform.\n* max_depth: Maximum depth of the individual regression trees.\n* learning_rate: The contribution of each tree is shrinked by the learning rate.\n\nThere is no strict rule to determine optimum values for these parameters. We need to find the right balance. Feel free to try different values for these parameters and see how the performance changes. Please do not limit yourself to what we did in exploratory data anaysis section. You can always dig deeper to explore the dataset to find out the correlations and underlying structure of data.","494835a6":"It is time to check if how price changes according to different brands. Boxplot is an informative tool for this task. We can also use pandas groupby function to check average prices of each brand","3146f173":"The line in the boxes shows the average price. Ford cars have the highest average price but please keep in mind that almost half of the cars in the dataset are ford. It might be useful when building and evaluating our model. There are also some extreme values (i.e. outliers) represented with block dots. We will handle outliers later on. The height of the boxplots represent how spread out the values are. The dataset includes more dodge cars than chevrolet cars but price of chevrolet cars are more spread out than dodge cars. Variety of models might be causing this spread out. Let\u2019s check how many models each brand has:","2d9a9d18":"The image above tells us two important things:\n\n* Color is not a decisive factor for price. The mean and the amount of spread of price are not changing much for different colors. Thus, it is better not to include \u201ccolor\u201d as a feature in our model.\n\n* There are outliers and we somehow need to handle them. Otherwise, the model will try to capture them which prevents the model from generalizing well to the dataset.\n\nWe have some cars that have extremely high prices. These outliers are not grouped in a particular color. From the figure above, it seems like all of the outliers are above 45000.

So if mean is higher than the median, we have more samples on the upper side of the median.","c571fb68":"Mean is higher than median, as expected.

Then we expect the model to make predictions on samples from the same distribution. In order to train the model and then test it, we need to divide the dataset into two subsets.
