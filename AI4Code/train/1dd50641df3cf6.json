In pattern recognition, information retrieval and binary classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, \n1. **recall** : \n\n    1. recall is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. \n1. **F-score** :\n\n    1. the F1 score is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\n\n1. **What is the difference between accuracy and precision?**\n    1. \"Accuracy\" and \"precision\" are general terms throughout science. A good way to internalize the difference are the common \"bullseye diagrams\". In machine learning\/statistics as a whole, accuracy vs. precision is analogous to bias vs. variance.","e58e0dd7":"<a id=\"74\"><\/a> <br>\n## 7-4 RandomForestClassifier\nA random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
