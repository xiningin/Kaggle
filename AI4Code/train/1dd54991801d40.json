This kernel is made from the course of [Intro to machine Learning.](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-machine-learning) But I also add some extra feature to the code. I will keep changing the kernel when I will learn new thing. If some one is trying to find out how to start in Kaggle I think this kernel  will help you to make your start in Kaggle.  "}}
