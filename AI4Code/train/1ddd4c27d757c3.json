This is partly due to ageism, or the discrimination of older adults based on age, which has been prevalent in research, policy, and the media.\n\nTraditional media (such as newspapers, television, and radio) have long reinforced ageist stereotypes by often portraying older adults as a burden to society.\n\nDuring the pandemic, this phenomenon has also been observed in social media (online platforms for sharing user-generated content). COVID-19 has accelerated changes in the way we share information, with a shift towards social media use by governments, news outlets, and researchers. \n\nWhile this has speeded up the transmission of data, it has also led to the dissemination of misinformation and negative messages.\n\nNegative social media messages about COVID-19 and aging often characterize older adults as helpless and expendable individuals.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">\u201c#BoomerRemover\u201d Twitter hashtag: Hate speech and Intergenerational Resentment.  <\/font>\n\nExisting hate speech and intergenerational resentment can be exemplified by the \u201c#BoomerRemover\u201d Twitter hashtag (user-generated metadata term), which was widely shared in social mediaat the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nTo understand the dissemination of ageist messages in social media, the authors group conducted a qualitative analysis of the content English-language tweets about COVID-19 and older adults posted in the ten days following the pandemic declaration .\n\nTheir findings showed that almost a quarter of tweets downplayed the importance of COVID-19 because it was deadlier among older individuals, and that 14% contained offensive content or jokes. Sentiment analysis found that negative tweets mostly contained words related with death and\/or sickness, and that sentiments changed over time, with an increase in negative content right after the pandemic declaration and a decrease thereafter.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Older Individuals Engagement: a Way to Receive Support during the Pandemic.<\/font>\n\nThere is a need to promote inclusivity in social media and to make the voices of older adults heard. Increasing the participation of older individuals can boost their engagement in social interactions and represent a way to provide and receive social support during the pandemic.\nhttps:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/eclinm\/article\/PIIS2589-5370(20)30378-3\/fulltext","53c31c46":"### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">Special groups: BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic)<\/font><\/mark><\/b>\n\n\nFour out of eight BAME participants reported changes to their health, citing changes in seizure activity (n\u202f=\u202f1), sleep disruption (n\u202f=\u202f2), and mental strain (n\u202f=\u202f2) as reasons for this.\n\nOne respondent reported feeling healthier and more relaxed.

Significant attention has focused on the individual-level demographic and co-morbid factors associated with rates and mortality of COVID-19.\n\nHowever, less attention has been given to the county-level social determinants of health that are the main drivers of health inequities.\n\nTo predict COVID-19 cumulative case rates at the county-level in Georgia, the authors performed a sequential, cross-sectional ecologic analysis using a diverse set of socioeconomic and demographic variables.\n\nLasso regression was used to identify variables from collinear groups. Twelve variables correlated to cumulative case rates with an adjusted r squared of 0.4525. \n\nAs time progressed in the pandemic, correlation of demographic and socioeconomic factors to cumulative case rates increased, as did number of variables selected.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Health Disparities affecting vulnerable populations<\/font>\n\nFindings indicate the social determinants of health and demographic factors continue to predict case rates of COVID-19 at the county-level as the pandemic evolves.

Also, there seems to be a history of poor risk communication in the months preceding the pandemic.\n\nAs the UK witnesses a second COVID-19 wave, those involved in healthcare delivery must ensure optimal care is provided for people with chronic conditions, such as epilepsy, to ensure that avoidable morbidity and mortality is prevented during the pandemic, and beyond.\n\nMedical services have reconfigured rapidly during the pandemic. In the United Kingdom (UK), many epilepsy nurses and neurologists with an interest in epilepsy were redeployed into general medical services, resulting in the temporary closure of epilepsy clinics. Video-EEG monitoring and other elective admissions were suspended. Access to neuropsychology was significantly limited, and epilepsy surgery was postponed.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Inequality on Multiple Levels: BAME Groups, Elderly, Lower Socioeconomic Strata <\/font>\n\nThe pandemic has also sharply accentuated inequality on multiple levels.

Dedeoglu -  22 October 2020 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/pra2.289\n\nThe advent of COVID\u201019 has resulted in an unprecedented level of digital global communication. With social distancing practices, there is an increased volume of online activities and also increased production of online information from both organizations and individuals.\n\nThe use of social networking has increased dramatically as people use these tools as a substitute for in\u2010person social gatherings. Social media has likely also become a substitute for person\u2010to\u2010person information seeking, which makes up half of all information seeking , and is particularly important for disadvantaged groups.\n\nHigher education is a clear example of the changes wrought by COVID\u201019. Universities and institutes have transitioned to virtual campuses, where all communication, teaching and learning, and support for students occur online.\n\nInternational students, while not the only group of affected students, have particular challenges around information: some are seeking information about their host country and their home simultaneously, and some are attempting to integrate into a university community without ever setting foot on campus. \n\nThe potential of digital access and equity challenges. If the communication strategies of governments, service providers and universities do not consider these needs, equity issues will arise.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Digital Access and Equity for Vulnerable Populations such as Migrant Groups or International Students<\/font>\n\nWith the world moving the bulk of its activities online during a Pandemic, digital access and equity and effective engagement need addressing more urgently than ever, particularly for vulnerable populations such as recent migrant groups or international students.\nhttps:\/\/asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pra2.289","6ef5392f":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Risk assessment of healthcare workers<\/font>\n\nIn addition to training and strict infection prevention and control (IPC), morbidity and mortality among healthcare workers is likely to be reduced if staff at high risk of severe outcomes (e.g. those with co-morbidities) are preferentially allocated to routine non-COVID-19 care; those who live with high-risk family members should also either avoid direct COVID-19 care or be supported to live separately from their household.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Cohorting COVID-19 patients<\/font>\n\nSeparating patients with COVID-19 from other patients will reduce nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but the effectiveness of cohorting depends on diagnostic accuracy, itself a function of prevalence of true COVID-19 cases among presenting patients.\n\nPositive predictive value (PPV) of COVID-19 diagnosis under alternative scenarios.

As we move online in response to COVID-19, it is imperative that administrators and teachers attend to the potential for this exacerbation and work to mitigate it at both the levels of policy and practice.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">TPD (Teacher Professional Development) for OBL (Online and Blended Learning)<\/font>\n\nIt is vitally important that research on TPD (teacher professional development) for OBL (online and blended learning) attend to inequities in education. \n\nThe TPD for OBL framework does not explicitly address this question; however, educational equity is, arguably, a worldwide issue.\n\nTherefore, any framework for supporting teacher professional development must attend to issues of equity. \n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Minoritized Communities: Black People, Women (in STEM subjects), People with Disabilities,LGBTQ community and other vulnerable populations<\/font>\n\nQuestions should focus on addressing the development of culturally sustaining pedagogies for marginalized and minoritized communities, including people of color, girls and women (in STEM subjects), people with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ community and other vulnerable populations.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">TPD for OBL: Supporting equity or Reproducing the status quo? <\/font>\n\nMoreover, teachers\u2019 voices should become more prominent in the development of TPD for OBL, such that their rights and expertise are respected. And while teachers\u2019 autonomy has become increasingly circumscribed in the classroom due to neoliberal reform movements, they are still highly influential actors in the lives of children. TPD for OBL should assist teachers in critically analyzing the new medium, and how it can be used to either support equity or reproduce the status quo.\nhttps:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11423-020-09864-4#citeas","f32e3fc3":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">COVID-19 Challenge. Resource allocation. Immediate adaptations. <\/font>\n\nManaging COVID-19 epidemics in fragile states and crisis-affected populations presents an unprecedented challenge for humanitarian actors, with huge competing population needs and limited resources. \n\nThe most marginalised and vulnerable populations are likely to be the most affected. The COVID-19 challenge is unprecedented and rapidly evolving. Resource allocation and service design must accordingly be reviewed continuously, with immediate adaptations if warranted and transparent dissemination of outcomes and experiences.\nhttps:\/\/conflictandhealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13031-020-00325-6","d03c864b":"### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">People aged over 60\u202fyears<\/font><\/mark><\/b>\n\nPeople with epilepsy aged over 60\u202fyears\n\nPeople over the age of 60 years reported the highest prevalence of diabetes, heart conditions, hypertension, and memory difficulties.\n\nFrequency of mental health difficulties and respiratory conditions was lower than the overall average. \n\nFewer individuals in this older cohort reported changes to their overall health and well being during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the wider dataset.\n\nA smaller proportion reported difficulty in taking ASMs (Anti-Seizure Medications) on time and accessing epilepsy care .

Risk factors include decreased vaccine uptake, urinary loss of immunoglobulins, and treatment with immunosuppressive medications. \n\nThe authors identified a number of key areas of glomerular disease care likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) clinic visit scheduling, (2) visit types, (3) provision of multidisciplinary care, (4) blood work and imaging, (5) home monitoring, (6) immunosuppression, (7) other medications, (8) immunizations, (9) management of children with suspected COVID-19, (10) renal biopsy, (11) patient education and support, and (12) school and child care.\n\nThere are minimal data regarding the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in adult or pediatric glomerular disease patients, as well as the efficacy of strategies to prevent infection transmission within these populations. \n\nThese guidelines are intended to promote optimal care delivery for children with existing or newly diagnosed glomerular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implications of modified care delivery, altered immunosuppression strategies, and limited access to existing resources remain uncertain.\nhttps:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33240518\/","104b108f":"### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\"> Health Disparities.
