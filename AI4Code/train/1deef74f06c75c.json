This is due to the arrival of a technique called \u201cbackpropagation,\u201d which allows networks to adjust their hidden layers of neurons in situations where the outcome doesn\u2019t match what the creator is hoping for.","b5410c55":"As per the result of confusion matrix, breast cancer predictions are quite successful.
