The top 20 destinations make 63.86% of the overall flights from SFO\nMost of the flight observations range between 337 miles (25th percentile) and 2000 miles (75th percentile) with outliers that go as low as 11 miles and higher than 2500 miles.\nThe Commercial airtravel space is dominated by 3 carriers namely\n- United Airlines Inc - 32.81% share\n- Skywest Airlines Inc - 29.56% share\n- American Airlines Inc - 9.30% share\nmaking up 71.67% of all flights leaving San Francisco International Airport\n\nAnd lastly as expected there is a strong correlation between Departure delay time and arrival delay time.","63b7a5a6":"Let's select a subset of columns with relevant data for our analysis","fc6a5277":"Locate them in our sub set - new data set","bf2cb2d0":"## Data Preparation & Cleaning","1ba3402e":"We can see that there are 1 million + null values in the entire dataset.

Here are some ideas for further exploration:\n\n- Conduct the analysis of destinations as served by different carriers\n- Explore the delay times against the different carriers - see if some flights caught up with the lost time mid air\n- Prepare analysis of the taxi volumes in and out SFO\n- Prepare the analysis of the variables we dropped e.g. CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, LateAircraftDelay\n- Compare the results with the previous years and identify interesting trends\n- Analysis of passenger and cargo data, ticket pricing and demand patterns between airlines - from a more robust dataset","de8a0b25":"## Package Install and Import\nFirst we will install and import the necessary packages","2c23485f":"There are no cancelled flights in our processed dataset however there were about 9,345 cancelled flights in the original dataset, contributing to some of the null values as I assume, there were no time entries to record","b4e38770":"Based off the analysis, commercial air travel follows seasonal pattern with business peaking around the 7th and 8th month i.e. July and August within a given year and the flight numbers increasing year on year from 2005 to 2008","21b07991":"The flights follow a seasonal pattern with business peaking around the 7th and 8th month i.e. July and August within a given year and flight numbers increasing year on year as evidenced by the darker shades in the heatmap above","776c15f9":"## Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization\n\nFirst we will begin analysis on the processed airline dataset to understand key essential components that make up the dataset. Revisiting the data, let us see how it looked like again.","23060ec2":"It appears short codes have been used for column names and values.\n\nWe can use the carrier file to see the full name of each carrier. The carrier file contains only two columns `Code` and `Description`. We can load it as a Panda series with `Code` as the index and `Description` as the value","2b015039":"How many values are non existent in the airline data set?","a1848a7c":"Majority of the missing values are related to time records. Each variable\/feature has 539,985 entries. I will therefore drop the missing values as they range from 2700 to 14000 (0.6% to less than 3%) of our observations","1df4d7c2":"Let's plot a heat map of all the Null values in our subset","8d5d5bf2":"We've now loaded the dataset. We're ready to move on to the next step of preprocessing & cleaning the data for our analysis.","f9c9ad9c":"The distance is in miles. As can be seen the distance between SFO to LAX is 337 miles. This is supported by https:\/\/www.distance.to\/SFO\/LAX which measures the shortest distance (air line) between SFO and LAX is 337.52 miles (543.19 km).","5db9092c":"Let's plot a heatmap of the processed data","09911f29":"Let's look at the numbers","17ffa74e":"## Cancelled Flights\nIt would be interesting to see the number of cancelled flights within that time period","c196a071":"We have a bimodal dataset with most flights taking about 60 minutes and another set of flights taking about 300 minutes","309ce980":"1186 of the 538,709 (About 0.2% of the) flights in the original dataset were diverted contributing to missing values\n\n","cc8e7ff8":"`carrier_name` is as outlined","9da2e259":"## Distribution of Flights across the years\nLet's look at the flight trends from San Fransico International airport from 2005 to 2008","a48e9195":"TailNum is categorical and therefore rightfully of dtype object. Let's examine the time variables. We need to have them in the `HH:MM `format\n\n","94db30a1":"## Loading the Dataset\nNow we are ready to load the dataset. We will do this using the standard read_csv command from Pandas. Let's take a glimpse at how the data looks like.","4c2dd5a6":"Most of the flight observations range between 337 miles (25th percentile) and 2000 miles (75th percentile) with outliers that go as low as 11 miles and higher than 2500 miles. Year 2005 had a higher spread as evidenced by the height of its box plot,however 2006 through to 2008 had similar distances covered","10e35ff5":"# Commercial Air Travel\n\nIn this Kaggle notebook, we'll analyze the Commercial Air Travel dataset on flights from San Francisco International airport to various destinations from 2005 to 2008. This dataset was obtained from UC Berkeley, Department of Statistics and D-Lab; Data presented by Chris Paciorek. The dataset contains relevant characteristics\/ features of US airlines from 2005 to 2008. You can find the raw data & official analysis here: https:\/\/github.com\/berkeley-scf\/r-bootcamp-2016\/tree\/master\/data.\n\nThere are several options for getting the dataset into Kaggle:\n\n- Download the CSV manually and upload it\n- Use the urlretrieve function from the urllib.request to download CSV files from a raw URL\n- Use a helper library, e.g., opendatasets, which contains a collection of curated datasets and provides a helper function for direct download.\n\nWe'll use our datasets available in Kaggle","57b7cd33":"Let's look at the cumulative trendline","ac5cd93c":"The dataset has 75,304 missing values.
