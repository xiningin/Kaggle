","94b30b11":"Lets examine these arrival or departure cargoes with domestic and international","d37562a8":"In the following scatter diagram and table, we can see how the properties are related to each other.","6ce8f8e2":"As a result,\n\nCargo weights received and send at the begining of 2009 were very low after 2015 they increased gradually.\n\nThe heaviest cargo was moved with domestic and arrival lines in September 2018. It is 82353 tons and its cargo type is freight.\n\nThe lightest cargo was moved with international and arrival lines in November 2010. It is 450 tons and its cargo type is mail.\n\nAlso there is a highly positive correlation between arrival and departure cargo weights for both freight and mail cargo types.\n\nWe can say that from the analysis, generally people prefer to send or receive freight cargoes with international lines(The reason may be due to import or export and especially for arrivals domestic cargoes never exceed international freight cargoes and for departure before 2010 international and domestic cargoes were close to each other.) and for mail cargoes they generally send or receive them with domestic lines (The reason may be mail cargoes are more personal)(However for arrivals its exceed domestic in 2008 and 2013  and also same thing can be for departures in 2013)","b0e480ad":"We can say when we look at the correlation and scatter diagrams there is a highly positive correlation between arrival and departure freight cargo weights.","4906ad97":" The arrival and departure freight cargo with international or domestic according to resampling by months are shown below with line charts.","f8ebe11e":"In the line chart below, we can see the arrival and departure freight cargo with international or domestic according to resampling by months.","dcc1f986":"And maximum weight was moved on July 2007 and weight is 3723.25 tons. ","a7e20394":"The weight of transported mail cargoes decreased in 2007 and 2009. After 2014, weights increased gradually. And it seems in 2017 maximum weight is moved. ","ebed6922":"Departure cargo weights look like much more than arrival weights and scatter diagram is shown below.","7aa0c26d":"Now lets examine the freight cargo types according to arrival or departure.","14bd6426":"Now we see the data types are changed.","c52b093d":"In both departure and arrival cargoes we can see international cargo weights are generally more than domestic. Especially for arrivals.","ebff876f":"Minimum weights of arrival freight cargo is moved on 1st February 2009 and minimum weights of departure freight cargo is on 1st January 2009 and for maximum weight of arrival freight cargo is moved on 1st September 2018 and for departure, it is on 1st August 2018."}}
