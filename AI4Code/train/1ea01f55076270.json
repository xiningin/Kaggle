Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). \n\n<br>A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns to better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.\n\n<br>The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.\n\n<font face=\"Monaco\" size=2 > \n<br>\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u9879\u76ee\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u62e5\u6709\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u94f6\u884c\uff08Thera Bank\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u662f\u5b58\u6b3e\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u7b49\u7684\u5b58\u6b3e\u4eba(\u5c5e\u4e8e\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u8d1f\u503a\uff09\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u5ba2\u6237\uff08\u5c5e\u4e8e\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\uff09\u6570\u91cf\u5f88\u5c11\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u5e0c\u671b\u8fc5\u901f\u6269\u5927\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u5ba2\u6237\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f00\u5c55\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\u4e1a\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u8d37\u6b3e\u5229\u606f\u8d5a\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u3002\u7ba1\u7406\u5c42\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u5c06\u5b58\u6b3e\u5ba2\u6237\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8d37\u6b3e\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\n\n<br>Thera Bank\u5728\u53bb\u5e74\u9488\u5bf9\u5b58\u6b3e\u5ba2\u6237\u5f00\u5c55\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u6d3b\u52a8\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e869\uff05\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b58\u8f6c\u8d37\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u9f13\u52b1\u4e86\u96f6\u552e\u8425\u9500\u90e8\u95e8\u53bb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u591a\u6d3b\u52a8\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\n\n<br>\u8be5\u90e8\u95e8\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5ba2\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u6d3b\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u3002\n    ","03e8e6ca":"<img src=\"https:\/\/i.loli.net\/2020\/09\/02\/NmsUyIcfl25AEux.png\" width=\"550\">","19ae17af":"#### <font face=\"Frutiger\" size=2 color=#008080 > 5.3 Three-Factor Relationship","f004bf0e":"#### <font face=\"Frutiger\" size=4 color=#008080 >Outline","5d2d61a7":"<font face=\"Frutiger\" size=2> \n+ Customers in CC Avg range from \\\\$0 - \\\\$8,400 with the CD account have the higher proportion of purchasing the personal loan than customers who do not have the CD account.\n+ Customers who have the CD account in CC Avg range from \\\\$3,000-\\\\$8,100 have the above average proportion of purchasing the personal loan.\n+ \u6709\u5b58\u6b3e\u5e10\u6237\u4e14\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u6708\u6d88\u8d39\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a\\\\ $ 0-\\\\ $ 8,400\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u8d2d\u4e70\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d37\u6b3e\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8981\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6ca1\u6709\u5b58\u6b3e\u5e10\u6237\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\n+ \u6709\u5b58\u6b3e\u5e10\u6237\u4e14\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u6708\u6d88\u8d39\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a\\\\ $ 3,000-\\\\\\ $ 8,100\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d37\u6b3e\u8d2d\u4e70\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002\n","60f44379":"+ <font face=\"Frutiger\" size=2> The mortgage range from \\\\$0-\\\\$52,000 has the highest proportion 6.24% of customers who purchased personal loan. \n+ There are no significant difference in proportion in the rest of the mortgage bin.\n+ \u4ece\\\\$ 0\u81f3\\\\$ 52,000\u7684\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u8303\u56f4\u5360\u8d2d\u4e70\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d37\u6b3e\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3a6.24\uff05\u3002\n+ \u5176\u4f59\u62b5\u62bc\u623f\u5c4b\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u7740\u5dee\u5f02.","c88cdeae":"<img src=\"https:\/\/i.loli.net\/2020\/09\/02\/yiZTnUr7fLYhIwb.png\" width=\"500\">","1cb8f7d9":"#### <font face=\"Frutiger\" size=3 color=#008080 >2.
