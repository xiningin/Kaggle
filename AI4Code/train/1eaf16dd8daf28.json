In general practise they should not be skipped as they would be a key part of a recommendation system.","4ee99656":"As we can see here, there are clearly more movies than TV Shows on Netflix, but we can dive deeper into the data and find out if this has changed over time.","2fcee729":"Here we can see that the \"director\", \"cast\", \"country\", \"date_added\" and \"rating\" columns have missing values.
