Potential fake accounts behind downvoting?\n\nAfter metnioning to a user that they were copying other's work without referencing them, I noticed my comment that once had 4 upvotes, suddenly had -5 votes. I found this strange that so many people at once downvoted my comment. After a little investigation I noticed something strange that leads me to believe fake accounts were created.\n\n**Update**: This thread brought more attention to the matter and I decided to make this kernel public: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/product-feedback\/76394","a5883964":"## Who are these friends?\n\nInteresting...

Oddly there are a group of users who upvoted vote on 20+ of them. This isn't too strange. Maybe these are just his friends?\n\n**Update** It appears there are only 23 kernels by this user now. Maybe some were taken down. Also the number of votes by these potential fake accounts has changed. Maybe the user caught on and changed their voting patters to only 10 votes on a single kernel.","f2aa2674":"## What other kernels do these users vote on? Maybe they just like upvoting?\nNope. While they have all voted enough to have a `contributor` status. They all seem to overlap voting for this one user.","e74b842f":"## User in question\nThe first thing I noticed was that the user in question had a handful of followers with generic sounding names, that only followed this user.","9c0620a6":"## Who do they follow?"}}
