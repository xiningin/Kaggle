This is better than simply choosing 0 all the time (the target incidence suggests that such a model would have 76% success rate). If you plan to use TPOT in the future, I strongly suggest you look at its excellent [documentation](http:\/\/epistasislab.github.io\/tpot\/). You can further improve the auc score by removing outliers as logistic regression is sensitive to outliers. Thus, removing outliers can further improve it.\n\nThank you for reading my notebook,please upvote it if you like it.\n ","f09259e5":"NOTE:\n\n> We can see that there is no missing vale for any row.\n\n> The datatype for all features is integer.","583cba89":"# **Data Exploration**\n","97304ab6":"5.**Checking target incidence**\n\nWe want to predict whether or not the same donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.

Introduction**\n\nBlood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. The demand for blood fluctuates throughout the year. As one prominent example, blood donations slow down during busy holiday seasons. An accurate forecast for the future supply of blood allows for an appropriate action to be taken ahead of time and therefore saving more lives.\n\nAim Of Project:\n\nTo build a model which can identify who is likely to donate blood again using TPOT. TPOT can eliminate the most tedious part of machine learning seemlessly and effortlessly more than ever. TPOT is meant to be an assistant that gives you ideas on how to solve a particular machine learning problem by exploring pipeline configurations that you might have never considered, then leaves the fine-tuning to more constrained parameter tuning techniques.\n\nYou can reach TPOT website and documentation from [TPOT](http:\/\/epistasislab.github.io\/tpot\/).\n\nLet's get started exploring the data","41866d05":"NOTE:\n\n> We can see that there are 576 rows and 6 columns in our training dataset\n\n> We can see that there are 200 rows and 5 columns in our test dataset"}}
