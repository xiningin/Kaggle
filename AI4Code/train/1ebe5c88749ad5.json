However, as many living and nonliving things make noise, the analysis of these datasets is often done manually by domain experts. These analyses are painstakingly slow, and results are often incomplete. Data science may be able to assist, so researchers have turned to large crowdsourced databases of focal recordings of birds to train AI models. Unfortunately, there is a domain mismatch between the training data (short recording of individual birds) and the soundscape recordings (long recordings with often multiple species calling at the same time) used in monitoring applications. This is one of the reasons why the performance of the currently used AI models has been subpar.\n\nTo unlock the full potential of these extensive and information-rich sound archives, researchers need good machine listeners to reliably extract as much information as possible to aid data-driven conservation.\n\nThe [Cornell Lab of Ornithology\u2019s Center for Conservation Bioacoustics (CCB)\u2019s](https:\/\/www.birds.cornell.edu\/ccb\/) mission is to collect and interpret sounds in nature. The CCB develops innovative conservation technologies to inspire and inform the conservation of wildlife and habitats globally. By partnering with the data science community, the CCB hopes to further its mission and improve the accuracy of soundscape analyses.\n<\/font>\n\n<br><br>\n*Notes: This is from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/birdsong-recognition description.*","2217b3c6":"<font size=\"2\">   \nSo We have lots of files here :\n<\/font>\n<br>\n\n\n> * train_audio :> Consists of Short Recordings of individual Bird Calls\n> * sample_submission.csv :> Sample of our Submission file (How it should be)\n> * test.csv, example_test_audio_summary.csv, example_test_audio_metadata.csv, example_test_audio :> These are the files related to our Test Data.
