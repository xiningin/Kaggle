we loaded wine data then we moved on to check if there is any null or missing value in the dataset here this wasnt the case we had preprocessed dataset so we moved on to visulaize the correkation of the parameter present in the dataset using corr() after that we plotted it using matplotlib and we went to vidualize whole dataset using hist() to better insight of the dataset.\n  - ### There was one minor issue : so first after we visualized data we took Quality of wine and converted it to cateogrical value (True or False) since we can say that if a wine has quality value over 5 its is a good vine otherwise its a not good wine( Here are just classifying wine based on True and False i.e if it has quality score over 5 and not on values from 3-8) so the next step to change the value of quality.\n  \n  - ### After that we can now split our data into training data and testing data and now we use standard scaler to standardize our both data (training as well as testing).\n  \n  - ###
