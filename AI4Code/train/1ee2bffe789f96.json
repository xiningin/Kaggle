Our goal is to find how many products are included in each order.\n\nTo achieve this, we follow a procedure that consists of two steps:\n1. Split our DataFrame into groups: The groups are created based on the different values that can be found on a specific column (in our case different order numbers in the column \"order_id\"). Note that the column has categorical data rather than actual values.\n2. Apply an aggregation function on them: Aggregation functions are actually all these functions that can turn the values of a column of group into a single value. Some aggregation functions are the mean, count, sum, max & min.\n\nIn our case we use count() aggregation function which returns the number of values found on a column (in our case product_id).
