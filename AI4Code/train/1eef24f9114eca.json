Scatter plots:","dcf59c36":"***What can be done about it?***\n\n1. We can use Spearman's correlation method.\n2. We can also bin the values in wei and plot the percentiles of the values of ei in each bin of wei.\n3. We can also take the logarithms of ei and then find Pearson's correlation; if there is a skewness in the data.\n\n***Let's use these 3 methods one at a time.***","9c719cc7":"***What is characterizing relationships?***\n\n1. A process in which we \"bin\" one variable (in our case, Women Entrepreneurship Index) and plot the percentiles of the other (Entrepreneurship Index).\n2. The codes would certainly be a better explaination of the concept.\n\n***What is the benefit?***\n\n1. It is, in my opinion, furthering the applications of scatter plots, that is to visualize the relationships.\n2. It provides more insights into the nature of the relationship.","065f6bc5":"***What does the output tell us?***\n\n1. As assumed, the variables are strongly correlated.\n2. The magnitude is more than 0.9.

Spearman's correlation method:","f28528af":"In a previous notebook, I have discussed at length about correlation as whole with special emphasis on \"scatter plots\" and \"Pearson's method\". Therefore, I would want the generous audience to view that notebook to have a better understanding of a couple of primitive methods which we use to find the correlation between two variables.

Not a single of the three lines is straight, which suggests that they are not linear, that further suggests that there is a number of outliers in our data and that the resulting skewness is justified.\n2. This also means that there is not a strong correlation! However, ***that very assumption is questionable***.\n\n***Why is that questionable?***\n\n1. We have a very little data. \n2. Therefore, when we plot the graph, the are highlighted contains a small amount of data.\n3. For instance, of the line pointing to the 75th percentiles, a dip is vissible between 40 and 50 on the x-axis. Nonetheless, that dip is not quite significant as it appears to be. Had we had more amount of data, this wouldn't have appeared to be a great deal of significant.\n\n***We are content with the previous result that is there is a strong correlation between the variables.***","553ed634":"The distribution of both the variables is not normal. This gives us a reason to rule out the possibility of the Pearson's correlation being the best possible in this case.\n\n***What are the other reasons for which the actual correlation is in contravention with the Pearson's method?***\n\n1. The presence of outliers (skewness in the data). We saw in the first part of the series, that both the variables are positively skewed.\n2. If the relationship between the variables is non-linear.","1594566a":"***What does the plot tell us?***\n\n1. The relationship is almost linear.\n2. The data that we have with us is mere 51 in number. Therefore, I conclude that had we have more data, the data plot would have been more linearly scattered.\n3. A strong correlationship in my opinion exists.","0a50002c":"***Why this method?***\n\nAs we have seen in the first part, the values of our variables are skewed. Therefore, to reduce the effect of the skewness, we take the log of the values and then find the correlation. \n\n***What if only one variable had skewness not both?***\n\nWe would take the log of the variables of that variable only, not both."}}
