I highly suggest you to go to that link and get a high level overview of what is present inside this dataset. The techniques used in this notebook is inspired from [this](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/reighns\/augmentations-data-cleaning-and-bounding-boxes) notebook by [reigHns](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/reighns)\nFor best learning experience, fork this notebook and follow along","41a23e62":"Damn, this means only these two columns are storing numeric values. But the values look same for every row, so they're kinda  useless right now. Get your surgical gloves on, because we'll need to do some serious operations on this thing.\n"}}
