Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and serverless computing environments.\n\nIn April 2008, Google announced App Engine, a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers, which was the first cloud computing service from the company. The service became generally available in November 2011. Since the announcement of App Engine, Google added multiple cloud services to the platform.\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform is a part of Google Cloud, which includes the Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as G Suite, enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and enterprise mapping services.\n\n**Source:** Wikipedia","97bd3a3c":"### Learning Rate: 0.002, Epochs: 10, Patience: 5","f3c870ac":"# Model Training - Parameter Tuning\n\nFor model training, I am using GreatGameDota's script found at https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/greatgamedota\/xception-classifier-w-ffhq-training-lb-537.","66090555":"## Resnext Model","0ec691f3":"## Epochs, Factor, Learning Rates & Patience (IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTAL NOTES)\n\nI've tried various learning rates `lr` (0.001, 0.0015, 0.002, 0.004), `epochs` (10, 12, 20, 42), `patience` (2, 5, 7) and `factor` (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7). The result from these is the score of 0.50480 for the Xception single model, and 0.43846 for the Resnext + Xception esemble. Further tweeking of these parameters do help increase the public LB score by a bit. Also, yet interestingly, as the score of the single model Xception decreases, the higher scoring esembles have equal weights, i.e. 0.5 for Resnext and 0.5 for Xception. \n\nFeel free to tweek these parameters further! Note that the total time for each run of 30 epochs or more on Google Cloud Compute took **more than 20 hours**. So it may be wise to plan your parameters properly based on the insights gathered from past trainings!","8b1b8d3e":"## Xception Model","05353da8":"Once you are able to see that, click on the dropdown icon beside SSH and click 'Open in broswer window' (see above).
