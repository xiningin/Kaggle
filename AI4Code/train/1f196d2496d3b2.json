While overuse injuries can occur, traumatic injuries such as concussions are most common. The force applied to either bringing an opponent to the ground or resisting being brought to the ground makes football players prone to injury anywhere on their bodies, regardless of protective equipment.\"<\/i> - Football Injuries, University of Rochester Medical Center \n\nSource: \u201cFootball Injuries.\u201d UR Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, University of Rochester Medical Center, 2010, www.urmc.rochester.edu\/orthopaedics\/sports-medicine\/football-injuries.cfm. \n\nGiven the context above, it might be possible to identify the moment of injury by tracking the instant when the maximum change occurs in all the variables associated with movement. \n\nWe will create a new DataFrame with variables that reflect the player's motion during the play. \n\n- delta_dir: Change in angle of player motion\n- delta_o: Change in player orientation\n- delta_s: Change in player speed\n\nNote: \n- x and y capture the location of the player on the field and they are not as important in identifying when the injury occured.\n- dis captures the distance travelled and s captures the speed which is the distance travelled over the time difference so there is no need to include both variables.
