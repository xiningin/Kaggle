Running python scripts with the \u2018i\u2019 option\n\nA typical way of running a python script from the command line is:  `python hello.py.`  However, if you add an additional  `-i` while running the same script e.g  `python -i hello.py`  it offers more advantages. Let\u2019s see how.\n\n-   Firstly, once the end of the program is reached, python doesn\u2019t exit the interpreter. As such we can check the values of the variables and the correctness of the functions defined in our program.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*XInqaE5tHueOrxn_--uzEA.gif)\n\n-   Secondly, we can easily invoke a python debugger since we are still in the interpreter by:\n```\n    import pdb  \n    pdb.pm()\n```\nThis will bring us o the position where the exception has occurred and we can then work upon the code.\n\n_The original_ [_source_](http:\/\/www.bnikolic.co.uk\/blog\/python-running-cline.html) _of the hack._\n","1f980b88":"The report can also be exported into an interactive HTML file with the following code.","f0bbdc79":"### Usage\n\nLet\u2019s use the titanic dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of the versatile python profiler.","63ffaff4":"## 10.

Finding and Eliminating Errors\n\nThe  **interactive debugger**  is also a magic function but I have given it a category of its own. If you get an exception while running the code cell, type  `%debug`  in a new line and run it. This opens an interactive debugging environment which brings you to the position where the exception has occurred. You can also check for values of variables assigned in the program and also perform operations here. To exit the debugger hit  `q`.\n","522bbf60":"To display the report in a Jupyter notebook, run the following code.

Interactive Pandas' plots\n\nThe **Pandas** library has a built-in `.plot()`  function as part of the DataFrame class. However,the visualisations rendered with this function aren't interactive and that makes it less appealing. On the contrary, the ease to plot charts with `pandas.DataFrame.plot()` function also cannot be ruled out. What if we could plot interactive plotly like charts with pandas without having to make major modifications to the code? Well, you can actually do that with the help of [**Cufflinks**](https:\/\/github.com\/santosjorge\/cufflinks) library.\n\nCufflinks library binds the power of  [**plotly**](http:\/\/www.plot.ly\/)  with the flexibility of  [pandas](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/)  for easy plotting.

However, it only gives a very basic overview of the data and doesn\u2019t help much in the case of large data sets.
