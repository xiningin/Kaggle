BigQuery also offers BigQuery ML, an easy way for users to create and run machine learning models to generate predictions through a SQL query interface.\n\nAlright, stop waiting and get started!","e313b0eb":"**Time Features**","368840dd":"** Total Time Stopped**","26d5aa59":"** What is BigQuery ML and when should you use it? ** \n\nBigQuery Machine Learning (BQML) is a toolset that allows you to train and serve machine learning models directly in BigQuery. This has several advantages:\n\nYou don't have to read your data into local memory. One question I get a lot is \"how can I train my ML model if my dataset is just too big to fit on my computer?\". You can subsample your dataset, of course, but you can also use tools like BQML that train your model directly in your database.\nYou don't have to use multiple languages. Particularly if you're working in a team where most of your teammates don't know Python or R or your preferred language for modelling, working in SQL can make it easier for you to collaborate.\nYou can serve your model immediately after it's trained. Because your model is already in the same place as your data, you can make predictions directly from your database. This lets you get around the hassle of cleaning up your code and either putting it intro production or passing it off to your engineering colleagues.\nBQML probably won't replace all your modelling tools, but it's a nice quick way to train and serve a model without spending a lot of time moving code or data around.\n\n**Models supported by BQML**\n\n  One limitation of BQML is that a limited number of model types are supported. As of August 6, 2019, BQML supports the following         types of models. More model types are being built out, though, so check the documentation for the most\n\n* Linear regression (LINEAR_REG). This is the OG modelling technique, used to predict the value of a continuous variable. This is what you'd use for questions like \"how many units can we expect a custom to buy?\".\n* Logistic regression (LOGISTIC_REG). This regression technique lets you classify which category an observation fits in to. For example, \"will this person buy the blue one or the red one?\".\n* K-means (KMEANS). This is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. It lets you identify categories. For example, \"given all of the customers in our database, how could we identify five distinct groups?\".\n* Tensorflow (TENSORFLOW). If you've already got a trained TensorFlow model, you can upload it to BQML and serve it directly from there. You can't currently train a TensorFlow model in BQML.","f6d2681f":"In this section, we are going analysis the total time stopped on the intersections in different cities.\n\n","09df8f49":"We are asked to predict TotalTimeStopped_p20, TotalTimeStopped_p50, TotalTimeStopped_p80, DistanceToFirstStop_p20, DistanceToFirstStop_p50 and DistanceToFirstStop_p80\n\nWe also have a feature called TimeFromFirstStop_px in the training set that can be usefull\n\nOther percentiles for the features mention recently can be found in the training set.

Harnessing the insights from this data has the power to improve safety, optimize operations, and identify opportunities for infrastructure challenges.\n\nThe dataset for this competition includes aggregate stopped vehicle information and intersection wait times. Your task is to predict congestion, based on an aggregate measure of stopping distance and waiting times, at intersections in 4 major US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago & Philadelphia.\n\n![](https:\/\/hotshotwarriors.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/I-95-Traffic.jpg)"}}
