But we know that passangers registered with Mr, Mrs, Master and other royal names would probably be rich and would have been given preference while saving and transferring using life boats.

Assuming that passangers from each cabin in a particular deck has equal probabilty of survival, e.g:- a passanger from C123 and C20 each, has same chance of survival. And, a passanger from B83 and B12 each, has same chance of survival, you get the point, we'll remove the cabin number and just keep the deck of the cabin. For missing values of cabin, we'll use \"U\" for unknown.\nAfter getting the deck values for all the passangers, we'll categorize them in deck A, B, C, D, E, F, G, T and U.","934edcae":"<h2>7.
