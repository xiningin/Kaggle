So it seems people are spending more money on presents from new merchants, therefore the \"loyal\" merchants suffered from that during Christmas shopping season...","2dda362e":"I saw most of the kernels using *magic* 2018-02 month as a reference point for calculating date features. However, when I looked at the data it was obvious that this doesn't hold for each `card_id`. \n\nLet's try to extract the correct reference point (let's call it `observation_date`) for each `card_id`."}}
