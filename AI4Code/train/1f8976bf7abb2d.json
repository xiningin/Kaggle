Once the eye is trained enough, in a glimpse it is possible to see much more than that: `perimeter points_worst` values are correlated with their SHAP values (colors seem to advance in order from left to right), and it can be a really good indicator of benign tissue (the points in the right-most side of the graph are further from zero than in other variables. In the second variable, the `perimeter_worst` variable is not as disperse in its SHAP values, but the majority of values are not in zero (which implies no influence in the prediction).\n\nWe can take a step down the abstraction scale and see individual features dependence plots. These graphs plot the feature's value respect to its SHAP value, letting us understand easily how they are related. SHAP also plots a second variables value, which is automatically chosen depending its interaction with the feature at hand. That way the library helps us find multi-dimensional dependences in the data.\n\nBelow we can see the dependence plot of `perimeter_worst`: as seen in the dependence plot, higher values of the variable are related to higher SHAP values. We can also see that this relation is not linear, but closer to having a threshold around 110. We can also see how the color denotes that when the `perimeter_worst` has a low value, `texture_worst` makes the SHAP value lower the higher it is.","58062441":"This model is able to make accurate predictions, but thanks to these SHAP interpretations also its explanations are available, which provides practitioners with useful information to understand the model and data scientists with valuable information to tune it.\n\n**Note**: putting it simply, in this models \"red means good\" and \"blue means bad\". That can be misleading at times, so if you are struggling with it you can change the color of it. Try running the function with the keyword argument `plot_cmap=['#00AA00', '#EE2222']` to turn it into \"green means good\", \"red means bad\".","d258d2da":"The first artifact that can be generated with these values is a summary plot, which plots the most important features for the model along with a visual intuition on how they influence it. Due to these model's nature, each sample has to be studied individually, so most of these graphs are just an aggregation of all these samples.\n\nWe can see that, along with the name of a variable, there is a plot. In it, each point being a sample and its color the value of the feature in it, we can see its SHAP value in the horizontal axis. Take into account that high SHAP values contribute to the sample being benign, and low values contributing to it being malign.","09eaccf2":"The main cross validation loop runs, computing also the `scale_pos_weight` parameter (which compensates unbalanceness in the training data) per fold. The final results are quite satisfactory.","8cf0f6dd":"This one is a relatively well behaved dataset and we are not in a competition, so a minimal parametrization will be performed. The main thing to highlight is that using `binary:logistic` as objective function and `auc` as the evaluation metric seem to be adequeate for the task. Also, this will make the tree return continuous probabilities, which are always useful for this problemas. We can round later if needed.","08703069":"# Using SHAP values for XGBoost interpretability\n\nMost of the algorithms whose popularity has risen over the recent years are considered **black box methods**. Contrary to interpretable methods, that produce predictions that can be explained by taking a look at the inner workings of the model, black box methods present the prediction as a mistery to the user. One of the most trivially interpretable methods, decision trees, provide a trivial way of interpreting: generating a binary decission tree: \"if X then A, else B\" is enough to traverse the tree checking each sample to understand their prediction. On the other hand, neural networks seem to magically fit to training data, and then use their obscure weights to spit a prediction. Similarly, gradient techniques like the ones used in XGBoost may use dozens of trees for regularization, rendering their interpretability as useless for most users.\n\nThis notebook aims to be both an introduction to [SHAP](https:\/\/github.com\/slundberg\/shap), which presents itself as \"a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model\", and a motivation to understand interpretability in a different way than it is popularly imagined. It is obvious for most data scientist that we will not be able to understand a neural network inner workings as trivially as the ones of a decision tree, but studying the relation between its input and outputs using an unified approach as SHAP can help the community (and with some pedagogy, a client) understand how a ML model is making predictions.","9c877e35":"## Conclusions\n\nIt is important to understand that while Linear Models exploit the average of all the training samples, Machine Learning usually is able to exploit individual charactersitics to perform a non-uniform prediction. Therefore, a general interpretability of the model is hard and prone to miss plenty of information. On the other hand, the interpretability of a single sample can be as straightforward as a force plot, which provides a lot of visual information.\n\nHopefully this kernel helps you find the motivation to look for interpretability of your models, and exploit the information that it can provide. Interpretability is the only way to demystify ML\/DL algorithms for non-specialized people, and clear its inclusion as a general tool to solve different problems in industry or society.","ae8c48f9":"However, SHAP values are especially useful when interpreting individual results. Lowering the abstraction from the general model to a single prediction makes the interpretation much more intuitive, resulting in more useful explanations. The example of this are force plots, where the horizontal axis are the SHAP value of the final prediction and each feature's contribution is shown a block: left of the result, the positive SHAP values (\"pushing\" the probability higher) and lower SHAP values in the right (\"pushing\" the probability lower).\n\nWe can see an example of it in a case of benign tissue (the first one in the training data). We can see how the final SHAP value (which can be transformed from a continuous domain to probability using a sigmoid) is 2.29 and higher than the base value, therefore predicted as benign. The representation shows how, despite the texture having anomalous values, the concavity and perimeter features finally turn the prediction to the positive side. The highest contribution is the one by `concave points_worst`.","83a0900a":"On the other hand, we can see that in an example of malign tissue (the 371st sample) the concavity, texture and perimeter of the cells make the model predict it as a negative case.","7a3cd00e":"In the confusion matrix is also possible to see how the discrete predictions out of the probabilities have a great performance: an average precision of around 95%. Still, take into account that no parameter search or feature engineering has been performed, so there is plenty of room for improvement. This is, however, out of the scope of the kernel.","cb87da97":"We can drop the `id` and the original `diagnosis` column: we will not be using them anymore in this notebook. Also, let's split the data in the conventional names: `X` for the feature matrix, and `y` for the labels vector.","445e6dc4":"It also contains the `diagnosis` column as the label of the samples, which is `B` for benign results and ` M` for malign. For XGBoost to properly manage the data, we must transform all columns to numeric values. In this case, only transforming the `diagnosis` columns is necessary. Creating a binary `benign` columns indicating if the tumor was benign or not should suffice.","6235cce7":"## The data: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset\n\nFor this demo, we will use the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, which contains 30 features extracted from an image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features represent different characterstics like the texture or the simmetry computed for each cell, and presented as the mean, standard deviation and \"worst\" (sum of the three largest values) of each of them.","bce34417":"Another interesting dependence plot is the one of `radius_worst`, that shows two clearly differentiated segments. This time, it is clear that low values of `radius_worst` imply a lower probability of it benign, and the samples in that segment with high `concavity_worst` seem to indicate a higher risk of malign tumors. High values of both `radius_worst` and `concavity_worse` indicate healthy tissue.","f2a8e650":"We will be using a 5-folds cross validation to train the model. Remember kids, always cross-validate your results!","337aebf4":"## Explaining the model with SHAP values\n\nUsing the SHAP module, we can generate different explainers: objects used to compute the SHAP values for each sample. These values are a representation of the impact of a certain feature in a prediction: positive values contribute to increase the final probability and negative values contribute to decrease it. This can be confusing now, but will get easier with the examples below.\n\nWe will compute these values for all the samples, `X`. This matrix, `shap_values`, is related with the training data: The element `shap_values[i, j]` is the SHAP value of the `i` sample's `j` feature. These values are not exclusive to XGBoost: plenty of other models have optimized explainers in SHAP, and the technique itself is model-agnostic.
