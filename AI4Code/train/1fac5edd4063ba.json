During the period of 1996 to 2000, only 38% of the scholarly scientific articles published by Brazilians were authored by women. That is, just since 2000, Brazilian women have reached near-parity with men when it comes to scientific authorship.\n\nBrazil also fares well in other indicators featured in the study. The proportion of female inventors in Brazil rose from 11% to 17% between 1996 and 2015. Today, the proportion of female inventors in Brazil is higher than in the United States (14%), United Kingdom (12%) or the European Union (12%).https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/shannonsims\/2017\/03\/08\/surprising-new-study-brazil-now-a-global-leader-in-gender-equality-in-science\/#68b4f3c76f44","3f655f87":"#Valerie Thomas\n\nShe is an African American scientist and inventor best known for her patented illusion transmitter and contributions to NASA research. \n\nValerie Thomas' interest in math and science were not encouraged until her college years. After graduating with a degree in chemistry, Thomas accepted a position at NASA. She remained there until her retirement in 1995. During that time, Thomas received a patent for an illusion transmitter and contributed broadly to the organization's research efforts.\n\nValerie Thomas was born in February 1943 in Maryland. Fascinated by technology from a young age, Thomas was not encouraged to explore science. At the age of 8, she checked a book called The Boy's First Book On Electronics out of the local library. Her father would not work on any of the projects with his daughter, despite his own interest in electronics.\n\nThomas attended a high school for girls that downplayed math and science. After graduating from high school, Thomas finally got a chance to explore her interests as a student at Morgan State University. She was one of only two women at Morgan to major in physics. Thomas excelled in her studies. She graduated from Morgan and accepted a position as a data analyst at NASA.\nhttps:\/\/www.biography.com\/scientist\/valerie-thomas","10e357b5":"#Ada Lovelace\n\nAugusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (n\u00e9e Byron; 10 December 1815 \u2013 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.

This led some women to apply for patents #in their husbands\u2019 names if they decided to apply at all.\n\nAs of last year,\n#only 10 percent of U.S. patent holders were women, although women account for half of doctoral degrees in science and engineering. #This disparity is due in part to the the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office being more likely to reject patents with women as sole #applicants.\n\n#Further, when patents sought by women are approved, they are more likely to have added parameters that made the description of the #patents far more detailed. These revisions tend to lower the scope of the patent, making it weaker and less valuable.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that women face more scrutiny in STEM fields, which is why the women on this list have more to be congratulated on than their inventions.
