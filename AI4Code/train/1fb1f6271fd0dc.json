The predictive model that you\u2019re going to build will serve two purposes:\n\nIt will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.\n\nIt will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.\n\n \n\nIn some cases, both of the above-stated goals can be achieved by a single machine learning model. But here, you have a large number of attributes, and thus you should try using a dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA and then build a predictive model. After PCA, you can use any classification model.\n\n \n\nAlso, since the rate of churn is typically low (about 5-10%, this is called class-imbalance) - try using techniques to handle class imbalance. \n\n \n\nYou can take the following suggestive steps to build the model:\n\n1. Preprocess data (convert columns to appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.)\n\n2. Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modelling\/feature engineering).\n\n3. Derive new features.\n\n4. Reduce the number of variables using PCA.\n\n5. Train a variety of models, tune model hyperparameters, etc. (handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques).\n\n6. Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that is is more important to identify churners than the non-churners accurately - choose an appropriate evaluation metric which reflects this business goal.\n\n7. Finally, choose a model based on some evaluation metric.\n\n \n\nThe above model will only be able to achieve one of the two goals - to predict customers who will churn. We can\u2019t use the above model to identify the important features for churn. That\u2019s because PCA usually creates components which are not easy to interpret.\n\n \n\nTherefore, build another model with the main objective of identifying important predictor attributes which help the business understand indicators of churn. A good choice to identify important variables is a **logistic regression model** or a model from the **tree family**. In case of logistic regression, make sure to handle multi-collinearity.\n\n \n\nAfter identifying important predictors, display them visually - you can use plots, summary tables etc. - whatever you think best conveys the importance of features.\n\n \n\nFinally, **recommend strategies to manage customer churn** based on your observations.\n\n \n\n","abb8a663":"The data dictionary contains meanings of abbreviations.

For example, many users in rural areas only receive calls from their wage-earning siblings in urban areas.\n\n \n\n**Usage-based churn:** Customers who have not done any usage, either incoming or outgoing - in terms of calls, internet etc. over a period of time.\n\n \n\nA potential shortcoming of this definition is that when the customer has stopped using the services for a while, it may be too late to take any corrective actions to retain them. For e.g., if you define churn based on a \u2018two-months zero usage\u2019 period, predicting churn could be useless since by that time the customer would have already switched to another operator.\n\n \n\nIn this project, we will use the **usage-based definition** to define churn.\n\n"}}
