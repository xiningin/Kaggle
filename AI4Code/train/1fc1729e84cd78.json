A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong.\n","24857b53":"### Load Data From CSV File\n","c5e7d328":"\n\n# SVM (Support Vector Machines)\n\n\n## Objectives\n\n\n-   Use scikit-learn to Support Vector Machine to classify\n","ff7cc33b":"After being fitted, the model can then be used to predict new values:\n","182676d8":"The SVM algorithm offers a choice of kernel functions for performing its processing. Basically, mapping data into a higher dimensional space is called kernelling. The mathematical function used for the transformation is known as the\u00a0kernel\u00a0function, and can be of different types, such as:\n\n```\n1.Linear\n2.Polynomial\n3.Radial basis function (RBF)\n4.Sigmoid\n```\n\nEach of these functions has its characteristics, its pros and cons, and its equation, but as there's no easy way of knowing which function performs best with any given dataset, we usually choose different functions in turn and compare the results. Let's just use the default, RBF (Radial Basis Function) for this lab.\n","8e0c02bc":"#### THANKU FOR READING MY NOTEBOOK","3c459156":"<h1>Table of contents<\/h1>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n    <ol>\n        <li><a href=\"#load_dataset\">Load the Cancer data<\/a><\/li>\n        <li><a href=\"#modeling\">Modeling<\/a><\/li>\n        <li><a href=\"#evaluation\">Evaluation<\/a><\/li>\n        <li><a href=\"#practice\">Practice<\/a><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<br>\n<hr>\n","179f6119":"Lets first look at columns data types:\n"}}
