Whether you are going to build a Machine Learning Model or if it's just an exercise to bring out insights from the given data, EDA is the primary task to perform. While it's undeniable that EDA is very important, The task of performing Exploratory Data Analysis grows in parallel with the number of columns your dataset has got. \n\nFor ex: Assume you've got a dataset with 10 rows x 2 columns. It's very simply to specify those two column names separately and plot all the required plots to perform EDA. Alternatively, If the dataset has got 20 columns, you've to repeat the same above exercise for another 10 times. Now, there's another layer of complexity because the visualization that you choose for a `continuous variable` and `categorical variable` is different, hence the type of the plot changes when the data type changes. \n\nGiven all these conditions, EDA sometimes becomes a tedious task - but remember it's all driven by a set of rules - like plot `boxplot` and `histogram` for a continous variable, Measure `missing values`, Calculate `frequency` if it's categorical variable - thus giving us opportunity to automate things. That's the base of this python module `pandas_profiling` that helps one in automating the first-level of EDA.
