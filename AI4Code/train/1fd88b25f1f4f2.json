Accurately predicting house prices can be a daunting task. The buyers are just not concerned about the size(square feet) of the house and there are various other factors that play a key role to decide the price of a house\/property. It can be extremely difficult to figure out the right set of attributes that are contributing to understanding the buyer's behavior as such. This dataset has been collected across various property aggregators across India. In this competition, provided the 12 influencing factors your role as a data scientist is to predict the prices as accurately as possible.\n","717ea4d4":"Attributes Description:\n        Column-\tDescription\n        POSTED_BY-\tCategory marking who has listed the property\n        UNDER_CONSTRUCTION-\tUnder Construction or Not\n        RERA-\tRera approved or Not\n        BHK_NO-\tNumber of Rooms\n        BHKORRK-\tType of property\n        SQUARE_FT-\tTotal area of the house in square feet\n        READYTOMOVE-\tCategory marking Ready to move or Not\n        RESALE-\tCategory marking Resale or not\n        ADDRESS-\tAddress of the property\n        LONGITUDE-\tLongitude of the property\n        LATITUDE-\tLatitude of the property\n","aa0660cd":"Here we will find how the price of the house depends on the person(i.e, dealer , owner or builder) who posted the ad of selling house.","2199c7cc":"Here we could observe in the provided scatterplot that the outliers are removed.\nAnd it could be observed that the property posted by dealer costs quite higher than others","149d14c3":"## POSTED_BY","e4f6ec26":"## RESALE ","ef3f82c2":"Here we could see that there is no null value in the dataset.","66b85fe8":"Ready to move houses costs quit large than other type.","1255a148":"## BHK OR RK","c5c60b80":"0:- no not ready to move             \n1:- yes ready to move","e3c67f74":"From the above scatterplot it is quit evident that there are some outlier in the provided data","14d524de":"## ADDRESS ","cc2250d5":"##  RERA","f8b25ef5":"Here the price distribution is quit significant in both cases","6f96aacb":"0 :- construction completed       \n      1:- under construction","8790ec7f":"0:-RERA not approved                            \n1:-RERA approved","013f53ca":"## Under-Construction ","f1bbc62b":"## BHK_NO ","7a222f25":"##  DecisionTreeRegressor","4b8433b6":"## Spliting of data "}}
