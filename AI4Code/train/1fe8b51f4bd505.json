population distribution of these regions. Sadly, some populated regions have low GDP (\\$ per capita).","af057eae":"In order to avoid loss of 21% of data, we fill the missing values in all 'NaN' containing columns. As median is a better statistical parameter here than mean because of some skewness of data in variables, we fill the missing values with the median of each region obtained for each variable.  Only in the case of  'Climate' column which has categorical data, the missing data is filled by the mode of that specific region. Dealing with missing values is a crucial step in any data analysis. Therefore, before deciding which parameter to use to fill the missing value, the distribution of the data should be carefully observed. Then we can check that we have filled all the missing values by using `isnull().sum()` function on dataframe (as done before).","16b5ee16":"For further analysis, I am keen which regions are there and the number of countries that fall into them, their population and their total area.  To do such operations we use `groupby` function which helps in segregating the data into groups and then one can apply any function to either selected columns or to all.  Here, I first grouped the data by 'Region' then counted the number of countries as well as the total population and area that fall under each region.","0a416bfe":"Next, we try hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost. As this was taking a long time on Kaggle kernel, I performed hyperparameter tuning outside of kaggle kernel.

Thus it is essential to check the data types before proceeding further, as shown here.  If the dtype is an object, it needs to be encoded. One of the ways to encode them is by using One Hot encoding where we will use Pandas `get_dummies` function.  As for the current data we have only two categorical variables: Country and Region. We will get back to this point when we start building our model.","e247a0f3":"### Dealing with the missing data:\nAs seen above, we have 14 columns out of 20 that have missing entries. If we drop all these missing entries (as shown next), we lose 21% of out data.","0d2461b5":"Now, we take the top 7 important features and use XGBoost for model prediction.

","d37c2a1d":"### Building a model for predicting GDP (per capita):\nAs we have already observed from the pairplots that GDP ($ per capita) is showing non linear relationship with most of the variables, therefore, we move straight to play with Random Forest and  XGBoost for building a predictive model.  \nBut, before we start building our model we have to get rid of categorical data that has `dtype` 'object', as machine learning models give errors with categorical data. We will encode them using get_dummies function. Here, we encode the 'Region' column of the dataframe. By encoding we create individual column for each value of the 'Region' column. After that we delete the 'Region' column from the new dataframe that we made after encoding. Moreover, we also drop 'Countries' column which is 'object' dtype and we do not need it further. ","a5c79b47":"One of the ways to visualize the correlation between various variables is by seaborn's pairplot.

The diagonal subplots in pairplots are showing the region specific distribution of the variables.","39b95142":"Here, we first try Random Forest.

It ranges from 0-1 for maximum proportion of variability explained . ","b0519f25":"Now, we try XGBoost and compare the RMSE from both the models.  As expected the RMSE reduces and R2 score increases for XGBoost.","ac102cde":"### Conclusion \nIn this analysis we build a predictive model using XGBoost which showed R2 score of 0.83. Also, from this dataset, we found the key features for predicting GDP (% per capita) are : Population, Phones (per 1000), Infant mortality (per 1000 births), Agriculture, Net migration, Area (sq. mi.) and Birthrate\n\nThanks for reading. Any feedback is highly appreciated.\n","62a25656":"Random search helps to narrow down the range for all the hyperparameters. This is then followed by GridSearch CV where we can test all the combinations of the parameters unlike Random search.

This also helps in deciding which imputation method to use while dealing with missing data (this is discussed later in this kernel).","76e45ae2":"### Plotting and analysing the data:\n\nAfter fixing all the missing values, it is time to check plots and see if we can find any interesting correlation between these variables. Here, we are using matplotlib and seaborn libraries for plotting. As can be observed from the heatmap below, GDP(% per capita) is showing a strong negative correlation with Infant mortality (per 1000 births), Birthrate and Agriculture. Also, it is showing a very strong positive correlation with Phones (per 1000) and a moderate positive correlation with Literacy(%) and Service. Moreover, it has some weak positive correlation with Net migration.  Additionally, Literacy(%) is showing strong negative correlation with Infant mortality (per 1000 births), Birthrate and Agriculture. In addition to GDP(% per capita), Literacy(%) is showing moderate positive correlation with Phones (per 1000), Service. Also, we find that agriculture is strongly positively correlated with Infant mortality (per 1000 births) and Birthrate, while it is negatively correlated with Service and Phone (per 1000) and as indicated before with  GDP(% per capita), Literacy(%).","38ba3ccd":"# Objective\n\nHi! Welcome to the updated version of my first Kernel.\nHere, I have used the dataset \"Countries of the World\". The data comes from 227 countries and contains information about some of the important factors that govern economic development.  In this, I have done exploratory data analysis and made a predictive model for GDP per capita, as this is the key indicator of economic development of any country. For building a better model, I have performed hyperparameter tuning of XGBoost and RandomForest.  In addition, I have found the key features that determine GDP per capita. Also, I have checked some other ingredients of Economic development and the relationships between them.
