**INTRODUCTION**\n\nThis work is to help the medical community answer the posted question in Kaggle: [What is known about COVID-19 risk factors?](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/tasks) The resulting model enables to understand and keep up with the large amount of literature contained in the provided dataset, specifically:\n\n1. Data on potential risks factors\n    1. Smoking, pre-existing pulmonary disease\n    1. Co-infections (determine whether co-existing respiratory\/viral infections make the virus more transmissible or virulent) and other co-morbidities\n    1. Neonates and pregnant women\n    1. Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences.\n2. Transmission dynamics of the virus, including the basic reproductive number, incubation period, serial interval, modes of transmission and environmental factors\n3. Severity of disease, including risk of fatality among symptomatic hospitalized patients, and high-risk patient groups\n4. Susceptibility of populations\n5. Public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control\n\nAt the end of this notebook, the question asked is answered by means of each of the aspects listed above. In each case, the original content of the article that most represents the processed aspect is shown.\n\nTo accomplish the goal, the selected approach was to perform text mining on input data, by applying the latest advances in natural language processing (NLP). This was realized by the following steps:\n\n    1. Obtain input data and pre-process it to facilitate analysis.\n    2. Extract the key terms from the task description.\n    3. Match key terms with text contents.\n    4. Group and quantify the findings.\n    5. Show the documents that answer the task questions.\n        \nThe advantage of using NLP to abord this problem is that it is based on language-specific models, saving time and resources for text analysis.\n\nThe key terms was extracted from the task description in the step 2, resulting in a set of rule-based patterns.\n\nThe matching of key terms (step 3) was applied through topic  classification with Spacy library. This work through large sets of the unstructured data to match the patterns obtained in step 2. It is a very fast and scalable process that preferably uses the GPU resource.\n\nThis approach presents the limitation of synonymy, where multiple words and phrases have the same or similar meaning. To counter this, great care was taken in selecting keywords to make up the vocabulary of terms (e.g. COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov, SARS Coronavirus 2, or 2019 Novel Coronavirus).\n\nIn other hand, since the [original input data](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge) it is stored in JSON single files, whose structure is likely too complex to directly perform the analysis, this notebook uses the pre-processed data from the dataset [CORD-19-CSV](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/huascarmendez1\/cord19csv), also of same authorship of this.\n\nThe preprocessing of the data further consisted of filtering the documents that specifically talk about the covid-19 disease and its other names, as well as that they dealt with related risk factors, among other general data review, counting and cleaning activities.\n\nFinally, as it is clear that the results presented here are not final, it is recommended to assume them as a starting point for a complete understanding of each of the aspects that it tries to address.","060b4d84":"## Load Data","9a0a825e":"## Get what the literature reports on the task topic","39a722cb":"Run the matcher","224c94b6":"## Pattern Matching\nObjective: classify all articles according to key terms.","72e8d983":" # What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?\n \nThe answer to this question is distributed in each of the aspects listed at the beginning of this notebook.","e1864306":"Quantify documents by key terms","d864d088":"Group findings by key term and sort by key term and count.
