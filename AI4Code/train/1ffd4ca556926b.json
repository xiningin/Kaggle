Import Dataset \n> In this section, I will load the desired dataset for this notebook. This dataset has huge number of reviews. It will be hard to work with full dataset. So I will randomly sample the dataset into smaller chunks for easy purpose.","8e627f61":"# 1.

The most common way of converting paragraphs to sentences is to split the paragraph whenever a period is encountered.\n\n### 6.2 Text Preprocessing\n> After converting paragraph to sentences, we need to remove all the special characters, stop words and numbers from all the sentences.\n\n### 6.3 Tokenizing the Sentences\n> We need to tokenize all the sentences to get all the words that exist in the sentences\n\n### 6.4 4. Find Weighted Frequency of Occurrence\n> Next we need to find the weighted frequency of occurrences of all the words. We can find the weighted frequency of each word by dividing its frequency by the frequency of the most occurring word.\n\n### 6.5 Replace Words by Weighted Frequency in Original Sentences\n> The final step is to plug the weighted frequency in place of the corresponding words in original sentences and finding their sum. It is important to mention that weighted frequency for the words removed during preprocessing (stop words, punctuation, digits etc.) will be zero and therefore is not required to be added\n\n### 6.6 Sort Sentences in Descending Order of Sum\n> The final step is to sort the sentences in inverse order of their sum. The sentences with highest frequencies summarize the text.","6c6ab63e":"# &#127916; Introdruction Wine Reviews\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/0GFdU23.png)\n> In this notebook, I will try to explore the Wine Reviews Dataset.

The summarized reviews can be used as a reviews title also.I will use Spacy as natural language processing library for handling this project.","d2a4984c":"That's awesome!

Now we can see our text is more manageable. This will help us to explore the reviews and later making summarizer.\n\nWe are also seeing that there are some punctuation and stopwords. We also don't need them. In the first place, I don't remove them because we are gonna need this in future when we will make summarizer. So let's make another column that will store our normalized text without punctuation and stopwords.","4a689265":"# 3. Text preprocessing\n> In this step, I will be using Spacy for preprocessing text, in others words I will clearing not useful features from reviews title like punctuation, stopwords. For this task, there are two useful libraries available in Python. 1. NLTK 2. Spacy. In this notebook, I will be working with Spacy because it is very fast and has many useful features compared to NLTK. So without further do let's get started!","5dda1cc8":"## Types of Text Summarization Methods\nText summarization methods can be classified into different types.\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/J5KyMBJ.png)\n**i. Based on input type:**\n\n1. Single Document, where the input length is short. Many of the early summarization systems dealt with single document summarization.\n\n2. Multi Document, where the input can be arbitrarily long.\n\n**ii. Based on the purpose:**\n\n1. Generic, where the model makes no assumptions about the domain or content of the text to be summarized and treats all inputs as homogeneous. The majority of the work that has been done revolves around generic summarization.\n\n2. Domain-specific, where the model uses domain-specific knowledge to form a more accurate summary. For example, summarizing research papers of a specific domain, biomedical documents, etc.\n\n3. Query-based, where the summary only contains information which answers natural language questions about the input text.\n\n**iii. Based on output type:**\n\n1. Extractive, where important sentences are selected from the input text to form a summary. Most summarization approaches today are extractive in nature.\n\n2. Abstractive, where the model forms its own phrases and sentences to offer a more coherent summary, like what a human would generate. This approach is definitely a more appealing, but much more difficult than extractive summarization.","c49c0808":"# 4. Distribution of Points\nIn this section, I will try understand the distribution of points.
