After each instruction there is an empty Code Cell. Write the Python code necessary to perform the operations. You can check your work at any time by executing the code and reviewing the output.<br><br>When you have finished, submit this homework by sharing your Kaggle notebook. Select the Share icon in the upper right corner of your Kaggle notebook screen. You need to **make your notebook public** by going to Sharing > Privacy and selecting Public. You can then just copy the URL from the browser to submit your notebook on Canvas.\n\nWhen you are ready, click the blue Submit Assignment button on Canvas and paste this link into the URL submission field.","624d83ca":"### Part 4\nIn the Code Cell below, write the code to **define** (i.e. create) three functions, in which each function **returns** one string. You should create one function each for the word \"Happy\", the word \"New\", and the word \"Year!\". Execute the three functions and show what they output.","41354d51":"### Part 6\nIn the Code Cell below, write a function that takes two parameters and adds them together. The function should write output that looks like an addition statement. For example, if the function was given the values 3 and 4 the output should be something like: \"3 + 4 = 7\" ","d430e6df":"### Part 5\nIn the Code Cell below, write a new function using the ones you created in the prior problem.
