However, due to the effectiveness of the method for computer vision, we knew that if we held a image classification competition, students would want to use deep learning. Therefore, I'm putting together this short tutorial to **give everyone a fair chance at trying out deep learning and seeing how it performs** against traditional ML techniques for the MNIST classification task.\n\nThis will also be covered on December 3rd's lecture.\n\n## Background\n**Lecture 25 Slides 2-6**\n\nIn the Nov. 19th lecture, we discussed Perceptrons and how they learn a linear separator given training data (assuming a binary case). However, most problems are not linearly separable.\n\nIt was determined that *multiple layers* of *multiple perceptrons* could, infact, learn non-linear separators for such problems. A simple example is the [XOR problem](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/perceptrons-logical-functions-and-the-xor-problem-37ca5025790a), which cannot be modeled by a single perceptron, but can be modeled by several perceptrons in multiple layers. In fact, the Universal Approximation Theorem suggests that a network of layers of perceptrons (a neural network) can approximate any continuous function (although it doesn't say anything about whether it can be efficiently learned).\n\nWhile the concept of neural networks has been around since the 40s, recent improvements in computation, data storage, and memory have made them viable for many different applications. A famous example is Krizhevsky et al.'s AlexNet in 2012, which won an image object classification challenge (ILSVRC2012), beating the next best method by 10% (a significant leap at the time).","b2aec459":"# Keras Implementation\nEnough of the boring (but important!) stuff, let's get coding. Thankfully, over the years, frameworks such as Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc. have made it very easy to build your own neural network.\n\nWe'll use Keras since it's the easiest. https:\/\/keras.io\/examples\/mnist_cnn\/\n\nWe'll also just use MNIST, without the student-collected data. You'll have to merge the two datasets by yourself.","91af2476":"OK, Keras is imported and the data is loaded. Now, let's build our neural network. I'm going to follow the template above.","ad925fe1":"And finally, we can train it! We can also give Keras the validation data so that we can see how it's doing on both data that it has seen before (train), as well as data it hasn't seen before (validation).","8e171170":"# Conclusion\nWe discussed what deep learning and neural networks are, and we implemented a very simple network that did very well.

Feel free to research each layer to learn their function, but I'm providing this as a template for those that just want to try it out. This is also very hand-wavy - if you're interested in reading into this more thoroughly, feel free to look up tutorials, guides, and lectures online. A good resource for more in-depth descriptions is [CS231n](http:\/\/cs231n.github.io\/convolutional-networks\/).\n\n- An input layer (for MNIST, 28x28x1)\n  - This is where the data comes into the network.\n- A convolutional layer\n  - These are perceptrons good at capturing spatial information.\n  - As covered in class, each perceptron needs an activation function. We'll use ReLU (Rectified Linear Units), which is the most popular\/effective.\n- A few more conv layers\n  - A deeper network can learn better, but it's also more complex and takes longer to train.\n- A max pooling layer\n  - This is like resizing an image to half its length and width. It helps us go from 28x28 input to 10 output.\n- A dense or \"fully-connected\" layer\n  - These perceptrons are connected to every node before it, similar to the neural net covered during lecture. Spatial information is lost, but more abstract class information is learned.\n- A dense layer that equals the number of classes\n  - This is the output layer. Each node represents a class, and the highest value is the prediction.\n- A softmax layer\n  - This layer scales the values so they add up to 1, so that they may be interpreted as \"confidence percentages\".\n  \nEssentially, we input an image, get some spatial information out of it with convolutional layers, abstract that information to class information with dense layers, then predict which class that image must be in with the last layer.\n\nObviously, it's far more complicated and nebulous, but this is enough to get started.\n  \n## Training\nWe train this network exactly like how we train a single perceptron. We give it *iterations* of training data until it updates its weights and it learns the task. We call each update of the weights an *iteration*. We may also want to keep repeating training data. Every time we exhaust the training data and start repeating, we call it an *epoch*.\n\nYou may be wondering how you can update the weights when nodes are chained to each other. This is called backpropagation - I don't have space to explain it here, but feel free to research online. Also, courses such as NLP (Prof. Collins), Deep Learning (Prof. Drori), and other DL courses will cover backprop in detail.\n\nI'm partial to *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, which is available for free online. [Section 6.5](http:\/\/www.deeplearningbook.org\/contents\/mlp.html) covers backpropagation in detail.\n\n## Testing\nAfter training, after all of the weights have been updated, we can feed the network an input (just like a single perceptron) to see what it classifies it as."}}
