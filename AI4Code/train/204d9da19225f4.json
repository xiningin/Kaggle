In this case, that means taking a date in the format of a string and transforming the string into a date type. Run the next cell to see an example.","f5e141cb":"> ## Extract Data from SQL Databases\n\n### Pandas and sqlite3\n\nYou can use Pandas to open a SQL database or to run a SQL query against a database. There is more than one way to do this depending on the type of SQL database you are working with: the [sqlite3 library](https:\/\/www.sqlite.org\/about.html) or the [sqlalchemy library](https:\/\/www.sqlalchemy.org\/).\n","7a1019b5":"The goal is to add the ISO codes to the projects data set. To start, use the pycountry library to make a dictionary mapping the unique countries in 'Official Country Name' to the ISO code.\n\nIterate through the unique countries in df_projects['Official Country Name']. Create a dictionary mapping the 'Country Name' to the alpha_3 ISO abbreviations. \n\nThe dictionary should look like:\n`{'Kingdom of Spain':'ESP'}`\n\nIf a country name cannot be found in the pycountry library, add it to a list called `country_not_found`.","a2e4690c":"XML looks very similar to HTML. XML is formatted with tags having values inside the tags. XML is not as easy to navigate as JSON. Pandas cannot read in XML directly. One reason is that tag names are user defined. Every XML file might have different formatting. You can imagine why XML has fallen out of favor relative to JSON.\n\n### How to read and navigate XML\n\nThere is a Python library called BeautifulSoup, which makes reading in and parsing XML data easier. Here is the link to the documentation: [Beautiful Soup Documentation](https:\/\/www.crummy.com\/software\/BeautifulSoup\/)\n\nThe find() method will find the first place where an xml element occurs. For example using find('record') will return the first record in the xml file:\n\n```xml\n<record>\n  <field name=\"Country or Area\" key=\"ABW\">Aruba<\/field>\n  <field name=\"Item\" key=\"SP.POP.TOTL\">Population, total<\/field>\n  <field name=\"Year\">1960<\/field>\n  <field name=\"Value\">54211<\/field>\n<\/record>\n```\n\nThe find_all() method returns all of the matching tags. So find_all('record') would return all of the elements with the `<record>` tag.\n","74d4a83b":"### Other Ways to Read in JSON\n\nBesides using pandas to read JSON files, you can use the json library. Python treats JSON data like a dictionary.","1712cdc1":"The United States, China, and India have such larger values that it's hard to see this data. Let's take those countries out for a moment and look at the data again.","545a12c9":"There are a few issues with this 'sector1' variable. First, there are values labeled '!$!0'. These should be substituted with NaN.\n\nFurthermore, each sector1 value ends with a ten or eleven character string like '!$!49!$!EP'. Some sectors show up twice in the list like:\n 'Other Industry; Trade and Services!$!70!$!YZ',\n 'Other Industry; Trade and Services!$!63!$!YZ',\n\nBut it seems like those are actually the same sector. You'll need to remove everything past the exclamation point. \n\nMany values in the sector1 variable start with the term '(Historic)'. Try removing that phrase as well.\n\n### replace() method\n\nWith pandas, you can use the replace() method to search for text and replace parts of a string with another string. If you know the exact string you're looking for, the replace() method is straight forward. For example, say you wanted to remove the string '(Trial)' from this data:\n\n| data                     |\n|--------------------------|\n| '(Trial) Banking'        |\n| 'Banking'                |\n| 'Farming'                |\n| '(Trial) Transportation' |\n\nYou could use `df['data'].replace('(Trial'), '')` to replace (Trial) with an empty string.\n\n### regular expressions\nWhat about this data?\n\n| data                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------|\n| 'Other Industry; Trade and Services?$ab' |\n| 'Other Industry; Trade and Services?ceg' |\n\nThis type of data is trickier. In this case, there's a pattern where you want to remove a string that starts with an exclamation point and then has an unknown number of characters after it. When you need to match patterns of character, you can use [regular expressions](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regular_expression).\n\nThe replace method can take a regular expression. So\ndf['data'].replace('?.+', regex=True) where '?.+' means find a set of characters that starts with a question mark is then followed by one or more characters. You can see a [regular expression cheat sheet](https:\/\/medium.com\/factory-mind\/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285) here.\n","e8c2a49d":"Use the pandas to_datetime method to convert the boardapprovaldate and closingdate columns into datetime objects.","56aa65dd":"Run the next code cell to see the unique country names in the project data set.

Thank you so much Udacity for providing such quality content. \n\n\n**ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load.**\n\nThis lesson uses data from the World Bank. The data comes from two sources:\n\n[World Bank Indicator Data](https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator) - This data contains socio-economic indicators for countries around the world. A few example indicators include population, arable land, and central government debt.\n\n[World Bank Project Data](https:\/\/datacatalog.worldbank.org\/dataset\/world-bank-projects-operations) - This data set contains information about World Bank project lending since 1947.\n\n#### Outline of this notebook:\n**Extract data from different sources such as:**\n\n- csv files\n- json files\n- APIs\n\n**Transform data**\n- combining data from different sources\n- data cleaning\n- data types\n- parsing dates\n- file encodings\n- missing data\n- duplicate data\n- dummy variables\n- remove outliers\n- scaling features\n- engineering features\n\n**Load**\n- send the transformed data to a database\n\n**ETL Pipeline**\n- code an ETL pipeline\n\nThe end goal is to clean these data sets and bring them together into one table. As you'll see, it's not as easy as one might hope. By the end of the notebook, I'll have written an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load this data into a new database.\n\nThe goal of the notebook is to combine these data sets together so that you can run a machine learning model predicting World Bank Project total costs. \n\nIn the process, you'll need to transform these data sets in different ways. And finally, you'll write a single Python module that reads in these date sets, transforms them, and loads the results into the database all in one step.","9bf5b0ce":"With messy data, you might find it easier to read in everything as a string; however, you'll sometimes have to convert those strings to more appropriate data types. When you output the dtypes of a dataframe, you'll generally see these values in the results:\n* float64\n* int64\n* bool\n* datetime64\n* timedelta\n* object\n\nwhere timedelta is the difference between two datetimes and object is a string.

You could also specify the `thousands` option with `thousands=','`. This specifies that thousands are separated by a comma in this data set. \n\nHowever, this data is somewhat messy, contains missing values, and has a lot of columns.

That was the issue with the World Bank projects data. Hence, the dtype was specified as a string:\n```\ndf_projects = pd.read_csv('..\/data\/projects_data.csv', dtype=str)\n```\n\nRun the code cells below to read in the indicator and projects data.

Note as well that the results will be slightly different depending on if you run forward fill first or back fill first. Afghanistan, for example, is missing data in the middle of the data set.

Python supports dozens of different encoding as seen here in [this link](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/codecs.html#standard-encodings). Because the web was originally in English, the first encoding rules mapped binary code to the English alphabet. \n\nThe English alphabet has only 26 letters. But other languages have many more characters including accents, tildes and umlauts. As time went on, more encodings were invented to deal with languages other than English. The utf-8 standard tries to provide a single encoding schema that can encompass all text.\n\nThe problem is that it's difficult to know what encoding rules were used to make a file unless somebody tells you.

Text needs to be converted into numbers. You could assign a number to each category like 1, 2, 3, and 4.

You can see examples at [this link](http:\/\/strftime.org\/).","9c6b6aef":"> ## APIs \n\n### Example Indicators API\n\nRun the code example below to request data from the World Bank Indicators API. According to the documntation, you format your request url like so:\n\n`http:\/\/api.worldbank.org\/v2\/countries\/` + list of country abbreviations separated by ; + `\/indicators\/` + indicator name + `?` + options\n\nwhere options can include\n* per_page - number of records to return per page\n* page - which page to return - eg if there are 5000 records and 100 records per page\n* date - filter by dates\n* format - json or xml\n \n and a few other options that you can read about [here](https:\/\/datahelpdesk.worldbank.org\/knowledgebase\/articles\/898581-api-basic-call-structure).","0d402b38":"> ## Imputing Data\n\nWhen a dataset has missing values, you can either remove those values or fill them in.","adf1fd26":"Exercise - Part 3\n\nThis part is similar to Part 2, but now you will use backfill. Write code that backfills the missing GDP data.","fea3327f":"You should have gotten an error: **UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte**. This means pandas assumed the file had a utf-8 encoding but had trouble reading in the data file.","ad2bab9e":"Now use the function to eliminate population outliers and then gdp outliers from the dataframe. Store results in the df_outlier_removed variable.","e976163d":"Now the df_projects dataframe and the df_indicator dataframe have a matching column called 'Country Code'. But these two data frames can't be merged quite yet. \n\nEach project in the df_projects dataframe also has a date associated with it. The idea would be to merge the df_projects dataframe with the df_indicator dataframe so that each project also had a population value associated with it. There are still more data transformations to do in order for that to be possible. ","11907588":"Write a function that uses the Tukey rule to eliminate outliers from an array of data.","2a344b48":"# Transform","ea714547":"Quite a few country names were not in the pycountry library. Some of these are regions like \"South Asia\" or \"Southern Africa\", so it makes sense that these would not show up in the pycountry library.\n\nPart 3 - Making a Manual Mapping\n\nPerhaps some of these missing df_projects countries are already in the indicators data set. In the next cell, check if any of the countries in the country_not_found list are in the indicator list of countries.","67499bd3":">## Eliminating Outliers\n\nEliminating outliers is a big topic. There are many different ways to eliminate outliers. A data engineer's job isn't necessarily to decide what counts as an outlier and what does not. A data scientist would determine that. The data engineer would code the algorithms that eliminate outliers from a data set based on any criteria that a data scientist has decided.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll write code to eliminate outliers based on the Tukey rule.","0a566e5b":"Did you notice a pattern in the projects data country names? The entries are repeated and separated by a semi-colon like this:\n```text\n'Kingdom of Spain;Kingdom of Spain'\n'New Zealand;New Zealand'\n```\n\nThe first step is to clean the country name column and get rid of the semi-colon.","fcbe74c9":">## Feature Engineering\n\nPractice creating new features from the GDP and population data. \n\nYou'll create a new feature gdppercapita, which is GDP divided by population. You'll then write code to create new features like GDP squared and GDP cubed. \n\nStart by running the code below. It reads in the World Bank data, filters the data for the year 2016, and cleans the data.","873c2772":"Combine the two data sets using the [pandas concat method](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/merging.html). In other words, find the union of the two data sets.","14055ec8":"This is somewhat of an improvement. At least there is no missing data; however, because GDP tends to increase over time, the mean GDP is probably not the best way to fill in missing values for this particular case. Next, try using forward fill to deal with any missing values.","36f3b5ef":"Output the df_merged dataframe as a sqlite database file. For this exercise, you can put all of the data as one table. In the next exercise, you'll create a database with multiple tables. ","9e2e34bc":"This looks better at least for the Afghanistan data; however, the Albania data is still missing values. You can fill in the Albania data using back fill. That is what you'll do next.","35241dac":"> ## Cleaning Data\n\nEvery data set might have its own issues whether that involves missing values, duplicated entries, data entry mistakes, etc. In this notebook, I'll do some data cleaning on the World Bank projects and World Bank indicators data sets.\n\nCurrently, the projects data and the indicators data have different values for country names. My task in this notebook is to clean both data sets so that they have consistent country names. This will allow you to join the two data sets together. Cleaning data, unfortunately, can be tedious and take a lot of your time as a data scientist.\n\nWhy might you want to join these data sets together? What if, for example, you wanted to run linear regression to try to predict project costs based on indicator data? Or you might want to analyze the types of projects that get approved versus the indicator data. For example, do countries with low rates of rural electrification have more rural themed projects?","bb3f8471":"Notice there are three columns associated with dates: boardapprovaldate, board_approval_month, and closingdate. Run the code cell below to see what these values look like.","4525d944":">## Scaling Data\n\nIn this exercise, you'll practice scaling data. Sometimes, you'll see the terms **standardization** and **normalization** used interchangeably when referring to feature scaling. However, these are slightly different operations. Standardization refers to scaling a set of values so that they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Normalization refers to scaling a set of values so that the range if between zero and one.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll practice implementing standardization and normalization in code. There are libraries, like scikit-learn, that can do this for you; however, in data engineering, you might not always have these tools available."}}
