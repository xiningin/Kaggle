It plays a significant part in building a model. Data Cleaning is one of those things that everyone does but no one really talks about. It surely isn\u2019t the fanciest part of machine learning and at the same time, there aren\u2019t any hidden tricks or secrets to uncover. However, proper data cleaning can make or break your project. Data scientists spend most for thier time around 80% on data cleaning and eda operations and reaimaing  20% is for model building. Data cleaning is the best way to get a better accuracy on the model. By keeping this mind , Researcher(s) introduced a some of the automated eda libraries for performing automatically the eda and data cleaning operations on the data with a few lines of code.**\n\n**Some of the Automated libraries are.**\n* Autoviz.\n* Sweetviz.\n* Dtale.\n* Lux.\n* Klib.\n* pandas-profiling.","1de2d93b":"Here, I will be using seaborn data \"Titanic\".
