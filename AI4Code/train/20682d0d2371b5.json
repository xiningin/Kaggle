Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\"\n\nprint(wrapper.fill(bert_abstract))","41a8a606":"question = \"What does the 'B' in BERT stand for?\"\n\nanswer_question(question, bert_abstract)","a09a9cd2":"question = \"What are some example applications of BERT?\"\n\nanswer_question(question, bert_abstract)","837135f3":"# Part 2: Example Code","def888f3":"We've concatenated the `question` and `answer_text` together, but BERT still needs a way to distinguish them.
