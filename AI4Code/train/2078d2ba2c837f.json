It is clear that the \ndistribution of crimes vary depending on their category and general location in terms of district. \n\nI tried to use Choropleth to visualize this however, the GIS information that I extracted from website Analyze Boston - Zoning District contain more districts than what this dataset has. So there are large areas with no inputs. That's why I had to with the heatmap approach.","ded89813":"Similar to the previous graph, the amount of crimes occurred on the different days of a week also does not vary much. Friday seemed to have accumulated a higher amount of crimes. This could potentially indicate something. However, at this stage, I don't want to draw my conclusion too early.

However, I'm only interested in the following 6 major categories:\n* Auto Theft related crimes\n* Weapon related crimes\n* Child related crimes\n* Larceny\n* Assault\n* Robbery\n\nSince I'm only interested in 6 categories of crimes, I'll use regex to rename any offenses that has the following keywords in its description in order to simplify future data extraction.\n\nAt last, I created a new dataframe named 'crime_df'. This dataframe contains all rows that are associated with the 6 crime categories happened in year 2016 and 2017.\n\nAll of my analysis and visualization will be focused on these categories of crime.","97c83f47":"### Correlation\n\nTo be updated","073b87e8":"Pay careful attention to the dates those crimes happend.

So I opted to not use any records from year 2015 and 2018.","ca13c273":"For the graph above, it looks like that the crime distribution is uniform across all months.

It is clear that Larceny and Assault are the two categories ranking the top two for happening most frequently while crimes associated with children occurs the least.\n\nIt is also worthwhile noting that the occurrances of certain crime categories is fairly constant for example: weapon or child related crimes.\n\nCrimes like Larceny and Assault fluctuates a lot and I suspect there exists some degrees of correlation between the two, which I will discover in the next section.","fe3b1196":"It is interesting to see this few shootings for the period of 4 years.
