As the fungus spreads, the top sides of the leaves develop lesions, as well, that may become black or mottled with defined edges.

Unfortunately, they are also highly prone to dieases like scab, rust, rot, powdery mildew etc which could result in reduced fruit yield and at some times even death. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the disease symptoms early so that effective steps can be taken to maintain the quality and production.\n\n\n## Objective\n\n![](https:\/\/ya-webdesign.com\/transparent250_\/icons-transparent-objective-2.png)\n\n[The objective of the compeition is multifold](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7\/overview\/description). We need to train a model on the given images dataset to:\n- Classify the Test dataset images into healthy or diseased plants\n- A leaf may belong to more than one class of diseases. We need to accurately distinguish between the different leaf diseases.\n-  Deal with rare classes and novel symptoms;\n- Address depth perception\u2014angle, light, shade, physiological age of the leaf; and \n- ncorporate expert knowledge in identification, annotation, quantification, and guiding computer vision to search for relevant features during learning.\n\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe datasets contains a set of leaf images have been divided into a training and a test set.The images can be healthy, those which are infected with apple rust, those that have apple scab, and those with more than one disease.\n\nOur job is to create a ML model to predict whether the test set tweets belong to a disaster or not, in the form of 1 or 0.This is a classic case of a Binary Classification problem. \n\n## Evaluation Metric\n\n\nEvaluation metrics are used to measure the quality of the statistical or machine learning model.There are many different types of evaluation metrics available to test a model. These include classification accuracy, logarithmic loss etc. For this particluar problem, our submissions will be evaluated on mean column-wise ROC AUC. This means the final score is the average of the individual AUCs of each predicted column. \n\n\n\n\n  ","3564eca3":"# 2.
