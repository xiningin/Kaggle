It moves from being primarily focused on exploration, when actions that have been tried the least are preferred, to instead concentrate on exploitation, selecting the action with the highest estimated reward.","d559a83a":"### Predicting ad positioning\n#### Task Details\nPlacement of ads on a website is the primary problem for companies that operate on ad revenue. The position where the ad is placed plays a pivotal role in whether or not the ad will be clicked.\n\n#### Expected Submission\nCreate a notebook, which proposes the the best position for ads placement.\n\n#### Evaluation\nYou need to predict the ad position so that it is clicked by the website users.\nThe total clicked ad positions can be used for evaluation of the model.","fc6e1c2e":"# Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)","45044250":"## Libraries and Utilities","f6beba00":"## Random Selection","12b3fe78":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)"}}
