Can Vaccination be harmful?\nThis topic is discussed in **Subunit Vaccines Against Emerging Pathogenic Human Coronaviruses** which says\n\n*Most SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines developed thus far are

Each vaccine type has different advantages and disadvantages. .... inactivated and live-attenuated virus-based vaccines .... generally induce highly potent immune responses and\/or protection, the possibility for incomplete inactivation of viruses or recovering virulence exists, resulting in significant safety concerns (Zhang et al., 2014). Also, these traditional vaccines may induce the **antibody-dependent enhancement** (ADE) effect, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2018b). Similarly, some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection, but they might **also induce anti-vector immunity or present pre-existing immunity, causing some harmful immune responses**. Instead, DNA and nanoparticle vaccines maintain strong safety profile; however, the immunogenicity of these vaccines is usually **lower than** that of **virus- or viral vector-based vaccines**, often requiring optimization of sequences, components, or immunization routes, inclusion of appropriate adjuvants, or application of combinational immunization approaches (Zhang et al., 2014).*","f8893c7d":"## A Commentary by Susan R Weiss\n\nThe noted research Susan R Weiss recounts the history or coronavirus research and ends with\n\n*The latest outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has paralyzed the world, and the scientific community is mobilized.

Moreover, it is gratifying that a number of people who trained with me are contributing to the effort to fight this virus, including Scott Hughes (New York City Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness & Response) and Kristine Rose (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) as well as several others carrying out bench research on SARS-CoV-2.

All of these medicines are metabolized in the liver. Most of the metabolites derived from Oseltamivir, Ribavirin and some of the metabolites of Lopinavir \/ Ritonavir, Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate are found in the urine due to renal excretion. Therefore, injury to the liver and kidneys can impair metabolism, excretion, dosing and expected concentrations of the medications, which can increase the risk of toxicity using the aforementioned medications.\nAs a result, **frequent and careful monitoring of liver and kidney functions in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of liver and kidney disorders**, and also help in achieving the optimal therapeutic concentrations and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions.*\n\n\nThis means that if the SARS-COV-2 virus attacks the liver and kidneys then it will impact or impair drug treatments.

Approaches to evaluate risk for enhanced disease after vaccination","bee07e99":"## Adjuvants\n\nSomewhat overlooked in this topic is the role of **adjuvants**. A **vaccine** needs an **adjuvant** to work well.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia\n\n*An adjuvant is a pharmacological or immunological agent that modifies the effect of other agents. Adjuvants may be added to a vaccine to boost the immune response to produce more antibodies and longer-lasting immunity, thus minimizing the dose of antigen needed. Adjuvants may also be used to enhance the efficacy of a vaccine by helping to modify the immune response to particular types of immune system cells: for example, by activating T cells instead of antibody-secreting B cells depending on the purpose of the vaccine*\n\nAdjuvants were discovered in the 1920s by Gaston Ramon, a veterinarian, who noticed that horses that had a strong reaction at the injection site produced plasma with stronger antibody yields. He started experimenting with additives to induce such reactions, including things like tapioca starch. **Coronavirus Vaccine Prospects April 2020 Derek Lowe**","8425baa1":"#### Papers by Heeney","4d451412":"# Coronavirus Vaccines In the Pipeline\n\nIn addition to what has been found above here are some **must reads**\n\n\n[Derek Lowe's Commentary](https:\/\/blogs.sciencemag.org\/pipeline\/archives\/2020\/04\/15\/coronavirus-vaccine-prospects)\n\n**Coronavirus Vaccine Prospects\nBy Derek Lowe 15 April, 2020**\n\n*Time for another look at the coronavirus vaccine front, since we have several recent news items.

It looks like Sanofi is bringing the **spike protein** and GSK is bringing the **adjuvant** (more on what that means below). Their press release says that they plan to go into human patients late this year and to have everything ready for regulatory filing in the second half of 2021. For its part, Pfizer has announced that they\u2019re pushing up their schedule with BioNTech and possibly starting human trials in August, which probably puts them on a similar timeline for eventual filing.*\n\n[Coronavirus Vaccine Landscape](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41573-020-00073-5)\n\n*The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is working with global health authorities and vaccine developers to support the development of vaccines against COVID-19.
