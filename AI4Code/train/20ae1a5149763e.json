Get the text from the HTML\n<p>This HTML is not quite what we want. However, it does <em>contain<\/em> what we want: the text of <em>Moby Dick<\/em>. What we need to do now is <em>wrangle<\/em> this HTML to extract the text of the novel. For this we'll use the package <code>BeautifulSoup<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, a word on the name of the package: Beautiful Soup? In web development, the term \"tag soup\" refers to structurally or syntactically incorrect HTML code written for a web page. What Beautiful Soup does best is to make tag soup beautiful again and to extract information from it with ease! In fact, the main object created and queried when using this package is called <code>BeautifulSoup<\/code>. After creating the soup, we can use its <code>.get_text()<\/code> method to extract the text.<\/p>","e9e4d8b6":"## 4. Extract the words\n<p>We now have the text of the novel! There is some unwanted stuff at the start and some unwanted stuff at the end. We could remove it, but this content is so much smaller in amount than the text of Moby Dick that, to a first approximation, it is okay to leave it in.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we have the text of interest, it's time to count how many times each word appears, and for this we'll use <code>nltk<\/code> \u2013 the Natural Language Toolkit. We'll start by tokenizing the text, that is, remove everything that isn't a word (whitespace, punctuation, etc.) and then split the text into a list of words.<\/p>","d0fb928c":"## 2. Request Moby Dick\n<p>To analyze Moby Dick, we need to get the contents of Moby Dick from <em>somewhere<\/em>. Luckily, the text is freely available online at Project Gutenberg as an HTML file: https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/2701\/2701-h\/2701-h.htm .<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong> that HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the standard markup language for the web.<\/p>\n<p>To fetch the HTML file with Moby Dick we're going to use the <code>request<\/code> package to make a <code>GET<\/code> request for the website, which means we're <em>getting<\/em> data from it. This is what you're doing through a browser when visiting a webpage, but now we're getting the requested page directly into Python instead. <\/p>","99df0017":"## 8. Lemmatization with NLTK\nLemmatization is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item. Lemmatization is similar to stemming but it brings context to the words. So it links words with similar meaning to one word.\n\nText preprocessing includes both Stemming as well as Lemmatization. Many times people find these two terms confusing. Some treat these two as same. Actually, lemmatization is preferred over Stemming because lemmatization does morphological analysis of the words.\n\nExample:","2612efd2":"## 8. We have the answer\n<p>Our original question was:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What are the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick and how often do they occur?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We are now ready to answer that!

Load in stop words\n<p>It is common practice to remove words that appear a lot in the English language such as 'the', 'of' and 'a' because they're not so interesting. Such words are known as <em>stop words<\/em>. The package <code>nltk<\/code> includes a good list of stop words in English that we can use.<\/p>","53e94878":"### If you liked and \/ or this content was helpful, I appreciate your upvote :)","6fea632d":"## 9.

Remove stop words in Moby Dick\n<p>We now want to create a new list with all <code>words<\/code> in Moby Dick, except those that are stop words (that is, those words listed in <code>sw<\/code>).
