The heuristic really provides a lot of guidance about how to select moves!\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to use **reinforcement learning** to build an intelligent agent without the use of a heuristic.  Instead, we will gradually refine the agent's strategy over time, simply by playing the game and trying to maximize the winning rate.\n\nIn this notebook, we won't be able to explore this complex field in detail, but you'll learn about the big picture and explore code that you can use to train your own agent.\n\n# Neural Networks\n\nIt's difficult to come up with a perfect heuristic.  Improving the heuristic generally entails playing the game many times, to determine specific cases where the agent could have made better choices.  And, it can prove challenging to interpret what exactly is going wrong, and ultimately to fix old mistakes without accidentally introducing new ones.\n\nWouldn't it be much easier if we had a more systematic way of improving the agent with gameplay experience?  \n\nIn this tutorial, towards this goal, we'll replace the heuristic with a neural network.\n\nThe network accepts the current board as input.  And, it outputs a probability for each possible move.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KgAliYQ.png\" width=90%><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nThen, the agent selects a move by sampling from these probabilities.  For instance, for the game board in the image above, the agent selects column 4 with 50% probability.\n\nThis way, to encode a good gameplay strategy, we need only amend the weights of the network so that _for every possible game board_, it assigns higher probabilities to better moves.\n\nAt least in theory, that's our goal.  In practice, we won't actually check if that's the case -- since remember that Connect Four has over 4 trillion possible game boards!\n\n# Setup\n\nHow can we approach the task of amending the weights of the network, in practice?  Here's the approach we'll take in this lesson:\n- After each move, we give the agent a **reward** that tells it how well it did:\n  - **_If_** the agent wins the game in that move, we give it a reward of `+1`.\n  - **_Else if_** the agent plays an invalid move (which ends the game), we give it a reward of `-10`.\n  - **_Else if_** the opponent wins the game in its next move (i.e., the agent failed to prevent its opponent from winning), we give the agent a reward of `-1`.\n  - **_Else_**, the agent gets a reward of `1\/42`.\n  \n  \n- At the end of each game, the agent adds up its reward.  We refer to the sum of rewards as the agent's **cumulative reward**.  \n  - For instance, if the game lasted 8 moves (each player played four times), and the agent ultimately won, then its cumulative reward is `3*(1\/42) + 1`.\n  - If the game lasted 11 moves (and the opponent went first, so the agent played five times), and the opponent won in its final move, then the agent's cumulative reward is `4*(1\/42) - 1`.\n  - If the game ends in a draw, then the agent played exactly 21 moves, and it gets a cumulative reward of `21*(1\/42)`.\n  - If the game lasted 7 moves and ended with the agent selecting an invalid move, the agent gets a cumulative reward of `3*(1\/42) - 10`.\n  \nOur goal is to find the weights of the neural network that (on average) maximize the agent's cumulative reward.  \n\nThis idea of using reward to track the performance of an agent is a core idea in the field of reinforcement learning.  Once we define the problem in this way, we can use any of a variety of reinforcement learning algorithms to produce an agent.","06e5aeee":"In this notebook, we'll train an agent to beat the **HEURISTIC** agent.  We specify this opponent in the `agent2` argument below.","9d337c75":"Stable Baselines requires us to work with [\"vectorized\" environments](https:\/\/stable-baselines.readthedocs.io\/en\/master\/guide\/vec_envs.html).  For this, we can use the `DummyVecEnv` class.  \n\nThe `Monitor` class lets us watch how the agent's performance gradually improves, as it plays more and more games.","d0a00c5f":"To learn more about how to define environments, check out the documentation [here](https:\/\/stable-baselines.readthedocs.io\/en\/master\/guide\/custom_env.html).","b95483a6":"# Code\n\nThere are a lot of great implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms online.  In this course, we'll use [Stable Baselines](https:\/\/github.com\/hill-a\/stable-baselines).\n\nCurrently, Stable Baselines is not yet compatible with TensorFlow 2.0.  So, we begin by downgrading to TensorFlow 1.0.","ec1a145d":"# Reinforcement Learning\n\nThere are many different reinforcement learning algorithms, such as DQN, A2C, and PPO, among others.  All of these algorithms use a similar process to produce an agent:\n\n- Initially, the weights are set to random values.\n\n\n- As the agent plays the game, the algorithm continually tries out new values for the weights, to see how the cumulative reward is affected, on average.  Over time, after playing many games, we get a good idea of how the weights affect cumulative reward, and the algorithm settles towards weights that performed better.  \n    - _Of course, we have glossed over the details here, and there's a lot of complexity involved in this process.  For now, we focus on the big picture!_\n    \n    \n- This way, we'll end up with an agent that tries to win the game (so it gets the final reward of `+1`, and avoids the `-1` and `-10`) and tries to make the game last as long as possible (so that it collects the `1\/42` bonus as many times as it can).\n    - _You might argue that it doesn't really make sense to want the game to last as long as possible -- this might result in a very inefficient agent that doesn't play obvious winning moves early in gameplay.  And, your intuition would be correct -- this will make the agent take longer to play a winning move!  The reason we include the `1\/42` bonus is to help the algorithms we'll use to converge better.  Further discussion is outside of the scope of this course, but you can learn more by reading about the \"temporal credit assignment problem\" and \"reward shaping\"._\n    \nIn the next section, we'll use the [**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**](https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/openai-baselines-ppo\/) algorithm to create an agent.","47005a60":"And, we calculate how it performs on average, against other agents.","bec76642":"The next step is to specify the architecture of the neural network.
