This has now occured due to a multitude of factors, it was the perfect strom. Nepal was begining to open up thanks to 7 months of low infection rates. Many social gathering were occuring in the big cities of Nepal. Next the Indian variant began spreading in India and as India began it's lock down hundreds of thousands of Nepali workers began returning homing to Nepal, bringing the variant with them. The variant itself is extremely virulent. Futhermore, the health care system is not capable to care for so many cases and has now collapsed, this means ill poeple stay witht heir families and cannot be helped or properlly isolated. Futhermore, the govenment has been disolved and there is a lot of political turmoil slowing down any progress.\n\nIn the daily vaccinations we can see an ubrupt stop in vaccinations. This is because as India began to worsen, they stopped exporting vaccines to Nepal, they were Nepal biggest vaccine supplier. This has left many Nepalis with only one vaccine. Since then, Chine and US are in the process of donating vacciantions to Nepal.\n\nNepal however, is in a position where there vacciantion administration infrastructure is rapid and solid. With international help they could come out of this urgent situtation in a better condition rather than worse.\n\nSources:\nhttps:\/\/www.statnews.com\/2021\/05\/26\/in-vaccine-apartheid-nepal-is-ground-zero-it-needs-u-s-help\/\nhttps:\/\/www.devex.com\/news\/nepal-struggles-with-a-surge-in-covid-19-cases-99953\nhttps:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/health\/health-news\/covid-crisis-reaches-nepal-surge-cases-hospitalizations-n1267419\nhttps:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/nepal-political-turmoil-unleashes-more-health-risks-during-covid-surge\/a-57674304\nhttps:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/healthcare-pharmaceuticals\/china-gift-1-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-nepal-2021-05-26\/\nhttps:\/\/www.devex.com\/news\/nepal-struggles-with-a-surge-in-covid-19-cases-99953","95626112":"# import numpy as np\n"}}
