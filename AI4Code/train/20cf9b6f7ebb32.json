Why do I say\"also\"? Because this project is based on another author's first project. Since I'm a newbie of kaggle, I decided to start with \"redo\" other author's project, in order to get some thoughts on how to start a project. Thanks to Rezuanur Rahman Dip's share of his first project, I did something similar but with some refactoring.\n\nGlad to share my first project here. Please feel free to give me some feedback. \n\nThe purpose of this project is to find out whether social distancing is effective on prevent the virus. The project take New York as an sample, calculated the new cases growth rate. We could compare the ratio before and after the shut-down policy, then get an insight from the result.","2e195ade":"# Covid-19 Analysis with New York Data - Refactored version","aaa21282":"New York shut down on Mar. 22th. We can see the new cases growth rate \ndroped significantly after that, which means social distancing (including social distancing requirements, masks, school and business closures, opening of testing clinics, contact tracing, availability ofserological testing, etc.) are quite efficient on stop the virus spreading."}}
