It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is based on Matplotlib (see below).\n\n* Matplotlib: a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms\n\nThe aforementioned Python packages are pre-installed for us, so we just need to load them. We use the command **import ** which loads the packages. The **as** keyword is used to indicate an alias to every package; an alternative way to call each imported package.

In particular, we need to count how many times each hour appears on the **order_hour_of_day**.\nFor example, for the first 5 orders that have been placed on hours: 8, 7, 12, 7, 15, one order has been place at 8hr, two at 7hr, one at 12hr and one at 15hr.  To extend this to all values on **order_hour_of_day**, we use the <b>.value_counts( )<\/b> method, which returns a Series with the unique values that can be found on a column and how many times they appear on it. ","7c6effd4":"## 7.2 More orders mean more often orders?\nIn the following example we check whether more active users (i.e., users with many total orders) order more often than users with few total orders.
