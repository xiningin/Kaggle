the `mplot3d` toolkit.","ef61563c":"If we want to produce a scatterplot matrix, i.e. a scatterplot of every pair of variables of a given data set, we can use a `PairGrid`. To do so, we first initialize the grid with our desired data set, and then pass the plotting function to a `map` method that will be called on each subplot. Alternatively, we can use the companion function, `pairplot()` that trades off some flexibility for faster plotting.","d3262af5":"If we want to generate a vector of random variables from a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, we can use the function `np.random.normal(loc, scale, size)` where `size` is the sample size,`loc` is the mean $\\mu$ which defaults to 0 and, and `scale` is the standard deviation $\\sigma$ which defaults to 1. If no value is given for `size` then just a single number is returned. In the example below, we create two correlated vectors of numbers and then use the `np.corrcoef` function to generate a matrix of correlation coefficients.","ecb1a048":"If we want more visual information about the smape of the distribution, which is especially helpful if we are working with a large dataset, we could make a boxen plot using the `kind = \"boxen\"` parameter.","17ac0323":"Using the magic command `%matplotlib notebook` we can also generate interactive figures which allow us to click and drag to rotate them.","4a2ac713":"We can also turn our contour plot into a heatmap by switching it to a filled contour plot via the `plt.contourf()` function. In addition, we'll ad a `plt.colorbar()` command to automatically generate an additional axis with labeled color information for the plot.","35e544df":"We can also change the viewing angle using the `view_init` method to set the elevation angle (angle relative to the x-y plane) and azimuthal angle (angle rotated counter-clockwise about the z-axis).","99ce2b55":"If we want to work with matrices, we have two main options depending on the type of data we wish to store. First, would be using NumPy arrays or structured arrays, which a handy for certain specialized situations, such as if we are working with just a single data type or we need to map onto binary data formats in another programming language such as C or Fortran.\nTo start with, we create a basic two-dimensional NumPy array and perform some math operations with it.","89cf7e21":"Since the number of cylinders has a small range, we might want to treat it as a categorical variable instead of a quantitative one. The main way of doing this is using Seaborn's `catplot()` function. Two types of categorical plots we can generate are a swarm plot (using the `kind = \"swarm\"` paramter) and a box plot (using the `kind = \"box\"` parameter).","0d8664f6":"Lastly, if we want to view summary data for each variable, we can use the `describe()` function. By default it only provides summary statistics for the numeric fields, but we can alter that behavior using the `include` argument.","913c443d":"In addition to boxplots, we can produce histograms with the `distplot()` function. Be default, it will draw a histogram and fit a kernel density estimate (KDE). If we don't want the KDE, then we use the parameter `kde = False`.","5a867a18":"In this section, we discuss how to slice NumPy arrays to access subsets of the data stored within them. For example, let's suppose our data is stored in the two-dimensional NumPy array `A`.","f9bb60a8":"Should we want to reproduce the exact same set of random numbers each time our code is run, we can use the function `np.random.seed(n)`, where `n` is an integer, to set the seed for our random number generator.","7a6b666f":"Alternatively, if we wish to look at the entire dataframe, we can simply call it, though it will get truncated. As a bonus, calling the data frame will also tell us the number of rows and columns it contains.","8b6d8775":"By switching the columns corresponding to the x and y axes and using the `orient` parameter, we can also specify that we want our boxplot to be horizontally oriented.","328612ec":"Also note that we can reshape an array (as long as the product of the dimentions remains same) using the command `A.reshape()`.","025b9497":"Now let's do some fancier visualizations by creating a contour plot. A contour plot requires three main arguments: a grid of $x$ values, a grid of $y$ values, and a grid of $z$ values.","29201d1a":"To access a single element, we can use a comma-separated tuple of indices `A[i, j]` where `i` is the row index and `j` is the column index. Note that NumPy arrays are zero-indexed and that we can also use negative indices to index from the end of the array.","15056fcb":"## Slicing NumPy Arrays","c4c921e6":"Now that we have loaded the data and dropped rows with missing values, we can check the `columns` attribute to see the names of the columns.","aca3a71d":"If we wish to slice an array, we can use the usual slicing syntax for standard Python lists: `A[row_start:row_stop:row_step, col_start:col_stop:col_step]`. Note that array slices are *views* rather than *copies* of the array data. This means that we modifying a slice will modify those entries in the original array.","eceb1099":"If we have two arrays with either the same dimensions, or dimensions which can be broadcast to each other, then we can perform vectorized operations.","c0683fb2":"Note that there's a lot more we can do with NumPy arrays, and we haven't even started talking about Pandas dataframes. For more info, Jake VanderPlas's *Python Data Science Handbook* is a good resource.","43e5dea8":"## Loading Data","0625c76f":"We can also specify that we want more levels to be drawn by using the `levels` optional parameter.","ce2618d3":"A good standard practice is to always check for missing values in the data. To do so, we can uset the `isnull()` and `any()` methods to check for missing values.","5765c4bc":"In this notebook, we rework through Lab 1 in ISLR using Python instead of R. We will use the packages `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn` in order to do so. Let's start by importing the two most `numpy`, which will allow us to use NumPy arrays, and `pandas` which will allow us to use Pandas series and dataframes.","502267c0":"To start off, let's create a simple scatter plot using the `plt.plot()` command and making sure to choose a preferred marker style.","40c70d1d":"If we want to adjust the number of bins from the default, which uses the [Freedman-Diaconis rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Freedman%E2%80%93Diaconis_rule), we can set that using the `bins` argument.","fcae188c":"We can also specify a subset of the variables we wish to use in the pairplot by using the `vars` argument.","57b37232":"If we want to describe a single column, we can use the `describe` method on that column.","fa69b61c":"Since there are only five rows with missing values, we'll drop them from the data using the `dropna()` function.","e9b25a25":"Having imported `numpy` and `pandas`, let's create some NumPy arrays to work with and demonstrate some basic operations.","2af99f4b":"# Lab: Introduction to Python","3be2ea9a":"If we wish to get information regarding the shape of an array, we have a few different attributes which we can check.","18742c2e":"## Graphics","505bbfac":"Lastly, we can use the `np.average()` and `np.var()` functions to compute the mean and variance of a vector of numbers. In addition, we can use the `np.sd()` function to compute the standard deviation a little more conveniently than using the formula $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X)}$.","f8a52421":"This tells us that there are some rows which have missing horsepower values. To see which rows these are and how many of them are contained in the dataset, we use a boolean mask.","40274b20":"If we want to create a sequence of numbers, we can use the `np.linspace(start, stop, num = 50)` function, which returns a NumPy array of evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. A similar way to generate such a sequence, but using a step size (instead of the number of samples) is `np.arange`.","899794c9":"One of the main ways of importing a data set into Python is to use the `pd.read_csv()` function from the Pandas package, which reads csv files. In order to read a file, we first must navigate to the proper directory where it is stored. For now, we will start by loading the `Auto` data set from a text file, store it as a data frame object, and then use the `head()` function to view the first few rows of data. By default, Pandas will infer the column names from the first line of the file. The option `na_values = [\"?\"]` tells Pandas that whenever it sees a question mark, it should be treated as a missing element of the data matrix.","51e465cf":"## Basic Commands in NumPy","528736be":"If we want to learn more a function or object, we can type `foo?` to access the docstring, or `foo??` to access the docstring and the Python code used as implementation.","259a0788":"First, let's start off by using Seaborn's `relplot()` function to plot a scatterplot of mpg vs the number of cylinders.","8041c6ba":"The two main graphics packages we'll use for plotting are `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`. To start, we'll import them using their standard aliases. Note that the main idea of Seaborn is to provide a convenient high-level API for producing plots that would be more effort-intensive to produce using raw Matplotlib commands (which is what Seaborn does under the hood). For basic plotting, Matplotlib works just fine, and looks pretty nice after Seaborn's default aesthetic settings are loaded, but for more sophisticated visualizations and working with Pandas dataframes, using Seaborn becomes quite invaluable.","b03433fb":"Note that by default the `pairplot()` function produces histograms on the diagonal instead of scatterplots. If we wish to reproduce this behavior using a PairGrid, we need to use the `map_diag()` and `map_offdiag()` functions. Do note that the axis ticks won't correspond to the count or density axis of the plots on the diagonal.","5c58267c":"## Additional Graphical and Numerical Summaries","062ce3de":"We can also use object-oriented methods for plotting instead of the MATLAB-style function we just used. While for simple plots, choosing between the styles is largely a matter of preference, for more-complicated plots the object-oriented approach is generally more convenient.","cff30d16":"As mentioned before, `A.shape` returns the dimensions of the array as a tuple `(rows, columns)`."}}
