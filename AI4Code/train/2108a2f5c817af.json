Epub 2017 Jun 1.\n\nPseudobulbar affect (PBA) is prevalent in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but there is limited information on its associations and course.\n\nExplore prevalence, associations, course and manifestations of PBA in outpatient cohort of patients with ALS and examine its relationship to depression.\n\nSelf-reported measures of PBA and depression (Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively) were obtained from consecutive patients with ALS using tablet devices in waiting rooms (Knowledge Program).\n\nPBA (CNS-LS \u226513) was seen in 209\/735 patients (28.4%). PBA was associated with bulbar onset and dysfunction, upper motor neuron dysfunction, cognitive impairment, depression and lower quality of life. A multivariable model that included lower bulbar and gross motor subscores, female gender, younger age and shorter duration of disease predicted PBA with 74% accuracy. CNS-LS scores increased only slowly with time. Women with PBA reported more crying than men. Crying (but not laughter) correlated with depression, and crying was associated with poorer quality of life. Exploratory factor analysis of pooled questions of CNS-LS and PHQ-9 identified three underlying factors (laughter, crying and depression) loaded on appropriate questions of the respective instruments.\n\nConclusion: This study identifies associations of PBA and additionally finds PBA (especially crying-predominant PBA) more prevalent in women with ALS. Although the two self-report instruments (CNS-LS and PHQ-9) discriminate well between PBA and depression, there is significant overlap between depression and crying in PBA. Studies of PBA should stratify for gender, examine crying and laughter as separate outcomes and adjust for depression.\n\nhttps:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28572273\/","94af68e3":"That scatter has almost the same\"design\" of the lineplot 2 snippets above.","15ce4fad":"![](https:\/\/images.slideplayer.com\/26\/8482975\/slides\/slide_7.jpg)slideplayer.com","a5530dba":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">How is RRMS Different from PPMS and SPMS?<\/span>**\n\nAuthor: Ananya Mandal, MD - Reviewed by Sally Robertson, B.Sc.\n\n\n\nRRMS: Relapsing-Remitting form of Multiple Sclerosis\n\nPPMS: Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis\n\nSPMS: Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis\n\n\n\"It is estimated that up to 80% of all individuals with MS (multiple sclerosis) have the relapsing-remitting form of the disease. These individuals have periods where their symptoms are mild or absent, which is otherwise referred to as remission, followed by periods of symptom relapse. Symptoms may occur suddenly and in acute bouts or exacerbations. During periods of relapse, symptoms may become worse each time.\"\n\n\"The relapsing-remitting form of MS may eventually progress to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), during which there are few or no periods of remission. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) can be diagnosed when two episodes of relapse are separated by more than 30 days, or there has only been one relapse that is accompanied by MRI evidence of newly scarred or damaged myelin three months later.\"\n\n\"The least common form of multiple sclerosis is primary progressive MS (PPMS), which occurs in about 10% to 15% of all cases and usually in people over the age of 40. In this form of MS, symptoms worsen over time rather than occurring in bouts or as sudden attacks.\"\n\n\"PPMS may be diagnosed if there have been no previous symptoms of relapse but the patient has become increasingly disabled over a period of at least one year.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.news-medical.net\/health\/How-is-RRMS-Different-from-PPMS-and-SPMS.aspx","a4f632d1":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Reliability, validity and validation of the CNS emotional lability scale for pseudobulbar affect on multiple sclerosis in Turkish patients<\/h1>\n\nAuthors: R\u0131fat Erdem Togrol & Serkan Demir\n\nPages 306-313 | Received 10 Mar 2018, Accepted 01 May 2018, Published online: 17 May 2018\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/24750573.2018.1472905\n\n\"Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is described as uncontrolled, unprovoked outbursts of laughing and\/or crying not related to the patient\u2019s underlying emotion or experience. PBA may be overlooked or underdiagnosed and so an effective method of evaluation is important. The Center of Neurologic Study-lability Scale (CN-LS) is such a self-report Likert scale consisting of seven questions on laughing and crying.\"\n\n\"The study was done to carry out the validity and reliability studies in Turkish for this test and validate it for multiple sclerosis (MS). For the content validity of the scale, one measurement and evaluation expert and five experts on the subject were interviewed. After a pilot study to evaluate the clarity of the scale, the reliability of the test was determined by sampling 154 normal and 56 MS patients, testing and retesting.\"\n\n\"Timely and appropriate evaluation of PBA is important in MS and the CNS-LS is a robust test instrument that has been used to assess PBA in different neurological conditions including MS.

It has been used in a number of different clinical entities successfully in different cultures. This is a Likert measure which the patient responses personally, consisting of seven questions of the patient\u2019s PBA episodes and the frequency, each question is rated between 1 and 5. \n\nTo cope with a chronic condition like MS (multiple sclerosis), the individual must try to maintain normal daily activities as much as possible, stay connected to one\u2019 s social environment, and pursue leisure activities, hobbies one enjoys and is able to do. But usually, there are problems and these problems interfere with the quality of life of the individual. The psychosocial and behavioural problems these individuals experience are due to different factors, some due to the actual illness itself and its neuropsychological effects, others are due to the social interaction that is disturbed as a result of the manifestations of the disease, one of which is PBA.\n\nAs stated above, its evaluation and monitoring are valuable. MS (multiple sclerosis) patients with this condition, when diagnosed, may be treated with antidepressants (tricyclic\u2019s, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), also with palliative drugs like dextromethorphan, levodopa, and TRH. Recently, a new treatment containing dextromethorphan plus quinidine have also been introduced.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/24750573.2018.1472905","5b3deab5":"#There are 20 (Multiple Sclerosis) patients with RRMS (Relapsing-Remitting), 10 with PPMS (Primary Progressive) and 33 with SPMS (Secondary Progressive)."}}
