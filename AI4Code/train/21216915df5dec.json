Since:\n- the `parent` column indicates the comment that was replied to, and \n- the `id` column has the unique ID used to identify each comment, \n\nwe can **GROUP BY** the `parent` column and **COUNT()** the `id` column in order to figure out the number of comments that were made as responses to a specific comment.  (_This might not make sense immediately -- take your time here to ensure that everything is clear!_)\n\nFurthermore, since we're only interested in popular comments, we'll look at comments with more than ten replies.  So, we'll only return groups **HAVING** more than ten ID's.","8e4d4db4":"Now you have the data you want, and it has descriptive names. That's good style.\n\n# Note on using **GROUP BY**\n\nNote that because it tells SQL how to apply aggregate functions (like **COUNT()**), it doesn't make sense to use **GROUP BY** without an aggregate function.  Similarly, if you have any **GROUP BY** clause, then all variables must be passed to either a\n1. **GROUP BY** command, or\n2. an aggregation function.\n\nConsider the query below:\n\n","bd061012":"Now that our query is ready, let's run it and store the results in a pandas DataFrame: ","4c2e6d58":"# Introduction\n\nNow that you can select raw data, you're ready to learn how to group your data and count things within those groups. This can help you answer questions like: \n\n* How many of each kind of fruit has our store sold?\n* How many species of animal has the vet office treated?\n\nTo do this, you'll learn about three new techniques: **GROUP BY**, **HAVING** and **COUNT()**. Once again, we'll use this made-up table of information on pets. \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fI5Pvvp.png)\n\n# COUNT()\n\n**COUNT()**, as you may have guessed from the name, returns a count of things. If you pass it the name of a column, it will return the number of entries in that column. \n\nFor instance, if we **SELECT** the **COUNT()** of the `ID` column in the `pets` table, it will return 4, because there are 4 ID's in the table.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Eu5HkXq.png)\n\n**COUNT()** is an example of an **aggregate function**, which takes many values and returns one. (Other examples of aggregate functions include **SUM()**, **AVG()**, **MIN()**, and **MAX()**.)  As you'll notice in the picture above, aggregate functions introduce strange column names (like `f0__`).  Later in this tutorial, you'll learn how to change the name to something more descriptive.\n \n# GROUP BY\n\n\n**GROUP BY** takes the name of one or more columns, and treats all rows with the same value in that column as a single group when you apply aggregate functions like **COUNT()**.\n\nFor example, say we want to know how many of each type of animal we have in the `pets` table. We can use **GROUP BY** to group together rows that have the same value in the `Animal` column, while using **COUNT()** to find out how many ID's we have in each group. \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tqE9Eh8.png)\n\nIt returns a table with three rows (one for each distinct animal).  We can see that the `pets` table contains 1 rabbit, 1 dog, and 2 cats.\n\n# GROUP BY ... HAVING\n\n**HAVING** is used in combination with **GROUP BY** to ignore groups that don't meet certain criteria. \n\nSo this query, for example, will only include groups that have more than one ID in them.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2ImXfHQ.png)\n\nSince only one group meets the specified criterion, the query will return a table with only one row. \n\n# Example: Which Hacker News comments generated the most discussion?\n\nReady to see an example on a real dataset? The Hacker News dataset contains information on stories and comments from the Hacker News social networking site. \n\nWe'll work with the `comments` table and begin by printing the first few rows.

To take a peek, click on the \"Code\" button below._)","19b578c6":"If make this error, you'll get the error message `SELECT list expression references column (column's name) which is neither grouped nor aggregated at`.\n\n# Your turn\n\nThese aggregations let you write much more interesting queries.

For instance, the comment with ID `801208` received `56` replies.\n\n# Aliasing and other improvements\n\nA couple hints to make your queries even better:\n- The column resulting from `COUNT(id)` was called `f0__`. That's not a very descriptive name. You can change the name by adding `AS NumPosts` after you specify the aggregation. This is called **aliasing**, and it will be covered in more detail in an upcoming lesson.\n- If you are ever unsure what to put inside the **COUNT()** function, you can do `COUNT(1)` to count the rows in each group. Most people find it especially readable, because we know it's not focusing on other columns. It also scans less data than if supplied column names (making it faster and using less of your data access quota).\n\nUsing these tricks, we can rewrite our query:"}}
