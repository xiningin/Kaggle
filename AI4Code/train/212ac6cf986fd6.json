This is no surprise given the \"women and children first\" procedure for evacuating. Further, it looks like there is significant variation in the survival rates of passengers boarding from the different Embarked locations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's create the new columns for our one-hot encoding.<\/p>","20f24eae":"<p>Since Age is most strongly correlated with Pclass and FamilySize, we'll use those data to fill out the missing Age values.

Sticking together (Grouping continuous numerical data)\n\n<p>There is one final way we will be cleaning our data. We currently have two columns containing continuous numerical data: Age and Fare.

Age is but a [missing] number\n\n<p>For the Embarked and Fare columns, which were missing few values each, we simply filled with the mode and median.

Diving in (machine learning)\n\n<p>Now that the data has been properly cleaned, we can try to find a model that works well for making our predictions.

Conclusions\n\n<p>After submission of these predictions, I received a test score of about 80%.<\/p>\n\n<p>Principal potential areas of improvement to our analysis would be outlier extraction, feature removal, and\/or the addition of more models. There may be certain outliers (for example, during the analysis I noted that there are just 1 or 2 passengers over age 70, who are both 80 and both survived) which could be removed to make the model more generalizable. One could also experiment with removing some of the features, as there may be overlap (title and sex as an example may be essential the same feature). Finally, more advanced models (such as XGBoost) could be implemented or one could consider a voting classifier to include input from all models that were considered.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading my kernel! As I mentioned in the introduction, I know there is plenty of room for improvement and any feedback or comments are greatly appreciated. Good luck in your own projects!<\/p>"}}
