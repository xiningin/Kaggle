They operate by enabling a sequence of data to be transformed and correlated together in a model that can be tested and evaluated to achieve an outcome, whether positive or negative.\nYou can imagine it like compining any algorithms together into a pipe then give the pipe to the model to make the process faster, it also very useful with cross validation!\n\n2- Support Vector Regression (SVR):\nSupport Vector Regression (SVR) uses the same principle as SVM, but for regression problems. \n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/SVR1.png)\n\nConsider these two red lines as the decision boundary and the green line as the hyperplane. Our objective, when we are moving on with SVR, is to basically consider the points that are within the decision boundary line. Our best fit line is the hyperplane that has a maximum number of points.\n\n3- Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\nis a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation which converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables. PCA is a most widely used tool in exploratory data analysis and in machine learning for predictive models. Moreover, PCA is an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables. It is also known as a general factor analysis where regression determines a line of best fit.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n#### So we will combine PCA & SVR into a pipe line then pass the pipeline into crossvalidation and get the score!","0dfcbf29":"### - Quick visualization:","afc66aea":"#### Pass my_pipeline into cross_validation and get the score!","f199ec8c":"## - In this notbook I will explain:\n#### 1- Pipelines\n#### 2- Support Vector Regression (SVR) & Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Techniques\n#### 3- Cross validation with pipelines","dca3947e":"### - Importing data and libraries","c86aa353":"#### Then we compine PCA & SVR in the method make_pipeline :"}}
