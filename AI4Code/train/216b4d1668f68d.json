Even if a strategy is profitable now, it may not be in the future, and market volatility makes it impossible to predict the profitability of any given trade with certainty. As a result, it can be hard to distinguish good luck from having made a good trading decision.\n\nIn the first three months of this challenge, you will build your own quantitative trading model to maximize returns using market data from a major global stock exchange. Next, you\u2019ll test the predictiveness of your models against future market returns and receive feedback on the leaderboard.\n\n# 1.2 Challenge Brief\nYour challenge will be to use the historical data, mathematical tools, and technological tools at your disposal to create a model that gets as close to certainty as possible. You will be presented with a number of potential trading opportunities, which your model must choose whether to accept or reject.\n\nIn general, if one is able to generate a highly predictive model which selects the right trades to execute, they would also be playing an important role in sending the market signals that push prices closer to \u201cfair\u201d values. That is, a better model will mean the market will be more efficient going forward. However, developing good models will be challenging for many reasons, including a very low signal-to-noise ratio, potential redundancy, strong feature correlation, and difficulty of coming up with a proper mathematical formulation.\n\n# 1.3 Organizers\nJane Street has spent decades developing their own trading models and machine learning solutions to identify profitable opportunities and quickly decide whether to execute trades. These models help Jane Street trade thousands of financial products each day across 200 trading venues around the world.\nAdmittedly, this challenge far oversimplifies the depth of the quantitative problems Jane Streeters work on daily, and Jane Street is happy with the performance of its existing trading model for this particular question. However, there\u2019s nothing like a good puzzle, and this challenge will hopefully serve as a fun introduction to a type of data science problem that a Jane Streeter might tackle on a daily basis. Jane Street looks forward to seeing the new and creative approaches the Kaggle community will take to solve this trading challenge.","5e960581":"# EDA","aa1e05e6":"# 1.-1 TL;DR\n\n- Based on the historical data, we need to develop a model to predict a return value for a given trade.\n- The return value can be 1(traded) or 0(passed) and depends on the weights and resp.\n- The evaluation will take place via a time-series API, which will rerun the submitted model on a data stream, iteratively on each data point.\n- Submissions will be evaluated by the utility score, explained below and implemented [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/jane-street-market-prediction\/discussion\/201257).\n\nKeep on reading the notebook :)","ef1ca91b":"[Here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/jane-street-market-prediction\/discussion\/199089) I am posting a discussion thread that explains about the evaluation metrics as well as utility score.

Each trade j has an associated weight and resp, which represents a return.\n\nFor each date i, we define:","81b0037d":"Here we observe the spikes in the data. Well, that's pretty expected from the distribution, yet we need to explore more on this behaviour.","b3bc073f":"- `resp` col is the key col to generate a return and `resp_{1, 4}` also represents the same entity but from different timezones. \n- Just from the above graphs, we can see that, all the resp cols are linear(almost, but with some noise added) with each other. We will dive deep into it, but let's see the `weight and resp` **together** effect on each time zone.","2207a15c":"where $|i|$ is the number of unique dates in the test set.
