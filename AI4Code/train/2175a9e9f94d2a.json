Generally A0 is 0.001 mm.\n* This equation assumes that a distance of 100 km separates the seismometer and the epicentre\n* Given seismic signals we are asked to predict the time until the onset of laboratory earthquakes\n* In the lab, 2 plates are put under pressure, resulting in shear stress\n* The training data is a single sequence of signal and seems to come from one experiment alone.\n* The test data consists of several different sequences, called segments, that may correspond to different experiments.\n* For each test data segment with its corresponding seg_id we are asked to predict it's single time until the lab earthquake takes place.\n","f7faefe4":"> It is well known that if a disaster has happened in a region, it is likely to happen there again. Some regions really have frequent earthquakes, but this is just a comparative quantity compared to other regions. So, predicting the earthquake with Date and Time, Latitude and Longitude from previous data is not a trend which follows like other things, it is natural occuring.","26fa0bda":"Description:\nHypothesis:\nBrief Discussion:","665a157b":"**Objective:**\nAnalyze The Earthquake Dataset provided by The NIEC between 1965 - 2016 and analyze the magnitude of Particular Earthquake.
