The most common Program Type is State Superfund Program\n2. Maximum number of project sites closed in the year 2015\n3. The most common contaminant is Lead and the least common are pickle liquor, mineral\/white spirits and calcium carbonate\n4. The most common control type os deed restriction\n\nAs a next step, we can use the location information about the sites and plot their locations on a map.","bec34a1f":"**Deed Restriction** is the most common type of control type with appoximately 45% of the total dataset.","64bfef63":"**Lead** is the most common contaminant across all sites with a whopping 2500+ sites with it.","16fcd751":"# Contaminants\n\nRather than exploring the waste names, it's better that we know which site has what contaminant. This may allow for similar solutions to be applied to sites that have same contaminants."}}
