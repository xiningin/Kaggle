In the subject \"ICT\", programming, software applications, utilization of the Internet and ICT environment, in the subject \"CS\", how to design and effectively use tools such as applications, in \"CCT\", problem solving and thinking by programming The purpose is to acquire skills such as development.|\n|Russia|2009|In Russian primary education, algorithm education is provided. Develop the ability to solve problems by building simple algorithms. In Russia, it seems that the emphasis is on algorithm education in ICT learning. The goal of learning is to develop the algorithmic thinking necessary to perform professional work in modern society, and to acquire the skills to create algorithms as one of the problem-solving methods.|\n|UK|2014|IIn 1995, \"IT\" was established as a compulsory independent subject in the primary and secondary education stages. In 1999, I changed the subject name to \"ICT\" and mainly learned how to operate computers and use applications. The turning point came around 2010. It is pointed out by the government and industry that although you can use writing software and spreadsheet software, it is not a subject to learn what you can do with a computer. Therefore, in 2012, the Ministry of Education reviewed the learning content of the \"ICT\" subject, changed the subject name to \"Computing\", and made primary education compulsory in 2014. In \"Computing\", instead of simply \"using\" computer operations as in the past, the learning content has changed to thinking about procedures for solving problems and setting the programming language to \"learning\".|\n|Japan|2020|[[Coding will be mandatory in Japan's primary schools from 2020]](https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Economy\/Coding-will-be-mandatory-in-Japan-s-primary-schools-from-2020)  |"}}
