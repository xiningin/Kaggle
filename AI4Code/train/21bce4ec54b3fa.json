But let's leave it for now, because it would unnecessarily complicate implementation if we wanted to automate this process.","779cda2b":"Ok, so the score decreased slightly, but we reduced input dimension by 80% and prediction time twice!\nOf course here top 20 was chosen arbitrarily, we could do a GridSearch approach and get multiple scores for different number of top variables and see how does the trade-off landscape between accuracy and complexity looks like.\n\nIn general, in-built selection is preferrable, because importances are calculated directly when fitting trees, so it saves computation and additional code lines, but in general it's good to know alternative methods for later use with algorithms that don't have in-built feature importance calculation.","06380420":"# Conclusion\n\nAs you can see using permutation importances didn't seem to prove improve accuracy. It reduced the number of columns down to 21, which seems a little low. It could be due to correlated inputs, for more info see here: https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/inspection\/plot_permutation_importance_multicollinear.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-inspection-plot-permutation-importance-multicollinear-py.\nAnyway, it was interesting to implement new Scikit Learn methods, although for practicality I would use in-built importances for dimensionality reduction and then use permutation importances or LIME \/ SHAP for model interpretation. Additionally, it would be worthwile to play around with automated multicollinearity reduction techniques in the future.","6e3e4d14":"# In-built feature importance\n\nRandom Forest was chosen for another nice property - it has in-built feature importance feature after fitting it, which saves considerable amount of coding.\nLet's use already fitted benchmark to get the important features.","5dbe1954":"fit base estimator, in next step get fitted estimator and apply feature importances","b2869711":"# Feature selection\n\nThe purpose of this post is to explore feature selection techniques, namely:\n    * Correlation based\n    * K-best\n    * In-built features importance of Random Forest\n    * Permutation importances","c83f257d":"# Permutation importance\n\nThe final technique that I'm going to consider in this post is permutation importance, which as argued (https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/inspection\/plot_permutation_importance.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-inspection-plot-permutation-importance-py) is superior to default impurity based feature importance.\n\nAdditionally, I'll wrap feature selection part into Sklearn pipeline, such that it can be integrated into end-to-end solution.","b250e623":"# The benchmark\n\nTypical framework for such experiments is building the simplest solution first and then trying different techniques to improve it.\nLet's use the usual Random Forest classifier, which is the go-to choice for prototyping, idea testing and experimentation.\nWe'll fit it on all features to get the benchmark and then try to reduce the number of features while maintaining as high accuracy as possible.\nBesides accuracy score, let's keep track of prediction time - a pretend scenario for when real time speed is important, this will add more motivation for dimensionality reduction.\nRemember, simple = good :)","f5c0e6be":"# Importance based on correlation to target","030a0f69":"Most of the variables have higher absolute correlation to target than random column, so this heuristic doesn't provide a good variable selection strategy.\nAlso all variables have very low correlations to target, e.g. 10% at most, so it's not evident how many top variables to select or what correlation threshold to set.\nLet's try taking top 20% most correlated variables and see how the score changes.","f2b180c4":"Separate X and y, add random feature for importance reference, change dtypes to float32 to speedup processing","7d2cb432":"# Data exploration\nThe dataset is taken from Kaggle: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/santander-customer-transaction-prediction\n\nLoad and inspect data,  check dimensions, data types, missing values, target variable","9d7ac79c":"Quite large dataset with 200 numerical features, no missing values and all variable names anonymyzed, target class is inbalanced.","d3f90e58":"# Sampling\n\nIn real life scenarios we would want to keep as much information as possible, given resource constraints and probably use model weights instead of downsampling.
