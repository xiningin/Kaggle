But since, most of the machine learning algorithms use Eucledian distance between two data points in their computations. We need to bring all features to the same level of magnitudes. This can be achieved by scaling. This means that you\u2019re transforming your data so that it fits within a specific scale, like 0\u2013100 or 0\u20131.","a0b8e7b0":"The data we use is usually split into training data and test data.
