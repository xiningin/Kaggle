What about employees who have been at the job longer?\n\nThe tafe_resignations dataframe already contains a \"service\" column, which we renamed to institute_service.\n\nBelow, we calculate the years of service in the dete_survey_updated dataframe by subtracting the dete_start_date from the cease_date and create a new column named institute_service.","8527b410":"First, we'll correct the Not Stated values and drop some of the columns we don't need for our analysis.","1419179b":"Below are our findings:\n - The years in both dataframes don't completely align.

Since we aren't concerned with analyzing the results by year, we'll leave them as is.","518b700d":"We can make the following observations based on the work above:\n - The dete_survey dataframe contains 'Not Stated' values that indicate values are missing, but they aren't represented as NaN.\n - Both the dete_survey and tafe_survey contain many columns that we don't need to complete our analysis.\nEach dataframe contains many of the same columns, but the column names are different.\n - There are multiple columns\/answers that indicate an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied.","970838c9":"# Identify Dissatisfied Employees\n\nNext, we'll identify any employees who resigned because they were dissatisfied.

The TAFE exit survey can be found [here](https:\/\/data.gov.au\/dataset\/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e\/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE can be found [here](https:\/\/data.gov.au\/dataset\/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d\/details?q=exit%20survey).\n\nWe'll pretend our stakeholders want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer the following question:\n - Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?","31cd5d20":"# Identify Missing Values and Drop Unneccessary Columns","1781d9ad":"# Clean the Service Column\n\nNext, we'll clean the institute_service column and categorize employees according to the following definitions:\n\n - New: Less than 3 years in the workplace\n - Experienced: 3-6 years in the workplace\n - Established: 7-10 years in the workplace\n - Veteran: 11 or more years in the workplace\n\nOur analysis is based on [this article](https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20171108006002\/en\/Age-Number-Engage-Employees-Career-Stage), which makes the argument that understanding employee's needs according to career stage instead of age is more effective.","76aa8d00":"# Combine the Data\n\nBelow, we'll add an institute column so that we can differentiate the data from each survey after we combine them.

Then, we'll calculate the percentage of employees who resigned due to dissatisfaction in each service_cat group and plot the results.\n\nNote that since we still have additional missing values left to deal with, this is meant to be an initial introduction to the analysis, not the final analysis.","abebabc9":"# Verify the Data\nBelow, we clean and explore the cease_date and dete_start_date columns to make sure all of the years make sense. We'll use the following criteria:\n- Since the cease_date is the last year of the person's employment and the dete_start_date is the person's first year of employment, it wouldn't make sense to have years after the current date. \n- Given that most people in this field start working in their 20s, it's also unlikely that the dete_start_date was before the year 1940.","53006610":"From the initial analysis above, we can tentatively conclude that employees with 7 or more years of service are more likely to resign due to some kind of dissatisfaction with the job than employees with less than 7 years of service. However, we need to handle the rest of the missing data to finalize our analysis."}}
