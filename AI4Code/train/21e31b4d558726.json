It allows data scientists to do end-to-end studies in a short amount of time. PyCaret is an alternative low-code library to the other open source machine learning libraries that may be used to do difficult machine learning tasks with only a few lines of code. PyCaret is a straightforward application.\nAll of PyCaret's operations are automatically saved in a bespoke pipeline that is completely organised and ready for deployment. PyCaret is a Python wrapper for a variety of machine learning libraries and frameworks, including scikit-learn, XGBoost, Microsoft LightGBM, spaCy, and others. \n\nHere, we are going to select the best model using Pycaret for classification of diabetic patients.","11f17d84":"# **Data Preparation**","ee3529a9":"# **Model Preparation**","528318bf":"# **Explantory data analysis**"}}
