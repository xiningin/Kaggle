Train gensim Doc2Vec model\n\n\nWord2Vec is a very famous algorithm for word embeddings. You can find a very good explanation of this algorithm in [this amazing blog post](http:\/\/jalammar.github.io\/illustrated-word2vec\/)\nThe main idea is beautifully resumed in this quote by  [John Ruper Firth](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Rupert_Firth) :\n\n *You shall know a word by the company it keeps*\n\nWord2Vec came up with this very innovative idea where you train a neural network on a task (finding a word given surrounding words - or the reverse) but you are not interested in the result of this task, rather in the weights of the network\u2019s hidden layer, that will be used to derive the word vectors. \n\nDoc2Vec has an augmented objective to have one vector for a sequence of words. \nThe first idea to do that could be to just take the mean vector of the Word2Vec vectors of each word in the sequence, however the  Doc2Vec authors had a smarter idea ([see the paper here](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1405.4053v2.pdf))\n).\nIt follows the same principle as Word2Vec : training on a task to get the hidden layer as a vector, but this time, we add the whole paragraph matrix along the window words as an input to the classifier. See on the following figure the task for the distributed memory model (you can check the other algorithm : Distributed bag of words in the article) \n\nFortunately the famous NLP library Gensim comes with an optimized class to train the Doc2Vec model \n[We can follow this tutorial](https:\/\/radimrehurek.com\/gensim\/auto_examples\/tutorials\/run_doc2vec_lee.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-tutorials-run-doc2vec-lee-py) on training Doc2Vec with gensim","c81bd823":"Keep only texts with minimal number of words using regex","98962048":"Unhide the cell below to find the definition of the following functions:\n* `format_name(author)`\n* `format_affiliation(affiliation)`\n* `format_authors(authors, with_affiliation=False)`\n* `format_body(body_text)`\n* `format_bib(bibs)`","3a3af65a":"<a id='clustering'><\/a>\n\n## 5.
