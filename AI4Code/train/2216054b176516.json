The financial sector is made up of firms and institutions that provide financial services. Banks, investment companies and insurance companies make up the financial sector. It is important that the financial sector remains profitable as its strength is a sign of a healthy economy [10]. The most profitable company in the list is Berkshire Hathway, a conglomerate holding company. Holding companies\u2019 primary business is holding a controlling interest in the securities of other companies [11]. It is no surprise that the technology sector is rapidly growing in the United States.

Catz has served as chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation since 2014. She began working at Oracle in 1999 [5]. Interestingly, Oracle is one of the many tech companies that moved its headquarters from California to Austin, Texas. Mary T.

She has been with General Motors for more than thirty years and the CEO for over seven years [6]. More diversity is necessary in the business world. Although the number of women running Fortune 500 businesses hit a record in 2021, there is still a very large gap between the number of men that are CEOs (93%) and the number of women that are CEOs. As for racial diversity, this year marks the first time that two Black women, Roz Brewer and Thasunda Brown, are running Fortune 500 businesses [7]. Before being appointed the CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Roz Brewer served as the COO of Starbucks and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club [8]. Accomplished businesswoman, Thasunda Brown Duckett, was the CEO of Chase Consumer Banking for over four years.
