The algorithm works by exploiting that fact that outliers are rare and most datapoints that are normal have similar feature values. The algorithm is able to label data points into outliers and normal points by recursively generating partitions on the dataset through randomly choosing features and its splitting values. The partitions are recursively created until a single data point is in the partition or all the points in the partitions have the same value. \n\nA diagram of the recursive partitioning is shown below:\n\n| ![](images\/iforest.png) |\n|:--:| \n| *From https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Isolation_forest* |\n\n\nThis recursively partitioning can be respresented as a tree and the length of the path from the root to the terminal node can be treated as a measure of normality. Points that require relatively few partitions and have relatively a small length to their terminal node (such as $X_j$ above) are considered outliers. When a forest of trees says the average depth to isolate a datapoint is small it's then flagged as a outlier by the model.\n\nScikit-learn has an implementation of [Isolation Forests](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html) that we will make use of to determine reasonable filters for outliers. One thing to notice is that there cannot be any missing values in the dataset when we fit the model:","ed396158":"These look like much more reasonable relationships! Let's get the maximum values to find the filters for removing outliers:","9c70d0d6":"The relationship is less obvious, but we can see that **buildings with higher electricity per square foot have a higher energy usage intensity.** \n\nNow we do the same for water usage intensity and EUI.

","3879ba05":"The box plots show that there are still a lot of outliers, but I don't want to remove too many data points, just the most egregious outliers.

I originally attmpted to clean and analyze this data set to try to find ways to reduce builings' energy usage and subsequently their green house gas emissions. After a few iterations I thought it might be interesting to see if I could predict the emission of green house gases from buildings by looking at their age, energy and water consumption as well as other energy consumption metrics. This is somewhat of a difficult task as the data was very messy and in this first blogpost I will cover how to perform,\n\n- Exploratory data analysis\n- Identify and remove outliers\n\nSince I will completing this project over multiple days and using [Google Cloud](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/), I will go over the basics of using [BigQuery](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/bigquery) for storing the datasets so I won't have to start all over again each time I work on it.  At the end of this blogpost I will summarize the findings, and give some specific recommendations to reduce mulitfamily and office building energy usage. The source code for this project can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mdh266\/NYCBuildingEnergyUse\">here<\/a>.\n\n----------\n### Data \n----------\nThe NYC Benchmarking Law requires owners of large buildings to annually measure their energy and water consumption in a process called benchmarking. The law standardizes this process by requiring building owners to enter their annual energy and water use in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) online tool, ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager\u00ae and use the tool to submit data to the City. This data gives building owners information about a building's energy and water consumption compared to similar buildings, and tracks progress year over year to help in energy efficiency planning.\n\nBenchmarking data is also disclosed publicly and can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/html\/gbee\/html\/plan\/ll84_scores.shtml\">here<\/a>.  I analyzed the 2016 data and my summary of the findings and recommendations for reducing energy consumption in New York City buildings are discussed in the conclusions post.\n\nThe data comes from the year 2016 and is quite messy and a lot of cleaning is necessary to do analysis on it. The cleaning process was made more difficult because the data was stored as strings with multiple non-numeric values which made converting the data to its proper type a more involved process.  One thing to keep in mind through out this post is that this is **self-reported data**, meaning our data is mostly biased, containinig outliers. Therefore, I will go over a few techniques for removing outliers in post.","25df1008":"We can use 140 as the upper bound for `NGI` and 180 for `Site_EUI`:","eff48bbb":"Interestingly, here we see a weaker, but still positive correlation, meaning **buildings which use more water per square foot only have marginarly higher energy usage intensity.** \n\nLastly we repeat the procedure for greenhouse gas emission intensity (`GHGI`), since I think that if a building is more energy intensive it would have a much larger carbon foot print. It turns out the filters already used were good enough and it didnt seem like there was too many outliers:","5e65a4b9":"We can see that we removed 669 buildings or a little less than 7%, which is a little high, but given this is self reported data it's not entirely unreasonable.","3c53b375":"About half of the buildings have missing data!

Note that we first have to normalize the data.","8337fc01":"It seems like it's the opposite of what I thought, but the number of residential buildings is much higher and the majority were built right before and right after World War 2, as well as in the 2000s.  The same is true about offices, however, without the uptick in the early 2000s.","eba46b05":"We can see again, large variations in the energy data, with most of it being between 0 and some fixed number with atleast one outlier.  For example, the minimum age of a building is -2, which is absurd!  We can also see from the varying \"count\" values that there are a significant number of missing values.  Let's find out just how many buildings have atleast one missing value:","c0aa57af":"The most common buildings in NYC are multifamily housing, then offices, other, hotels and somewhat suprisingly non-refrigerated warehouse space.

Let's create our dataset focusing on the fields:\n\n    - Energy Star \n    - Site Energy Usage Intensity (Site_EUI)\n    - Natural Gas Intensity (NGI)\n    - Eletricity Intensity (EI)\n    - Water Intensity (WI)\n    - Green House Gas Intensity (GHGI)\n    - Occupancy Per Sq Ft (OPSFT)\n    - Age \n    - Residential (1 or 0 if true or false)\n    \nWe choose these fields as they should be independent of size of the building and therefore comparable across buildings.","2b759075":"This is too many building types to visualize the Energy Star Score (<code>Energy_Star<\/code>) of each, we'll just look at just 5 building types, lumping the 54 into the categories into either:\n- Residential\n- Office\n- Retail\n- Storage\n- Other\n\nI built a function to group the buildings into the 5 types above called <code>clean_property_type(...)<\/code> and we use it below to transform the Pandas Series:","50e825fb":"Now we can look at the  <code>Energy_Star<\/code> (score) of each of the grouped buildings types:","17687ca2":"We can then look at the distribution of values in the dataframe:","7de50316":"There are about 13,233 buildings with different types of energy usage, emissions and other information.

In addition, we must do some basic feature engineering.  The reported data gives us the metrics (`NAT_Gas`, `Elec_Use`, `GHG`, `Water_Use`) in terms of total volume. Using these metrics in comparing buildings of different sizes is not a fair comparison.  In order to compare them fairly we must standardize these metrics by dividing by the square footage of the buildings giving us each metrics' intensity.

Our strategy for removing the outliers will be to use scatter plots of various the metrics against the `Site_EUI` as their should be a natural relationship between them. For the purposes of this removing outliers let's focus on just `NGI`,`EI`,`WI`, and `GHGI` as we expect these correlated to `Site_EUI`:","ccdfbe94":"We can see that the majority are within the 50-100 range, but a almost 1000 buildings have scores inbetween 0 and 10.

From the final heat map of the correlation matrix we can see that the Energy Star score is negatively correlated with enery usage intensity.  This makes sense as the energy star score is a measure of energy efficiceny of the building. The energy usage intensity has a strong positive correlation to the natural gas usage intensity.  We can see that natural gas usage intensity and electricity usage intensity are uncorrlated.  This implies we could replace one with the other.  Therefore reducing natural gas consumption or replacing it with electricity could be the best answer to reducing energy usage intensity and green house gas emissions.  It should also be noted that year the residence was built did not have any correlation with energy usage intensity. This is probably due to the fact that the majority of residential buildings in New York City were built in a similar time period and before energy efficiency was a priority.\n\n\nSince natural gas usage intensity is most highly correlated with energy usage intensity reducing it could improve building energy efficiency and reduce green house gas emissions (so long as the buildings' electricity comes from a clean energy source or atleast one with less emissions than natural gas). Some ways to reduce natural gas consumption include:\n\n- Investing in more efficient heating and cooling services or slightly reducing the usage of either heating or cooling during the day when most people are not home. This is especially important in large buildings as HVAC systems have a larger volume of air to heat\/cool.\n\n\n- Another option is to reuse waste heat, such as reusing the vented air from electric clothes dryers, however, filtering and the air will be necessary and could alter the cost effectiveness of this approach.\n\n\n- Replacing gas powered appliances such as stoves with more efficient electric ones is another option.  However, the source of electric power should also be considered to weigh the overall energy efficiency and enviromental impact.\n\n\n- Another option is to replace gas powered water heaters by solar powered water heaters. While solar powered water heaters are not as cost effective in moderate climates, the presence of numerous roof top water tanks on New York City buildings may help make this option more financially competitive.  At the very least, it suggests that having roof top water tanks for solar powered water heaters is structurally possible, where as with individual houses this may not be the feasible.\n\n\n- In addition, buying energy efficient refrigerators and dryers is also important as these are two of the largest energy consumers in ones home.\n\n\nWe saw that there were a lot of fields in the dataset with missing values.  In the next blogpost we will go over the steps to how to impute these missing values.","a0ba8ee5":"Most buildings are in compliance with the Department of Finance Benchmarking standards.
