Apart from these two fields, the fields where Data Scientists do not use Machine Learning the most are **Accounting\/Finance** and **Manufacturing\/Fabrication**.\n\nI get the first point. The data is skewed. Most of them are from the education or computer industry and stochastically many of them will not use ML methods. That's very statistically significant. What intrigues me most is the 2nd point. That is Finance and Manufacturing industries Data Scientists also do not use Machine Learning often, be it a team of 1-2 Data Scientists or 20+ Data Scientists. \n\nNow is this an indicator of the following points?\n\n* These two industries simply does not require Machine Learning a lot? Now I don't know a lot about the manufacturing industry, but if we see the current trend of AI in finance, we almost daily see an article in medium about **Time Series Forecasting** in finance industry. Then why is there such a shortage of ML methods in finance, at least in this dataset? Is it because:\n* For the finance industry, the articles we see in medium are not good enough for the real world and they are more likely to fail in the real world?\n* And for the manufacturing industry, it seems to me that there can be a lot of really good use cases especially regarding inventory. But why is that not reflected in this dataset? Is it because of the lack of experience, the Data Scientists this industry is hiring is not able to solve this problem or is it something else?\n\nNow most likely you have understood my pattern. I ask a question, try to answer that and then bring in more questions! More questions and few answers! Life is so hard! But let's adhere to that pattern and ask ourselves this next logical question:\n\n## 6.g) For the Finance and the Manufacturing industry, what is the average experience (in terms of years) of Machine Learning that the employess in there have? \n\nTo get this answer, we drag **Q15 (Experience of ML (years)) in the rows** and **Q20 (industry)** in the column.

So is this a signal that young people don't like Machine Learning at all? Of course, this data is skewed and may or may not be a proper representation of the whole population, but still this leads to an interesting querstion. \n\nIs the Young generation not interested in Machine Learning because:\n\n1.

A significant number of Data Analysts of age group 25-29 does not use Machine Learning method.

May the force be with you kind of thing. They are waiting for a miracle to happen or something like that. Most likely this group are still using jupyter notebooks for doing machine learning. And I don't blame them. Putting ML models in production is hard, really hard. Take a look at the rough steps it takes for productionizing a model.\n    * First, you have to create an API for the model's pickle file.\n    * Then you most likely have to create a dockerfile for your devops team so that they can run this API at some open port and deploy it.\n    * Then the front facing web app consumes it.\n    * But your task is far from over. What if your test data doesn's match the distribution of your training data? You suddenly understand that the training data was an anomaly? Or what if it initially matches your training data but slowly drifts away to a different distribution because of perception change, market change or behaviour change? \n    * Taking all the above into account, you have to create some kind of model monitoring system so that you can be alerted of any kind of [concept drift](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/gentle-introduction-concept-drift-machine-learning\/) if that happens.\n    * And if that concept drift happens (actually it will happen, just a matter of when), then you need to have some kind of re-training framework in place so that your business doesn't lose millions of dollars just by trusting your model.\n    * So you see, this whole process is not easy. It is actually even more difficult than the model training itself. If you don't believe me, read this [paper](https:\/\/proceedings.neurips.cc\/paper\/2015\/file\/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf) by google which talks about \"Hidden technical debts in Machine Learning\". In this paper, you will see why Machine Learning is only a very small part in any organization's AI workflow. But again, CyberDeck has a one click MLOPS section, which will do all the above, with just one click of the mouse. If you want to see that in action, check this video out: https:\/\/youtu.be\/bj9nCRkT8nM and skip to **8:46**.\n2. **Next are the people who have admitted that they don't use ML models in production.**\n3. **After that, we have people, who have well established ML models in production for more than 2 years (good for them!)**\n4. **Finally, we have people, whose models have been in production for less than 2 years and people who use ML models for generating insights (but do not put them in production).**\n\nSo you see, this whole MLOPS thingy is still very new to everyone, and a very few of them have nailed it.\n\nNow let's try to segregate these people again by their different characteristics so that we can form our next set of hypotheses.\n","f1ff0d01":"We see again that most of the data is null here.

On the right hand side of the **Count** dropdown and also below it, we see two empty spaces for dragging different columns in.\n5.

But here, we see that they belong to one of the dominating classes within age group 25-29 who are exploring ML models and may put them in production one day. These two insights are quite contradictory. So let's try to delve deeper into this.\n\nFor this, we bring **Q15 (Years of ML experience)** into the row alongside the other variable.

Let's validate that by understanding if they are also uncomfortable in putting ML models to production.\n\nWe will put **Q23 (Putting ML models in production)** in the rows and **Q1 (Age group)** in the columns section.

But if we see the bar just next to it, this bar belongs to the Data Analysts. Majority of them has under 1 years of experience or 1-2 years of experience. But little experience always brings the dream out of you and you tend to seek higher, almost impossible acheivements. So these are the people who said that **They are exploring ML models and plan to put them in production one day**.
