However, the percentage dropped to 34.1% in 2017. \n\n\n\n**<font color='green'>The Bookings:<\/font>**\n- **Almost 2\/3 of hotel booking gets cancelled**, therefore the probability of hotel booking cancellation is much higher. \n\n- **87.6% cancellation is observed with 'no deposit'** followed by 12.2% non-refundable deposit. This is beacuse, customers is not willing to deposit any amount which is non-refundable, resulting in high ratio of 'no deposit' booking. \n\n\n\n**<font color='green'>The Customers:<\/font>**\n- It is observed that 94.6% of customers who have booked hotel have not cancelled any bookings earlier. This looks positive on hotel business. However, as **97% of the customers are new**, it is cannot be denied that **hotels do not get repeat visitors**, observed as 3.19%. \n\n- **Most customers are Transient**, who visit without kids which is accounted by 99.2% without babies, 92.8% without children. Although, feature babies and children seems redundant in presence of one another, it however is not. \n\n- Most customers have certain request, such as **bed in breakfast as highest preference**. However, as most hotels are City Hotels, **most customers do not give priority to parking space**. It is because, cities usually have well transportaion connectivities.","d24c668f":"### 2.2.2.
