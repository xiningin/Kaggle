vast majority of users \"never\" use drugs. It's good to to see.","ff302fc9":"#### General Comments\n\nIn this project machine learning was used to predict the astrological signs of OkCupid users. This is an important feature since many people believe in astrology and matches between compatible star signs. If users don't input their signs, an algorithmic solution could have generated a sign to impute missing data when making matches.\n\nAlas, the final selected algorithm did no better than basic guessing.\n","9e902d8b":"#### Splitting Data\n\nNext the data needs to be split into train and validation sets. In this split 25% of the data is reserved for the final validation, while 75% is kept for training the model. ","bbd069da":"# Discrete variable\n\n#### Sex\n\nPreviously it was identified that there are more males in the data, and it seems that there are ~35,000 men to ~25,000 women.","1f5149a7":"#### Label Imbalance \n\nAn imbalance in the prediction label needs to be checked. This is important since it's a multi-class problem where two or more outcomes can be had. An imbalance in a response variable is bad since it means that some labels only occur a few times. This is an issue for machine learning algorithms if there are not enough data to train with which will give bad predictions. \n\nIn the given dataset, we observe that the counts of all the zodiac signs are more or less equal (i.e., without large deviations). Hence, we do not have to worry about imbalances and trying to address this problem.","b7ec088a":"In the confusion matrix, it becomes clear that Cancer, Gemini, Leo, and Virgo was predicted most often, but was not super accurate since the vertical color band represents even distributed guesses mostly wrong and some correct.

","31086523":"#### K Nearest Neighbor\n\nThe next models is the `KNeighborsClassifier` which will take 20 of it's neighbors to predict the signs. The default value for `n_neighbors` is 5 which was kept. This number can be tuned later on if needed. This model had a 33% accuracy which is a good sign.\n","26c408ea":"#### Height\n\nThe next plot shows the height variable, most people look like they are between 5 feet tall and 6.5 feet tall.","c3af6755":"#### Status\n\nThe relationship status for a dating website is fairly predictable.

It seems that many of the columns do have missing values. ","c6f5d105":"Below is a confusion matrix of the results with the true values on the y axis and predicted values along the x axis.

Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we've never had before about how different people experience romance.\n\nThe goal of this project is to scope, prep, analyze, and create a machine learning model to solve a question.\n\n## Import Python Modules\n","e2d68ef5":"#### Orientation\n\nThe majority of users are straight."}}
