**Sex**: Being a Female will increase survival rate.\n* **Parents\/Children**: Survival rate increases by having 1-3 parents\/children.\n* **Siblings\/Spouses**: Survival rate increases by having 1 sibling\/spouse.\n* **Embarked Location**: Embarking from Cherbourg increases survival rate.\n* **Fare**: Paying a fare of ~ 30-90 increases survival rate.\n* **Passenger Class**: Being a First Class passenger increases survival rate.\n  * From our descriptive statistics analysis earlier: ***First Class Passengers had the highest survival rate (~ 67%) compared to Second Class (~ 47%) and Third
