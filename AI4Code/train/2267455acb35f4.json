Eventually, we evaluate the cummulative similarity based on all the features processed to give a single number for the overall similarity score.\n* Description - We filter the description by removing stopwords and punctuations. Then we use TF-IDF to find weight (importance) of each word in the description. Cosine similarity is used to find similarity between descriptions of two shows.\n* Genre - Each show has set of genre types that are applicable as per the content. We match each genre and similarity is calculated as the [intersection\/ union] of the genre for given two shows.\n* Rating - As some of the rating titles mean similar categories, we group given ratings into appropriate clusters, e.g., Y, Y7, and Y7-FV are grouped in one cluster. As each rating has a distance from other rating, i.e., Y is closer to PG than R which means that a person who watches Y rated shows is more likely to watch Y or PG shows than R rated shows. Thus, each cluster is trategically placed from other clusters according to the likelihood of closeness.\n* Country of Release - Country of release follows the same approach as that of Genre.\n\n### **Final similarity score:**\n\nWe gave weights to each metric where description had the highest weight of 0.4 while genre, rating and country had equal weights of 0.2 each.

To find the recommendation, we have used intersection by union approach. Initially, we find the intersection of country list between two movies and total number of unique countries between two movies. Once we achieve this, we divide the number of intersected movies by all uniques movies and get our similarity score.  \n\nOur dataset consists of 8% values which nan. We can assume that when we have nan, we can't find similarity and thus the score will be equal to 0. \n\n### Recommendation by Ratings","28e4af3b":"### Distribution of shows over Country","143e2b87":"## **Netflix Data EDA**","c4f2e803":"## Content Based Filtering\n\nRecommendation engine is a method to predict what user desires at a given moment in time.
