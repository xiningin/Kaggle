But we are still using Decision Tree models, which are not very sophisticated by modern machine learning standards. In the next step you will learn to use **[Random Forests](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/random-forests)** to improve your models even more. Random Forests are based on decision trees, but they typically give you much better predictions.\n\n---\n**[Course Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/machine-learning)**\n\n\n"}}
