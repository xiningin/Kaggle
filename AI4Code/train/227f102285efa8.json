The * is used to denote a stop codon, in these regions the protein has finished its full length. Many of these occur frequently and result in short lengths of protein, more likely than not these play little biological role and will be excluded in the further analyses. <br\/>\n\n**Code Details** <br\/>\nCan be found here: [translate](https:\/\/biopython.org\/DIST\/docs\/api\/Bio.Seq-module.html#translate)","a66752e5":"I hope you enjoyed this notebook, and I hope our data science community can continue to tackle data regarding the caronavirus now that we are all working from home.
