Customer churn is one of the biggest concerns of a bank and through a combination of exploratory data analysis and model predictions the bank intends to retain its customers and minimize customer loss.\nChurn is defined as a movement of a customer\/client from one company to the other. There are several reasons that may lead to an increase in customer churn in the case of banks. Some of the reasons are stated below: \na) Availability of latest technology   b)Customer friendly staff c) Low interest rates\nOn average, service providers such as banks experience a churn rate between 10 to 30 % \nAfter running prections using machine learning models, the bank wants to know those potential customers who are at risk of leaving the bank so that the bank can direct their efforts towards retaining them through promotions, offers et cetera.\n\n\n#CUSTOMER CHURN MODELS\nSuch models are developed to identify those customers who are likely to churn. These models uses historical data on former churners in order to find similarities with existing clients. Customers who are found to exhibit such similarities are classified as potential churners.\nBanks choose to focus more on retaining customers because the cost of attracting new customers is much more than the cost incurred on retaining them. Customers who are associated with the bank on a long-term basis less costly to serve and therefore generate higher profit for the bank. Such customers also provide new referrals which negates the needs for banks to direct a chunk of their resources towards attracting new customers.\n\nIn this project, the following sequence of actions will be undertaken:\na) An exploratory data analysis of the database will be undertaken to summarize the data and interpretations will be stated as per requirement for better understanding.\nb) For predicting possible customer attrition\/churn in the future, different models will be used to find the most accurate results which will be used to help the bank to reduce customer churn.\n","498d7c05":"From the above diagram, it is observed that approximately **49%** of the total customer base are inactive,which is a worrying statistic for the bank. The bank is bound to face difficulties unless they take measures to entice inactive customers to restart banking services.","f35340cc":"We will import pre-installed libraries for the purpose of exploratory data analysis","4d969fc7":"From the above diagram, it is observed that majority of the customers associated with the bank are from France as compared to Germany and Spain.","3296218d":"**DATASET PREPROCESSING**\nWe are going to use a dataset which gives information regarding bank customers and their associated features for predicting whether a customer is likely to leave the bank or not","4ba2b85d":"In the following cell, we scale all the variables to calibrate the predictive model for better results.","f5c122b3":"In the above graph, it is observed that the bank has a significant amount of clients who have availed their credit card services.","9bd69c5c":"**FEATURE ENGINEERING FOR THE PREDICTIVE MODEL**\n\nIn thise section, we will select features\/variables that are essential for the purpose of developing a predictive model. We need to know which input variables will give us baseline accuracy. We will also create new features based on the ralationship between attributes and use it with the existing ones for predicting the next client who is likely to churn. \n\nIn the following cell, we will create\/standardize some attributes on a head to head basis. For instance, we will create an attribute between **Balance** and **EstimatedSalary** since they are quantitative in nature. Similarly,we will find a ratio between **Tenure** and **CreditScore** over **Age**","486b2849":"**Relations of Continuous variables with Customer Attrition\/Exit**","9691e43b":"**We now check for missing values in the dataset**","6b3e2ea0":"**CONCLUSION**\nThis study was conducted to use an existing dataset of a bank with the aim of predicting customers who are likely to leave the bank in the near future. Using this predictions, the bank will be able to formulate a strategy to retain these set of customers. After performing an exploratory data anlysis on the existing dataset, we gained an insight in to the bank's current state of affairs; a key observation being that 20% of the bank customers had left the bank. This figure was taken into consideration while deciding the default set o=for the test data which was 25%.\n\nTo make the predictions, it was seen that Random Forest Model was the most efficient model in this case with an accuracy of 87%. It is said that every machine learning model is valid and the performance of any model depends on the existing information and the parameters that have been passed. Random Forest has a topology of multiple trees and helps avoiding overfitting. A model can always perform better if the datasets are much larger and more information can beu used to train the model.","1c40fb01":"**There are no missing values in any of the columns and we can proceed further \nCheck the data type for each column\/variable in the dataset**","63f168e3":"**In the table below,  the key characteristics of the dataset is displayed.**","6040d088":"**MODEL TESTING AND VALIDATION**\nIn the following cells, a prediction list featuring the first five customers who are likely to churn in the near futurewill be displayed using a new dataframe.\n**As seen above, Random Forest Models had the ighest accuracy and hence will be used to make the predictions**","3d7b9340":"From the table above, we can see that columns **'Geography'** and **'Gender'** now have numerical values","9883d7d3":"1) **CustomerID**: Unique number assigned to each bank customer**\n\n2) **Surname**: Last name of each bank customer\n\n3) **CreditScore**: It is a number that shows the customer's creditworthiness.
