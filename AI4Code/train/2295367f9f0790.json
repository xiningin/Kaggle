It is an important subtask in natural language processing systems.*** \n\nReference : [A Machine Learning Approach to Coreference Resolution of Noun Phrases](https:\/\/www.mitpressjournals.org\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1162\/089120101753342653)\n\n![](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/ai.orbifold.net\/default\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/corefexample.png?resize=1030%2C550)\n\n* In the example below you can see an example of **(positive and negative) coreferences** in the ***sentence \u2018My mother\u2019s name is Sasha, she likes dogs.\u2018.*** In this, ***the token \u2018she\u2019 refers to \u2018Sasha\u2019 and not \u2018dogs\u2019.*** It takes a ***lot of (annotated) data and neural training to make this happen.*** Nowadays a precision of around ***75% can be achieved in English while other languages are slowly catching up.***\n\n* There are a lot of linguistic subtleties when it comes to ***coreferences points(pleonasms, anaphora, cataphora etc.)***  but ***according to the AI of the consumer and the chatbots, the correction is something wonderful.*** As long as the given ***text is not too big, everything is fine.*** On the contrary, imagine that you gave twenty pages of ***Shakespeare and ask for \"him\", which is mentioned on the last page. The time between coreferences can not be too long. Short entries of chatbot records, emergency calls and messaging applications are ideal.***\n* Basic references can be part of a larger semantic graph (and semantic reasoner) that represents the essence of a particular context (for example, an emergency call). Essentially, any correlated (together) entry is a separate subgraph, but references create a connected graph. A little like substances that create weak bonds through cohesion.\n\n","6b8e38b7":"### **5.Error Analysis**\n\n*  That ***GAP is  challenging  for both off-the-shelf systems and our baselines. To assess the variance between these systems and gain a more qualitative understanding of what as- pects of GAP are challenging, we use the num- ber of off-the-shelf systems that agree with the rater-provided labels (Agreement with Gold) as a proxy for difficulty. Table 11 breaks down the name-pronoun examples in the development set by Agreement with Gold (the smaller the agreement the harder the example).**\n* *Agreement with **Gold is low (average 2.1) and spread. Less than 30% of the examples are successfully solved by all systems (labeled Green), and just under 15% are so challenging that none of the systems gets them right (Red). The majority are in between (Yellow). Many Green cases have syntactic cues for coreference, but we find no sys- tematic trends within Yellow.***\n\n![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kagglesdsdata\/datasets\/106140\/287877\/table12.JPG?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1550302390&Signature=FTSW5FTKAVYA%2BjPM7AFIQNJEsPQQAImXuSaKH%2B5G5Mz9ATqjagoiXevM3iVEYrnVLI63828uVXcf1RteEVifgB7XI69ZhDwBX8uxV18Q9cTP0n5RU5KgJvGNYO1vQamd5R6Hz6Pj8z9EJLj1MyZk6sDHTevtB6J%2F7x1lwML%2Ff5Rinl2gT%2FZg6%2F6stZ3hOI9JQi6MMYA%2BMaS7mlJafs%2B2boezz1O04lm4IEZmrodLAO7SEdIQvz0%2BbV7rJ7hsV1aSBAcWZX0dy%2FNO%2BTJpW82OKmnw7T3c1%2FzBjszLVb7%2B5vBDi6FEzlCfI%2F5INdNlq3vGIrJTZklK9c76%2FnsDRxhc7g%3D%3D)\n\n\n### **6.Conclusion** \n> I am not changing conclusion. because it helps to getting all insights\n\n* They have presented a **dataset and a set of strong baselines for a new coreference task, GAP.** *Designed GAP to represent the challenges posed by real-world text,* in which **ambiguous pronouns are important and difficult to resolve.** *Highlighted gaps in the existing state of the art, and proposed the **application of Transformer models to address these.** Specifically, we show how traditional linguistic features and modern sentence encoder technology are complementary.*\n* ***Work contributes to the emerging body of work on the impact of bias in machine learning. We saw systematic differences between genders in analysis; this is consistent with many studies which call out differences in how males and fe- males are discussed publicly. By rebalancing our dataset for gender, we hope to reward systems which are able to capture these complexities fairly. It has been outside the scope of this paper to explore bias in other dimensions, to analyze coreference in other languages, and to study the impact on downstream systems of improved coreference res- olution. We look forward to future work in these directions.***\n\n\n### Thanks **Google  and  the Google AI Language team** for sharing such wonderful problem and this research paper\n\n### ***Note : Correct me if i had done mistake any where.***","118d0d76":"### **2.Background**\n\n* Existing datasets do not capture ambiguous pronouns in suf\ufb01cient volume or diversity to benchmark systems for practical applications.\n\n#### ***2.1.Datasets with Ambiguous Pronouns***\n\nHere they are talking about similar dataset which is contain pronouns ambigiousness\n\n1.

We confine ourselves to singular references, non-reflective pronouns of the genus, and names whose head tokens differ from each other.\n\n* ***FINALPRO.*** Both names must be in the same sentence, and the pronoun may appear in the same or directly following sentence.\n* ***MEDIALPRO.*** The first name must be in the sentence directly preceding the pronoun and the second name, both of which are in the same sentence. To decrease the bias for the pronoun to be coreferential with the first name, the pronoun must be in an initial sub- ordinate clause or be a possessive in an initial prepositional phrase.\n* ***INITIALPRO.*** All three mentions must be in the same sentence and the pronoun must be in an initial subordinate clause or a possessive in an initial prepositional phrase.\n\n*Convert and improve this diversity in five dimension*\n\n* **Page Coverage.** We retain at most 3 exam- ples per page-gender pair to ensure a broad coverage of domains.\n* **Gender.** The raw pipeline extracts contexts with a m:f ratio of 9:1.

We include such examples in our dataset but bal- ance them 1:1 against examples that do not include mentions of the page entity.\n* **Coreferent Name.** To ensure mention order is not a cue for systems, our final dataset is balanced for label \u2014 i.e. whether Name A or Name B is the pronoun\u2019s referent.","77c422f1":"## Research topic Name : **Entity Coreference Resolutions - NLU Task**\n\n----\n\n![](https:\/\/camo.githubusercontent.com\/94157dbf6ab835f0608aa44d8fca92b4ae74eeec\/68747470733a2f2f68756767696e67666163652e636f2f636f7265662f6173736574732f7468756d626e61696c2d6c617267652e706e67)\n![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kagglesdsdata\/datasets\/106140\/287946\/sample.JPG?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1550303436&Signature=k15Uq4bg8h9Raqs3FVQArPATMazCL1KFJSsjBZkwkBVAqScdnH54cfhzIrmoZI8ZmJqX%2B17KuJzr9bsasoeP2FnUPHIM5LNLbvrJdgutkh8ax3iJU6xOP0Kw6uUXAlt1CBd02qgL0Bq10Nbn96UOLFMDqdUJt%2B7JR27JsCI8f9XOxee1UFQOv8HpR022V4b5ZYKYs9kaBK7QJyu6IvYmsJtl0py1I2uxGO8K%2F1miBhKlFtIP%2BRZEQqOxMSw5fcekp5p3Sgz47ZmsNuDDyMIddKeYaNzLXYZIvDCcNaUkcwWHT6uTqaKIXyWUEVxVUZ45bKqSAk3UxcrO0bBz15f8cw%3D%3D)\n\n**Note : Here, I have tried to giving full insight about this topic as much as possible.I have gather all information by research from the internet. so if I missed something suggest. **\n\n* For this topic I will explaied here some basic so It will make it clear more to understand this topic\n\n\n\n---\n## Index : \n[**1 .What is Coreference?**](#1-.What-is-Coreference?) | [**2.

One possible reason that in-domain OntoNotes performance and out-of-domain GAP performance are not very different could be that state-of-the-art systems are highly tuned for re- solving names rather than ambiguous pronouns.\n\n### **4.3 Coreference-Cue Baselines**\n\n![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kagglesdsdata\/datasets\/106140\/287877\/table6.JPG?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1550299165&Signature=YYlLuPGVfn%2BNYkJXWYz3vThMfOqYgpCrlvCpFGkpWKwn4%2Bwt0PwiE0qSZaM4seUUzXbBjbzDA1FetBjuAWMSGracKpNIFZouOLFyVoNdtSzmrrhoOh4IaaByj9grE%2F20F5RL%2BMjUaYVpjAerFtAMY4aoSI2fUzm6vNLeFnztL0Y8ytWtfaAmP6IMrTs113wy8kSTeZIGuqHDnblC1jd9%2FeQLT3FfCi1J0exctkOXugmvTQGOhGVzg5PNG30J042%2FN1boCRO0YNDw1Cotkz7amLNbbjc5dUs6LABEH2ZlX6HIqXd8DdKvGfq4dVFuqEakI1WC3FBrNuefO6Ekx%2FsAJA%3D%3D)\n\n* To understand the shortcomings of state-of-the-art coreference systems on GAP, the upper sections of Table 6 consider several simple baselines based on traditional cues for coreference.They don't require gender match because of constrain of Google NL API. and Second, They select among the candidates using one of the heuristics described next.For scoring purposes, we do not require exact string match for mention alignment, that is, if the selected candidate is a substring of a given name (or vice versa), we infer a coreference relation between that name and the target pronoun.\n\n#### Surface Cues Baseline cues which require only access to the input text are:\n* **RANDOM.** Select a candidate uniformly at random.\n* **TOKEN DISTANCE.** Select the closest can- didate to the pronoun, with distance mea- sured as the number of tokens between spans. \n* **TOPICAL ENTITY.** Select the closest candi- date which contains the most frequent token string among extracted candidates.\n\n![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kagglesdsdata\/datasets\/106140\/287877\/table7.JPG?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1550299936&Signature=D0uBXmnzuYOTKB34sw%2FYSV09Fkpc1VsSTfYe6I9TdcgYjx628MccO%2F%2BVd0BEJl3q%2FzGYwBTEW0Zrvlq%2B9xK1H9ASplUgtdcTZaI1b%2FPeCJC2tqVVIuaoOMFwBp2dE7FAoK2VAH%2Fd03rVKZ6KtwB4oJnuzpfi4vDXn3iohfGlbJmjDwMDvvhYd%2BQ4ppq63C0Y3PYjSvER%2BME%2BnA2JvriOPvuP2L7EFxtxnr8PUFzXNo3JrnNgwAYLv%2Bv7e2UpLACtTkVcP0MN8lFvFKSVnrlo80mDV7%2FFcd4AMu%2F5ZqRfnB0TVYKIoNsfjvqtkpzDljqBe%2FtvS63bqFnzb74omiP2fw%3D%3D)\n\n* The performance of ***RANDOM (41.5 Overall) is lower than an otherwise possible guess rate of 50%. This is because the baseline considers all possible candidates, not just the two annotated names. Moreover, the difference between  masculine and feminine examples suggests that there are more distractor mentions in the context of fem- inine pronouns in GAP. To measure the impact  of pronoun context, we include performance on the artificial gold-two-mention setting where only the two name spans are candidates for inference (Table 7).*** RANDOM is indeed closer here to the expected 50% and other baselines are closer to gender-parity.\n* TOKEN DISTANCE and TOPICAL ENTITY are only weak improvements above RANDOM, vali- dating that our dataset creation methodology con- trolled for these factors.\n\n#### Structural Cues Baseline cues which may ad- ditionally access syntactic structure are:\n* **SYNTACTIC DISTANCE.** Select the syntac- tically closest candidate to the pronoun. Back off to TOKEN DISTANCE.\n* **PARALLELISM.** If the pronoun is a subject or direct object, select the closest candidate with the same grammatical argument. Back off to SYNTACTIC DISTANCE.\n\n* Both cues yield strong baselines comparable to the strongest **OntoNotes-trained systems** (cf. Table 4). In fact, $Lee et al. (2017)$ and **PARALLELISM** produce remarkably ***similar output: of the 2000 example pairs in the development set, the two have completely opposing predictions (i.e. Name A  vs.  Name B) on only 325 examples.***\n\n### ***Transfomer Model on validation dataset and results***\n\n![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kagglesdsdata\/datasets\/106140\/287877\/table8.JPG?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1550300184&Signature=cmzSdi2w0TS3eQ1k3AsdWDaQxYYYAoFbkt5TVty%2BHL7xLAL8jRaWNSqhd6AZ9YrPfS1m%2Byz2XWsIuhxjAU47G18TuDNVeU%2B9RbvQjjKgk3lpiLZsAYywEIiiutheXZaeXi8AJ%2Fkw4R1RXDG2hRGTzgaW8xzNrT4LtP0SUKkZOBkFvZmNVaYT3pjw%2FPKbUoY498hS2lS6ee5cC%2B8AWHdIgQeZ71kYA%2FWJAtHiOtkxDu3P5ZxNigxsYYwtmwvEgEZVmcNSPjOTIjJn%2F0jrwuSQcWmY215t%2BjWEawylVBdG%2Buh4h04AN3koiqq%2FUTSU6ni86Uw6tF%2BKe6Bd2fP4h%2B8lXg%3D%3D)\n\n* ***Wikipedia Cues\tTo explore the page-context** setting, they consider a Wikipedia-specific cue: URL. Select the syntactically closest candi- date which has a token overlap with the page title. Back off to PARALLELISM. The heuristic gives a performance gain of 2% overall compared to PARALLELISM. That the feature is not more helpful again validates our methodology for extracting diverse examples. We expect future work to greatly improve on this base- line by using the wealth of cues in Wikipedia arti- cles, including page text.\n\n### **4.4Transformer Models for Coreference**\n\n![](https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-ovHQGevt5Ks\/WaiCfS0OPUI\/AAAAAAAAB_U\/nEqsh9fgecM1v98NAvGp8Zgr5BwBbOGBQCEwYBhgL\/s640\/image4.png)\n\n* ***The Transformer model underlying our experiments is trained for 350k steps on the 2014 English-German NMT task, using the same settings as $Vaswani et al. (2017).$*** The model pro- cesses texts as a series of subtokens (text frag- ments the size of a token or smaller) and learns three multi-head attention matrices over these, two self-attention matrices (one over the subtokens of the source sentences and one over those of the target sentences), and a cross-attention matrix be- tween the source and target. \n\n* **The recent Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) demonstrated tantalizing representations for coreference: when trained for machine transla- tion, some self-attention layers appear to show stronger attention weights between coreferential elements.17** $Voita et al. (2018)$ found evidence for this claim for the English pronouns it, you, and I in a movie subtitles dataset $(Lison et al., 2018).$ GAP allows us to explore this claim on Wikipedia for ambiguous personal pronouns. To do so, we investigate the heuristic:\n\n![](https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-iPcRnix4isk\/WaiC02QrGbI\/AAAAAAAAB_Y\/KGP356uQ2uQ6ZtFm9kz9nsZ1oIgNsImGACEwYBhgL\/s640\/image1.png)\n\n\n## **Transformer by GOOGLE**\n\n#### **More you can read from here : http:\/\/jalammar.github.io\/illustrated-transformer\/**\n\n![](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-aZ3zvPiCoXM\/WaiKQO7KRnI\/AAAAAAAAB_8\/7a1CYjp40nUg4lKpW7covGZJQAySxlg8QCLcBGAs\/s640\/transform20fps.gif)\n\n* **The TRANSFORMER-SINGLE** baseline in Table 6 is the one set by L3H7 in Table 8.  Despite not having access to syntactic structure, TRANSFORMER-SINGLE far outperforms all surface cues above. That is, we find evidence for the claim that **Transformer models implicitly learn language understanding relevant to coreference resolution.** Even more promising, we find that the instances of coreference that **TRANSFORMER- SINGLE can handle is substantially different from those of PARALLELISM,** see Table 9.\n\n![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kagglesdsdata\/datasets\/106140\/287877\/table9.JPG?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1550301118&Signature=Qkdo6eVhBHXJYyjLkzbMZKjd29mO2fCWhQUzNZ5yE3%2BhwzFAyBz5DEuinE9TeYymUB5%2B4flzzBvhp3peKzd7RmqqbvyAH7F8Om0x2Ib76z1VmKTQIGi56pVmxfKuk%2FTCEL4Nyl1bFuA6V6Jskn%2FW1ASDUtSOml99ucFNLaXQkp5toDU3CXgtixwWR7SllJY6WqdCOtw28q2GZ55Qgjj6UKNopzu%2FadPgV1BcH0qWWaJczVj6Qpb2zYw0tgRGo%2FPjWni1iKnFLaK2AL%2BFC9WCmgT1UrKB6WPAX7ubtq99Gk0hFsUKDScoaQhMv9inBp%2BreP8BHLVQNZPddKXno4rxmQ%3D%3D)\n\n* **TRANSFORMER-MULTI** We learn to compose ***the signals from different self-attention heads using extra tree classifiers $(Geurts et al., 2006).$ We choose this classifier since we have little available training data and a small feature set.
