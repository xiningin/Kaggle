This instance will be used for training and then to save the final trained model for future inference. \n \n#### Loss Function and Optimizer\n - `Optimizer` is defined in the next cell.\n - We do not define any `Loss function` since the specified model already outputs `Loss` for a given input. \n - `Optimizer` is used to update the weights of the neural network to improve its performance.\n \n#### Further Reading\n- You can refer to my [Pytorch Tutorials](https:\/\/github.com\/abhimishra91\/pytorch-tutorials) to get an intuition of Loss Function and Optimizer.\n- [Pytorch Documentation for Loss Function](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html#loss-functions)\n- [Pytorch Documentation for Optimizer](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/optim.html)\n- Refer to the links provided on the top of the notebook to read more about `BertForTokenClassification`.

For further reading into Dataset and Dataloader read the [docs at PyTorch](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html)\n\n#### *CustomDataset* Dataset Class\n- This class is defined to accept the `tokenizer`, `sentences` and `labels` as input and generate tokenized output and tags that is used by the BERT model for training. \n- We are using the BERT tokenizer to tokenize the data in the `sentences` list for encoding. \n- The tokenizer uses the `encode_plus` method to perform tokenization and generate the necessary outputs, namely: `ids`, `attention_mask`\n- To read further into the tokenizer, [refer to this document](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/transformers\/model_doc\/bert.html#berttokenizer)\n- `tags` is the encoded entity from the annonated dataset. \n- The *CustomDataset* class is used to create 2 datasets, for training and for validation.\n- *Training Dataset* is used to fine tune the model: **70% of the original data**\n- *Validation Dataset* is used to evaluate the performance of the model. The model has not seen this data during training. \n\n#### Dataloader\n- Dataloader is used to for creating training and validation dataloader that load data to the neural network in a defined manner. This is needed because all the data from the dataset cannot be loaded to the memory at once, hence the amount of dataloaded to the memory and then passed to the neural network needs to be controlled.\n- This control is achieved using the parameters such as `batch_size` and `max_len`.\n- Training and Validation dataloaders are used in the training and validation part of the flow respectively","787590bc":"### Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial we will be fine tuning a transformer model for the **Named Entity Recognition** problem. \nThis is one of the most common business problems where a given piece of text\/sentence\/document different entites need to be identified such as: Name, Location, Number, Entity etc.\n\n#### Flow of the notebook\n\nThe notebook will be divided into seperate sections to provide a organized walk through for the process used.

Please ensure that these elements are present in your setup to successfully implement this script.\n\n - Data:\n\t- We are working from a dataset available on [Kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/)\n    - This NER annotated dataset is available at the following [link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abhinavwalia95\/entity-annotated-corpus)\n    - We will be working with the file `ner.csv` from the dataset. \n    - In the given file we will be looking at the following columns for the purpose of this fine tuning:\n        - `sentence_idx` : This is the identifier that the word in the row is part of the same sentence\n        - `word` : Word in the sentence\n        - `tag` : This is the identifier that is used to identify the entity in the dataset. \n    - The various entites tagged in this dataset are as per below:\n        - geo = Geographical Entity\n        - org = Organization\n        - per = Person\n        - gpe = Geopolitical Entity\n        - tim = Time indicator\n        - art = Artifact\n        - eve = Event\n        - nat = Natural Phenomenon\n\n\n - Language Model Used:\n\t - We are using BERT for this project. Hugging face team has created a customized model for token classification, called **BertForTokenClassification**. We will be using it in our custommodel class for training. \n\t - [Blog-Post](https:\/\/ai.googleblog.com\/2018\/11\/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html)\n     - [Documentation for python](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/transformers\/model_doc\/bert.html#bertfortokenclassification)\n\n\n - Hardware Requirements:\n\t - Python 3.6 and above\n\t - Pytorch, Transformers and All the stock Python ML Libraries\n\t - TPU enabled setup. This can also be executed over GPU but the code base will need some changes. \n\n\n - Script Objective:\n\t - The objective of this script is to fine tune **BertForTokenClassification**` to be able to identify the entites as per the given test dataset. The entities labled in the given dataset are as follows:","0086377c":"<a id='section01'><\/a>\n### Importing Python Libraries and preparing the environment\n\nAt this step we will be importing the libraries and modules needed to run our script.
