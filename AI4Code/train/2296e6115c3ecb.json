H, C, N, O, P and S are key components of biological molecules and natural products. Na, Mg, K, Ca, and Zn are cations that cannot perform redox chemistry but are key structural components of various biological macromolecules and are involved in signaling processes. The remaining transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) can perform redox chemistry and thus are often involved in the active sites of important redox enzymes and electron transfer proteins.\n\nAmong other elements mentioned in a handful of titles, some are potent poisons (Cd, Hg, Pb). Mo is found in the xanthine oxidase family of enzymes and in molybdenum nitrogenase. Cobalt is the found in cobalamin (vitimin B12). Cisplatin and related Pt-containing compounds are important anticancer drugs.","12616d30":"Create lists\/dicts for journals, amino acids and amino acid images. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are commonly referred to by their anionic forms, aspartate and glutamate respectively. Except in specific cases generally involving electron transfer, radical forms of amino acids (e.g. tyrosyl) are uncommon. Cationic forms (e.g. glycinium) are rarely (if ever?) used in the literature.","8f4ff473":"# Inorganic Chemistry\nAs might be expected, the 'elements of life' are a much smaller focus in inorganic chemistry. Heavier p-block elements see some represenatation, but the majority of the field involves transition metal research. Within the block, early metals are generally less popular owing to their more limited reactivity. The late second and third row metals serve as flexible and reliable catalysts for a diverse array of reactions both in the lab and in industry. Unfortunately, these noble metals are substantially less abundant and more expensive than first row metals. A huge driving force in modern inorganic chemistry is learning to use these base metals as catalysts for reactions historically mediated by their more expensive counterparts.\n\nDespite occupying 28 slots on the table, research involving f-block metals is fairly scarce. Lanthanide chemistry was generally unremarkable until the relatively recent interest in their unique magnetic and photophysical properties. The actinides are radioactive, and tranuranic actinides are extremely scarce or entirely synthetic. Among them, only thorium and uranium are amenable to study. Working with the others requires working with extremely small quantities of material in specialized environments to protect from the radioactivity.","6d417743":"# Organometallics\nAs something of a subfield of inorganic chemistry, organometallics also has has a strong focus on transition metal chemistry. However, there is a much stronger emphasis on second- and third-row metals. This is largely due to their incredible value as catalysts for diverse organic transformations, an area that is more in line with organometallics than pure inorganic chemistry. Furthermore, these metals often form much more stable organometallic entities than their first row congeners.","7a939987":"# Overall\nLooking at the sum of all journals included in the search, the upper half of the periodic table generally sees much more study than the bottom half. Without looking at specific elements too closely, this makes a lot of sense--lighter elements are substantially more abundant and are much, much more likely to be a componnent of biological systems. Additionally, theres a stong focus on metals, likely due to the strong synthetis and catalysis\/methodology focus of most of the journals represented (Inorganic Chemistry, Organometallics, Journal of Organic Chemistry). Carbon and hydrogen, however, are the overall winners due to their importance across the board in biochemistry, inorganic synthesis, catalysis and clean energy.","88f19b80":"# Prevalence of Elements and Amino Acids in Various Fields of Chemistry\n\nDifferent fields of chemistry innately have different goals and thus use different chemicals and elements during their reasearch. \n\nBefore starting, it is important to note that by only searching for element names, the information will have substantial limitations. For example, Fe, ferric, ferrous and ferryl are all iron, but none of these will be captured by the search. Similarly, carbon monoxide contains one carbon and one oxygen atom, but only the carbon atom will be counted. Organic chemistry focuses primarily on transformations involving hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, but these reactions and funtional groups have specific names that don't contain the elements themselves (i.e. amines, aldehydes, esters, alcohols). On the other side, when a metal complex or catalyst is a key component of the paper, it is very often used in the title (i.e. An Iron Complex with ...; A Copper-Catalyzed ...). Because of this (and because my background is inorganic), most of the commentary will be focused on transition metal chemistry.","f81aa5fe":"# JACS\nAs a general-purpose journal that encompasses all fields of chemistry, the distribution here should be somewhat similar to the overall distribution.","f8f2dfb5":"# Chemical Reviews\nChemical Reviews is generally similar to the overall distribution and to JACS.","396ce7fc":"Generate and populate dataframes for analysis. Article titles are searched for element or amino acid names using a simple regex. It case-insensitively matches the item, ensuring that it is not adjacent to any additional letters. The word can, however, be adjacent to numbers or punctuation. Without these restrictions, certain elements (e.g. tin) that are common substrings of other words are overcounted.","924704c8":"# The Journal of Organic Chemistry\n\nPerhaps suprisingly, metals are fairly well represented in organic chemistry as well. Metal-catalyzed reactions are a crucial component of synthetic organic chemistry, and late metals (especially palladium, copper, rhodium and nickel) are particularly adept for this purpose. However, using only the names of elements for this survey is paticularly problematic for in organic chemistry because important developments and transformations are often tied to functional groups, rather than elements.","ab518802":"# Amino Acids\nI don't have a very strong background in biochemistry and thus not much insight here. Tyrosine has a fascinating role in protein electron transfer chains. Cysteine is a common ligand in metalloenzymes (especially iron-sulfur clusters!) and as the only thiol, is often used in inorganic model chemistry. Tryptophan is a precursor to a number of other important biological compounds. Glycine is the simplest amino acid, and thus finds use in synthetic chemistry when a (nonspecific) amino acid is desired."}}
