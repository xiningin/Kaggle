Chess games of this period emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.\n\nPeople did not care about their pieces, pawn, sometimes even sacrificing their Queens, just to attack the enemy King, Long-term strategic planning, that was for the coward's, the goal of the game for everyone was to checkmate the other enemy.\n\nKey Players - Alexander McDonnell, Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais, Howard Staunton, Adolf Anderssen, Daniel Harrwitz, Henry Bird, Louis Paulses.\nAnd the most important Paul Morpy, who was the best player at his time.\n\nYou might have not heard of them but you might still come across their name's via Opening's like Bird's Defence, Staunton Gambit etc.\n\n## Classical Era\n\n![](https:\/\/images.indianexpress.com\/2018\/05\/viswanathan-anand-fb1.jpg)\n\nMorphy\u2019s eventual successor, Wilhelm Steinitz, reigned as world champion until 1894. Steinitz managed to retain his superiority for so long because he developed new principles of the middlegame, particularly in closed or semiclosed positions, that only his successor, Emanuel Lasker, and Lasker\u2019s contemporaries fully appreciated. <br>\n___Steinitz said his \u201cmodern school\u201d was guided by two premises:___\n1. that the natural outcome of a game is a draw because of the inherent balance between the forces of White and Black \n2. that checkmate is the ultimate but not the first objective of the game.\n\nThe games had begun to move to the Hyper Mordern Era, and Steinitz was the one who started it, People had started realizing that the way to justify a decisive attack in the post-Morphy era was to accumulate small, often subtle, advantages \u2014 for example, having two bishops when one\u2019s opponent has two knights, having an entrenched knight at a fortified outpost, or having greater maneuvering space.\n\nPeople had started to develop Positional Play, they had started to try to accumulate slow advantages, than going straight for the king with badly coordinated pieces\n\n* This is as far as we go, since after 1915, Hypermordern Era starts, but the games we have access to is only till 1914*","a4ed234b":"Let me explain some of the most occuring text's :-\n* Pawn, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, King - all of these are the pieces in the game\n* Position - describes how pieces are placed on the chessboard\n* Centre - the 4 square exactly in the middle of the board, modern day games mostly revolve around controlling these squares with and pawns and pieces, as controling them gives positional advantages\n* Development - Moving pieces, Castling, or connecting rooks\n* Files - columns that go up and down the chessboard, idealy you want to have your rooks on a open file\n* Diagonal - diagonals of the chessboard, idealy you want to have your bishops in the longest diagonals\n* Passed pawn - pawns that don't have any enemy pawns in their path to Queening\n* Exchange - Trading a piece for an enemy's piece\n\n**One really cool thing I like about this word cloud is that they don't have Blunder's in them, given that these were played by top player's at that time, it is obvious that they won't be making alot of Blunder's(Game losing moves), but we beginner's, intermediate and even Advanced players have a lot of blunders happen in our games.**","a7ca9a21":"# No. of moves","bb81b536":"# Opening\nFor all you Queen's Gambit Fan's, you might have heard of some of these in the show<br>\nNote though, Positional Game is still developing in the Classical Era, Ruy Lopez, French Defence, Giuoco Piano, Caro-Kann Defence, are all reached after 1.e4, so don't let this graph make you think that Queen's gambit is significantly played in this Era.","d01c0be4":"# Exploratory Data Analysis\nAbout the data, The dataset does not contain Game-36.txt, as it was not available in the book text file, so keep that in mind.\nAlso, Game-17's Place column is empty.<br>\n\nI have been playing chess for 3 years now, (rated 1700, if anyone of you is also chess enthusiast, I would love to collaborate in a project related to chess with you)","9f77519e":"# First Move\nMost of the games first move was 1e4, this move led to open positions with many posibilites for tactics and attacks, A romantic Era classic, but as we can see 1d4, the move that leads to closed, positional games, shows that slowly people are moving towards, Hypermordern Era.","d635274b":"# History of Chess\n\nThe Games that were reviewed in the book were played in the duration of [1889-1914],  This Book was published in 1915, so this makes sense.\nThe game of chess has been divided into eras :-<br>\n|---- Romantic Era<br>\n|---- Classical Era<br>\n|---- HyperModernism Era<br>\n|---- Dynamism Era<br>"}}
