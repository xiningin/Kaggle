All cities did almost equal in sales (Naypyitaw had least if strictly seen). However, the net income (here gross income) is exceptionally high in Naypyitaw. Let us investigate this further.","5d48c01a":"Initial Preprocessing : \n1. We can set the invoice id as index, as it is unique for every customer\n2. We should drop the Tax 5% columns as this variable cannot be controlled by customer, neither by business owner and hence will provide no insight\n3. Gross margin percentage column can also be dropped since it is same irresepctive of any factor","067732b2":"Findings : \n\n* Members spend more on each visit \n* Both members and non-members buy approximately the same number of goods in a visit\n* Members clearly shop for more, maybe they give in to the urge of using their membership\n* Female shoppers are more iclined towards memberships\n\nRecommendations : \n\n* Initiate extensive membership programs, especially for women","31aa6e7c":"Now let us look at the product categories and find out which type of product should be stocked well in the new store in Naypyitaw","d557d7d0":"Let us look at number of sales in all the cities and product types we might be interested in","da3dcf69":"Here, there is no ambiguity. Food and Beverages, Fashion accesories, Electronic accesories are higly popular choices and also generate highest profits and hence they should be in the inventory well and also be included in marketing campaigns and advertisements.\n\nSince Electronic accesories customers have rated the service lowest amongst others, the company needs to improve customer service in this domain in the new store. ","027073b2":"All cities have done almost equal in sales. \nHowever, in prodcut category, Fashion accesories, Food and Beverages, Electronic accesories stand out from the rest.\nNow we shall investigate the revenue brought in by each category and city.","e9d506ff":"**PROBLEM STATEMENT**\n\nWe will assume that the supermarket company is deciding to expand in any one of the cities of - Yangon, Naypyitaw or Mandalay. Using the sales data from already available stores of the company, we have to make a recommendation on which city shall they choose. Also, we will try to identify the liked product category and the target audience (gender, membership options, payment modes etc).\n\n**OBJECTIVES**\n\nUsing the dataset to find out shopping behaviour of customers in the supermarket. \n1. We will do all required analysis to find out where (city and branch) is doing well and where it is not successful \n2. Find out most liked product categories and analyse the revenue they generate\n3. Also try to gain insights on how customer behaviour varies depending on gender, membership status (Member \/ Normal)","ff1f38f4":"FINAL COMPLETE BUSINESS RECOMMENDATION : \n\n* The city chosen for expansion should be Naypyitaw\n* Open the store in Naypyitaw with a full-backed inventory of goods in product categories - Food and Beverages, Fashion Assesories and Electronics\n* The company should improve service in Electronics domain\n* The prime target for marketing should be women\n* Persausive ads for offering memberships, more to women\n* Increase service in cash payment modes ","accef3a6":"This makes the picture clearer. Number of customers in Naypyitaw are the least but they tend to spend more on each purchase (Higher unit price) and also buy more number of goods in each purchase (6 as compared to 5 in other two cities).\n\n**This makes Naypyitaw the clear choice for opening up another store**","bc346c59":"We can also drop Branch columns as each city has only one branch : \n* Yangon - A\n* Mandalay - B\n* Naypyitaw - C"}}
