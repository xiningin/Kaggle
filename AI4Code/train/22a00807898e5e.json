Fit each model to train_X and train_Y, then score with test_X and test_Y.\n4.

Pclass should not be ordinal as 3rd class doesn't have mean that this characteristic is worth three of a first-class characteristic-it should just be an identifier.\n\n1. Let's make an array of train_df and test_df as we will need these changes on both in order for our model testing as well as submitted prediction to take them into account. \n2.

To fix this, we are first going to viusalize the distribution of who survived based on age and then split age up into bands so that we can see the survival probability distribution of certain age brackets.\n\n**Observations**\n\nIt is clear that the Age plays a significant part in who survives as seen in that over half of those from infant age until 16 survived, while less than 10% of those over 64 survived."}}
