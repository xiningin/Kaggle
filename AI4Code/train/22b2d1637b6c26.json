In playoffs teams adapt eachother in each round. *You beat your opponent, good for you, now get ready to next team, mindset.* I mean, match-ups played out according to the opponent, everything changes, things like shot selection, playing type, playing pace etc.\n* Finally, data does not have *per game* data so I will create that using other columns.
