This means that the store caters to majorly low-income group customers and doesn't entertain rich\/luxury customers.\n\nSo, we will remove this outliers otherwise it will pose a problem in further analysis.

Firstly, we did some data preprocessing: haddled missing values, detected and removed outliers.\n\nSecond step was Exploratory Data Analysis to undestand relationships between our data.\n\nDuring the final step, we covered an essenatial part of our research - we applied hypothesis testing to answer the following **3 business problems**:\n\n**1. Is the average salary of PhD owners statistically different from Master owners?**\n\nWe assumed **Null hypothesis(H_0)**: The mean ranks of the two groups are equal\n\n**Alternative hypothesis(H_a)**: The mean ranks of the two groups are not equal\n\nWe used Mann-Whitney's test, and got p-value < significance level, so we can conclude that the average income of PhD owners is different from the average income of Master owners at a 95% confidence level\n\n\n**2. Is the correlation between the annual income and the amount of spending statistically significant?**\n\nUsing Spearman correlation test we received the following result: correlation coefficient : 0.8466, pval: 0.0000 \n\nThere is a strong positive collection, thats why we reject out null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis - **there is statistically significant correlation between the income and the spending amount**.\n\n\n\n**3. Is there correlation between the diploma owned and the marital status?**\n\n**Null hypothesis(H_o)**: Education and Marital_Situation are independant\n\n**Alternative_hypothesis(H_a)**: Education and Marital_Situation are not independent\n\nUsing the chi-square test, we can see that the P-value is superior than the significance level of 5%, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nThe Test-statistic is inferior than the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nThats why we conclude that the marital status is independent from the diploma owned at a 95% confidence level","057e2bb5":"Outliers analysis must be done with care. From above we can see that several variables seem to have outliers :\n\n>Age: 3 customers older than the Upper Fence set at 74 years old. We will not remove them\n\n>Income : Several value are greater than the Upper Fence of 113K. While having an income of 150k is not impossible, we will remove the customer who has an income of 666k (Moreover, this observation is defined as an extreme outlier based on our definition stated previously)\n\n>Spending : There is only one outlier which is at the limit of the Upper Fence.
