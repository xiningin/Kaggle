I start with an EDA analysing each properties' distribution, followed by the pair interactions and then the correlations with our target: the tumor diagnosis.\n\nAfter the EDA I set up 10 out-of-the-box models for a first evaluation and use cross-validation to measure them. I use Recall instead of Accuracy or F1-Score since I want to detect all malignant tumors. After the first results I analyse features importances, do a single round of feature selection and evaluate the models again. By the end of the chapter I analyse model errors and from the 10 first models I choose 5 for model tuning: Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and KNN.\n\nI then proceed to tune the five models using GridSearchCV and prepare the data for model stacking by predicting probabilities for both train and test sets. Using Logistic Regression as a second-level model, I tune its parameters and finish the construction phase.\n\nFinally, I test all first level models and the stacked Logistic Regression on our untouched test-set. For the first level models, using regular 0.5 threshold Logistic Regression performed best with 95,8% Recall. By lowering the threshold SVC and Logistic Regression tied with over 98% recall with SVC having a higher Accuracy. By using the model-stacking technique, Logistic Regression was able to obtain 100% Recall on the test set. On the last chapter I summarize the findings and conclusions.\n\nOn Annex - A I repeat a few Machine Learning steps using SMOTE to generate new data points making the data balanced. \n\nOn Annex - B I use three different dimensionality reduction techniques to see if I can reduce the dataset and still get a good test score.","d554d558":"### First Models' Results","2ce6b79e":"# <font color='darkgreen'> Annex - B: Dimensionality Reduction Techniques <\/font>\nOn this annex we will try out three different methods for dimensionality reduction:\n- Principal Component Analysis\n- Autoencoder\n- Linear Discriminant Analysis\n\nWe will be using a Logistic Regression to evaluate each method.
