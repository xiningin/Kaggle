Load and Clean Data","f2e3b242":"As you can see there is a 'pound-for-pound' weight-class.  To quote Wikipedia: \n\nPound for pound is a ranking used in combat sports, such as boxing wrestling, or mixed martial arts, of who the better fighters are relative to their weight (i.e., adjusted to compensate for weight class). As these fighters do not compete directly, judging the best fighter pound for pound is subjective, and ratings vary. They may be based on a range of criteria including \"quality of opposition\", factors such as how exciting the fighter is or how famous they are, or be an attempt to determine who would win if all those ranked were the same size.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pound_for_pound","0f2dba93":"Let's take a quick look at this data","5c840bde":"We should probably covert the date column and clean any nulls if they exist","89224858":"# 2.
