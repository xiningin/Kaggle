and `Fare` features are binned. Binning helped dealing with outliers and it revealed some homogeneous groups in those features. `Family_Size` is created by adding `Parch` and `SibSp` features and **1**. `Ticket_Frequency` is created by counting the occurence of `Ticket` values.\n\n`Name` feature is very useful. First, `Title` and `Is_Married` features are created from the title prefix in the names. Second, `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Family_Survival_Rate_NA`  features are created by target encoding the surname of the passengers. `Ticket_Survival_Rate` is created by target encoding the `Ticket` feature. `Survival_Rate` feature is created by averaging the `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Ticket_Survival_Rate` features.\n\nFinally, the non-numeric type features are label encoded and categorical features are one-hot encoded.

This is a beginner level kernel which focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Feature Engineering**. A lot of people start Kaggle with this competition and they get lost in extremely long tutorial kernels. This is a short kernel compared to the other ones. I hope this will be a good guide for starters and inspire them with new feature engineering ideas.\n\n**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is a great competition to apply domain knowledge for feature engineering, so I made a research and learned a lot about Titanic. There are many secrets to be revealed beneath the Titanic dataset. I tried to find out some of those secret factors that had affected the survival of passengers when the Titanic was sinking. I believe there are other features still waiting to be discovered. \n\nThis kernel has **3** main sections; **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Feature Engineering** and **Model**, and it can achieve top **2%** (**0.83732**) public leaderboard score with a tuned Random Forest Classifier.

This observation could be related to `Pclass` feature\n* `Parch` and `SibSp` features show that passengers with only one family member has a higher survival rate","9fde6786":"### **1.2 Missing Values**\nAs seen from below, some columns have missing values. `display_missing` function shows the count of missing values in every column in both training and test set.\n* Training set have missing values in `Age`, `Cabin` and `Embarked` columns\n* Test set have missing values in `Age`, `Cabin` and `Fare` columns\n\nIt is convenient to work on concatenated training and test set while dealing with missing values, otherwise filled data may overfit to training or test set samples. The count of missing values in `Age`, `Embarked` and `Fare` are smaller compared to total sample, but roughly **80%** of the `Cabin` is missing. Missing values in `Age`, `Embarked` and `Fare` can be filled with descriptive statistical measures but that wouldn't work for `Cabin`.","12fc739e":"#### **2.5.1 Label Encoding Non-Numerical Features**\n`Embarked`, `Sex`, `Deck` , `Title` and `Family_Size_Grouped` are object type, and `Age` and `Fare` features are category type. They are converted to numerical type with `LabelEncoder`. `LabelEncoder` basically labels the classes from **0** to **n**. This process is necessary for models to learn from those features.","5b609ca5":"### **2.3 Title & Is Married**\n`Title` is created by extracting the prefix before `Name` feature. According to graph below, there are many titles that are occuring very few times. Some of those titles doesn't seem correct and they need to be replaced. **Miss**, **Mrs**, **Ms**, **Mlle**, **Lady**, **Mme**, **the Countess**, **Dona** titles are replaced with **Miss\/Mrs\/Ms** because all of them are female. Values like **Mlle**, **Mme** and **Dona** are actually the name of the passengers, but they are classified as titles because `Name` feature is split by comma. **Dr**, **Col**, **Major**, **Jonkheer**, **Capt**, **Sir**, **Don** and **Rev** titles are replaced with **Dr\/Military\/Noble\/Clergy** because those passengers have similar characteristics. **Master** is a unique title. It is given to male passengers below age **26**. They have the highest survival rate among all males.\n\n`Is_Married` is a binary feature based on the **Mrs** title. **Mrs** title has the highest survival rate among other female titles. This title needs to be a feature because all female titles are grouped with each other.","57d25d8f":"### **3.2 Feature Importance**","8922f07d":"After filling the missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, `Fare` and `Deck` features, there is no missing value left in both training and test set. `Cabin` is dropped because `Deck` feature is used instead of it.","983187f7":"### **2.2 Frequency Encoding**\n`Family_Size` is created by adding `SibSp`, `Parch` and **1**. `SibSp` is the count of siblings and spouse, and `Parch` is the count of parents and children. Those columns are added in order to find the total size of families. Adding **1** at the end, is the current passenger. Graphs have clearly shown that family size is a predictor of survival because different values have different survival rates.\n* Family Size with **1** are labeled as **Alone**\n* Family Size with **2**, **3** and **4** are labeled as **Small**\n* Family Size with **5** and **6** are labeled as **Medium**\n* Family Size with **7**, **8** and **11** are labeled as **Large**","1e416d79":"### **1.6 Conclusion**\nMost of the features are correlated with each other. This relationship can be used to create new features with feature transformation and feature interaction. Target encoding could be very useful as well because of the high correlations with `Survived` feature.\n\nSplit points and spikes are visible in continuous features. They can be captured easily with a decision tree model, but linear models may not be able to spot them.\n\nCategorical features have very distinct distributions with different survival rates. Those features can be one-hot encoded. Some of those features may be combined with each other to make new features.\n\nCreated a new feature called `Deck` and dropped `Cabin` feature at the **Exploratory Data Analysis** part.","5419658d":"#### **1.5.1 Continuous Features**\nBoth of the continuous features (`Age` and `Fare`) have good split points and spikes for a decision tree to learn. One potential problem for both features is, the distribution has more spikes and bumps in training set, but it is smoother in test set. Model may not be able to generalize to test set because of this reason.\n\n* Distribution of `Age` feature clearly shows that children younger than 15 has a higher survival rate than any of the other age groups\n* In distribution of `Fare` feature, the survival rate is higher on distribution tails. The distribution also has positive skew because of the extremely large outliers","868d1c69":"#### **2.1.1 Fare**\n`Fare` feature is positively skewed and survival rate is extremely high on the right end. **13** quantile based bins are used for `Fare` feature. Even though the bins are too much, they provide decent amount of information gain. The groups at the left side of the graph has the lowest survival rate and the groups at the right side of the graph has the highest survival rate. This high survival rate was not visible in the distribution graph. There is also an unusual group **(15.742, 23.25]** in the middle with high survival rate that is captured in this process.","52a2bb43":"* Training set has **891** rows and test set has **418** rows\n* Training set have **12** features and test set have **11** features\n* One extra feature in training set is `Survived` feature, which is the target variable","00ffc71a":"### **1.4 Correlations**\nFeatures are highly correlated with each other and dependent to each other. The highest correlation between features is **0.549500** in training set and **0.577147** in test set (between `Fare` and `Pclass`). The other features are also highly correlated. There are **9** correlations in training set and **6** correlations in test set that are higher than **0.1**.","87aa9e99":"As I suspected, every deck has different survival rates and that information can't be discarded. Deck **B**, **C**, **D** and **E** have the highest survival rates. Those decks are mostly occupied by 1st class passengers. **M** has the lowest survival rate which is mostly occupied by 2nd and 3rd class passengers. To conclude, cabins used by 1st class passengers have higher survival rates than cabins used by 2nd and 3rd class passengers. In my opinion **M** (Missing `Cabin` values) has the lowest survival rate because they couldn't retrieve the cabin data of the victims. That's why I believe labeling that group as **M** is a reasonable way to handle the missing data. It is a unique group with shared characteristics. `Deck` feature has high-cardinality right now so some of the values are grouped with each other based on their similarities.\n* **A**, **B** and **C** decks are labeled as **ABC** because all of them have only 1st class passengers\n* **D** and **E** decks are labeled as **DE** because both of them have similar passenger class distribution and same survival rate\n* **F** and **G** decks are labeled as **FG** because of the same reason above\n* **M** deck doesn't need to be grouped with other decks because it is very different from others and has the lowest survival rate.","a0d11fc7":"#### **1.2.2 Embarked**\n`Embarked` is a categorical feature and there are only **2** missing values in whole data set. Both of those passengers are female, upper class and they have the same ticket number. This means that they know each other and embarked from the same port together. The mode `Embarked` value for an upper class female passenger is **C (Cherbourg)**, but this doesn't necessarily mean that they embarked from that port.","461315b9":"There are too many unique `Ticket` values to analyze, so grouping them up by their frequencies makes things easier.\n\n**How is this feature different than `Family_Size`?** Many passengers travelled along with groups. Those groups consist of friends, nannies, maids and etc. They weren't counted as family, but they used the same ticket.\n\n**Why not grouping tickets by their prefixes?** If prefixes in `Ticket` feature has any meaning, then they are already captured in `Pclass` or `Embarked` features because that could be the only logical information which can be derived from the `Ticket` feature.\n\nAccording to the graph below, groups with **2**,**3** and **4** members had a higher survival rate. Passengers who travel alone has the lowest survival rate. After **4** group members, survival rate decreases drastically. This pattern is very similar to `Family_Size` feature but there are minor differences. `Ticket_Frequency` values are not grouped like `Family_Size` because that would basically create the same feature with perfect correlation. This kind of feature wouldn't provide any additional information gain.","bd3d94c1":"### **2.1 Binning Continuous Features**","013de172":"In order to be more accurate, `Sex` feature is used as the second level of `groupby` while filling the missing `Age` values. As seen from below, `Pclass` and `Sex` groups have distinct median `Age` values. When passenger class increases, the median age for both males and females also increases. However, females tend to have slightly lower median `Age` than males. The median ages below are used for filling the missing values in `Age` feature.","c1763aed":"`StratifiedKFold` is used for stratifying the target variable. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class in target variable (`Survived`).","e1d73a08":"### **1.3 Target Distribution**\n* **38.38%** (342\/891) of training set is **Class 1**\n* **61.62%** (549\/891) of training set is **Class 0**","c76b0738":"## **3. Model**","2c305a94":"#### **1.2.3 Fare**\nThere is only one passenger with missing `Fare` value. We can assume that `Fare` is related to family size (`Parch` and `SibSp`) and `Pclass` features. Median `Fare` value of a male with a third class ticket and no family is a logical choice to fill the missing value.","2d1fd844":"### **1.5 Target Distribution in Features**","215e076f":"When I googled **Stone, Mrs. George Nelson (Martha Evelyn)**, I found that she embarked from **S (Southampton)** with her maid **Amelie Icard**, in this page [Martha Evelyn Stone: Titanic Survivor](https:\/\/www.encyclopedia-titanica.org\/titanic-survivor\/martha-evelyn-stone.html).\n\n> *Mrs Stone boarded the Titanic in Southampton on 10 April 1912 and was travelling in first class with her maid Amelie Icard.
