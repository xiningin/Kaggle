Physically, this is the change in pressure per change in flow (air volume per time). Intuitively, one can imagine blowing up a balloon through a straw. We can change R by changing the diameter of the straw, with higher R being harder to blow.\n\n* `C` - lung attribute indicating how compliant the lung is (in mL\/cmH2O). Physically, this is the change in volume per change in pressure. Intuitively, one can imagine the same balloon example. We can change C by changing the thickness of the balloon\u2019s latex, with higher C having thinner latex and easier to blow.\n\n* `time_step` - the actual time stamp.\n\n* `u_in` - the control input for the inspiratory solenoid valve. Ranges from 0 to 100.\n\n* `u_out` - the control input for the exploratory solenoid valve. Either 0 or 1.\n\n* `pressure` - the airway pressure measured in the respiratory circuit, measured in cmH2O.\n\n","4a8c133b":"Work in progress.\n\nNext steps:\n\n* Apply lightgbm\n* Apply H20\n\nEarlier dealt with similar in one of TBS. Will explore in more detail over the weekend."}}
