Which one? Even though the magnitude of the nWBV correlation is 0.11 higher than the Age one, I will go for the latter in order to keep the model more practical. After all, it is far easier to find out a person's age than to conduct a brain scan. The model could therefore be used  digitally before any hospital visit to find out the need to for such a visit. However, lets see the effect on the model's accuracy of removing each one separately.\n","4a7c3962":"# Modeling","15d7f6d6":"### Method 2: Imputing by linear regression; ordering and splitting the target feature.\n\nWhile linear regression is good for the continuous features, it will not work well for the target feature (*demented*), as it is binary. It will have to be handled differently.","8389a126":"Dodgy distributions! (Except for the comely nWBV Longitudinal distribution). Natural scale attributes (that is, related to size) are usually normally distributed (or, more accurately, lognormally), but none of these except for the green nWBV curve seem to be so. Since the curves of the Cross-sectional and Longitudinal are almost equivalent for eTIV, their unruly shape must be caused by the measurement methodology. As for the ASF, it is no wonder that the distribution looks like that of eTIV, being derived from it.","0e27e115":"Encoding the M\/F column. In other words, mapping the M and F strings into 0 and 1 respectively so that it could be used by  ML models.","35292c4d":"A considerable amount of demented people got scores in the same range (26 - 30) as the non-demented ones in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal. As such, it is no wonder that the majority of the converted people too lie in this range. It seems that this test does not pick up dementia as well as the one used for the CDR.\n\nIn the cross-sectional, the majority of people with any dementia (ie. non-zero CDR) are males. On the other hand, in the longitudinal, there is no gender bias for existing dementia, though the majority of the people who were developed dementia after the first test were female.","e90b4528":"Alas, looking at the Recall scores (the averages between the 0 and 1 values), none of the handling methods could beat the most popular one, imputation by most frequent value. Note also that for some reason the scores of the two worst ones, the logistic regression and decision tree (methods 3 and 4) are equivalent.\n\nThe Recall of 0.9 for negatuves (that is, not being demented) is decently high. However, our primary aim, the maximization of Recall for positives, has not succeeded, its being only 0.74. Lets see whether it can be raised by bagging.","ccc76fc8":"As expected, none of of the imputed values are above 0.5.\n\nA different threshold is therefore needed to map the values into 0 and 1. I could of course simply use the point equidistant from the min and max of the values. However, there is no reason to assume that these values can be interpreted as probabilities. So I will instead not use a threshold at all, but rather assume that the expected value of the probability of dementia is the same in this NaN-subsample as in the non-NaN one. I will then find out the ratio *X* of demented people in the non-Nan subsample of the Cross-validated set (I am excluding the Longitudinal from this ratio because its *demented* column contains no missing data), order the imputed values ascending, and map the last *XN* values to 1, the rest to 0, where *N* is the amount of values.","b85d5990":"Alas, AdaBoostClassifier is no better than BaggingClassifier. I hypothesize the reason to be the dataset's smallness, so that no model can get a good grasp on the reality of the problem space in order to push down the bias to a decent level.\n\nIt is strange that for Method 1, the recall and precision of the negative results (i.e., 0) is 0. For some reason the model ascribes positive to all the people. It may well be that since Method 1 imputes only 0s (as the non-demented are more numerous in the data), the dataset becomes too unbalanced for AdaBoost to handle.

Could this be an indication of women's having more mentally stimulating lifestyles, or at least having had decades ago, when these old people were young? \n\nIn any case, the scarcity of males in the Converted group is probably caused by the tendency of the males' dementia to have already begun by the time the study was conducted.\n\n**Total**\n\nThere is no significant difference between the genders in the age of demented people: the condition tends to begin creeping into people's brains at the same age (about 55).","734c4466":"# Mission\n\nCreating a model whereby dementia can be predicted for any person, enabling early intervention.

In the Cross-sectional, this is visible as the shifting of the bulk of the distributions downwards from CDR = 0 to 0.5 and 1, and of course blatantly in the great swath of people near 0 years in the CDR = 2 group. However, looking at the Longitudinal and the Total, even though the demented distribution is slightly lower than the non-demented in its head, tail and median, the overlap between the two categories is nevertheless too significant to be able to assert that demented people tend to have shorter educations than non-demented.\n\nLooking at the total data, note the great median at around 12 years for demented females, which contrasts with the more even distribution of the demented males. (This is mostly from the equivalent peak in the Longitudinal's Demented group). It is difficult to conceive of a reason for this. One hypothesis is that women with barely any education tend to (or tended a few decades ago) to accept the jobs of housemaking and raising children more readily than more educated ones. However, it is not intuitively obvious that such activities would less mentally stimulating than doing an 'actual' job. In fact, the empathetic and linguistic capabilities trained during interactions with children seem to me more stimulating than many jobs.","26f0fef8":"Validating the model:","c09bde1e":"# Setup ","f1d95995":"The standard deviation of ages in the longitudinal is pretty small; an elderly population was intentionally chosen for that study. From experience of living in society we can say that the expected probability of having dementia is far greater for old people than for young and middle-aged ones, and hence the longitudinal study is very valuable for increasing the accuracy of the eventual model. However, it would advisable to have more data of the boundary region between youth and oldness (that is, the middle ages); there is an unseemly trough at the 30 - 50 range.","14c61358":"The most striking thing is that in the cross-sectional study, the people with the highest socioeconomic status are all males, while in the longitudinal they are all females. Otherwise the socioeconomic status does not seem to have a correlation with dementia.\n\nNote also the clear median of 2 for non-demented females, and the median of 3 for demented. It is surprising that people of higher socioeconomic status would have a higher probability of developing dementia, since they tend to have engage more in mentally stimulating activities (e.g., reading literature). ","adb228a8":"### Volumes","97ea30bc":"I will use logistic regression, the most natural model for binary classification. And I will wrap it in a bag, i.e., use BaggingClassifier with an ensemble of LogisticRegressions. Bagging is the splitting of the training data into folds, and training of a separate model for each. A prediction is then made by predicting with each of these models, and averaging their results. This is a great way to raise regularization: the averaging lessens the effect of outliers, as only one of the folds will include each outlier (if the folds are sampled without replacement, as I do below).\n\nNow, which scoring function is best in this case? Certainly not accuracy, even though this dataset is not unbalanced (as the 0\/1 ratio is about 40\/60). Accuracy should never be used in data science, [as it is an improper scoring rule](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/a\/312787\/49044) (in fact, it is not a scoring rule at all), discontinuous at the threshold. Of the X widely used evaluation metrics for binary classification ([here](https:\/\/neptune.ml\/blog\/evaluation-metrics-binary-classification) is a great summary) there are two candidates for this project:\n\n1. Logloss: the natural function for logistic regression.\n2. Recall (i.e., true positive rate): how many of the true positives are classified as positive. This is calculated by\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nwhere *tp* is the amount of true positives and *fn* is the amount of false negatives. In clinical contexts, the metrics of the confusion matrix, including recall, are of primary importance ([but have to be handled with care due to cognitive bias](https:\/\/www.fharrell.com\/post\/mlconfusion\/)) because of the high risk associated with erroneous decisions. This project's aim is to create a dementia detection model, to be integrated into any digital healthcare platform. Although dementia (or more specifically, its most common cause, Alzheimer's) is near the low end of the scale of disease severity, it is nevertheless critical to get potentially affected people into treatment as soon as possible, given the great decline in quality of life (for the person him\/herself as well as for family members). As such, it would be better to erroneously send someone on a clinical visit than to fail to notice a budding dementia. I therefore choose the Recall as the metric, rather than the elegant logloss.","e697472a":"Lets check out the values of the target feature.","3f0a851e":"# Dataset description\n\n\n> The [Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)](http:\/\/) is a project aimed at making MRI data sets of the brain freely available to the scientific community.
