This means that the data is not uniformly distributed and likely have too many outliers, my solution to this is converting this data into categorical data. Again, you can observe the positive correlation in the graph below","f851c1d9":"### Tags\nTags are just list of strings, we will create new columns using the important tags, and drop this column, then we calculate the weighted tags, which gives the most weight to most popular tag.\n\nAs you can see below, there is no visible correlation between weighted tags and units sold","85ddfd0d":"### Rating to sales ratio means anything?\nAs you can see in the plot below, there is a negative correlation between rating\/rating count to sales\n\n# Overfitting example\nI wanted to show an overfitting example and bad feature extracting practise.\nAs you can see below, we are assigning the units_sold\/rating and units_sold\/rating_count as new columns. This is a bad practise and doesn't mean that you developed a \"good\" model. This means you cheated.

The graph is nearly linear and has positive tangent. Which means positive correlation between merchant rating and units sold.","8e3edf7c":"As it can be observed above, number of the ratings is more important than positive ratings, Quantity > Quality in this case.\n\n\nNow we have replacements for \"rating\", \"rating count\", and all \"rating X count\" colums, therefore we no longer need them, we can drop it.","16c574e2":"### Currency\nDoes currency of the buyer have an effect on the total sales?
