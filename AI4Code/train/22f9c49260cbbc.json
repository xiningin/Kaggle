Usually, we use scatter plots to highlight the relationship between two continuous variables (like `\"bmi\"` and `\"charges\"`).  However, we can adapt the design of the scatter plot to feature a categorical variable (like `\"smoker\"`) on one of the main axes.  We'll refer to this plot type as a **categorical scatter plot**, and we build it with the `sns.swarmplot` command.","38ee9649":"As always, we check that the dataset loaded properly by printing the first five rows.","e19ad18d":"# Color-coded scatter plots\n\nWe can use scatter plots to display the relationships between (_not two, but..._) three variables!  One way of doing this is by color-coding the points.  \n\nFor instance, to understand how smoking affects the relationship between BMI and insurance costs, we can color-code the points by `'smoker'`, and plot the other two columns (`'bmi'`, `'charges'`) on the axes.","212fc3b1":"This scatter plot shows that while nonsmokers to tend to pay slightly more with increasing BMI, smokers pay MUCH more.\n\nTo further emphasize this fact, we can use the `sns.lmplot` command to add two regression lines, corresponding to smokers and nonsmokers.
