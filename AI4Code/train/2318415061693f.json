It should be mentioned that an individual\u2019s access to a farmers market depends on more factors, such as individual income and means of transportation. While a county may be above average in economic terms, multiple cities and towns are located in each county. Even individual cities have income inequality between neighborhoods. Also, this report did not access the size of the farmers markets and availability of specific dietary foods. Yet, it is reassuring, nevertheless, to find no substantial evidence on the county level that farmers markets are disproportionately distributed by per capita and median income. \n","12f56acf":"## Discussion<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"fifth-section\"><\/a>","207c76d7":"## References<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"seventh-section\"><\/a>\n\n[1] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2015 \u2013 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 8th Edition.

Local farmers markets have proliferated as a means to distribute fresh produce directly to consumers, skipping the costly distribution and packaging step. However, one criticism of farmers markets is that they are largely inaccessible to many Americans, due to location, especially to those of low income and socio-economic status. This project draws upon all the registered farmers markets in the United States in 2020 as well as economic statistics for each county to investigate the correlation of income and access to farmers markets. This preliminary study used multiple regression modeling to find a positive correlation of the density of farmers markets in a county to the per capita income. However, there was a negative correlation of the density of farmers markets to the county\u2019s median household\/family income. Overall, there was no clear trend that greater income in a given county affected the density of farmers markets. Furthermore, county segmentation by K-means found an optimal of 3 clusters of counties by the elbow method. Four counties (Maricopa County, AZ; Los Angeles County, CA; Harris County, TX; and Cook County, IL) were identified as great potential for new farmers markets due to low market density, high population and relatively high income.","2484d3c8":"## Introduction<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"first-section\"><\/a>","1dee3527":"## Conclusion<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sixth-section\"><\/a>","092616b0":"Let's normalize the dataset.

Excluding the uninhabited county-equivalents, the county or county-equivalent with the highest per capita income is New York County, New York (Manhattan) (\\\\$62,498), and the county or county-equivalent with the lowest per capita income is Manu'a District, American Samoa (\\\\$5,441). Puerto Rico is also much poorer in comparison to the 50 states.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau defines a family as two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption residing in the same housing unit. A household consists of all people who occupy a housing unit regardless of relationship. A household may consist of a person living alone or multiple unrelated individuals or families living together. Median family income is typically higher than median household income because of the composition of households. Family households tend to have more people, and more of those members are in their prime earning years; as contrasted with members who have lesser incomes because they are very young or elderly. Areas with a wide disparity between the two measures have an excess of nonfamily households: single persons or otherwise.\n    \nK-means partitioned the counties into 3 mutually exclusive groups. The counties in each cluster are similar to each other demographically and economically. Now I can create a profile for each group, considering the common characteristics of each cluster. The 3 clusters are:\n\n\u2022\tLess dense population counties (\\~73,900), with a median household income of \\\\$46,122 and Per Capita Income of \\\\$23,696. High density of farmers markets (8.4\/100k population). These are rural areas in the U.S., which while lower in economic status, are high in farmers markets.\n\n\u2022\tMedium dense population counties (\\~109,000), with a median household income of \\\\$60,734 and Per Capita Income of \\\\$31,568. Medium density of farmers markets (2\/100k population).\n\n\u2022\tHighly dense population counties (\\~579,000), with a median household income of \\\\$54,297 and Per Capita Income of \\\\$28,271. Low density of farmers markets (1.2\/100k population). \n\nThere are only 4 counties designated as (2) cluster: Maricopa County, Arizona; Los Angeles County, California; Harris County, Texas; and Cook County, Illinois. These would be the best places for new farmers markets to open because of the low density of existing markets but relatively high income and population!","cc1ea57d":"The data sources were uploaded to [Kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/) by [Madeleine Ferguson](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/madeleineferguson\/farmers-markets-in-the-united-states). [5] The farmers market data is maintained by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service. [6] The farmers market listings include market locations, directions, operating times, product offerings, accepted forms of payment, and more. The list of United States counties by per capita income is from the 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates; data for Puerto Rico is from the 2013-2017 American Community Survey 5-Year estimates, and data for the other U.S. territories is from the 2010 U.S. Census. [7-10] The data contains the name of the county (or equivalent), state or territory, per capita income, median household income, median family income, population, and number of households. An alternative method was considered to obtain farmers market information from the Foursquare API using a free developer user. The resulting searches are limited to 50 responses and the maximum radius of search is 100,000 meters. Foursquare API has advantages to tabulate all the venues near a particular position, but is cumbersome for acquiring clean data such as all farmers markets in the United States. Thus, farmers market data was taken from ams.usda.gov.","a9ffc06a":"## Methodology<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"third-section\"><\/a>","7f302fec":"> ## Table of contents:\n* [Introduction](#first-section)\n* [Data Sources](#second-section)\n* [Methodology](#third-section)\n* [Results](#fourth-section)\n* [Discussion](#fifth-section)\n* [Conclusion](#sixth-section)\n* [References](#seventh-section)","6196d576":"## Results<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"fourth-section\"><\/a>","889d1da8":"### Unsupervised Machine Learning: County Segmentation with K-Means ","949ab024":"**Background:** Over the past century, public health is the United States has achieved tremendous success in increasing the longevity and productivity of life. At the same time, due in part of the changes in lifestyle behaviors, the rates of non-communicable diseases, specifically, chronic diet related diseases have risen. Some of these most common diseases include cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and poor bone health. Alarmingly, roughly half of all American adults (117 million individuals) have one or more preventable chronic diseases more preventable chronic diseases. [1] The impact of chronic disease is also felt economically, as in 2008, the medical costs associated with obesity were estimated to be \\\\$147 billion a year. In 2017, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes was \\\\$327 billion in medical costs and loss of productivity. [2-4]\n\n**Problem:** Having access to healthy, safe, and affordable food choices is crucial for an individual to live a healthy lifestyle. Food access is influenced by diverse factors, including proximity to food retail outlets (e.g., distance to a grocery store\/supermarket\/market or overall density of markets), individual resources (e.g., income to dictate spending), and neighborhood-level resources (e.g., average income of the neighborhood\/county to subsidize and incentivize agricultural infrastructure). Innovative approaches to food access such as farmers markets, mobile markets, shelters, food banks and community gardens\/cooperatives have emerged as an alternative and improvement to grocery stores. However, the limited location of farmers markets makes their accessibility restricted. It should be noted that race\/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and the presence of a disability also may affect an individual\u2019s ability to access foods to support healthy eating patterns. However, the in depth study of these other contributing factors is outside the scope of this project.\n\n**Interest:** This project seeks to visualize and communicate the relationship between the location and density of farmers markets and the economic status of U.S. counties. Knowing which regions and counties are lacking in farmers markets is critical both from a public health perspective and from an economic opportunity perspective. Local municipalities and city councils may use this information to organize and petition for additional farmers markets to meet the needs of their constituents. From a purely business perspective, new vendors and farmers can find target areas lacking in competition in order to sell to underserved communities."}}
