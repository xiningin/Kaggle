It has one state-run hospital for more than 55,000 people. (Private hospitals are out of reach for most people). India has a poor culture of testing, and most people with flu symptoms do not go to doctors and instead try home remedies or go to pharmacies. There's a scarcity of isolation beds, trained nursing staff and medics, and ventilators and intensive care beds.\n\n###**India poor testing rate masked coronavirus cases:** [Report](https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2020\/03\/india-poor-testing-rate-masked-coronavirus-cases-200318040314568.html)\n"}}
