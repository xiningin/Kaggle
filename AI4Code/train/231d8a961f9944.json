That is why number beyond 1000 is unrealistic.

Most of the countires are spending under 2500% of their GDP on health. Since values are very large in columns of Percentage_expenditure, GDP, and Population, it's better to take a log value or use winsorization if required.\n\nThe BMI values are very unrealistic because the value more 40 considered as extreme obesity.
