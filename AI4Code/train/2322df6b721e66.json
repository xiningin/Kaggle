It may be that the older set had more missing values, and\nreplaced those with zeroes, but that is a guess.","b4f749fc":"### Polio Vaccination ###\nNot many data points along the red line, no consistent trend in over or under estimating, and problems in the problems Kaggle set with values near zero.\n\nIn my set, there are only a few points less than 20, which are reported as near 40 in the previous Kaggle set.\n(If I had to guess, these could be extrapolations from world regional averages.)","fe26ac6f":"### Body Mass Index (BMI) ###\nThis is the most glaring example, as there is basically no correlation between the two sets for BMI.\n\nTo set a realistic scale, this feature is a national average. WHO regards a BMI of less than 18.5 as underweight, while a BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and above 30 is considered obese. In my data set it ranges from 20 to 32. In the Kaggle set, it goes from single digits up to 80.","9054ea1c":"## Introduction ##\n\nThe data set is similar (but not identical) to a previously used [dataset in Kaggle][kag_ds].\nThat Kaggle set has bad data, where it is not clear how much of the information is valid.\nWhile there may have been errors in the older WHO data that have been corrected by now, there\nare some values that are unrealistic.\n\nSome examples of corruption problems with the previous Kaggle data set:\n- For \"percentage expenditure\", a country is listed as spending 194 times their GDP on just health care.\n- India is listed as having 1500-1800 infant deaths per 1000 population, which is not possible with half the population being female and a 9 month pregnancy.\n- \"infant deaths\" column has Uzbekistan with the values (17, 16, 15) for the years 2013-2015. This seems reasonable, except the actual values from the WHO web page are (26.3, 24.6, 23.0).\n\nThis notebook will compare some of the features that are present in both the previous Kaggle dataset\nand the one I generated. Since I have just made this data set, and can compare directly to the data in\nthe source server, I have confidence that any differences with the previous Kaggle set are due to errors in\nthe older set (which does not document how the data was generated).\n\n[who]: https:\/\/www.who.int\n[whodb]: https:\/\/www.who.int\/gho\/database\/en\/\n[unesco_ed]: https:\/\/en.unesco.org\/themes\/education\/databases\n[kag_ds]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kumarajarshi\/life-expectancy-who\n[think_9_10]: https:\/\/courses.thinkful.com\/dsbc-model-prep-v1\/checkpoint\/10","b10be0c7":"### Life Expectancy ###\nThe most obvious difference is the clustering of life expectancies in the previous Kaggle set in decades\n(50, 60, 70, 80). I don't know the reason for it, but it might be due\nto rounding errors or filling in missing values.","94e315c6":"### Population ###\nThe scatter plot shows that there are many points where the population is the same in both sets\n(along the drawn red line), but also quite a few where the previous Kaggle set appears to be off by a factor of 10 or a 100.","7aff6762":"I have picked out 6 features which should be almost the same between the two data sets.\nI am using the country name and year to match the two sets. If either of the\nsets is missing a value, that country-year row is removed. (I am not investigating why data\nmight be present in one set but absent in the other.)\n\nI say \"almost the same\", because I have seen differences between the UNESCO and GHO values\nfor some of the variables in my data set. However, those differences were relatively minor. Comparing\nthe previous Kaggle set to the recently generated data set shows significant larger differences.\n\nI am writing a few observations about the features, in the order they are plotted.\nThe left-most plot is the distribution from my data set, the middle plot is from the previous Kaggle set,\nand the right-most plot is a scatter distribution of the previous Kaggle set vs. my set.","f56ec65d":"### Adult Mortality ###\nLike population, the previous Kaggle set has some data points near or at the correct value, but a large\nnumber that are significantly wrong."}}
