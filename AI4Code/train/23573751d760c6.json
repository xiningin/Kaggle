However, the *test.csv* might come in handy when confirming that your generated row_id actually exists in the test data.\n\nLet's make some predictions. In this tutorial, we'll simply use mock predictions, so that we can focus on the submission process.","b1838dfd":"# Sample submission\n\nAssuming you have looked at our other notebooks, you should be familiar with extracting training samples from focal recordings, train a model and then make predictions on soundscape data. The only step that is missing is a valid submission to enter the leaderboard. In this tutorial, we will introduce the very basics of how to run inference on a hidden test set.\n\nFirst thing we need to do is to look for test soundscapes. **The hidden test set will only appear if you submit the notebook.** Yet, you can use the training soundscapes to test your workflow.","2c6eeef5":"Finally, we have to convert our result data frame to a csv file named \"submission.csv\". This way, it will get rated when submitting the notebook.","eebf92b4":"Filenames already include all the data that we need to make a valid submission (test and train soundscapes have the same naming scheme). \n\nTake a look at this example:","61b41c41":"Ok, but how do we actually submit? These are the steps you need to take:\n\n1. Save the notebook by clicking \"Save Version\" in the upper right corner (only visible in edit mode).\n2. The notebook will then show up under \"Code\" on the main competition page (it will also show up under \"Your work\").\n3. Click and view the notebook.\n4. Now click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select \"Submit to Competition\" (see screenshot below).\n5. Follow the on-screen instructions.\n6. Wait for the notebook to finish, results will show up under \"My Submissions\".\n\n![How to submit to the competition](https:\/\/tuc.cloud\/index.php\/s\/z9eWEA8ZtbHki3i\/preview)\n\nThat's it.
