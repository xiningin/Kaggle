Here's quick recap of the topics:\n* Introduction to the CIFAR10 dataset for image classification\n* Downloading, extracing and loading an image dataset using `torchvision`\n* Show random batches of images in a grid using `torchvision.utils.make_grid`\n* Creating a convolutional neural network using with `nn.Conv2d` and `nn.MaxPool2d` layers\n* Training a convolutional neural network and visualizing the losses and errors\n* Understanding overfitting and the strategies for avoiding it\n* Generating predictions on single images from the test set\n* Saving and loading the model weights\n\nThere's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n* Try chaging the hyperparameters to achieve a higher accuracy within fewer epochs. You use the comparison table on the Jovian.ml project page to compare your experiments.\n* Try adding more convolutional layers, or increasing the number of channels in each convolutional layer\n* Try using a feedforward neural network and see what's the maximum accuracy you can achieve\n* Read about some of the startegies mentioned above for reducing overfitting and achieving better results, and try to implement them by looking into the PyTorch docs.\n* Modify this notebook to train a model for a different dataset (e.g. CIFAR100 or ImageNet)\n\nIn the next tutorial, we will continue to improve our model's accuracy using techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization and dropout. We will also learn about residual networks (or ResNets), a small but critical change to the model architecture that will significantly boost the performance of our model. Stay tuned!","44d7b9ba":"The function `to_device` uses function recursion (look it up and think about the film Inception!).

The if statement is False, so you simply do tensor.to(device).\n\nExample 2: Now imagine \"data\" is a list of tensors. The tensor.to(device) method applies only for tensors, not lists of tensors. So the trick used here goes like this: \"data\" is a list, so the if statement is True, so you \"go one level down\" and re-apply the whole function to_device to each individual tensor in the list. Now each element is a tensor, so the if statement is False, so you move each to \"device\".\n\np.s.

However, if you train the model for long enough, you will notice that the training loss continues to decrease, while the validation loss stops decreasing, and even starts to increase after a certain point! \n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/1QU0m.png\" style=\"max-width:400px;\">\n\nThis phenomenon is called **overfitting**, and it is the no. 1 why many machine learning models give rather terrible results on real-world data. It happens because the model, in an attempt to minimize the loss, starts to learn patters are are unique to the training data, sometimes even memorizing specific training examples. Because of this, the model does not generalize well to previously unseen data.\n\n\nFollowing are some common stragegies for avoiding overfitting:\n\n- Gathering and generating more training data, or adding noise to it\n- Using regularization techniques like batch normalization & dropout\n- Early stopping of model's training, when validation loss starts to increase\n\nWe will cover these topics in more detail in the next tutorial in this series, and learn how we can reach an accuracy of **over 90%** by making minor but important changes to our model.","a9a7c7b6":"The above directory structure (one folder per class) is used by many computer vision datasets, and most deep learning libraries provide utilites for working with such datasets.

We expect these values to be similar to those for the validation set. If not, we might need a better validation set that has similar data and distribution as the test set (which often comes from real world data).","b4744652":"## Testing with individual images\n\nWhile we have been tracking the overall accuracy of a model so far, it's also a good idea to look at model's results on some sample images.

We begin by creating a test dataset using the `ImageFolder` class.\n\n","28d80b0c":"The initial accuracy is around 10%, which is what one might expect from a randomly intialized model (since it has a 1 in 10 chance of getting a label right by guessing randomly).\n\nWe'll use the following *hyperparmeters* (learning rate, no. of epochs, batch_size etc.) to train our model.

[Convolutions in Depth](https:\/\/sgugger.github.io\/convolution-in-depth.html) by Sylvian Gugger (this article implements convolutions from scratch)\n\nThere are certain advantages offered by convolutional layers when working with image data:\n\n* **Fewer parameters**: A small set of parameters (the kernel) is used to calculate outputs of the entire image, so the model has much fewer parameters compared to a fully connected layer. \n* **Sparsity of connections**: In each layer, each output element only depends on a small number of input elements, which makes the forward and backward passes more efficient.\n* **Parameter sharing and spatial invariance**: The features learned by a kernel in one part of the image can be used to detect similar pattern in a different part of another image. For example, a kernel to detect edges in the image\n\nWe will also use a [max-pooling](https:\/\/computersciencewiki.org\/index.php\/Max-pooling_\/_Pooling) layers to progressively decrease the height & width of the output tensors from each convolutional layer.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/computersciencewiki.org\/images\/8\/8a\/MaxpoolSample2.png\" style=\"max-width:400px;\">\n\nBefore we define the entire model, let's look at how a single convolutional layer followed by a max-pooling layer operates on the data.","bb95353b":"Let's verify that the model produces the expected output on a batch of training data.

We'll use the `random_split` helper method from PyTorch to do this. To ensure that we always create the same validation set, we'll also set a seed for the random number generator.","cce068de":"The `Conv2d` layer transforms a 3-channel image to a 16-channel *feature map*, and the `MaxPool2d` layer halves the height and width.
