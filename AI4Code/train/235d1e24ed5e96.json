Explanations of this paradox have been sought in a correlation between apparent radial velocities and distances, but so far the results have not been convincing. The present paper is a re-examination of the question, based on only those nebular distances which are believed to be fairly reliable.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/15\/3\/168","2b2f7830":"#At least my Correlation is ALIKish Hubble's","33105732":"![](https:\/\/s2.studylib.net\/store\/data\/005778187_1-aff7f6eb8484d0298d4ea760a15abe5a-300x300.png)studylib.net"}}
