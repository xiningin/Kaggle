We could fill in according to these 3 thresholds and get a low classification success. But here we have to pay attention to this; there is an imbalance between classes in the data. For this, we will use the quartiles and use the values \u200b\u200bobtained as threshold values. So we will do a classification process by using two threshold values \u200b\u200btogether.

Now the following may come to mind; Why did you use median instead of mean? This is because; We did the normality test at first and found that it was not distributed normally. When the data is not distributed normally, an intervening large value causes the mean to deviate. For this, I took the median value. But I didn't do this classically by taking the median of a variable. I did it like this; I found the median values \u200b\u200bof classes 0 and 1 and by taking the average of them, I reached a healthier result. This is the average I get; it created the threshold value that initially demarcated my data. So he separated the 0 and 1 classes. But the threshold process is not over yet.
