a cluster of tweets where there is a high similarity between text and selected texts ,if we can find those clusters then we can predict text for selected texts for those tweets irrespective of segment\n\nLet's see if we can find those clusters,one interesting idea would be to check tweets which have number of words lesss than 3 in text, because there the text might be completely used as text","4b4874e5":"There are no null Values in the test set","67911ac6":"## What do we currently Know About our Data:\n\nBefore starting let's look at some things that we already know about the data and will help us in gaining more new insights:\n* We Know that selected_text is a subset of text\n* We know that selected_text contains only one segment of text,i.e,It does not jump between two sentences.For Eg:- If text is 'Spent the entire morning in a meeting w\/ a vendor, and my boss was not happy w\/ them. Lots of fun.  I had other plans for my morning' The selected text can be 'my boss was not happy w\/ them. Lots of fun' or 'Lots of fun' but cannot be 'Morning,vendor and my boss,\n* Thanks to this discussion:https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/tweet-sentiment-extraction\/discussion\/138520 We know that neutral tweets have a jaccard similarity of 97 percent between text and selected_text\n* Also as discussed here https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/tweet-sentiment-extraction\/discussion\/138272 ,there are rows where selected_text starts from between the words and thus selected_texts dont always make sense and since we do not know whether the output of test set contain these descrepancies or not ,we are not sure that preprocessing and removing punctuations would be a good idea or not","c239fa87":"**By Looking at the Unique Words of each sentiment,we now have much more clarity about the data,these unique words are very strong determiners of Sentiment of tweets**","43e8181b":"OOPS!While we cleaned our dataset we didnt remove the stop words and hence we can see the most coomon word is 'to' .
