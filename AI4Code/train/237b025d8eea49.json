However, just how tough was it to get into these universities in 2019? I will attempt to answer that question by performing exploratory data analysis on the UTBK 2019 datasets.","b575969a":"When it comes to the humanities clusters, there is virtually no difference in performance between UI's accepted applicants and ITB's accepted applicants. However, both universities' accepted applicants outperformed UGM's.","317a73a3":"We will now perform data wrangling on both datasets regarding various admission variables: admission status (for applicants), passing grade, accepted applicants, total competing applicants, and acceptance rate (for majors).\n\n*Just a quick note: this acceptance rate here will only account for total competing applicants. By \"total competing applicants\", I mean applicants who were \"actively\" competing for the quota allocated, i.e. the applicants who already got accepted in their first choice aren't going to be counted in the total competing applicants for their second choice. I personally believe that by calculating the acceptance rate this way, we will get a number that better reflects the acceptance rate or selectivity of a certain choice.*","0871cc3a":"We see that UI tops and dominates the list. ITB, despite [being the most selective university in 2009](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bandung_Institute_of_Technology#Academics), doesn't actually make the cut. Let's see if we divide it by clusters.","123c31a6":"From all the valid data, *Sekolah Bisnis dan Manajemen* (School of Business and Management) has the highest passing grade in ITB for humanities cluster, while *Fakultas Seni Rupa dan Desain - Kampus Cirebon* (Faculty of Art and Design - Cirebon Campus) has the lowest passing grade, albeit still pretty high at 641.25, considering that the mean of humanities cluster test scores is below 600 from the KDE plot before.","30a37ace":"To compare the top 3 against each other, please we will plot the KDE of three of them along with the rest of test takers. We will also straightaway divide it by cluster\/type.\n\nFirst, we will do science cluster.","859b183c":"## **Analysis - Gadjah Mada University**","8c39b288":"Generally, we use the 95% confidence interval, which means that we can confidently say the two groups are statistically different if the p-value is less than 0.05. Here, we see that the **p-value is very close to 0**, which suggests that there is good evidence to **REJECT the Null Hypothesis**. Meaning the there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups. The **t-test** shows that the scores for these two groups are significantly different and that the science cluster applicants outperformed the humanities cluster applicants even if only by slightly.\n\nLet's perform the same analysis for both academic aptitude scores and specialized scores.","9246e433":"We can safely reject the Null Hypothesis and say that, on average, applicants who got admitted into UI outperformed those who didn't. How does that look across different types\/cluster, anyway?","c12aa331":"We can see that the result is generally the same as overall, with humanities applicants that got accepted into UI having a larger discrepancy of score from the humanities applicants that didn't get into UI.","f862882d":"Let's see the distribution of the applicants who got accepted into UI.","3755fbdc":"As you can see, there are two exam types in Indonesia divided by the specializations. The first specialization is (natural) sciences and technology, and the second one is social sciences and humanities. In the old days, applicants can take two different specializations with just one ID. However, the mechanism in 2019 might have been different from the old days, so we will check to see first if there were any shared IDs between the specialized tests to decide how we will wrangle the data further.","87c92559":"Generally there are 3 types of admissions for Indonesian public universities: non-test admission through high school report cards (SNMPTN Undangan), national entrance exam for university admission (UTBK\/SBMPTN), and independent admission test; these three admission types are held in respective succession. For UTBK, the allocated quota for admission is at the very least 40%. Here, we are making the assumption that all universities allocated exactly 40% for UTBK, even though in reality some universities allocated more quota in UTBK because the quota for the non-test admission wasn't fulfilled yet.","a8eca972":"Alright, now we will move on to analyze the majors\/universities. First, we will find out which majors have the highest number of total competing applicants.","a2bdbd8b":"It seems like there were no shared IDs, so we can just combine both datasets by concatenating for easier wrangling process and analysis.","329d1ea2":"When considering only the aggregate, how does the minimum passing grade compare between each university? Like, for instance, how high of a grade do you have to earn if you only care about getting into one of these universities regardless of the major?","49f80720":"Whoops, we haven't added the acceptance rate column yet.","faf715eb":"We will now compare between applicants who got accepted into ITB and applicants who didn't get into ITB--either people who failed to get into ITB, chose a ITB major as a second choice but got into their first choice, or simply didn't choose ITB in the first place.","d45444fd":"## **Data Wrangling**","ae9fc66f":"There's a chance that there were some invalid data where the major ID doesn't match up with any major in the majors dataset we have, so we will first inspect that.","8bfa1e74":"## **Conclusion**\n\nFrom the analyses that we have done, it can be safely concluded that getting into these top 3 universities is tough, judging by a variety of variables such as their passing grades, acceptance rates, and how the accepted applicants performed against the other test takers. They did live up to their names as the best Indonesian universities in 2019!","af9120c3":"From all the valid data, *Fakultas Teknologi Industri - Kampus Ganesa* (Faculty of Industrial Technology - Ganesa Campus) has the highest passing grade in ITB for science cluster, while *Sekolah Arsitektur, Perencanaan, dan Pengembangan Kebijakan - Kampus Cirebon* (School of Architecture, Planning, and Policy Development - Cirebon Campus) has the lowest passing grade--though still pretty high at 638, considering that the mean of science cluster test scores is below 600 from the KDE plot before.","e28417f9":"From all the valid data, *Pendidikan Dokter* (Medical School) has the highest passing grade in UI for science cluster, while *Ilmu Keperawatan* (Nursing Science) has the lowest passing grade--though still pretty high at 630.5, considering that the mean of science cluster test scores is below 600 from the KDE plot before.","89cb6c3d":"Next, we find out the acceptance rate for each university and rank them.","d4335d41":"We will now first wrangle the data regarding university majors by merging majors list and university list.","fd2974c6":"Let's see the distribution of the applicants who got accepted into ITB.","9ac78ee0":"From what we can see, the science cluster applicants overall tend to perform *only very slightly* better than the humanities cluster applicants judging from the average scores, but is this statistically significant? Let's find out.","f31684b1":"Visually we can conclude that on average, the applicants that got into top 3 performed better. But how did they compare to one another? We will perform hypothesis testing to find out.","6cabb34c":"Turns out our suspicion was right. For ease of analyzing, we will just drop the rows without valid majors for either major choice 1 or major choice 2, since there are only a few of them.","c9ba0e1b":"Again, while the top 3 universities are among the top 20 choices, they aren't exactly the most popular. Most likely because the average (and below average) applicants would gravitate to choosing non-top 3 universities to ensure their admittance."}}
