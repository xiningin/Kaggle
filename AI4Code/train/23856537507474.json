It also can be helpful for owners of low memory computers.\n\nThe idea is to store each column as numpy array, then access them using numpy.memmap and combine column into pandas when needed. Reading is available by object id or in chunks. A chunk may contain multiple object ids, object ids are not spread between chunks.\n\nData preparation is done in two kernels because of max disk space limitation. See [kernel 1](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexfir\/test-set-columns-part-1) and [kernel 2](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexfir\/test-set-columns-part-2). Output of the kernels is added as input to this kernel.","1c6b686e":"Let's read all test set and perform some operation (we need doing something as data is not read until we use them) and measure required time.","e885a3c6":"Before reading data, call init function and get info object that will be used later.","8dcd242b":"Not bad, but still only reading took a lot of time, even so single field was read and no pandas object was created.\nNow let's see what is performance of chunk reading.
