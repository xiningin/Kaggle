Additionally it shows that there's three separate colors that show up (1, 2, 3), the pos_as_num chart shows everything on a scale which causes the viewer to believe that there are far more variable types than there is.  However, based off the knowledge we possess Guards score the most amount of points, followed by forwards, and lastly centers.\n\nCurrently looking into how to alter the 'c' parameter so that there's more of a concise 'key'.","425e9bb1":"We use the bar chart because it is ideal to compare figures across different categories, in this case it's the three different positions within the 'pos' column.","3308cc19":"Both graphs show the data being skewed to the left.
