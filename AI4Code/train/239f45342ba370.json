train the model on 80% of the mushroom data, and then test it's performance on the remaining 20%.\n\nAnd as for the Unsupervised Learning Algorithm (K-Means Clustering): I've found that if we cluster the data (with it's labels removed) into two different clusters, then one cluster ends up holding most of the **<font color=\"purple\">poisonous<\/font>** mushrooms, while the other cluster ends up holding most of the **<font color=\"green\">edible<\/font>** mushrooms. So, to build our binary classifier, we will cluster that same 80% of mushroom data mentioned above into two clusters, and then classify the remaining 20% of mushrooms as **<font color=\"purple\">poisonous<\/font>** or **<font color=\"green\">edible<\/font>** depending on which cluster they belong to.\n\nAnd at the end, we will compare the performances of the two algorithms on that test data to see who comes out on top!","a539c64b":"<a id=\"3\">\n## 3.
