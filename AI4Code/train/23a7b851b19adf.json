These    droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you       are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.\n   \n   \n## To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:\n\n1. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.\n2. Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.\n3. Avoid touching your face.\n4. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.\n5. Stay home if you feel unwell.\n6. Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.\n7. Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.(by WHO)","66f28f3f":"## Covid-19:\n![banner-2.png](attachment:banner-2.png)\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.\nMost people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n","8d7884ba":"## EDA(Exploatry Data Analysis):\n  let's find statistical evidence from data","dce2b7f9":"## Correlation:","f828dfa1":"## Introduction:\nHello Kagglers!!\nI am here to contribute towards COVID- 19.
