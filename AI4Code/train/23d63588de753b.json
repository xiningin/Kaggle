This makes z-score a parametric method. Very frequently data points are not to described by a gaussian distribution, this problem can be solved by applying transformations to data ie: scaling it.","034e21ef":"Alright then, we've dealt with 0s let's move forward","e8443708":"Here is the end of EDA with continuous terms.","199d3c60":"Clearly, houses with waterfront starts only with ~0.4million.

Prediction of property prices is becoming increasingly important and beneficial. Property prices are a good indicator of both the overall market condition and the economic health of a country.\n\n#### Columns:\n\n- Date: Date when the house is ready for sale. \n- Price: Price of the house to be sold.\n- Bedrooms: No. of bedrooms in the house.\n- Bathrooms: No. of bathrooms in the house.\n- Sqft_living: Squarefoot of Living in the house.\n- Sqft_lot: Squarefoot of Floor in the house. \n- Floors: Floors on which living area located. \n- Waterfront: If waterfront available in front of house.\n- View: Vie from the house.\n- Condition: Condition of the house.\n- Sqft_above: Squarefoot above is the space available at roof. \n- Sqft_basement: Squarefoot basement is the space available at the basement.\n- Yr_built: In which year the house is built.\n- Yr_renovated: Year of renovation.\n- Street: On which street house is located.\n- City: City in which the country is located.\n- Statezip: Zip code of the area in which house is located.\n- Country: Country is US.","d1145e94":"Handling outliers of price columns. As, it is very important because at last we're predicting price and disturbance in its distribution might hit hard to our predictions.","1ff8bc32":"Checking our model accuracy in the starting.","e82cf27c":"Maximum price is for 2.5 floors trailing by 3.5 floors.","b5267d97":"Possibly the condition here is for the condition of house and I assuming 5 as best condition and 1 as the worst.\n\nBut 1 has just 6 houses that means USA is a country of good conditioned houses.\n\nWell just one change for me to replace 1 with 2. That's all.","941b8953":"Max price of 7,8,9 bedrooms are less than that of 6 bedrooms which is kind strange, but it might possible if the house is far from the main town or have some issues like paranormal activities like hollywood movies\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02!!\n\nWe can leave it as it ease or we can change it also!! I personally think let's deal with it because less than 20 rows have more than 6 bedrooms and it will might lead to disturbance in our distribution.","7f785f2f":"There are alot of outliers can clearly observed!!\n\nLet's visualize it more clearly!","3ea97a35":"Too much disturbance in this column and also as we checked above is not much correlated to our dependent column price. So, I've decided to leave it as it is.","2d3ce872":"**Encoding**: In laymens language it is just converting data into numerical forms so that our model can understand data easily.\n\nThere are many techniques for label encoding but here after observing data well I choose One Hot Encoding.\n\n**Note**: The one hot encoder does not accept 1-dimensional array or a pandas series, the input should always be 2-dimensional and the data passed to the encoder should not contain strings.","a9511f60":"Checking for multicollinearity among the continuous columns using VIF methods.\n\n**Multicollinearity**: Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with one another in a regression model.\n\n**Why not Multicollinearity?**: Multicollinearity can be a problem in a regression model because we would not be able to distinguish between the individual effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable.\n\n**Detection of Multicollinearity**: Multicollinearity can be detected via various methods. One of the popular method is using VIF.\n\n**VIF**: VIF stands for Variable Inflation Factors. VIF determines the strength of the correlation between the independent variables. It is predicted by taking a variable and regressing it against every other variable.\n\n`Here, I'll check VIF only for the continuous variables.`","fc8b01c8":"So, 0 price houses have ~4 bedrooms, ~2.5 bathrooms and ~2800 sqft living.\n\nAs we discussed above these are some major columns on which price depends. So we'll use these to replace 0 prices of houses.","a7ce9987":"You can observe a litle high variation in statezip in comparison to city. So I'have selected our final column that is statezip.\n\nNow, let's drop street, city and country before moving forward.","a2f140cd":"Increased!!...","8678ec7d":"As you can also observe sqft living and prices of 3.25 bathrooms closely related to each other so, let's replace 0 bathrooms with 3.25","35e0002e":"I here replaced few of less occuring entries to decrease the skewness of our distribution.","1c8a1130":"What a CHANGE!!\nQuickly Visualizing more columns.","cce79ed7":"None of the pvalue is greater than significance value 0.05. So, it proves there is no relationship between the variables with y, so must not be dropped."}}
