It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.\nIn a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches.\n\nThe decisions or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.\n\nIt is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure.\n","f825ed6f":"## Build the model","f98a8023":"## Import Libraries","0e2a3984":"### Visualize the Tree","f7776adf":"## Data Visualisation","0d39c391":"## Attribute Selection Measures\n \nIf the dataset consists of **N** attributes then deciding which attribute to place at the root or at different levels of the tree as internal nodes is a complicated step. By just randomly selecting any node to be the root can\u2019t solve the issue. If we follow a random approach, it may give us bad results with low accuracy.\n\nFor solving this attribute selection problem, researchers worked and devised some solutions. They suggested using some criteria like :\n\n**Entropy,\nInformation gain,\nGini index,\nGain Ratio,\nReduction in Variance\nChi-Square**\n\nThese criteria will calculate values for every attribute. The values are sorted, and attributes are placed in the tree by following the order i.e, the attribute with a high value(in case of information gain) is placed at the root.","b8fe0773":"![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/446\/0*BdgOokoatW17zEK7.png)","c25e05a6":"#### Predict","d5e78424":"## Data preparation","2731a86d":"where **T\u2192 Current state and X \u2192 Selected attribute**\n","eabce554":"![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/688\/1*bcLAJfWN2GpVQNTVOCrrvw.png)","27fed039":"#### Train","aec82bf6":"### Max Leaf Nodes","c9bd6fed":"### Max Depth","dd3fc357":"## Read Datasets and Check out the Data"}}
