Autumn is coming, don't forget to drink orange juice and be healthy!","feca1a10":"All this can be displayed on one chart. But please excuse me. I respect every vitamin. Seems pretty logical. We see that salads contain a record amount of vitamin A compared to dishes from other categories. No wonder! After all, vitamin A is rich in many vegetables, as well as fish and eggs. We can also see how similar the distribution graphs of protein and calcium are! Even for me, it's no secret that protein is rich in calcium.\n\nYou can view each substance. Now I am interested in how many harmful substances are in my favorite dishes.","46ac2faf":"Basically, the products contain relatively little sugar.

This dataset is perfect. All values are in place. Well let's see what we love to eat :D I see that the dishes are divided into categories. Breakfast, coffee and tea and so on.

The correlation matrix confirmed the idea that cholesterol and trans fats are best avoided. They are not only harmful to the body, but also increase the caloric content of food hehe\nIf you want to know the average calorie content of products, you can see the distribution. Or look at any of the measures of the Central trend.","c4d07995":"Thanks! \n![![image.png](attachment:image.png)](https:\/\/vlg.discont-plitki.ru\/upload\/iblock\/861\/861d0c45693d75a49f2331d0290f88ab.jpg)"}}
