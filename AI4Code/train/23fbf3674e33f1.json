CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is an open standard guide that describes common approaches that are used by data mining experts. CRISP-DM includes descriptions of the typical phases of a project, including tasks details and provides an overview of the data mining lifecycle. The lifecycle model consists of six phases with arrows indicating the most important and frequent dependencies between phases. The sequence of the phases is not strict. In fact, most projects move back and forth between phases as necessary. It starts with business understanding, and then moves to data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment. The CRISP-DM model is flexible and can be customized easily.\n## Buissness Understanding\n\n    Tasks:\n\n    1.Determine business objectives\n\n    2.Assess situation\n\n    3.Determine data mining goals\n\n    4.Produce project plan\n\n## Data Understanding\n     Tasks:\n\n    1.Collect data\n\n    2.Describe data\n\n    3.Explore data    \n\n## Data Preparation\n    Tasks\n    1.Data selection\n\n    2.Data preprocessing\n\n    3.Feature engineering\n\n    4.Dimensionality reduction\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Data cleaning\n\n            Data integration\n\n            Data sampling\n\n            Data dimensionality reduction\n\n            Data formatting\n\n            Data transformation\n\n            Scaling\n\n            Aggregation\n\n            Decomposition\n\n## Data Modeling :\n\nModeling is the part of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process model that i like best.

They use a ventilator to pump oxygen into a sedated patient's lungs via a tube in the windpipe. But mechanical ventilation is a clinician-intensive procedure, a limitation that was prominently on display during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators is prohibitively expensive, even before reaching clinical trials. High-quality simulators could reduce this barrier.\n\nCurrent simulators are trained as an ensemble, where each model simulates a single lung setting. However, lungs and their attributes form a continuous space, so a parametric approach must be explored that would consider the differences in patient lungs.\n\nPartnering with Princeton University, the team at Google Brain aims to grow the community around machine learning for mechanical ventilation control. They believe that neural networks and deep learning can better generalize across lungs with varying characteristics than the current industry standard of PID controllers.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient's lung. The best submissions will take lung attributes compliance and resistance into account.\n\nIf successful, you'll help overcome the cost barrier of developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators. This will pave the way for algorithms that adapt to patients and reduce the burden on clinicians during these novel times and beyond. As a result, ventilator treatments may become more widely available to help patients breathe.\n\n**Eval Metric**: The competition will be scored as the mean absolute error between the predicted and actual pressures during the inspiratory phase of each breath. The expiratory phase is not scored. The score is given by:\n\n|X\u2212Y|\n\nwhere X is the vector of predicted pressure and Y is the vector of actual pressures across all breaths in the test set.\n    \n  **Reminder**\n\n* id - globally-unique time step identifier across an entire file\n\n* breath_id - globally-unique time step for breaths\n\n* R - lung attribute indicating how restricted the airway is (in cmH2O\/L\/S). Physically, this is the change in pressure per change in flow (air volume per time). Intuitively, one can imagine blowing up a balloon through a straw. We can change R by changing the diameter of the straw, with higher R being harder to blow.\n\n* C - lung attribute indicating how compliant the lung is (in mL\/cmH2O). Physically, this is the change in volume per change in pressure. Intuitively, one can imagine the same balloon example. We can change C by changing the thickness of the balloon\u2019s latex, with higher C having thinner latex and easier to blow.\n\n* time_step - the actual time stamp.\n\n* u_in - the control input for the inspiratory solenoid valve. Ranges from 0 to 100.\n\n* u_out - the control input for the exploratory solenoid valve.

A value close to zero suggests a weak correlation, whereas a value closer to -1 or 1 indicates a strong correlation.\n\nCorrelation values, called correlation coefficients, can be calculated for each observation and different lag values. Once calculated, a plot can be created to help better understand how this relationship changes over the lag.\n\nThis type of plot is called an autocorrelation plot and Pandas provides this capability built in, called the autocorrelation_plot() function.\n\nThe example below creates an autocorrelation plot for the Minimum Daily Temperatures dataset","ca5a9615":"##  Time Series Histogram and Density Plots\nAnother important visualization is of the distribution of observations themselves.\n\nThis means a plot of the values without the temporal ordering.\n\nSome linear time series forecasting methods assume a well-behaved distribution of observations (i.e. a bell curve or normal distribution). This can be explicitly checked using tools like statistical hypothesis tests. But plots can provide a useful first check of the distribution of observations both on raw observations and after any type of data transform has been performed.\n\nThe example below creates a histogram plot of the observations  dataset. A histogram groups values into bins, and the frequency or count of observations in each bin can provide insight into the underlying distribution of the observations.","3aeeec44":"<a id=\"top\"><\/a>\n<h3 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" style='color:white; background:#1777C4; border:0' role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\"><center>Data Modeling<\/center><\/h3>\n\nModeling is the part of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process model that i like best.

If you are predicting a numeric value like a height or a dollar amount, you don\u2019t want to know if the model predicted the value exactly (this might be intractably difficult in practice); instead, we want to know how close the predictions were to the expected values.\n\nError addresses exactly this and summarizes on average how close predictions were to their expected values.\n\nThere are three error metrics that are commonly used for evaluating and reporting the performance of a regression model; they are:\n\n    Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n\n**Mean Absolute Error**, or MAE, is a popular metric because, like RMSE, the units of the error score match the units of the target value that is being predicted.\n\nUnlike the RMSE, the changes in MAE are linear and therefore intuitive.\n\nThat is, MSE and RMSE punish larger errors more than smaller errors, inflating or magnifying the mean error score. This is due to the square of the error value. The MAE does not give more or less weight to different types of errors and instead the scores increase linearly with increases in error.\n\nAs its name suggests, the MAE score is calculated as the average of the absolute error values. Absolute or abs() is a mathematical function that simply makes a number positive. Therefore, the difference between an expected and predicted value may be positive or negative and is forced to be positive when calculating the MAE.\n\nThe MAE can be calculated as follows:\n\n    MAE = 1 \/ N * sum for i to N abs(y_i \u2013 yhat_i)\n\nWhere y_i is the i\u2019th expected value in the dataset, yhat_i is the i\u2019th predicted value and abs() is the absolute function.\n\nwe have done all EDA needed to chose the best preprocessing steps and begin modeling .\nWork is in progress .. \n\nUpvote if you find it useful .","29d31846":"The line plot is quite dense.\n\nSometimes it can help to change the style of the line plot; for example, to use a dashed line or dots.\n\nBelow is an example of changing the style of the line to be black dots instead of a connected line (the style=\u2019k.\u2019 argument).","b3c48f44":"## Create clusters with pressure data\n\nhttps:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/dynamic-time-warping-3933f25fcdd\n\nhttps:\/\/rtavenar.github.io\/blog\/dtw.html\n\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/walmartglobaltech\/time-series-similarity-using-dynamic-time-warping-explained-9d09119e48ec","3aaef19e":"The plot created from running the example shows a relatively strong positive correlation between observations and their lag1 values.\n\nWe can repeat this process for an observation and any lag values. Perhaps with the observation at the same time last week, last month, or last year, or any other domain-specific knowledge we may wish to explore.\n\nFor example, we can create a scatter plot for the observation with each value in the previous seven days. Below is an example of this for the Minimum Daily Temperatures dataset.\n\nFirst, a new DataFrame is created with the lag values as new columns. The columns are named appropriately. Then a new subplot is created that plots each observation with a different lag value"}}
