It is well suited for seasoned data scientists who want to increase the productivity of their ML experiments by using PyCaret in their workflows or for citizen data scientists and those new to data science with little or no background in coding. PyCaret allows you to go from preparing your data to deploying your model within seconds using your choice of notebook environment.","1fafed1e":"# **Let's see if we can further optmize the Gradient Boosting Regressor Model?**","f0d9c5d0":"# **Comparing Models**\n\nNotice that we have used n_select parameter within compare_models. while the compare_models option by default returns the best performing model (you can sort the model based on the metricof your choice, by default it picks up R2). However you can use n_select parameter to return top N models. In this routine we will compare_models Top 3 of our best performing models and will be further sorting it using RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) metric the lower the better.","f622d525":"# **Getting Data**\n\nWhile there are multiple ways to get data into Google Colab environment, however, my preferred way is to get the google drive mounted which saves a lot of time for me.

Importing a module prepares an environment for specific task. For this analysis we will be using Regression, NLP and probably Classification module to perform series of analysis to make sense of the data and to make predictions.","e32db309":"# **Plotting the Tuned Model**\n\nBefore model finalization, I will use the plot_model() function can be used to analyze the performance across different aspects such as Residuals Plot, Prediction Error, Feature Importance etc. This function takes a trained model object and returns a plot based on the test \/ hold-out set.","d3a04dc2":"# **PREDICTING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE USING AIRBnB DATA**\n\nAirbnb has seen a fleeting development since its beginning in 2008 with the number of rentals recorded on its site developing exponentially each year. Airbnb hsa turned out to be a game changer when it comes to the traditional travel and hospitality industry as more and more travelers are looking true value for their money.\n\nThis analysis is based on 13,578 unique listing in Lisbon, while the minimum rental in Lisbon stands at 10 dollar in neighborhoods like Campolide,Santa Maria Maior, Santa Clara, S\u00c3\u00a3o Vicente, Avenidas Novas, Areeiro, Carnide and Alvalade. \n\nThe price for a listing ranges from 10 dollars per night to a whopping 4K dollars per night in Benfica.\n\nThe aim of this analysis is to identify key indicators that can help us to improve the customer and property experience, ultimatley helping AirBnB Lisbon more business and a positive customer experience."}}
