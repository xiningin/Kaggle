The dataset is then partitioned into two parts at a 70:30 ratio for training and test.\n\nThen, given the large number of columns of descriptive features after transformation, applying feature selection could be beneficial before fitting the model. I select the top 10 features by Random Forest Importance and F-Score. Then, I compare the performance of these two feature selection methods and continue with the better one for further model fitting.\n\nAfter the feature selection, I train the models with hyperparameter search in a pipeline with 5-fold repeated stratified cross-validation based on the train data with full features and the same train data but only with the top 10 features selected in the previous stage. \n\nStratification is necessary throughout the model fitting and selection as the binary target classes are imbalanced.\n\nIn the end, I fit the best models identified from the hyperparameter search on the test data with a 5-fold repeated stratified cross-validation and compare the model performance by a paired t-test to determine if these models yield any significant differences. The comparison is initially based on the metric area under curve (AUC), and I integrate other evaluation metrics, such as recall, precision, and F1-score, for a comprehensive and in-depth comparison.","0457d92b":"## Feature Selection & Ranking\n\nThe 1-nearest neighbor classifier is used as a wrapper to compare the performance of feature selection methods: F-Score and Random Forest Importance. I also use stratified 5-fold cross validation with 3 repetitions for assessment.","0e58258e":"### F-Score","a0e215f8":"### Random Forest Importance","5c046c2d":"# Hyperparameter Tuning<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"><\/a>\n\nIn this section, I train and fine-tune the models based on the 276 rows of training data. I also compare the performance of models with the full features and with the top 10 features.\n\nEach model is evaluated by 5-fold stratified cross-validation with 3 repetitions for hyperparameter tuning.","35185362":"# Summary <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"5\"><\/a> \n\nThe Decision Tree model based on the top 10 features selected by F-Score is the best model for prediction in this analysis, under a limited hyperparameter tuning and feature selection approach. Although there is not enough statiscal evidence to show that this Descision Tree model performs better than the other KNN and Naive Bayes models, at a 5% level of significance, it yields the highest AUC score (0.916) and F1 score (0.9). In general, all models with only the top 10 features selected by F-Score perform significantly better than those with the full features, at a 5% level of significance.","6c784f19":"The dataset contains 395 observations. The numeric target feature \"G3\" has been renamed as \"target\" and transformed into a binary categorical feature with two levels \"pass\" and \"fail\".","18d62034":"# Performance Comparison <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4\"><\/a> ","ba37607b":"For models based on the top 10 features selected by F-Score, the KNN model performs significantly better than the Naive Bayes model. Decision Tree performs similarily comparing with either KNN or Naive Bayes models. It is hard to decide the optimal model at this stage with only AUC score available, but based on the above performance comparison, it is clear that all models with the top 10 features perform better on the test data. Therefore, for further evaluation on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score and confusion matrix, I only consider models with the top 10 features.","6de33664":"## Encoding Categorical Features\n\nIt is necessary to encode all categorical features into numerical features, since Scikit-learn requires all data to be numeric before putting them into the algorithm. \n\nBefore encoding the target feature, the descriptive features and the target feature need to be partitioned. ","84438160":"## 1. K-Nearest Neighbors\n\nI use grid search for hyperparameter tuning in a pipeline and train the KNN model with different k-nearest neighbors and distance types.","07725f57":"Suppose the school wants to predict students who are likely to fail the Mathematics course in order to give these students more support in advance. Then the recall of \"0\" (fail) is an important metric to consider in this case. The Decision Tree model is the most optimal one.\nHowever, if the school wants to correctly predict students who are likely to pass in order to select good students to attend Mathematics competitions, the recall of \"1\" (pass) should be emphasized. Therefore, the KNN model can be the most optimal one.\nIn general, the Decision Tree model can be regarded as the best model in terms of the F1-score as this score is a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall.","6cfb792c":"## 2. Decision Tree\n\nTo find the optimal Decision Tree model, I include different criterion (gini index and entropy), maximum depth and minimum sample split in the grid search.","228a4517":"### Performance Comparison Using Paired T-Tests","62a4f962":"The performances after feature selection by both Random Forest Importance and F-Score are statistically better than the performance based on the full features, at 5% level of significance. \nMeanwhile, the difference between F-Score and Random Forest Importance is also statistically significant. Therefore, for the further analysis, I continue with the top 10 features selected by F-Score as shown in the below figure. In this figure, it shows that the importance decreases sharply after the top 2 features. The importance becomes very marginalised till the last feature.","1ae76906":"In this section, I fit the optimal models from the above analyses on the test data with 5-fold stratified cross validation and 3 repetitions.
