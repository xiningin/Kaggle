Each of the phases and process involved are heighted below. The tools used for this analysis are the Python programming language and the Pandas exploratory library.\n","141486ea":"## PHASE 6: ACT\n\n#### Identified Insights:\n1. The Bellabeat Fitness Tracker is mostly used on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, while rarely used on weekends and on Mondays.\n2. Most users who log their activity are sedentary (seated), representing about 80% of total time logged in.\n3. The more step taken by user, the more calories lost. Users with above 3000 steps lost the most calories.\n\n#### Solve Business Problem:\nRecall that the business aim is to gain insight to unlock new marketing strategy for growth.\n1. Users often forget to use Bellabeat Fitness Tracker on weekends and Mondays.\n2. Users do not log into the app when doing active chores, they are almost always logged in when seated.\n3. Walking exercises and calorie loss are correlated.\n\n#### Make Recommendations and Decision.\n1.\tSet reminders or notification messages to users on weekends and Mondays to remind them of Bellabeat Fitness Tracker usage.\n2.\tEducate users on how to use the Bellabeat Fitness Tracker especially during active chores, this would help it to track their activity and proffer best routine.\n3.\tSince the activity level directly defines the loss of calories, when users are motivated and reminded to use the app, their activity level increases and so does their calorie loss, thereby encouraging them to advertise the product to family and friends.\n\n\n### All of this would lead to growth for Bellabeat!","9448d19c":"## PHASE 2: PREPARE\nThe Bellabeat\u2019s FitBit Fitness Tracker Data is a publicly available data which record users\u2019 daily activities from their smart device.
