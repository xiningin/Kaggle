However, I do not know the specifics of how this dataset was collected, so I have to trust the publisher that this data was collected in an un-biased manner.","c73ceb0f":"The distribution of average glucose levels is interesting, it appears the population in the dataset has two means, one centered around 80 and the other centered around 220. After some very brief googling, I believe there are two possible explanations for this. The first explanation is there is one population with diabetes, and thus higher levels of glucose than those without diabetes. Another explanation is that people have different glucose levels depending on the time of day and how recently they have eaten, so those measured right before a meal would have lower glucose levels, and those measured after a meal have higher levels. However, based off a quick google search, it appears that those without diabetes do not have great variation of their glucose levels before and after meals, whereas those with diabetes do. So it appears a signifcant number of individuals in the dataset have diabetes, thus creating the second peak.","65cf5d7c":"The distrubtion of BMI looks fairly normal, except there is a massive tail causing the distribution to be right-skewed. We see there are only 5 individuals with a BMI exceeding 65, so they do not end up impacting the mean in an extreme way.","3cbefba9":"Another finding is that all of these health measures have a positive correlation with each other to varying degrees.","84be3684":"Now we will look at the distributions of the different columns of our data.","aa2467ab":"We see that the only column with missing data is the bmi column, and that column has less than 5% missing values, which is good.","873ef9f7":"A modest number of individuals have heart disease or hypertension.","83df4c48":"Here we see the correlations of each health measure.
