We should crop away some from the top and bottom of the image, since as we saw on train most images that show the full height of the circle are class 0, which is an unwanted correlation.\n\nShould we crop from the right or left? Most of the test data just shows the center part of the retina, so it makes sense to focus on that and crop train images the same. That's what we'll do here. We're not cropping out too much area, 6% on either side.\n\n(To get a little better with the part of the test data that shows the full width, it may be worth it to have some train images that do show the full width, for example crop train images to the center part with prob 3\/4 and show the full width with prob 1\/4.)\n\nHere is a function that crops a centered image to look like train size #1 \/ test size #0:","b7198545":"# Apply.","37fe470d":"It does not, the network is still very good at figuring out the original size of the train image.

One with target='size', where the task of the NN is to predict the original size.\n\nThe reason for using target='size' is the following: The most common class on train is zero, hence if we use target='class' the network is going to guess zero if in doubt. This is going to lead to high accuracy for example for the images of original size #8, and we won't know if that's because there are still unwanted correlations or if it's just a guess. Using target='size' is more finegrained.","dacc1fb5":"# Removing unwanted correlations in training data\n\nThe training data come from different sources, with different image sizes, and characteristics like brightness and hue. As noted in https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/taindow\/be-careful-what-you-train-on, some of this image metadata - like the height and width - are correlated with the label. The most extreme case is that all 351 train images with dimensions 2048x1536 are class 0. Those correlations don't transfer to the test data (or the real world), so they should be removed so the final model doesn't learn them.\n\nHow to remove the spurious correlations? One could do heavy random augmentation, especially cropping, and hope to \"cover\" the correlations under the randomness of augmentation. Or one could do more targeted, deterministic preprocessing to remove the correlations, which is what we'll do here. \n\nIn either case, one would like to test whether one has successfully removed them. To test whether a preprocessing method removes spurious correlations, we'll take the preprocessed images and apply with a transformation that obscures the ground truth - such as turning all foreground pixels white and all background pixels black, or doing a Gaussian blur with large radius. \n\nThen, we'll train a simple model to predict which class the image is. If that model performs much better than random, there are still some superficial correlations and we need to do more preprocessing. If we don't manage to train a good model, it's good. We can never have a guarantee that we've removed all correlations which are there on train and are not there on test, but weakening unwanted correlations is already better than nothing.\n\nTo cut down runtime, work with data that's rescaled to 1\/4 of the height and 1\/4 of the width (keeping the aspect ratio).\n\n---\n\nThis is my first public kernel, feedback would be much appreciated!
