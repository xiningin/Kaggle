It is a centroid-based algorithm meaning that the goal is to locate the center points of each group\/class, which works by updating candidates for center points to be the mean of the points within the sliding-window. These candidate windows are then filtered in a post-processing stage to eliminate near-duplicates, forming the final set of center points and their corresponding groups.

Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and\/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and\/or features. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.\n\nWe can use clustering analysis to gain some valuable insights from our data by seeing what groups the data points fall into when we apply a clustering algorithm.","272deab3":"Here we will be looking for patterns with which we can group datapoints so all the features\/columns are not important .\n\nSome columns are passenger specific such as passengerId, Ticket, etc we can drop them .","b31da373":"**MeanShift**","efede0d0":"*1)* To explain mean-shift we will consider a set of points in two-dimensional space like the above illustration. We begin with a circular sliding window centered at a point C (randomly selected) and having radius r as the kernel. Mean shift is a hill climbing algorithm which involves shifting this kernel iteratively to a higher density region on each step until convergence.\n\n*2)* At every iteration the sliding window is shifted towards regions of higher density by shifting the center point to the mean of the points within the window (hence the name). The density within the sliding window is proportional to the number of points inside it. Naturally, by shifting to the mean of the points in the window it will gradually move towards areas of higher point density.\n\n*3)* We continue shifting the sliding window according to the mean until there is no direction at which a shift can accommodate more points inside the kernel. Check out the graphic above; we keep moving the circle until we no longer are increasing the density (i.e number of points in the window).\n\n*4)* This process of steps 1 to 3 is done with many sliding windows until all points lie within a window. When multiple sliding windows overlap the window containing the most points is preserved. The data points are then clustered according to the sliding window in which they reside.\n\n**An illustration of the entire process from end-to-end with all of the sliding windows is show below**. Each black dot represents the centroid of a sliding window and each gray dot is a data point.\n\n![](http:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1600\/1*vyz94J_76dsVToaa4VG1Zg.gif)","fa6dd425":"*References :-*\n\n*towardsdatascience.com\/the-5-clustering-algorithms-data-scientists-need-to-know-a36d136ef68*","d5830335":"We can see\n\n1) Total passenger information we have is 715.\n\n2) Out of these 715 passenger only 40% survived.\n\n3) PClass mean= 2.237 which shows there are more people in lower class cabins\n\n4) Mean of Sex column is 0.63 where 0 is female and 1 is male which means there were more males in ship than females.\n\n5) The average fare of passenger in this dataset is $35"}}
