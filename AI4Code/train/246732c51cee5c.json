The best thing about Plotly is that it is free and graphs rendered using Plotly are interactive which can be helpful in drilling down on categories. However the downside is it's lengthy code. Plotly is very verbose i.e we need to write lengthy codes for creating even the simplest graph.\n\nHowever while working on a recent project, I came across a library which made my life easier. Using this library, I rendered Plotly graphs using code similar to **Matplotlib**. The library I used is **CUFFLINKS**. Cufflinks is a library which binds Plotly graphs directly onto **Pandas** dataframe. The code is very similar to that of Matplotlib, thereby making it easier to interpret. This library is probably available for **Python only**. If I find R equivalent for this, I will surely post it.\n\nThis notebook is just an introduction to Cufflinks, so that more and more people can use it.

But if u see carefully, not all the graphs have the same y-axis range, i.e some graphs have values higher than 100, whereas some have just below 20. So just looking at the graph can lead to faulty decisions. Lets caliberate the y-axis onto a common axis","0eaea946":"\n## Yearly Sales By Region\n\nLets see a one liner code to render a plot using Plotly.\n","4d9aa513":"I hope this notebook was useful.
