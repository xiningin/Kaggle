In addition, international payments are easy and cheap because bitcoins are not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Small businesses may like them because there are no credit card fees. Some people just buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping that they\u2019ll go up in value.\n\n#### How is Bitcoin traded?\n\nMany marketplaces called \u201cbitcoin exchanges\u201d allow people to buy or sell bitcoins using different currencies. Coinbase is a leading exchange, along with Bitstamp and Bitfinex. But security can be a concern: bitcoins worth tens of millions of dollars were stolen from Bitfinex when it was hacked in 2016.\n\nPeople can send bitcoins to each other using mobile apps or their computers. It\u2019s similar to sending cash digitally.\n\nPeople compete to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoins using computers to solve complex math puzzles. This is how bitcoins are created. Currently, a winner is rewarded with 6.25 bitcoins roughly every 10 minutes.","dfdf2566":"## Objective\nThe aim of this kernal is to train an LSTM model to predict the future price of Bitcoin based on past time series data. This kernal will use LSTM model from the Keras Library\n\n## What is LSTM?\n\nLSTM stands for long short-term memory networks, used in the field of Deep Learning. It is a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems. LSTM has feedback connections, i.e., it is capable of processing the entire sequence of data, apart from single data points such as images. This finds application in speech recognition, machine translation, etc. LSTM is a special kind of RNN, which shows outstanding performance on a large variety of problems.\n\n<center><img src = \"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*goJVQs-p9kgLODFNyhl9zA.gif\" alt=\"LSTM aniamtion\" width=700px><\/center>\n\n"}}
