The main difference is that the DBN is padded, so that the CSD portion of it always consists of two digits. That means we'll need to add a leading 0 to the CSD if the CSD is less than two digits long. Here's a diagram illustrating what we need to do:\n- As you can see, whenever the CSD is less than two digits long, we need to add a leading 0. We can accomplish this using the pandas.Series.apply() method, along with a custom function that:\n1. Takes in a number.\n1. Converts the number to a string using the str() function.\n1. Check the length of the string using the len() function.\n1. If the string is two digits long, returns the string.\n1. If the string is one digit long, adds a 0 to the front of the string, then returns it.\n1. You can use the string method zfill() to do this.\n","601a7861":"- Reading in the Data","4dafa4da":"* Reading in the Survey Data\n- The files are tab delimited and encoded with Windows-1252 encoding.
