strong growth in the mean salaries of Data science professionals could be observed. During the same period, remote jobs have been preferred more over\nregular jobs. As far as salaries are concerned, there has been a substantial increase in the number of professionals bagging salaries upto 200,000 USD.\n\n\n>In terms of average salaries with respect to Job titles for the year 2021, ML Engineer, Principal Data Scientist and Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineer bagged the top 3 positions.\nML Engineer's average salary has increased by 16 times over the period from 2020 to 2021 followed by Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineer by 3 times. \nThis indicates a huge increasing importance in data engineering skills in data science industry. On the contrary, Big Data Engineer, Research Scientist and Computer Vision Engineer \ncame at the bottom 3 places in terms of change in average salary for the period from 2020 to 2021.\n\n\n>Coming to various experience levels, only Executive level professionals had an increase in their average salary and that too by about 14%. All other professionals at other excperience levels\nhad a decrease in their salary with entry level professionals bearing more than 10% decrease in their average take home pay.\n\n\n>With respect to average salaries based on employee residence for the year 2021, Data science professionals from US, Russia and Japan earned the top 3 position.\nData science professionals from Nigeria (400%), Italy (300%) and Russia (over 150%) experienced the highest change in their mean salaries from 2020 to 2021.\nThough Indian data science professionals bagged the 4th position (150%) in terms of increase in the average salaries based on employee residence, \nData science professionals from India and other developing countries are hugely underpaid compared to US, Russia and Japan.\nData science professionals in Mexico, Poland and Spain experienced huge decrease in average salaries over the period from 2020 to 2021 with professionals from Mexico \nexperiencing more than 90% decrease in their salaries.\n\n\n>Data science professionals working on contract and part-time basis received an increase in salary with contract workers grabbing more than 1.5 times previous year salary on average.\nThough not much change could be observed for full-time employees, freelancers have taken a huge hit in their average salaries that decreased by almost 75%.\n\n\n>Data science professionals working in the US bagged top position with respect to their average salaries for 2021 overtaking Japan.\nWhen companies in Nigeria (400%), Canada (over 100%) and India (over 100%) gave the top 3 hike in their employees average pay, those at Mexico followed by Austria and Great Britain \nhad to cut a huge portion of their employees average salaries.\n\n\n>Data science professionals working in mid sized companies have taken a hit in their mean salaries. Whereas, those in small and large companies have recieved a hike.\nProfessionals working remotely had an increase in their average salary for 2020 and 2021 compared to professionals who does less than 20% of their work remotely. \nTherefore, its better to have a full time job along with part time remote work compared to completely relying on remote work.\n\n\n>Freshers and entry level professionals in Data science have opted for full time employment only which is the best option for a data science fresher in India \nas well as for any fresher around the world.\n\n\n>Again, for an Indian data scientist, irrespective of their experience level, a full time employment is the best option.\nFor an Indian fresher data science aspirant, becoming a Data Scientist would be the best choice based on salary.
