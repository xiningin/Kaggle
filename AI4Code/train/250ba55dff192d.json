This will execute the Python code contained in the cell. Executing a cell that defines a variable is important before executing or authoring a cell that depends on that previously created variable assignment.\n- **Expect to see lots of errors** the first time you load this page. \n- **Expect to see lots of errors** for all cells run without code that matches the assertion tests.\n- Until you click the blue \"Copy and Edit\" button to make your own copy, you will see an entire page of errors. This is part of the automated tests.\n- Each *assert* line is both an example and a test that tests for the presence and functionality of the instructed exercise. \n\n## The only 3 conditions that produce no errors:\n1.

For example, if the exercise instructs you to reverse a list of numbers, your job is to find the \n- Save often by clicking the blue \"Save\" button.\n- If you need to clear the output or reset the notebook, go to \"Run\" then \"Restart Session\" to clear up any error messages.\n- Do not move or alter the lines of code that contain the `assert` statements. Those are what run your solution and test its actual output vs. expected outputs.\n- Seek to understand the problem before trying to solve it. Can you explain the problem to someone else in English? Can you explain the solution in English?\n- Slow down and read any error messages you encounter. Error messages provide insight into how to resolve the error. When in doubt, put your exact error into a search engine and look for results that reference an identical or similar problem.\n\n## Get Python To Do The Work For You\nOne of the main jobs of a programming language is to help people solve problems programatically, so we don't have to do so much by hand. For example, it's easy for a person to manually reverse the list `[1, 2, 3]`, but imagine reversing a list of a million things or sorting a list of even a hundred things. When we write programmatic solutions in code, we are providing instructions to the computer to do a task. Computers follow the letter of the code, not the intent, and do exactly what they are told to do. In this way, Python can reverse a list of 3 numbers or 100 numbers or ten million numbers with the same instructions. Repetition is a key idea behind programming languages.\n\nThis means that your task with these exercises is to determine a sequence of steps that solve the problem and then find the Python code that will run those instructions. If you're sorting or reversing things by hand, you're not doing it right!\n\n## How To Discover How To Do Something in Python\n1. The first step is to make sure you know what the problem is asking.\n2. The second step is to determine, in English (or your first spoken language), what steps you need to take.\n3. Use a search engine to look for code examples to identical or similar problems.\n\nOne of the best ways to discover how to do things in Python is to use a search engine. Go to your favorite search engine and search for \"how to reverse a list in Python\" or \"how to sort a list in Python\". That's how both learners and professionals find answers and examples all the time. Search for what you want and add \"in Python\" and you'll get lots of code examples. Searching for \"How to sum a list of numbers in Python\" is a very effective way to discover exactly how to do that task.","e497ec4d":"## List Operations\n**Hint** Recommend finding and using built-in Python functionality whenever possible.","8895a6ee":"Created by [Ryan Orsinger](https:\/\/ryanorsinger.com)\n\nSource code on [https:\/\/github.com\/ryanorsinger\/101-exercises](https:\/\/github.com\/ryanorsinger\/101-exercises)\n\nProudly hosted on [Kaggle.com](https:\/\/kaggle.com\/ryanorsinger)","cdc2dd9d":"## Working with Lists of Dictionaries\n**Hint** If you need an example of lists of dictionaries, see [https:\/\/gist.github.com\/ryanorsinger\/fce8154028a924c1073eac24c7c3f409](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/ryanorsinger\/fce8154028a924c1073eac24c7c3f409)","d129fb25":"## Accessing List Elements","1c486155":"## Troubleshooting\n- If this entire document shows \"Name Error\" for many cells, it means you should read the \"Getting Started\" instructions above to make your own copy.\n- Be sure to commit your work to make save points, as you go.\n- If you load this page and you see your code but not the results of the code, be sure to run each cell (shift + Enter makes this quick)\n- \"Name Error\" means that you need to assign a variable or define the function as instructed.\n- \"Assertion Error\" means that your provided solution does not match the correct answer.\n- \"Type Error\" means that your data type provided is not accurate\n- If your kernel freezes, click on \"Run\" then select \"Restart Session\"\n- If you require additional troubleshooting assistance, click on \"Help\" and then \"Docs\" to access documentation for this platform.\n- If you have discoverd a bug or typo, please triple check your spelling then create a new issue at [https:\/\/github.com\/ryanorsinger\/101-exercises\/issues](https:\/\/github.com\/ryanorsinger\/101-exercises\/issues) to notify the author.","75664d9a":"## Getting Started\n0.
