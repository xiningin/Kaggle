This can be re-trained, however, has been trained by default for identifying topics for online data (Specifically news articles). [Github link](https:\/\/github.com\/user1342\/Pre-Trained-News-Topic_Modelling)\n\n## Installation\nInstall the library with  ```pip``` and the GitHub link.\n```\npython -m pip install git+https:\/\/github.com\/user1342\/Topic-Modelling-For-Online-Data.git\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nfrom topic_modelling.topic_modelling import topic_modelling\n\nmodeller = topic_modelling()\n\nprint(modeller.identify_topic(\"hello world\"))\nprint(modeller.get_topics())\n```\n\n### Re-training The Model\nThe number of topics, passes, and dataset (seperated by ```\\n``` with one line per article) can be defined. Topics defaults to 4, passes to 15, and the dataset defaults to a list of 22545 news articles located in the ```data``` directory of the library called ```dataset.txt```. Once retrained the new model files will be created in the libraries ```models``` folder and will be used for later use.\n\n```python\nmodeller = topic_modelling()\nmodeller.re_train(number_of_topics=4, number_of_passes=70, dataset=\"new_data.txt\")\n```\n\n### Visualising Groups\nWhen using a Jupyter Notebook you can use the ```get_lda_display``` function to return the LDA data to visualise the model.\n\n```python\nmodeller = topic_modelling()\npyLDAvis.display(modeller.get_lda_display())\n```\n## Groups\nThe model is pre-trained for 4 'news-related' groups. These group descriptions are detailed below:\n\n| Group ID | Group Description | Example Keywords                                   |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| 0        | People            | Player, People, Family, League                     |\n| 1        | Government        | President, Government, Company, National, Minister |\n| 2        | Technology        | Google, Apple, Phone, Technology, Microsoft        |\n| 3        | Residential       | Bedroom, Garden, House, Water                      |\n\n## Dataset\nThis dataset has been gathered from the global most used news websites (written in English), where they're most recent pages have been identified as news (using:  [Website-Category-Identification-Tool](https:\/\/github.com\/user1342\/Website-Category-Identification-Tool)) then these articles have been added to the dataset.\n\n- Kaggle Dataset and Kernel: www.kaggle.com\/dataset\/061b55bb510ebb7c484ef2c9ed5f5ddc474239d5952d9a75e7cc587923bec7df\n"}}
