Students ask questons on the CareerVillage.org platform and Professionals answer them. CareerVillage.org has a pretty good recommendation system inplace that's based on hard-coded rules. They would love to make it more efficient and improve it's performance. That's where you come in :)\n\nSince questions and answers are the main focus of this competition, I thought it would be helpful to join a few tables together to help get things started. This is totally not an exhaustive list of things to do and there's a lot more data to explore so go get wild!\n","e05a3700":"It's all about questions and answer and how to make proper recommendations so these tables might be a good palce to start:\n\n- questions.csv\n- answers.csv\n- professionals.csv","b06880b9":"Ok friends, there's now a table with questions, answers, and the professionals that answered them. This may or may not be helpful, I'll leave that up to you to decide!\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n","a3a448ad":"First I'll join questions and answers together. Notice that each column name is prepended with the table name. \n\n","0756bdd6":"The next thing I will do add the professionals table, because at the end of the day we'll probably need to know who answers which kinds of questions."}}
