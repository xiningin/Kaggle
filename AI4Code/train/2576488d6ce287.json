models which at best are imperfectly accurate, one has to question to validity of productionalizing this model into an actual HR department in a company. Analyzing the ROC curve which visualizes True Positivity Rate vs False Positive Rate for every threshold we can give the classifier. True Positivity Rate is that rate of truly positive results that our model predicts over the numeber of actual positive. False Positivity Rate is the number of False Positives detected over the actual number of negatives in the dataset. Our classifiers can be tuned based on a threshold so that it is less likely to either yeild false positives or false negatives, however there is a trade off. The ROC (Reciever Operator Characteristic) Curve demostrates this tradeoff. If we make some broad estimates with interpretting our results, we can see that in the best of conditions if we want to truly identify 80% of true fight risks, we would be falsely acusing 50% of our candidates. Impementing any threshold (any point on the curve) might lead to demotivating effects of the employees and consiquently make them more likely to leave your company. Thus it is my opinion that a productionalized model should not be used over traditional HR resources.\n\nUtilizing our model as a tool to extract insight, we see as was noting in the exploratory data analysis portion of the notebook city developement is by and large the most prodominant determinant. This confirms what we already know. This makes sense as a person living in a city with a low developement index logically is going to be more likely to look elsewhere for another opportunity, Additionally, it is the reason why top companies such as google locate their offices in growing cities with high levels of developement. From the visualized tree we see that if a person lives in a low developement city, they are less likely to leave if they are working in a larger company.\n\nAnother important note is that gender play absolutely no role in determining whether or not a candidate is a flight risk. Unfortunately, sexism and bias are prevelent in our society and historically a person might get overlooked for a training based on their gender. Our finding go beyond the moral arguement, to find this empirically nonsensical.

The company is offer paid training to their employees. Fortunately, many employees have signed up for these paid job trainings. However, they have been running into the situation where upon finishing a course they end up switching companies. The company would like to know whether or a candidate is going to jump ship after finishing the course. The provide dataset encapsulates a number of measured factors such as the number of the training being offered, the education level of the candidate, the developement index of the city for which the company is located, ext ... The data was collected with idea that it could posible to predict whether or not a person is going to leave the company right after completing the paid training.\n\n\nThe comprehensive goal of this brief investagation is produce a predictive model which can accurately decern whether or not a candidate is going to jump ship.

The distributions for gender across both groups who chose to stay and to those who chose to leave look nearly identical. Another key takeaway is the degree to which our data is imbalanced. Seventy two percent of candidates have relevent experience, eighty nine percent of of candidates have STEM backgrounds, and the overwhelming majority of candidates are male. Therefore, it should be necissary that we take into account this imbalance when defining our pipeline. \n\nIt should also be noted that across both gender and education levels we see that the city's level of developement plays a significant role in determining whether the participant leaves or not. This makes sense as a person living in a city with a low developement index logically is going to be more likely to look elsewhere for another opportunity, Additionally, it is the reason why top companies such as google locate their offices in growing cities with high levels of developement.
