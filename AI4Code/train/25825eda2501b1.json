Conclusion\n\nThe work described in this notebook is based on a database providing details on purchases made on an E-commerce platform over a period of one year. Each entry in the dataset describes the purchase of a product, by a particular customer and at a given date. In total, approximately $\\sim$4000 clients appear in the database. Given the available information, I decided to develop a classifier that allows to anticipate the type of purchase that a customer will make, as well as the number of visits that he will make during a year, and this from its first visit to the E-commerce site.\n\nThe first stage of this work consisted in describing the different products sold by the site, which was the subject of a first classification. There, I grouped the different products into 5 main categories of goods. In a second step, I performed a classification of the customers by analyzing their consumption habits over a period of 10 months. I have classified clients into 11 major categories based on the type of products they usually buy, the number of visits they make and the amount they spent during the 10 months. Once these categories established, I finally trained several classifiers whose objective is to be able to classify consumers in one of these 11 categories and this from their first purchase. For this, the classifier is based on 5 variables which are:\n- ** mean **: amount of the basket of the current purchase\n- ** categ_N ** with $N \\in [0: 4]$: percentage spent in product category with index $N$\n\nFinally, the quality of the predictions of the different classifiers was tested over the last two months of the dataset. The data were then processed in two steps: first, all the data was considered (ober the 2 months) to define the category to which each client belongs, and then, the classifier predictions were compared with this category assignment. I then found that 75% of clients are awarded the right classes.\nThe performance of the classifier therefore seems correct given the potential shortcomings of the current model. In particular, a bias that has not been dealt with concerns the seasonality of purchases and the fact that purchasing habits will potentially depend on the time of year (for example, Christmas ). In practice, this seasonal effect may cause the categories defined over a 10-month period to be quite different from those extrapolated from the last two months. In order to correct such bias, it would be beneficial to have data that would cover a longer period of time.\n\n","9cb7315c":"Each entry of the dataframe indicates prizes for a single kind of product. Hence, orders are split on several lines. I collect all the purchases made during a single order to recover the total order prize:","1b81b5cd":"and train it:","0e90a1a1":"___\n## 2.

Classification of customers\n\nIn this part, the objective will be to adjust a classifier that will classify consumers in the different client categories that were established in the previous section. The objective is to make this classification possible at the first visit. To fulfill this objective, I will test several classifiers implemented in `scikit-learn`. First, in order to simplify their use, I define a class that allows to interface several of the functionalities common to these different classifiers: ","3f5c40bb":"** d \/ _Customers morphology_ **\n\nFinally, I created a representation of the different morphotypes.

In this section, I intend to use the content of this latter variable in order to group the products into different categories.\n\n___\n### 3.1 Products Description\n\nAs a first step, I extract from the **Description** variable the information that will prove useful. To do this, I use the following function:","1c9f60eb":"\n** a \/ _Silhouette intra-cluster score_ **\n\nIn order to have an insight on the quality of the classification, we can represent the silhouette scores of each element of the different clusters.

Note that the **kmeans** method of sklearn uses a Euclidean distance that can be used, but it is not to the best choice in the case of categorical variables. However, in order to use the Hamming's metric, we need to use the [kmodes](https:\/\/pypi.python.org\/pypi\/kmodes\/) package which is not available on the current plateform. Hence, I use the **kmeans** method even if this is not the best choice.\n\nIn order to define (approximately) the number of clusters that best represents the data, I use the silhouette score:","f9a0f9c8":"Then, I load the data.

Here, we prepare the test data by defining the category to which the customers belong. However, this definition uses data obtained over a period of 2 months (via the variables ** count **, ** min **, ** max ** and ** sum **). The classifier defined in Section 5 uses a more restricted set of variables that will be defined from the first purchase of a client.\n\nHere it is a question of using the available data over a period of two months and using this data to define the category to which the customers belong. Then, the classifier can be tested by comparing its predictions with these categories. In order to define the category to which the clients belong, I recall the instance of the `kmeans` method used in section 4.

So I delete them from the dataframe:","604ece2f":"We note that the number of cancellations is quite large ($\\sim$16% of the total number of transactions).\nNow, let's look at the first lines of the dataframe:","bc20a5fb":"I check the number of elements in every class:","7e4434d3":"   \n|   | mot 1  |  ...  | mot j  | ...  | mot N  |\n|:-:|---|---|---|---|---|\n| produit 1  | $a_{1,1}$  |     |   |   | $a_{1,N}$  |\n| ...        |            |     | ...  |   |   |\n|produit i   |    ...     |     | $a_{i,j}$    |   | ...  |\n|...         |            |     |  ... |   |   |\n| produit M  | $a_{M,1}$  |     |   |   | $a_{M,N}$   |","2b90529a":"___\n#### 4.2.2 Creation of customer categories","2a7f666b":"Up to now, the information related to a single order was split over several lines of the dataframe (one line per product).

I therefore create a new dataframe that contains, for each order, the amount of the basket, as well as the way it is distributed over the 5 categories of products:","27bf4400":"In the following, I will create clusters of customers. In practice, before creating these clusters, it is interesting to define a base of smaller dimension allowing to describe the `scaled_matrix` matrix. In this case, I will use this base in order to create a representation of the different clusters and thus verify the quality of the separation of the different groups. I therefore perform a PCA beforehand:","1622e61d":"and then check for the amount of variance explained by each component:","d0eef299":"We see that the quantity canceled is greater than the sum of the previous purchases.\n___\n#### 2.2.2 StockCode\n\nAbove, it has been seen that some values of the ** StockCode ** variable indicate a particular transaction (i.e. D for _Discount_).

It remains to understand the habits of the customers in each cluster. To do so, I start by adding to the `selected_customers` dataframe a variable that defines the cluster to which each client belongs:","7085f88b":"Then, I define a classifier that merges the results of the various classifiers:","2cfb4ef0":"and I output the result as wordclouds:","8f08c943":"In order to have a global view of the type of order performed in this dataset, I determine how the purchases are divided according to total prizes:","0f4121f1":"___\n###\u00a04.2 Creation of customers categories","da717ab1":"The execution of this function returns three variables:\n- `keywords`: the list of extracted keywords\n- `keywords_roots`: a dictionary where the keys are the keywords roots and the values are the lists of words associated with those roots\n- `count_keywords`: dictionary listing the number of times every word is used\n\nAt this point, I convert the `count_keywords` dictionary into a list, to sort the keywords according to their occurences:","a6a6e861":"and to choose the appropriate ranges, I check the number of products in the different groups:","05f9f211":"___\n#### 5.1.1 Confusion matrix\n\nThe accuracy of the results seems to be correct. Nevertheless, let us remember that when the different classes were defined, there was an imbalance in size between the classes obtained. In particular, one class contains around 40% of the clients. It is therefore interesting to look at how the predictions and real values compare to the breasts of the different classes. This is the subject of the confusion matrices and to represent them, I use the code of the [sklearn documentation](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/model_selection\/plot_confusion_matrix.html):","ba24cff2":"OK, therefore, by removing these entries we end up with a dataframe filled at 100% for all variables!

This can be achieved by selecting the customer category as the one indicated by the majority of classifiers. To do this, I use the `VotingClassifier` method of the `sklearn` package. As a first step, I adjust the parameters of the various classifiers using the *best* parameters previously found:","50e3d00d":"A customer category of particular interest is that of customers who make only one purchase. One of the objectives may be, for example, to target these customers in order to retain them. In part, I find that this type of customer represents 1\/3 of the customers listed:","1dc2f12a":"In a first step, I regroup reformattes these data according to the same procedure as used on the training set.

At first, I use the result of the PCA:","b34582bc":"In practice, the scores obtained above can be considered equivalent since, depending on the run, scores of $ 0.1 \\pm 0.05 $ will be obtained for all clusters with `n_clusters` $> $ 3 (we obtain slightly lower scores for the first cluster). On the other hand, I found that beyond 5 clusters, some clusters contained very few elements. I therefore choose to separate the dataset into 5 clusters. In order to ensure a good classification at every run of the notebook, I iterate untill we obtain the best possible silhouette score, which is, in the present case, around 0.15:","25e4f7f7":"The list that was obtained contains more than 1400 keywords and the most frequent ones appear in more than 200 products. However, while examinating the content of the list, I note that some names are useless. Others are do not carry information, like colors. Therefore, I discard these words from the analysis that follows and also, I decide to consider only the words that appear more than 13 times.","91f9a818":"then I can test the quality of the prediction with respect to the test data:","a57c7d2b":"It can be seen that the data concern 4372 users and that they bought 3684 different products. The total number of transactions carried out is of the order of $\\sim$22'000.\n\nNow I will determine the number of products purchased in every transaction:","9244aba3":"Then, I plot the learning curve to have a feeling of the quality of the model:","611af5b2":"From this representation, we can see that for example, one of the clusters contains objects that could be associated with gifts (keywords: Christmas, packaging, card, ...). Another cluster would rather contain luxury items and jewelry (keywords: necklace, bracelet, lace, silver, ...). Nevertheless, it can also be observed that many words appear in various clusters and it is therefore difficult to clearly distinguish them.\n\n** c \/ _Principal Component Analysis_ **\n\nIn order to ensure that these clusters are truly distinct, I look at their composition. Given the large number of variables of the initial matrix, I first perform a PCA:","6c744781":"and show the result on a chloropleth map:","d967947a":"# Customer segmentation\n\n\nThis notebook aims at analyzing the content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by $\\sim$4000 customers over a period of one year (from 2010\/12\/01 to 2011\/12\/09). Based on this analysis, I develop a model that allows to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year and this, from its first purchase. <br>\n\n___\n**Acknowledgement**: many thanks to [J.

In particular, this type of curves allow to detect possible drawbacks in the model, linked for example to over- or under-fitting.

In order to draw this curve, I use the [scikit-learn documentation code again](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/model_selection\/plot_learning_curve.html#sphx-glr- self-examples-model-selection-pad-learning-curve-py)","82950f6b":"____\n#### 4.1.3 Consumer Order Combinations\n\nIn a second step, I group together the different entries that correspond to the same user.
