The customer can be practically any number of premiums late which is impossible to find out. So it'd be better if I assume he\/she is 0 premium late.

The customer who earns around 5 crore a month pays 20% premium by cash or credit card.\n5. The customer who earns over 3 crore a month pays 50% premium by cash or credit card.\n6.

This means the data of this column has a symmetric distribution. Same is true for the 3rd column 'age_in_days'. While for the 2nd column 'perc_premium_paid_by_cash' the mean is 0.314288 and median is 0.167000. This difference tells that the data distribution is not symmetric for this column. So I'll explore this column data and all other columns(like 'income', all 3 'count' columns, etc) that represent such unequal data symmetry via plots. Plus, the statistics shown above can be visualized by the help of boxplots. A **boxplot** shows the minimum value, 1st Quartile, median value, 3rd Quartile & the maximum value of a variable. Beyond the minimum and maximum values on the boxplot, we have outliers. These outliers are unusually small or large values in the dataset. These can arise due to the following errors:\n\n1. Data entry errors\n2. Measurement errors\n3. Processing errors\n4. Change in the underlying population.","11f35485":"One thing is clear from above 3 plots though that the customers who earn more than Rs 4 lakh a month have been paying their premiums on time.

The 50% is the **50th percentile** & it is called the **2nd Quartile**.

For example:\n\n* The 'target' and 'id' variables\/columns have a correlation coefficient of -0.0051.

This strength is very weak.\n* The 'target' & 'perc_premium_paid_by_cash_credit' variables have a correlation coefficient of -0.24. This means they are also negatively correlated but by a strength of 0.24. Although this strength too is weak but it is comparatively stronger than the previous pair.\n*  Negative correlation coefficient means when the value of one variable increases the value of the other one decreases. While positive correlation coefficient means when value of one variable increases the value of other variable also increases.\n* 'target' and 'age_in_days' are positively correlated by a weak strength of 0.095.\n* It is clear that the strongest strength between target & any other variable is of 0.29 units only. This is a negative correlation between 'target' & 'Count_more_than_12_months_late' columns. This means the more the value of 'count' a customer has, the less he's going to a '1' in his target column.
