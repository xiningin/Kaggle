Instead, you, or a domain expert, must interpret the raw observations and decide whether a value is an outlier or not. Nevertheless, we can use statistical methods to identify observations that appear to be rare or unlikely given the available data. We will assume that outliers are only to be found in temperature measuraments. From the plots above we can see there are some points that fall far out of the normal one or two points standard deviation. With three we should be certain that it is an outlier and that is why we should remove it. Alternatively we can also say that standard deviation is heavily influenced with the outliers. To remedy that I also implemented a an IQR (inter quartile range) method that removes all values that fall below or above IQR (which is Q1-Q3). With these two relatively simple methods we should be able to recognize most of the outliers. Qualitative examination would also be beneficial (and they were since we had couple of very hot days in winter ;)), along with other more advanced techniques.\n\nThen I tested it and IQR method was not very effiecent even with high koefficients, so I stuck with std method. I tried different values, and it seems that with std2 that is koefficient of 1.8*std removes most of the outliers.\nFor the missing values I just interpolated the missing values (standard imputation technique). But inspecting the data I see that there some values that are 40 degrees in winter (in temp_14columns). So we also need to make sure that these are also gone, since they are definitely an outlier. So I located these valus and set them to NaN then i interpolated all of the NaN with polynomial interpolation.\n\n\n\n","a91e26b5":"#### Explanation of our own strategy","57b2a359":"\nBefore we evan start discussing missing values imputation, we need to define the scope of a definition missing values. Is it just NaN, can it be 0 or 999 or some other value? For that we ought to plot the variables and check our usual suspects. Other tactic would also be to ask meterologist. It can happen that for example humidity readings machine gives 999 when in defect. Let us assume we are only dealing with NaN.\n\nweather.dropna()-quickest and dumbest solution. We will lose a lot of data. Makes sense if number of missing values is small. But evan than we should use our brains.\n\n\nweather.fillna(method='pad') \nweather.fillna(method='bfill') Foreward, backward filling. It is reasonable. Data point in previous or next step should also be the one missing. It is robust in the sense that we do not have to make any assumptions about the data. Imputation works best when many variables are missing in small proportions. The power boost is much less impressive when one important variable is missing in 70% of cases, because the uncertainty in estimates will yield highly varying imputed datasets.\n\n\nweather = weather.fillna(weather.mean()) Mean is prone to outliers, and imputation would fail. It also reduces the variance in the data. We could opt for median to avoid outliers. Assumptions for pad and bfill also hold for this imputation\n\n\nweather = df.weather(method='linear') or polynomial of higher order would also make sense, at the end we are finding a function that dsecribes our data (column). But we will not be able to generalise, over-fitting.\n\nmodel for NaN- same story it would be in most cases the perfect solution to handle missing values. But we are giving up a few things. OVerfitting,time,simplicity to name a few.\n\n\nLastly for MAR (humidity) we will be using Multiple Imputation using MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations).\nBasic idea is that we are going to run multiple regression models and each missing value is modeled conditionally depending on the observed (non-missing) values, andthen average it over the number of regressions. Papers show that this ought to be the best solution for MAR-data. We are going to use neat package called fancyimpute. There we could have used kNN (Which also very reasonable) to imputata. Please note that it works only on numpy array, so we need to convert back and fort!\n","de1bf831":"\nStrategy is as follows (general one) We got some pointers on where and what type of missing variables are in certain columns. But there are much more missing values than that. We need to check each column(variable) individually and than depending on the findings (amount of missing data, where are they missing, the variable) we will perform the optimal imputing.\n\nLet us start with no missing data-columns, How do we check ? For example, for the daily maximal temperature we would do (I deleted these cells) data_weather[data_weather['temp_dailyMax'].isnull()] \"temp_dailyMean\", 'temp_dailyMin', 'temp_minGround', 'hum_dailyMean', \"hum_dailyMean\" columns have no missing values. Let us check for data_weather[data_weather['temp_7h'].isnull()] there are some missing values and they seem to be rather randomly scattered. Taking that into account we are going to use simple backwardfill here. Analog for 'temp_14h' and 'temp_19h'.\nLet us move further on. 'wind_mSec' has only 7 missing values in all of the 7 years. Simple interpolate() ought to do the trick.\n'wind_degrees' is the interesting one. There a couple of missing values in the beginning but in the last year we observe that data is missing for whole months at a part. Logically we ought to do simple interpolate() for the few values that are missing in the beginning and than just copy the months from previous year (2017) or any other year for that matter. We only need to find the row indices of the previous year months and than replace it with the missing values in 2018. Finally 'skyCover_14h','skyCover_19h','skyCover_7h','sun_hours' are all missing values at the same time (just a few of them) once again I opt for simple interpolate().\n\nTemperature is MCAR\nThe missing wind speed readings is MNAR\nMissing humidity readings MAR. If we compare given and the alternative definitions following tactics would be reasonable choices.\n\nFor Temperature, independent what the time of the year is temperature should be close to the previous day\/following day. So backward fill seams reasonable.\n\nWind i described above, but it depends on what wind column exactly.\n\nHumidity NaNs (there are 3 columns in regard to humidity) could be removed with a machine learning model. We already now that temperature is a independent variable, we could also test whether other variables have predictive power and do a regression. But after consulting online it seems that Multiple imputation with MICE is the best option, that is why I wanted to use that. Unfortunately I did not manage to install the library fancyimputer, so I opted for polynomial interpolation (\"piecewise_poly\") there I hope that polynomial function will catch trends and predict\/imputate missing values.\n\n","df683c95":"**Columns** Are really standard ones, humidtiy measured every 7,14 and 21 hours, wind speed, temperature and other weather specific indicators taken at different times of the day","f67dcc8d":"## Merging influenza and weather datasets","b80e235d":"If you take a closer look at some of the observations, you should notice that some of the temperature values are not particularly plausible ","37ba7213":"**If you benefited in any way please upvote :)**","93c200df":"## Findings ans lessons learned:\n","667a35f6":"Merge the `data_weather_weekly` and `data_influenza` datasets.","48d3452e":"## Aggregate values \n\nAggregation of the observations on a weekly basis.

Than I extracted the 2018 data which is our test data(y_2018,X_2018). And with help of train_test from sklearn I created training and validation sets (X_train,X_test)\n\n\nFirst model---NN. Started of with manually checking the hyperparameters-of course very bad tactic but atleast I got a feeling of the hyperparameters. Then I implemented a grid search for neural network. Time expensive! I commented the code out because it takes way to long. Results? Training set (in-sample error: 0.17964286018957273  Validation set:0.18736383060332323  Test set (out-of sample error): 0.27193468030735335\nNothing special! We should definately find better parameters. LEt us now try 70 30 split . The results are 0.23348722898699353 0.24321321252264558 0.3280610208183715 respectively. Now that is already better and 80\/20 : 0.21209512149397639 0.22662413117187602 0.3066506555408157. I have to be honest I was suprised, but it just goes to show case the difference in using different splits when training. NN had more data to learn on (with 80\/20, but 70\/30 was not efficient), hence it had better results. NOTE: For neural networks is seems to be impossible to achieve absolute reproducibility. I understand that randomness comes from 2 sources. First of all when I use cross validation train_test_split function but there I defined random_state=42. Another source is the initialisation of the weights. Every time it is going to be different. I tried to tackle that on 2 ways: \n\n\nfrom numpy.random import seed\n\nseed(1)\n\nfrom tensorflow import set_random_seed\n\nset_random_seed(1)\n\nand\n\nkeras.initializers.RandomUniform(minval=-0.05, maxval=0.05, seed=123)\n\n\nWhat I did achieve is that the variability(reproducability) was smaller but it was not perfekt as with random forest. There I can achieve same results with every run, (even tough there is internal randomness in the RF algorithm itself) So I know it has something to do with NN. Luckily for me RF gives much better and stable results and that is mine final solution, but I spend to much time on NN just to throw it away.\n\n\n\n\nSecond model---random forest---RF  Than I tried to implement another tactic namely randomized search(for Hyperparameter tuning but this time random forest instead of NN. Then the process is straight foreward, I experimented a bit to know which parameters are good (low RMSE) and than I used this knowledge to built interval of parameters that I gave to the randomizedsearchCV. Eventually I do find better parameters (and actually a better model, RF outperforms NN) And the results are as follows:\nRandom forest on mine trial-and error hyperparameters validation set: 0.15017251130121254\n\n and test data (2018 data) RMSE: 0.1941060627117721 now when I used randomized search I get following results: RMSE on validation data set: 0.11813299983524722\n\nand RMSE on test data set (2018)  0.15562591092506128\n\nObviously we can see that new parameters perform better on 2018 (what we would hope for)\n\n\n\n","1793d261":"\n\n<span style=\"color:blue\">**Findings:**<\/span> There is not much to say here other than we confirmed quantitively what was already familiar, namely there is more flu in winter time, temperature, humidity and other factors influence\/are connected in certain ways to the outcome of the epidemy.

Trial and error wont work and we need to have more quantitative approach, like randomized-search. Grid search is out of the question until we get quant computers (run-time is awfull). Problems with reproducibility of NN, making the same initial weights for the artificial neural network is pretty hard. How can we implement randomized search for random forests. Different imputation techniques and also to think qualitatively and inspect the data, not only blindly apply the techniques(thats how I found out that some of the outliers in winter were deliberately set to 40, have I only applied those two techniques with standard deviation or inter-quartile range, I would have missed it!). Furthermore what are some interesting aggregation measures that we can introduce to our dataset(feature engineering, we can potentially get a better prediction if we make the features ourselves).
