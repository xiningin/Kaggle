Senior kagglers with Master and Doctoral degrees who crossed the *akme age* line (that is, those who are of the age of 45-49 and older) constitute the 'golden pool' of experts here in Kaggle platform. It could make sense to better engage with them to motivate them to do more knowledge sharing with and possibly other training activities for more junior population of Kagglers.\n2. Ethical standards conduct across various activities on the platform (otherwise known as 'ethical kaggling') could be one of the pillars to keep Senior-level expertswilling to contribute to the body of knowledge here at Kaggle more. Conversly, the lack of 'ethical kaggling' may discourage them from being active on the platform.\n3. Since the majority of Kagglers are quite junior, one of their motivations is to prove their competencies\/expertise as well as stand out of the crowd. Some of them are yet to get their heads around the concept of 'ethical kaggling' (see the discussion threads like https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/discussion\/206639 and similar).\n4. Propaganda and some sort of control of conducting the 'ethical kaggling' practices can be benefitial for the Kaggle community to sustain in the long run. It will also help to better motivate the top senior-level experts to share their knowledge and wisdom with junior generations.","ce126d7a":"## Using Auto ML Tools By Purpose and User Occupation","50cfc197":"### Female Kagglers","4062a802":"## Kaggle vs. Colab Usage","b87c7479":"## IDE Preferences\n\nIn https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dwin183287\/kagglers-seen-by-continents, the following basic findings about IDE preferences have been discovered\n\n- Jupyter is the most used IDE for Kagglers around the world.\n- Though VSCode is the 2nd most used IDE in the world, it still has a very big gap compared to Jupyter.\n- The third place is varies among the continents with most of Kagglers choose PyCharm except for America and Australia which prefer RStudio compared to PyCharm.\n- R is ranked as the 3rd highest languange in all continents (except in Asia), but RStudio is not as popular as R itself in Europe, Others and Africa.
