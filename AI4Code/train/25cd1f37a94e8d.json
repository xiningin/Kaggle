So, in its simplest sense, pulmonary fibrosis (PF) means scarring in the lungs. Over time, the scar tissue can destroy the normal lung and make it hard for oxygen to get into your blood. Low oxygen levels (and the stiff scar tissue itself) can cause you to feel short of breath, particularly when walking and exercising. Pulmonary fibrosis isn\u2019t just one disease. It is a family of more than 200 different lung diseases that all look very much alike. The PF family of lung diseases falls into an even larger group of diseases called the interstitial lung diseases (also known as ILD), which includes all of the diseases that have inflammation and\/or scarring in the lung. Some interstitial lung diseases don\u2019t include scar tissue. When an interstitial lung disease does include scar tissue in the lung, we call it pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n**Ideopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis occurs when no cause of the disease can be identified** \n\nSource \"https:\/\/www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org\/life-with-pf\/about-pf\"","5b8c33f6":"**This is surprising because the category of smoker that has the highest FCV currently smoke.**\n* Lets look to see and see if there is any information we can gleam more insight into the smoking categories.\n","d84dd64a":"While the average age of each smoking status very similar we can see that the distribution for each group is slighly different.\n* Current smokers is slghtly skewed more negativly vs the other two groups.\n"}}
