Visualizing the data is also a very important step because it makes it easier for a lot of people to understand the data and detect patterns, trends and outliers. K-means clustering algorithm (which found a strong structure in our dataset) was easy to implement in this case, since we had some domain knowledge that told us the number of suicides committed by people in different countries, so we didn't have to pre-specify the number of clusters(k). However, this doesn't always happen that way. As for suicides and factors that influence them one can say while age and gender can be some of those factors, Gdp and Hdi not really, because even in countries with high Gdp and Hdi a lot of people commit suicide. Other than that, there's not enough data available for better analysis, as there are other biological, psychological and social factors that may cause suicides (race, ethnicity, social isolation, contagion, religion, etc.), as well as geographical (climate)<\/font>"}}
