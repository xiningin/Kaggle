Because of that you may want to select the precision\/recall tradeoff before that.\n+ You are now able to choose a threshold, that gives you the best precision\/recall tradeoff for your current machine learning problem. If you want for example a precision of 80%, you can easily look at the plots and see that you would need a threshold of around 0.4. Then you could train a model with exactly that threshold and would get the desired accuracy.\n\nAnother way is to plot the precision and recall against each other:","7743da41":"+ Over 72% of the passengers embarked from the port \u2018Southampton\u2019, 18% from the port \u2018Cherbourg\u2019 and the rest from the port \u2018Queenstown\u2019.\n+ Passengers from port \u2018Southampton\u2019 have a low survival rate of 34%, while those from the port \u2018Cherbourg\u2019 have a survival rate of 55%.","9d986686":"# ROC AUC Curve\nAnother way to evaluate and compare your binary classifier is provided by the ROC AUC Curve. This curve plots the true positive rate (also called recall) against the false positive rate (ratio of incorrectly classified negative instances), instead of plotting the precision versus the recall.\n\n+ The red line in the middel represents a purely random classifier (e.g a coin flip) and therefore your classifier should be as far away from it as possible. Our  model seems to do a good job.\n+ We also have a tradeoff here, because the classifier produces more false positives, the higher the true positive rate is.\n\n# ROC AUC Score\n+ The ROC AUC Score is the corresponding score to the ROC AUC Curve. It is simply computed by measuring the area under the curve, which is called AUC.\n+ A classifiers that is 100% correct, would have a ROC AUC Score of 1 and a completely random classiffier would have a score of 0.5.","695025b3":"# ML Modelling","572884e2":"The Embarked feature has only 2 missing values, which can easily be filled.
