This can be done using some feature selection method or feature projection method.  \nLet us demonstrate each of these approaches.\n* We can select a Feature selection method : RFE (Recursive feature elimination)\n* We select a feature projection method : PCA (Principle Component Analysis)  \nTo use PCA, our data must be standardized, and should not have outliers. Our data satisfies these requirements.\n\nLet's investigate PCA briefly. We will compute the principle components for the training feature subset...  \nLets look at the shape of `X_train2`, and lets also look at the explained variance per PC graphically:","104f5317":"Great!  \nWe have a lot of data available to us all wrapped in 'inner' and 'outer'\n\n\n# Visualize\nNow we may ask ourselves:  \nWhat types of analysis \/checks can I do with the scores that I get from the outer K folds?  \n3 checks that we can do that will provide us with insight:  \n* 1  LEARNING CURVE  \ncheck for stability of the predictions (use iterated\/repeated cross-validation)\n{if we use a learning curve to do this, we can also see the effect of number of\ntraining samples on performance.}\n* 2 VALIDATION CURVE  \ncheck for the stability\/variation of the optimized hyper-parameters.\nFor one thing, wildly scattering hyper-parameters may indicate that the inner optimization\ndidn't work. For another thing, this may allow you to decide on the hyperparameters without\nthe costly optimization step in similar situations in the future. With costly I do not refer\nto computational resources but to the fact that this \"costs\" information that may better be\nused for estimating the \"normal\" model parameters.\n* 3 INNER VS OUTER LOOP  \ncheck for the difference between the inner and outer estimate of the chosen model.\nIf there is a large difference (the inner being very overoptimistic), there is a risk that\nthe inner optimization didn't work well because of overfitting.  \n\nLets look at the simplest check first: check 3","7af75e54":"We see significant variation in performance for `n_components`.  \n\nWhat value does this add to our investigation?  \nFrom the validation curves, we can summize that next time we dont really need to tune `C`. but we have to tune `n_components`. we also observe that the hyper-parameters do not scatter wildly, the curve is smooth, so the inner CV provided a good estimation of hyper-parameter effects.  \n\n\nSo for the logit (Logistic Regression) estimator, we have created and compared pipelines 1 and 2, and we have explored the best model of `pipe2`.  \nLets save the best logit-based model as `best_logit`:","be64732f":"Yes it is boolean. Good.  \nNext we will split `X` and `y` into new sets. The train:test ratio shall be 80:20.","5effb16e":"Clearly our ranges are completely different across quantitative variables. Furthermore, the features (except maybe `Age`) do not resemble a normal distribution, so we have established the need to transforms.  \n\nLets also look at the boxplots:","6a584692":"# Model selection: Pipeline\nIn our pipeline we want to include:\n* Feature Normalizer transform : QuantileTransformer\n* Feature Scaler transform  : standardScaler\n* Dimensionality reduction  : RFE or PCA\n* Estimator  : test multiple\n\nFirst, we will define a function that returns an estimator and its parameter distributions.  \nFor example, the following function requires only an input like `logit` and the y_train data to return a Logistic Regression classfier and parameter distributions that we can search over when we want to optimize it.  \n\nNext, we declare a function where we can specify which estimator we want to use. The function creates 2 full pipelines for this estimator, one using RFE, and one using PCA.  \n\nLets try this out!  \nWe will make a pipeline for logit model (using`idx = 0`):","f310e3e2":"* 'Inner' contains many models. Lets print the index of the best model","d549676c":"Now lets evaluate pipelines with other estimators:\n\n### knc (k-nearest neighbours classifier):\nNote that `pipe1` fails because RFE wont work with knc since the knc does not expose \"coef_\" or \"feature_importances_\" attributes.","fbcaf7a9":"These features have very different means and standard deviations - this clearly needs standardization.   \nIdeally our data should be normally distributed.
