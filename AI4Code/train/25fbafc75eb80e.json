Studies have found that senior citizens that regularly do charity\/generousity work typically lived long life and said that they were happier. However for this data set there didn't appear to be a strong corelation between happiness and generousity.","665b6633":"**Is happiness getting what we don't have ?**\n\nFor my analysis I wanted to look at the premise of \"Happiness can be gained from something we don't have\".\n\nIf you do a quick check of the top 20 countries that think freedom or money is important to happiness. You'll see it's the countries that don't have a lot of freedom or money that rate these items highly important to happiness. "}}
