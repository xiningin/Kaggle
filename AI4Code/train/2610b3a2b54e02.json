Analyzing the below heat map, it can be observed that majority of schools (about 50%) service between Pre-KinderGarden\/Kindergarden and 5th grade. Also, many schools (about 20%) service from 6th grade to 8th grade.\n","47be7b39":"Q. Which are the cities with high number of schools?                                                                                     \nA. The below count plot shows \"Brooklyn city\" having highest number of schools (>400). After Brooklyn, Bronx and New York are the cities with high number of schools (> 200)","8b2d0a02":"Q. Are the students underachieving or meeting their targets? Similarly, how is the trust rating among the schools?\n\nA.i) Looking at the below count plots of Student Achievement Rating and Trust Rating, majority school's (about 50%) students are meeting their targets. Only a very small fraction of students not meeting their targets.                       \nii) If we observe the countplot of Trust rating, most of the schools (>75%) are either meeting their trust targets or exceeding them. Only a very small fraction of schools are not meeting their trust targets.","2948f945":"Q. Is school income dependent on economic need?                                                                       \nAns. The below scatter plot clearly shows direct (inverse) relationship between school income and economic need. Except for a few outlier scenarios, higher the economic need index, lower is the school income estimate. (corelation = -.89)","a9fcdbd2":"Q. Is chronic absence among schools related to the community?\n\nA. If we observe below joint plots, more the number of asian and white community people in the school, less is the chronic absence in such schools. Schools with high number of black and hispanic community people are found to be having high chronic absence.\n","357afcf0":"    Q. Is there any relationship between Collaborative Teachers, Supportive Environment and Trust?     \n    A. Below pairplot shows the relationship among the three. There is a direct relation among them. Higher the Collarborative Teachers, higher is the Supportive Environment and higher is the Trust and vice versa.","45f62663":"Q. Compare average ELA proficiency among the schools with average Math proficiency.                          \n\n\n\nA. Looking at the below KDE plot, it appears that average Math proficiency among schools is higher than average ELA proficiency. Majority of schools have average ELA proficiency between 2 and 3 while average Math proficiency is between 2 and 3.5","f0e60a4d":"Importing CSV into a data frame and plotting the scatter plot"}}
