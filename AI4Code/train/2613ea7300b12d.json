There is no only English titles but Indonesian as well as we might expected.

Please, state your thoughts on the comment section as well. \n\n* So, first thing that I noticed here is the **diversity** both in the images and the texts. Some of the images seems to be taken at home, some of them seems to be a bit more professional, some of them are just catalog images. Also there are some texts on the images as well. Our models should be robust to that diversity in the images.\n\n* Second thing to notice is titles of the images. They also seem to be diverse. They mostly include the brand of the product, but there is no particular format. Careful preprocessing would bring additional improvements here. \n\nNow, let's visualize some of the images from the other tail of the line:","693c3e29":"Hi everyone, \n\nIn this notebook we will explore the Shopee Dataset with simple visualizations.

So any image that belongs to the same group will be considered as the same product. We will also visualize and explore those images later in the notebook.","622a8796":"# To Be Continued...","fd3df343":"<img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-competitions\/kaggle\/24286\/logos\/header.png?t=2021-01-07-16-57-37\" style=\"width:80%;\">\n\nDo you scan online retailers in search of the best deals? You're joined by the many savvy shoppers who don't like paying extra for the same product depending on where they shop. Retail companies use a variety of methods to assure customers that their products are the cheapest. Among them is product matching, which allows a company to offer products at rates that are competitive to the same product sold by another retailer. To perform these matches automatically requires a thorough machine learning approach, which is where your data science skills could help.\n\nTwo different images of similar wares may represent the same product or two completely different items. Retailers want to avoid misrepresentations and other issues that could come from conflating two dissimilar products. Currently, a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning analyzes image and text information to compare similarity. But major differences in images, titles, and product descriptions prevent these methods from being entirely effective.\n\nShopee is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Customers appreciate its easy, secure, and fast online shopping experience tailored to their region. The company also provides strong payment and logistical support along with a 'Lowest Price Guaranteed' feature on thousands of Shopee's listed products.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll apply your machine learning skills to build a model that predicts which items are the same products.\n\nThe applications go far beyond Shopee or other retailers. Your contributions to product matching could support more accurate product categorization and uncover marketplace spam. Customers will benefit from more accurate listings of the same or similar products as they shop. Perhaps most importantly, this will aid you and your fellow shoppers in your hunt for the very best deals.","ae11a596":"# Let's start with the imports","6fd3d6d7":"# Reading the files","8b78799f":"Let's check out the statistics about the grouped images (by length):"}}
