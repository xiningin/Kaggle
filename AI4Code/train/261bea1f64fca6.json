McLaughlin and Amir Vera, CNN\n\nAn influential coronavirus model cited by the White House predicts the pandemic will \"peter out\" in May, but experts are wary about its assumption that there will be no resurgence of the virus in the summer months.\n\nThe model, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, was created by Dr. Christopher Murray, who told CNN Monday the country can essentially stop coronavirus transmission this summer.\n\nAccording to Murray's model, Monday was the peak day for daily deaths in the United States. It projected about 2,150 Covid-19 deaths Monday, which are expected to decline moving forward.\n\nNew York, one of the hotspots for the virus, hit its peak number of deaths three days ago, according to the model, but hundreds of deaths are still expected daily for the coming week.\n\nBy August, the model predicts, a total of 68,841 people will have died in the United States, which is up from Friday's projection of 61,500 deaths.\n\nThe University of Washington model release coincides with the White House's desire to \"reopen\" the country soon now that the number of new cases has declined over two consecutive days, but experts warn that in the United States' coronavirus fight, different states will see different peaks.https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2020\/04\/13\/health\/us-coronavirus-updates-monday\/index.html","57974cbe":"thegreatcoursesplus.com","30960b9d":"#Codes from Zhenyu https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/zhenyufan\/nlp-for-yelp-reviews\/notebook","f4d7b78f":"Something went wrong here and obviouly I don't know how to fix it.","c9ccfe3b":"ML without TF-IDF","a880e3d7":"datarobot.com"}}
