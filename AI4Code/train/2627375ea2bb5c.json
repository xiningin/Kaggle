Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.\n\nIf the reason is explanation #1 above, does that affect your trust in the model you build with this data?

To ensure you can apply these techniques on your own, you will have to apply them to a new dataset (with house prices from Iowa).\n\nThe exercises use a \"notebook\" coding environment.
