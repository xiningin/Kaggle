Import the libraries","f9348f92":"### 7. Dataset and DataLoader\n\nWe use Data Loaders because sometimes the datasets can have upto millions of records which may eventually lead to enormous size of those datasets and hence they are generally very difficult to load in memoty all at once. Due to the limited available memory space, we use a technique called batching. Batching is simply accessing records from such huge datasets in `batches` and not all at once.\n\nFor example, Let's suppose you have 1000 records in a dataset and you want to apply batching on this dataset. So, if you set the batch size to 200, your model will first be trained on the first set of 200 records in 1 iteration of the feedforward network. Then, it will train on the next set of records and so on. So, it will essentially take 5 iterations for the whole dataset to be passed through the feed forward network.\n\nJust to clear things:\n\n**batch**: Small set of the larger dataset\n\n**iteration**: 1 `batch` going from the input layer to the output layer is said to complete one iteration\n\n**epochs**: When every record of the dataset is passed through the network, then the network is said to have finised 1 `epoch`\n\nNow, the MNIST dataset isn't that large that we have to use dataloader, but since it's a general practice to load the data in batches, so, I am going to implement using dataloader.\n\nHead to PyTorch's official documentation on Dataset class, DataLoader and Transforms to know more about the same: https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/beginner\/data_loading_tutorial.html\n\nNow we will make our dataset using TensorDataset class and would set the batch size to be `100`.\n\nThen with the help of DataLoader class, that will provide an iterable over our dataset, we will make our `train_loader` and `test_loader`. The shuffle paramtere is set to true in order to specify that the records in a particular batch needs to be randomly selected from the whole dataset and not select in their original sequence as they appear.","daca1275":"**Q. Why these many layers? Why not less or more?**\n\nA. Choosing the number of layers is up to the network designer (you). It's with hit and trial that you develop an intiution of how many layers (or neurons) a particular problem may require to get to the desired solution. You can play with the number of layers and neurons (numbers like 128, 224 etc) and see how the network is responsding to your changes.\n\n**Q. What does Conv2d(1, 128, 5) actually mean?**\n\nA. Conv2d() is a function that helps create a convolution layer. The three paramteres mentioned (in order) are: input_channels, output_channels and kernel_size.\n\n**input_channels:** input_channels refers to the number of channels the input has. If our dataset contained colored images, this argument would have been equal to 3. But our dataset contains only the black and white pictures (more generally called as the grayscale images), so a grayscale images have only 1 channel. Hence the argument is equal to 1.\n\n**output_channels:** output_channels is arbitrary number and can be set to any number you want. It basically sets the number of neurons that its input_channels would be connected to. It also sets the input_channels of the next convolution layer. So, `output_channel (previous layer) = input_channel (next layer)`\n\n**kernel_size:** kernel_size is a square matrix of a particular width and height. When we set the third parameter to 5, it basically means we are setting the square kernel of size 5 x 5. A kernel can be thought of as a window (matrix) that slides over our image to extract certain features out of it in order to learn. That's why kernels are also called as feature maps.\n\nThere's anther parameter that we haven't explicitly defined but by default is set to 1, and that is '**stride**'. A stride means by how much the kernel should slide in order to output the next feature map. `stride = 1` essentially means that it will slide by 1 pixel to right and 1 pixel to down.\n\n**Q. What is pooling?**\n\nA. Pooling is another type of layer in a neural network that down samples the feature maps created by the convolution layer. It basically summarises a portion of the image in a much lesser space. It is done to reduce variance and computations. But why Max-pooling? It's because max-pooling helps in extracting low-level features like edges, points, etc. There are other type of pooling methods such as average pooling and others.\n\n**Q. What is the importance of view() function in the forward() method?**\n\nA. The view() function takes in a tensor (for ex a 4D tensor) and outputs a lower dimensional tensor (for example a 1D tensor). This is required because the next set of layers are the linear layers. And linear layers only accept a 1D tensor (a \"flattened\" array) as an input. So, the view function is used to flatten the tensor so that it can then be fed to the linear layers.\n\n**Q. What is a Dropout Layer?**\n\nA. To help understand what dropout really is, we need to understand what regularisation in general is\n\n### Regularization\nRegularization helps to solve over fitting problem in machine learning. It is nothing but adding a penalty term to the objective function and control the model complexity using that penalty term.\n\nToo complex?\n\nFor now, consider it as something that tells our model to not cross a certain boundry (threshold). Because if it does, it will be overfitted. Overfiting is a problem that machine learning algortihms face when the model is 'too exact' to be used for actual real world data. That simply means that our model, when overfitted, wouldn't be accurate in preidction task when a new datapoint is fed into the model (for example a datapoint from the test dataset). So, in order to avoid overfitting, we use regularization. This is just an intuition. We don't need to get into the math of anything for now.\n\nDropout is one of the regularization methods. Dropout helps avoid overfitting by simply 'switching off' some of the neurons in a particular iteration. Sometimes, the outup of a particular neuron from a particular layer can shoot off to a high value or to a very low value. So, the dropout method helps the network to consider some of the other neurons that it might have been ignoring because of their lower valued outputs. So, by simply turning off some neurons, it makes sure that it takes into account every neuron and hence train in a more vigorous manner and hence avoid overfitting.\n\n**Q. What is RelU and softmax?**\n\nA. RelU is short for Rectified Linear Unit. RelU and Softmax are both activation functions. What are activation functions, you ask? Well, they can be thought of as something that restricts the values of the neurons after computations to explode to extremes (very high negative or very high positive) values. Activation functions makes sure the values are bounded within a range. For example, the relu function makes sure the values are between (0,max(val)) range, where 'val' is the actual value of the neuron.\n\n**Q. But why only relu and Softmax are chosen?**\n\nA. You can choose any activation function you want. However, recent researches proves that relu performs well in almost all the cases as comapred to other activation functions. tanh is another very commonly used activation function. We don't have the luxury of choosing just any activation function when it comes to the output layer. We want to choose an activation function according to our desired output. We have chosen softmax because softmax gives out a class score for every class which is basically a probablity distribution that in turn tells us how confident is the neural network about a certain class to be the actual output.","81e158de":"### 5. Rescaling values\n\nThe pixel values that we have got in the dataset is in the range of (0,255).

Net() class has two methods, namely, `__init__()` and `forward()`.\n\n**init() method:** The `__init__()` method, which is one of the 'special methods' that are provided by python, stands for initialisation and as the name tells itself, it is used to initialise everything that we need to. It inherits all the properties of the `nn.Module`'s own `__init__` function when we write `super().__init__()`. All the convolution layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, Linear (Dense\/fully connected) layers are defined in this method.\n\n**forward() method:** It's the `forward()` method where we set the course of our network and use all the layers that we define in the `__init__` method.\n\nWhen we execute the code, the init method will be called and everything would be initialised. When we'll make the object of the same class, the forward method will be executed.\n\nThe architecture:\n\n`Layer 1: Convolution Layer 1 > Activation Function (RelU) > Pooling Layer 1 > Dropout Layer 1\nLayer 2: Convolution Layer 2 > Activation Function (RelU) > Pooling Layer 2 > Dropout Layer 2\nFlatten the output from the 2 layer\nLayer 3: Linear Layer 1 > Activation Function (RelU) > Dropout Layer 3\nLayer 4: Linear Layer 2 > Activation Function (RelU) > Dropout Layer 4\nLayer 5: Output Layer > Activation function (softmax)`","7df33562":"## Deep Learning\nDeep Leaarning is a subset of Machine Learning (Shallow Learning) that, generally, requires huge amount of data in order to puke out good results.

By supervised I mean, we know the target variable and its values for particular records and hence we can feed in this data to machine learning and deep learning algorithms and specify what it needs to learn.

Hence we use the `view()` function.\n\n`optimizer.zero_grad()` sets all the gradient's values to zero. It's an essential step while training the network.\n\n`log_ps = model(images.type(torch.FloatTensor))` simply gives a set of images to the network for training. Here the set is of 100, as we set it earlier while defining the `DataLoader`\n\n`loss = criterion(log_ps, labels)` compare the predicted and the actual labels and calculates the loss.\n\n`loss.backward()` is the step where the network starts backpropagating in order to adjust the weights and other parameters of the network and start the training process all over again.\n\n*Please note that the loss is calculated by the loss function but the weights are **updated** only during backpropagation.\n*\n\n`running_loss += loss.item()` is used to calculate `trainLoss` which eventually would be helpful in plotting the graph of training and validation loss\n\nSince we don't want every iteration to get printed on the screen, we only want every 100th iteration to get prinited with the accuracy score, hence we have used an `if` statment for the same.\n\n`with torch.no_grad():` the `with` keyword is an elegant way of handling exceptions in python. The wrapper `torch.no_grad` temporarily sets all the `requires_grad` flag to false.

Essentially, it calculates if a particular weight value needs to be decreased (subtracting from thhe original value) or increased (adding to the original value) and by how much.\n\nThere are many loss functions that can be used. The two most common ones are Cross Entropy Loss and NLL Loss for classification problems (just a reminder that we are dealing with a classification problem right now). The choice of which loss function to use is an experimental problem. You can follow <b><a href='https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/how-to-choose-loss-functions-when-training-deep-learning-neural-networks\/'>this<\/a><\/b> guide to start using the loss functions and by practice, build your own intiution.\n\nFor now, I'll be using the Cross Entropy Loss\n\nWe are now making an object of our Net() class and setting the loss function. We are using the Cross Entropy Loss. You can use any other loss function as well.","ee4bf294":"## Implementation\nWe will be implementing a specific type of Neural Network called <b>'Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)'<\/b> and we'll follow the following steps:\n\n1.

Split the data into train and test sets\n\nWe need a test set, apart from the original test.csv that is provided, for the purpose of our training and validation. The test.csv doesn't contain the target variable and hence the model can't be trainied on that. The target (label column) is only present in train.csv. Hence, we will split the data in the training set (training.csv) into two parts - training set (for training the model) and test set (for validation). To do so, we will use train_test_split() method from `sklearn.model_selection`. This method takes in the features (X) and label column (y) separately in the first 2 parameters. The 3rd parameter is test_size, which we can set in order to specify with what percentage we want to split our data. We are going to use \"0.1\" as the argument value. This will split our data into 90% training and 10% test sets. The 4th parameter is the `random_state`. This is an optional parameter which you will find as a part of many ML algorithms. It is required to produce same results and eliminate any 'randomness' that the algorithms can take since a lot of the internal values in ML algorithms have to assume some random values as part of their execution.\n\nThe function outputs 4 values, essentially splitting the X and y in to 2 parts each (test and training sets)","1d2cbc65":"# MNIST using PyTorch for Beginners (Detailed Descriptions)","3989b21c":"### 2. Load the dataset\n\nAfter loading the dataset with the help of panda's `read_csv()` function, we check if the data is imported correctly or not. This can be done in many ways, the simplest way is to check the number of rows and column. And we can do so with the help of `shape` attribute. It outputs in the format - (rows, columns)."}}
