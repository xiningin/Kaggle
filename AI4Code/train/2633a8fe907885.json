It says NYC produces far more claim than any other province of the dataset! We might ask what percent of the total is NYC Claim? This bar chart tells us absolute numbers, but it's more useful to know relative proportions. No problem:","76c03068":"When plotting only one variable, the difference between an area chart and a line chart is mostly visual. In this context, they can be used interchangably.","603095a3":"A histogram looks, trivially, like a bar plot. And it basically is! In fact, a histogram is special kind of bar plot that splits your data into even intervals and displays how many rows are in each interval with bars. The only analytical difference is that instead of each bar representing a single value, it represents a range of values.\n\nHowever, histograms have one major shortcoming (the reason for our 200$ caveat earlier). Because they break space up into even intervals, they don't deal very well with skewed data:","3a8698c5":"**Conclusion and exercise**\n\nIn this section of the tutorial we learned about the handful of different kinds of data, and looked at some of the built-in tools that pandas provides us for plotting them.\n\nNow it's your turn .

And each bar can represent anything, as long as it is a category.\n\nIn this case the categories are nominal categories: \"pure\" categories that don't make a lot of sense to order. Nominal categorical variables include things like countries, ZIP codes, types of cheese, and lunar landers. The other kind are ordinal categories: things that do make sense to compare, like earthquake magnitudes, housing complexes with certain numbers of apartments, and the sizes of bags of chips at your local deli.\n\nOr, in our case, the number of claims by the Age at Injury in the dataset:","69a9fb8d":"**Line charts**\nThe Claims recieved in the dataset we have takend only 40 different unique values to fill, for which our bar chart is just barely enough. What would we do if we consider the age group 0-100? We'd have 100 different categories; simply too many to fit a bar in for each one!\n\nIn that case, instead of bar chart, we could use a line chart","ccba5427":"The spike at zero indicates the large number of claims for which No age of injury has been provided.\n\nA line chart can pass over any number of many individual values, making it the tool of first choice for distributions with many unique values or categories.\n\nHowever, line charts have an important weakness: unlike bar charts, they're not appropriate for nominal categorical data. While bar charts distinguish between every \"type\" of point line charts mushes them together. So a line chart asserts an order to the values on the horizontal axis, and the order won\u2019t make sense with some data. After all, a \"descent\" from California to Washington to Tuscany doesn't mean much!\n\nLine charts also make it harder to distinguish between individual values.\n\nIn general, if your data can fit into a bar chart, just use a bar chart!","709a496b":"What does this chart tells ??\n\nThat most of the claims are at no further action that makes sense,as the data set taken  must be having past records that has already been taken care of  .","ee361e84":"**Area charts**\nArea charts are just line charts, but with the bottom shaded in. That's it!","07eca5c7":"As you can see, most of the claims are submitted in age group between 35 and 58; and, if we are to believe that dataset is an arbiter of all claims recieved, then at 50 is somehow the highst number of claims are recieved."}}
