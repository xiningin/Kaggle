An outlier is a row that have a feature value outside the (IQR +- an outlier step).\n\n\nI decided to detect outliers from the numerical values features (Age, SibSp, Sarch and Fare).

Indeed, there is a peak corresponding to young passengers, that have survived. We also see that passengers between 60-80 have less survived. \n\nSo, even if \"Age\" is not correlated with \"Survived\", we can see that there is age categories of passengers that of have more or less chance to survive.\n\nIt seems that very young passengers have more chance to survive.","93a00d97":"Since we have one missing value , i decided to fill it with the median value which will not have an important effect on the prediction.","9c61825d":"If you found this notebook helpful or you just liked it , some upvotes would be very much appreciated - That will keep me motivated :)","59b23fe8":"Only Fare feature seems to have a significative correlation with the survival probability.\n\nIt doesn't mean that the other features are not usefull.
