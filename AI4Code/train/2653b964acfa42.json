I have studied online about data science and I think I am ready to give a try in real data. This is my very first basic data analysis of \"World Happiest Report\". \n\nI will work on year of 2017 of the data, and I will try as much as possible to give detail as much as I know. I hope this trial would help me to improve myself and help you to see very basic steps of data science. \n\n** I am making this study with a lecture of DATAITeam. I am studying their course and do my analysis. You can see the course [here.](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kanncaa1\/data-sciencetutorial-for-beginners)\n\n** PS: Please give comments and recommendations about my work so that I can improve myself."}}
