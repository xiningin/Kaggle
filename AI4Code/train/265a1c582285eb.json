Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.\n\nThis is a standard supervised classification task.A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).Classification can be of two types:\n\nSupervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features.\nBinary Classification : In this classification we have to predict either of the two given classes. For example: classifying the gender as male or female, predicting the result as win or loss, etc.\n\nMulticlass Classification : Here we have to classify the data into three or more classes. For example: classifying a movie's genre as comedy, action or romantic, classify fruits as oranges, apples, or pears, etc.\n\nLoan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces atleast once in its lifetime.

We will create the following three new features:\n\nTotal Income - As discussed during bivariate analysis we will combine the Applicant Income and Coapplicant Income. If the total income is high, chances of loan approval might also be high.\n\nEMI - EMI is the monthly amount to be paid by the applicant to repay the loan. Idea behind making this variable is that people who have high EMI\u2019s might find it difficult to pay back the loan. We can calculate the EMI by taking the ratio of loan amount with respect to loan amount term.\n\nBalance Income - This is the income left after the EMI has been paid. Idea behind creating this variable is that if this value is high, the chances are high that a person will repay the loan and hence increasing the chances of loan approval.","ee8fef66":"We can see that there are a higher number of graduates with very high incomes, \nwhich are appearing to be the outliers.","dc9b61f0":"our predictions are almost 78% accurate, i.e. we have identified 78% of the loan status correctly for our XGBClassifier model.\n\nLogistic Regression model gives : 79% prediction accuracy\n\nDecision Tree model gives : 71% prediction accuracy\n\nRandom Forest model gives : 78% prediction accuracy\n\nRandom Forest with Grid Search model gives : 77% prediction accuracy\n\nXGBClassifier model gives : 78% prediction accuracy","26390a00":"We will use scikit-learn (sklearn) for making different models which is an open source library for Python.
