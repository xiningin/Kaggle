most interesting and helpful stages is the feature scaling when the dataset attributes go to different ranges like some attribute between [1-100], others [1000, 10000000], and others are different,  in this case of numerical ranges of different attributes, it's helpful to standardize all the numeric attributes to specific range always [0-1], which applied by the Max-Min function, which divides each value by max minus min which will restrict all values to be between 0 and 1, other function is using standard deviation and mean, but its goes to the different distribution of ranges. \n\nThis is help machine learning to perform well in this case of **Features Scaling**, also some times when the model in learning if we do not apply **Features Scaling** and values of some attributes are large, this can cause explode of values in the iteration when the model trying to minimize the cost function.\n","1aa09e12":"# Underfitting\nAs we can see how its bad prediction since of this large error,

to fit the data as it linear equation.\n- The dataset itself may contain insufficient attributes to let the model learn from.\n- insufficient quantity of the training data.\n- Regularization part if
