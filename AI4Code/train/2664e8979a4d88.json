To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 \nintroductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early \nreported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, \nwe show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic \nimportation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.\n\"\"\"\nresearch_papers.search_2d(query)","aec09aa8":"To create a **ResearchPapers** instance call `ResearchPapers.load`. This will load the metadata from the **metadata.csv** file and perform all the necessary preprocesing.

Indexing from texts takes **30** seconds on my laptop, but around **100** seconds on a Kaggle instance. If you want to create a more powerful, and potentially more accurate index, then use `ResearchPapers.load(index=\"text\")`.

Selecting subsets of research papers\nThere are a few ways to select from the research papers. Firstly, you can use the query function\n\n## Query\nThe query function follows the same pattern as the DataFrame query function - in fact it delegates to the metadata dataframe's query function, makes a copy of the metadata and creates a new ResearchPaper instance. This means you can use the exact syntax that is available for dataframes. In the example below, we select research papers published in **New Scientist** after February 29th","b0bad4bb":"## Dedicated Query Functions\nThese functions build on top of the query function and are dedicated for a subset of the data\n\n- **since_sars** Select papers since SARS\n- **since_sarscov2** Select papers since SARS-COV-2\n- **before_sars** Select papers before SARS\n- **before_sarscov2** Select papers before SARS-COV-2\n- **before** Select research papers before a date\n- **after** Select papers after a date"}}
