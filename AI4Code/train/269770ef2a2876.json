Overall accuracy score may not be sufficient in real world. One dataset could be used to produce several logistic models which give us different performance. We cannot jude immediately that a model is better than other one unless confusion matrix is attached. What the matrix tells us? Mainly, true positive, false negative, true negative, false negative, in short, these indicators allow us to compare models in every angles, and let us properly select a right model depending on situation.","57db85bd":"**Adding confusion matrix tells us something**\nAs the accuracy score of random forests show, its accuracy score increases as we suspected. However, the score strats to remain constant, and drop at some point. What does this imply? It tells us a number of tree (hyper-parameter) is needed consideration. Higher amount of trees may not the best solution. This is why confusion matries are attached, which give us very useful information. It is not necessary to pick 300 trees, but 50 or 100 tress are acceptable. Why? Obviously, it is hard to tell difference in accuracy score, true positive, false negative, true negative, and false negative.","ab6c3365":"\n***This work inspired by \"AnthonyRidding\" and \"Siraj Raval\"***\nAnthonyRidding's kernal is amazing and a goog model to study for anyone who starts exploring Kaggle. For Siraj Raval, he is a great Youtuber explaining maching learning and data science's stuff in a way everyone could understand."}}
