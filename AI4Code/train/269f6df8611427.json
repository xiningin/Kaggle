It would be greatful to identify root cause and bettter startegy for hotel management team.\n\n* Here we are going to extract the insight about most of the customer prefer resort or city hotel...\n\n* By using EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) we are analysing and visualising the different prospective. Which gives us different insights like ( 1. Customer visits on mostly which month, 2. days in months, 3. most cancelation month, etc).\n\n* Lets visualise the more insights while performing **Exploratory Data Analysis**.\n* we are helping hotels to get ready with necessary arrangements on heavy and low tourist visit periods.","e3b130a2":"# **Importing Dataset**\n\n* We have lot of alternatives to import datasets like (from database, online repository like github and google drive, etc...).\n* Here we are going to use the csv excel file for mini-projects, for real world project we wont use this csv load technique.\n* To load csv file we are using the pandas library.","5b082800":"* info() method on your DataFrame to get useful information about the data. like row count, null column or not and datatype","bca66fb9":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n# Reference:\n\n* To know more about dataset and its attributes please visit https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/329286343_Hotel_booking_demand_datasets","ac2323ba":"* Above output describe the Statistical values for non categorical columns.

One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40060 observations of H1 and 79330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking.\n\n* In tourism and travel related industries, most of the research on Revenue Management demand forecasting and prediction problems\n\n* However, the remaining tourism and travel industries like hospitality, cruising, theme parks, etc., have different requirements and particularities that cannot be fully explored without industry\u2019s specific data. Hence, two hotel datasets with demand data are shared to help in overcoming this limitation.\n\n* The datasets now made available were collected aiming at the development of prediction models to classify a hotel booking\u2019s likelihood to be canceled. Nevertheless, due to the characteristics of the variables included in these datasets, their use goes beyond this cancellation prediction problem. One of the most important properties in data for prediction models is not to promote leakage of future information\n\n* A word of caution is due for those not so familiar with hotel operations. In hotel industry it is quite common for customers to change their booking\u2019s attributes, like the number of persons, staying duration, or room type preferences, either at the time of their check-in or during their stay. It is also common for hotels not to know the correct nationality of the customer until the moment of check-in. Therefore, even though the capture of data took  considered a timespan prior to arrival date, it is understandable that the distribution of some variables differ between non canceled and canceled bookings.\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)","56274ee9":"# 1.
