This is based on how free do people feel in the given country and how much do they trust the government \n* **Generosity** is a numeric variable based on how generous the people are in the given country.\n* **Dystopia Residual** is our last variable which is numeric an imaginary country that has the world's least happy people.

Introduction\n**The World Happiness Report** is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It contains articles, and rankings of national happiness based on respondent ratings of their own lives,which the report also correlates with various life factors. As of March 2020, **Finland** was ranked the happiest country in the world three times in a row.\n\n## History\nIn July 2011, the **UN General Assembly** adopted resolution 65\/309 Happiness: Towards a Holistic Definition of Development inviting member countries to measure the happiness of their people and to use the data to help guide public policy. On April 2, 2012, this was followed by the first UN High Level Meeting called Wellbeing and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm, which was chaired by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Prime Minister Jigme Thinley of Bhutan, a nation that adopted **gross national happiness** instead of gross domestic product as their main development indicator.\n![The-World-Happiness-Report-4.webp](attachment:The-World-Happiness-Report-4.webp)\nThe first World Happiness Report was released on April 1, 2012 as a foundational text for the UN High Level Meeting: Well-being and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm, drawing international attention. The report outlined the state of world happiness, causes of happiness and misery, and policy implications highlighted by case studies. In 2013, the second World Happiness Report was issued, and since then has been issued on an annual basis with the exception of 2014.The report primarily uses data from the Gallup World Poll. Each annual report is available to the public to download on the World Happiness Report website\n\n## Methods and Philosophy\nThe rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The report correlates the results with various life factors.\n\nIn the reports, experts in fields including economics, psychology, survey analysis, and national statistics, describe how **measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations**, and other topics. Each report is organized by chapters that delve deeper into issues relating to happiness, including mental illness, the objective benefits of happiness, the importance of ethics, policy implications, and links with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) approach to measuring subjective well-being and other international and national efforts.","5ab3d5f4":"**Inferences**\n* There's a positive correlation between **social support with  happiness score and life expectancy**\n* Most of the country's citizen have **low perceptions on corruption of government**\n* There are no factors which correlates with generosity\n* **GDP** has high correlation with **social support and life expectancy**\n* **Freedom** has good correlation with **happiness score and as well as GDP and life expectancy**\n* Perceptions of corruption factor is **right skewed** and Social support factor is **left skewed**","a2c7c8d7":"## 5b.
