We need to run our `after_batch` transforms here, and before we do so, as we want those to be done on the GPU if possible, we need to (recursevly) convert all of our tensors to GPU via `to_device`.

We can do this as any time we iterate over the `DataLoader`, what we actually do is call `dl.one_batch` (during training, etc) so we just need to make those three functions I mentioned above. First, let's make our base.\n\nWhat we want to do is override both `DataLoader`'s `shuffle_fn`, as what this function does is return a list of index's to grab. If the index's are the same, the data is the same, and that's all there is to it. In this particular case, we're going to be calling their `shuffle_fn`, etc multiple times, so we need to keep track of who actually is being called. We'll store this in a value called `count`. When it's 0, we'll grab some index's.
