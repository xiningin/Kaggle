But Firstly I would like to thank the author of the data-set for taking the time to compile this data.\n\nSo What will we talk about ?\n* We will first talk about world Population, %change in population, median age and fertility rates.\n* Then we will dive into a deeper level and talk about world region and individual countries.\n* We will also be developing Prediction models for world population(till 2077, obviously pun intended!)","6ddafbb1":"# Conclusion:\nThis analysis is far from over we would be expanding upon this in future versions.\nTodo : Predictive Modeling\n\n\"Live Long and Prosper\"\n\nThanks.","ca149e24":"# Conclusion of EDA of World Population \n* From Figure 1 we can observe that world's population is increasing Linearly (That something good to know).\n* From Figure 2 and 3 we can observe % change in population as well as fertility rates of world are reducing (might be due to awareness regarding family planning has increased).\n* From Figure 4 We can Notice the World has enter in it's 30s.\n* From Figure 5 and 6 we can notice the Population density is increasing but more people are moving to urban areas.\n* In a hypothetically ideal situation this is good news as more and more people move to urban areas, they will have access to better health care Facilities, and hence standards of living will improve, this in-turn will increase awareness about family planning and hence world population will stablize.","f858f0e9":"Talking about median Ages:\n* India has median Population age of 28.\n* USA, China, Russia, Canada have median population ages : 38, 38, 40, 41 years respectively\n\nLets now talk about fertility Rates","79c59a23":"We can observe China and India have the largest Population[](http:\/\/)"}}
