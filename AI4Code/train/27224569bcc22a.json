Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.\n\nHere's a picture of the three different Iris types:","b57ea6bd":"## Model Evaluation\n\n**Now get predictions from the model and create a confusion matrix and a classification report.**","6a408ebc":"Very similar, this makes sense, there is basically just one point that is too noisey to grab, which makes sense, we don't want to have an overfit model that would be able to grab that.","6c39e575":"## Gridsearch\n\n** Import GridsearchCV from SciKit Learn.**","413290e3":"# Train Test Split\n","44ab7c75":"**Create a dictionary called param_grid and fill out some parameters for C and gamma.**","b3261e7b":"\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n","652456e6":"**Create a kde plot of SepalLengthCm versus SepalWidthCm for setosa species of flower.**"}}
