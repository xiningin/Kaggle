Import data from input read that excel and print the data.\n\nGo through the table having 6 coloumns:\n1. Jio Prepaid Recharge Plan\n2. Data Benefit\t\n3. Validity\t\n4. spent per day\t\n5. data per day\t\n6. data value\n\n**Jio Prepaid Recharge Plan**: This coloumn shows price of a plan for a particular time like 84, 56, 24, 365 days.\nUnits: Indian Rupee. 555 (din ka dedh GB) may be by this number you remember our favorite plan. Admit it we are loyal like hell to this plan. Yeah even me.\n\n**Data Benefit**: How much data these plans are offering to us per day or in total.\n\n**Validity**: Activation time period of a plan. Never need to remember as these leave no chance to make you remember last day.\n\n**Spent per day**: It's a ratio of Jio Prepaid Recharge Plan and Validity it defines how you spent on per day basis.\nI don't need to tell we cant live a day without using net so it is fair to calculate this analysis on daily spent for data.\n\n**Data per day**: Data we get per day because not all plans are on day to day basis any of them are like 200 GB for 1 months. So if we take ration of total data and validity then we ett this.\n\n**Data value**: One of the most important thing to understand. It is simple if data value of plan is more then it is cheap and best.\nIf data value of plan is less it is costly and you must avoid choosing it.\nIts simple formula of ratio.\n","1b34022b":"# CONCLUSION\n\n\nI am not at all against JIO actually I love Jio it's bussiness plan and alsoI don't support BSNL, IDEA VODAFONE OR AIRTEL and I am not saying that change your plan today and even I have not included factors like speed of internet in your area it is just a simple analysis for breaking myths between us about cost efectiveness of data plans.

If you want to compare your plan with anyone you just need to compare data value. Plan having larger data value is good plan than other.\n2. If you want to comapare the plans of whole family then you just need to add the data value.\nfor example- data value of father's plan + data value of sibbling's plan + data value of your plan= total \nand compare it with plan you can choose.\n\n### 3.
