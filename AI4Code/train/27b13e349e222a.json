Let's look at the top countries by total cases per 1 million population.","6c08437d":"Introduction\nI am well aware, that none of us will ever forget coronavirus, but in case someone from another planet reads this(I'm hoping) ,here's an introduction..\n\nCovid-19 is an ongoing global pandemic,caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 21 April 2021, more than 143 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.04 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.","a0067a02":"# Covid through the last one year\n\nIt would be interesting to analyze the new cases counted every day for the last one year (approx) throughout the world.","c1e8a8ee":"1. Astonishing, most of the countries that made it into top 10 by the total number of cases, do not appear here when the count is normalized by population. USA and France are the only ones repeating\n2. 14 out of the top 20 are European countries, 4 are in North America and remaining 2 in Asia.\n3. Among the Scandinavian countries, Sweden and Netherlands appear in the top 20.\n4. Also, 1 out of every 10 person in America has been tested positive.","391ec605":"If we take data from most countries around the world into consideration then:-\n* Covid kept infecting more and more people until mid January 2021- sometimes the slope is steeper like October-January , at times it is also levelled like August-October.\n* After January 2021, the curve finally started a downward shift as the daily new cases kept reducing.\n* At February the curve started an upward transition again and most of the world(or countries that contribute majorly to the population  of the world) experienced what we'll call a **Second Wave**.\n\nLet's do a more granular analysis of this trend. I have handpicked some countries that had most of the covid cases , let's visualize whether they did or did not see a second spike.","23e00065":"1. One would assume that the countries worst hit by Covid would also record the most number of deaths, but this is not the case. There are other factors like dominant age-group,percentage of population with chronic illness, healthcare measures taken by the government like the rate of testing, public awareness and cooperation.\n2. This plot has more European countries than the one above it, 16 out of 20.\n3. Some countries that were not so severe with cases per 1m population like Spain,UK, Italy, Poland and Brazil have managed to appear in the top 20 for the worst death rates.\n4. Others like Israel, Swedeen, Netherlands and France have managed to have a relatively lower death rate.\n5. A major factor in curbing COVID was the rate of testing. Let's see which are the top 20 countries in terms of tests per 1 million population.","e3b6a4a7":"India recieved it's peak(of the first wave) in daily cases in mid September 2020, when the count touched hundred thousand new cases in a day.\nAfter this the sloped started a downhill ride almost as steep as the increase from April 2020-September 2020.\nAround mid February 2021, the curve started a gradual then later a steep increase in daily cases.\nOn April 18 2021, the daily cases are ~275k, which is almost 3 times the cases during the first peak in Mid September.\nAfter the first week of April, most states in India are under a complete lockdown.\nWe'll compare this with other counts such as active cases, daily new deaths and daily vaccinations.","c9775a94":"## Second wave in India \n<div id = 'india'>\nWe'll start the analysis of the second wave by India, since it's ongoing.<\/div>","831a6a92":"1. Either something is wrong with the data or some countries were extremely privileged when it came to testing. 6 tests per person, that's an awful lot.\n2.

It could easily be a typo.\nIt is worth noting that on April 18th the daily death toll is 1625, which is not more than 1.5 times the death toll during the peak of the first wave.\nThe amount of vaccines being administered daily is also increasing rapidly, with periodic dips. Until now 107 million people have recieved their first shot and 16 million people are fully vaccinated. These are people above the age of 45 as currently they are the only ones eligible.\n\n**So, what caused this catastrophic Second wave in India?**\n\nDuring late January and February when the daily cases in India reduced a lot, the people and even government officials made the mistake of assuming the worst was over. Despite seeing a second wave in European Countries, the possibility was ignored. Regulations on social-distancing and wearing masks were relaxed. People started believing that the population would develop herd immunity. Also, vaccines were considered sufficient in the battle against covid."}}
