Recall that the validation_curve function, in addition to taking an initialized unfitted classifier object, takes a dataset as input and does its own internal train-test splits to compute results.\n\n**Because creating a validation curve requires fitting multiple models, for performance reasons this question will use just a subset of the original mushroom dataset: please use the variables X_subset and y_subset as input to the validation curve function (instead of X_mush and y_mush) to reduce computation time.**\n\nThe initialized unfitted classifier object we'll be using is a Support Vector Classifier with radial basis kernel.  So your first step is to create an `SVC` object with default parameters (i.e. `kernel='rbf', C=1`) and `random_state=0`. Recall that the kernel width of the RBF kernel is controlled using the `gamma` parameter.  \n\nWith this classifier, and the dataset in X_subset, y_subset, explore the effect of `gamma` on classifier accuracy by using the `validation_curve` function to find the training and test scores for 6 values of `gamma` from `0.0001` to `10` (i.e. `np.logspace(-4,1,6)`). Recall that you can specify what scoring metric you want validation_curve to use by setting the \"scoring\" parameter.  In this case, we want to use \"accuracy\" as the scoring metric.\n\nFor each level of `gamma`, `validation_curve` will fit 3 models on different subsets of the data, returning two 6x3 (6 levels of gamma x 3 fits per level) arrays of the scores for the training and test sets.\n\nFind the mean score across the three models for each level of `gamma` for both arrays, creating two arrays of length 6, and return a tuple with the two arrays.\n\ne.g.\n\nif one of your array of scores is\n\n    array([[ 0.5,  0.4,  0.6],\n           [ 0.7,  0.8,  0.7],\n           [ 0.9,  0.8,  0.8],\n           [ 0.8,  0.7,  0.8],\n           [ 0.7,  0.6,  0.6],\n           [ 0.4,  0.6,  0.5]])\n       \nit should then become\n\n    array([ 0.5,  0.73333333,  0.83333333,  0.76666667,  0.63333333, 0.5])\n\n*This function should return one tuple of numpy arrays `(training_scores, test_scores)` where each array in the tuple has shape `(6,)`.*","fa5af749":"### Question 7\n\nBased on the scores from question 6, what gamma value corresponds to a model that is underfitting (and has the worst test set accuracy)?
