I added some useful notes along the way to clarify things. \nThis notebook's content is from A-Z Datascience course, and I hope this will be useful to those who want to review materials covered, or anyone who wants to learn the basics of clustering.\n\n# Content:\n### 1. K-means Clustering \n### 2. Hierarchical Clustering\n\n________\n_________\n\n# K-means Clustering\n![i1](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/p3GHQXL.png)\n\n### Random Initialization Trap\nIf the initial centroids are placed at random, they can potentially determine the way clusters form, which is not idea as there exists optimal initial centroids that need to be placed so that the algorithm works properly. In order to achieve, this K-means ++ algorithm is used. This happens in the background of libraries, so no need to do this manually.\n\n### Choosing the right number of clusters (initial clusters)\nWithin Cluster Sum of Squares (WSCC) algorithm\n![i13](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NZ2jRt3.png)\n\nElbow method:\n![i14](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/0k6ALfB.png)\n\nChoose the point where there is a significant drop from behind, and low drop after that point.\n","6908e467":"Here the longest distance would be:\n![i238047](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/efEqQ5F.png)\nAs no extended horizontal lines cross this line.

This threshold can be different by context, but an optimal threshold can be roughly found.\n\n--> Set the threshold that it crosses the largest distance of the vertical line there is on the dendrogram. The vertical line with the largest distance should not cross any extended horizontal lines of columns. Example:\n![i83](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7geN4Wi.png)\n\n## Type 2: Divisive"}}
