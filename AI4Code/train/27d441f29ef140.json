(_This pattern makes sense, since high BMI is typically associated with higher risk of chronic disease._)\n\nTo double-check the strength of this relationship, you might like to add a **regression line**, or the line that best fits the data.  We do this by changing the command to `sns.regplot`.","969b7f9c":"This scatter plot shows that while nonsmokers to tend to pay slightly more with increasing BMI, smokers pay MUCH more.\n\nTo further emphasize this fact, we can use the `sns.lmplot` command to add two regression lines, corresponding to smokers and nonsmokers.  (_You'll notice that the regression line for smokers has a much steeper slope, relative to the line for nonsmokers!_)","dd351cbf":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

One way of doing this is by color-coding the points.  \n\nFor instance, to understand how smoking affects the relationship between BMI and insurance costs, we can color-code the points by `'smoker'`, and plot the other two columns (`'bmi'`, `'charges'`) on the axes.","dc89b7c0":"# Scatter plots\n\nTo create a simple **scatter plot**, we use the `sns.scatterplot` command and specify the values for:\n- the horizontal x-axis (`x=insurance_data['bmi']`), and \n- the vertical y-axis (`y=insurance_data['charges']`).","bea4c96a":"The `sns.lmplot` command above works slightly differently than the commands you have learned about so far:\n- Instead of setting `x=insurance_data['bmi']` to select the `'bmi'` column in `insurance_data`, we set `x=\"bmi\"` to specify the name of the column only.  \n- Similarly, `y=\"charges\"` and `hue=\"smoker\"` also contain the names of columns.  \n- We specify the dataset with `data=insurance_data`.\n\nFinally, there's one more plot that you'll learn about, that might look slightly different from how you're used to seeing scatter plots.  Usually, we use scatter plots to highlight the relationship between two continuous variables (like `\"bmi\"` and `\"charges\"`).  However, we can adapt the design of the scatter plot to feature a categorical variable (like `\"smoker\"`) on one of the main axes.  We'll refer to this plot type as a **categorical scatter plot**, and we build it with the `sns.swarmplot` command.","72c5c316":"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create advanced **scatter plots**.\n\n# Set up the notebook\n\nAs always, we begin by setting up the coding environment.
