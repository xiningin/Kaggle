Make sure you do that! If you do it on paper, turn it in to me!\n* Good! Make sure if multiple ifs go together, you have an elif. Also, you should always have an else statement. \n* Why have me pick a number? Why not just have me type mountain?\n* When you have a word and a number, you don't need an underscore. ex ```answer1``` instead of ```answer_1```\n\n---","b26906b6":"Here, write a 1 paragraph reflection answering the following questions:\n\n*   What was the hardest part of this project?\n*   What was the easiesy part of this project?\n*   How did you utilize your peer feedback?\n* What was different between your plan and the final project?\n* How well did you plan? Was your idea too easy? Too hard? Just right?\n* If you had unlimited time, what would you add to this project?","7039f998":"The hardest part of this project was Kaggle either not running or transforming my code blocks into markdown blocks. The eisiest was creating the inputs and the idea. I added some more else\/ elif statements. My plan was pretty similar to my final project just a lot shorter. My idea was pretty easy maybe a little too easy. I added some \"or\" statements to add a little something more to the project.","995da62e":"# Reflection\n","e64542cc":"# Make a Plan","08bdbed0":"Luke Taylor","ba39c146":"### Rubric","43a9b826":"I plan on making a map quiz that will tell you where to go based on user input to questions.","63644df7":"## Project Instructions","f7850e66":"# Code","b9d23524":"You will have one of three options for this project. *For both options, make sure your planning includes a decision tree and pseudocode. You may do your decision tree on paper if you would like.* **Planning and commenting your code will help you on this project a LOT** \n\nFor both, you need to have:\n* at least 5 unique results\n* at least 2 questions with more than 2 choices\n\n**Option 1: Map Quiz**\n\nFirst, [take a look at this flowchart quiz](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/236x\/65\/a8\/88\/65a8889a1c1f2ff796eeb6920277d902.jpg). You will be making a quiz similar to this. You may choose your topic. It might look something like this:\n\n```\nI will tell you where to go on vacation!\n\nWhat kind of weather do you like? (warm, cold, neutral)\nwarm\n\nWhat language do you want to speak on vacation? (English, Spanish, French)\nEnglish\n\nCan you afford a flight overseas? (yes, no)\nno\n\nYou are going on vacation to Richmond, Virginia!\n```\n\n\n**Option 2: Choose your own adventure**\n\nYou may have to google \"choose your own adventure\" to see how it works, or check with your peers around you. It might look something like this:\n```\nThere are three doors in front of you, which do you go through? (type door 1, door 2, or door 3)\ndoor 1\n\nBehind door 1 is a lion. What do you do? (fight it, run away, accept death)\nfight it\n\nYou fought it and survived! You lost a leg though.\n```\n\n\n**Want to make it better?**\n* add questions, options, or results\n* make it so that a user can enter multiple versions (\"yes\" and \"Yes\" both work)\n* add a mini game to it!\n* anything else!\n"}}
