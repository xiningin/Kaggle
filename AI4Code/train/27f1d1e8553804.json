I am learning this topic from datacamp so this kernel is just for learning purpose.\n\n**Introduction** \n\nSince first X-ray image in 1895, Medical Imaging technology advanced a lot. \n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/e3\/First_medical_X-ray_by_Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen_of_his_wife_Anna_Bertha_Ludwig%27s_hand_-_18951222.gif)\n\n\n**Loading Image**\n\nWe will use imageio python package to read images. Imageio is a Python library that provides an easy interface to read and write a wide range of image data, including animated images, volumetric data, and scientific formats(https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/imageio\/)."}}
