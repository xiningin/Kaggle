This notebook is a 2D convolutional neural net (from scratch) to identify the artist behind a painting. There are over 50 artists with over 8000 paintings, some of them kind of similar in the technique, so this makes the training and identification sort of tricky. \n\nHaving said that, I personally am a big fan of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, so I was a little bit disappointed not to find him in the list of 'the best artworks of all time' (as you will see later). Here, just for completeness a nice painting of Kirchner (title: Nollendorfplatz): \n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/ff\/Ernst_Ludwig_Kirchner_-_Nollendorfplatz.jpg)\n\nIn any case enjoy the notebook. Any ideas, suggestions or comments are of course more than welcome and appreciated. Have fun!","4914919c":"The model is a 2D convolutional neural network from scratch. Here one could probably still spend a little bit of time to improve the final results especially acuracy. One could think of using a more complex architecture or something predefined (e.g. ResNet, GoogLeNet, etc) and then attaching something in the end.

The choice for loss and metric seems kind of natural for this type of problem.","e9d4af1d":"For at least some decrease of overfitting I use data augmentation with a couple of provided functionalities, i.e. rotation, zoon, transalation and contrast of the figures. In general one could have used more or something different.","52fd6336":"This is a simple version of a convolutional Neural Net. Results are not that awesome, but somewhat solid considering created from scratch. Overfitting seems to be on the smaller level, so this should be okay. Using pretrained models like ResNet50 could improve the performance, will probably try this later at some point. Any further ideas, suggestions on how to increase the accuracy are of course more than welcome.","baa2077e":"# Model","7317feb3":"# Data augmentation","df9df71a":"# Visualise some of the paintings","c6840d92":"Next part is to read the data for further usage.
