Not surprisingly traffic crimes were signifigently higher than any other crimes, and most of these crimes occured on the drive home from work (3-6pm). Traffic crimes were slightly higher in the winter months.\n\nFor this study a geographic heat plot was used to show where the traffic crimes were most common during the evening rush hour. The heat plot can be extremely overwhelming if too much data is used or the map is zoom out too far.\n\n","855898da":"<h2>The Time of the Year Isn't A Big Factor<\/h2>\n\nTHe months of January to May seem to be slightly higher for traffic crimes, but not signifigently.\n\n<h2>Driving Home from Work is the Worst for Accidents<\/h2>\n\nIt appears that the hours of 3-6pm are the worst for traffic crimes.\n\nAs the next steps let's look at geographically where the traffic crimes are occuring between 3-6pm.","3d9cb9e1":"<H2>Traffic Related Crimes were the Most Common<\/H2>\n\nThe three top crimes were all traffic related so let's group them together and look at when they occurred.","b103b6a6":"<H2>What were the Most Common Crimes ?<\/H2>\n\nAs the next step let's look at the 20 most common crimes."}}
