And, thankfully, through the 'Kaggle survey on DS & ML', we've gained a glimpse on the job environments and skills requirement with the discussions above. The working environments of data science, and the common personal backgrounds are discussed based on the job contents options provided by Kaggle.\n\nThe roads to data science involve tons of learning and practicing. We might start with getting familiar with the field, and further deep dive into serveral subfields. The processes of understanding the field can be carried out with several courses in schools or online. Basic theories, some of the skills required are taught and practiced with the assignments or projects. (If lucky enough, it might help you get some interviews with these projects and skills)\n\nAfter gaining some knowledges and skills through courses, if you have the chance to make decision yourself, it's also a good timing to really think about which subfields or skills sets wanting to deep dived into. **Designing your own path to the career!** A imagination of what kind of roles in the career, a consideration of what kind of learning procedures you like better, these might also help you on the decision.\n\nBased on the roles willing to play in the industry, there are more learning and practicing for improvements on the skill sets, knowledge, amounts of projects, in order to get recognized in millions of resumes and perform well on the interviews. \n\nThe road of learning might not stop even after entering the career. As the responsibilities of the team varies with time, you might need to do other tasks with new tools never used before. As new technology keeps coming out in this generation, you might need to start digging into more mathmetical parts to understand mechanism of the new hottest machine learning algorithms. In addition, some of the job positions might not only need hard skills but also soft skills, such as presentation skills, communication skills, or even business insights. **Learning process never stops.** Following those masters in the field through media platforms can help us keep in track of the newest informations in the industry, also knowing what those masters are thinking and learn with them.\n\nBelow are the learning platforms that can become the references when dicisions on the learning media.","c79fda17":"# Conclusion\n<a id=\"conclusion\"><\/a>\n***\n\nThere are many resources online sharing and teaching us the experiences to get into the career in data science. While different people have different opinions based on their different backgrounds, we might get confused on what to do after scrolling down many web pages. We therefore take a look into the annual data science survey conducted by Kaggle, and observe what those already in the career of data science are doing. Job environments, job requirements and qualifications, learning ways and platforms are discussed based on the roles, the duties in the data science career, in order to know what skills to learn based on the 8500 people working in the DS field.\n\nThanks for the patience for reading on this work.

As there are lots of employees in company with big data team, there are also lots of smaller companies required employees with data science but with smaller team size.\n\nThe subjects with more amounts of duties (more than 3) have more opportunities in smaller data team size or much bigger team size. In the other hand, within data team size of 1-2, there are surprisingly more than 560 job positions (subjects) that only focus on one duty, which is the most among all the types in this heatmap. \n\n\n","b138f313":"When categorized into groups with job role, the title of data scientist is still the most, surpassing 40% in each group. The title of software engineer also stands in second or third most in each job role group, way more than data engineer and Database engineer, also demonstrating the title's career decision flexibility in the software industry. \n\nIn the roles of analysis of data, data analyst and software engineer are the second and third most titles (more than 10%). On the other hand, the role for running or building data infrastructure also lies into the duty of software engineer and data analyst. It also indicates that some of duties of data analyst not only need analysis skills but also knowledges on data infrastructure.\n\nThe subjects with title of research scientist also play important roles on the duties involving machine learning, ranking second or third in ML-related groups, espescially when it comes to the research on machine learning.\n\nIn addition, the big amount of data would sometimes be utilized to drive several business decisions. Therefore, the roles involving business insights, such as business analyst and product manager, also require skills in data science (around 5% in each group). Statisticians suprisingly have played a really small ratio among all the groups, even in the group of analysis, while there are also more other job titles (maybe more specific) among these groups categorized by job roles.","3cfafacb":"# Roles in Data Science\n<a id=\"roles\"><\/a>\n***\n\nWith 2019 Kaggle DS & ML Survey, we like to get into the subfields of those who are **working in a role related to data**, also working in the** business which incorporates with machine learning**, 8570 subjects in total.

Besides the processes of gaining data and cleaning data, the options in the survey have covered the basic overflow of the entire data science industry.

What are the position names when searching the job sites? What are the duties responsible in the position? Who are my colleages? How's the team I'm working with? \n\nThe questions start from situation when finding jobs (position name), and then the situations when working. The environment plays important roles during working, where the duties, responsibilities of your own and the status of company might affect the atmosphere and then our working moods. Whether there are colleagues who also work on similar problems can also affect the efficiency in working. We therefore next take a look at the career environments of the data science. Based on the questions above, we discuss with the job titles, amount of duties, and the data team size (here defined as employees whose roles are responsible in DS).\n\n## Job Titles\n<a id=\"titles\"><\/a>\n\nDifferent companies have different requirements and definitions on the job titles in data science. When scrolling down the job of 'Data Scientist' on Linkedin or Glassdoor, job responsibilitiy varies with different team, and company. We might find that some require data analysis and building ML prototype,\nand others might also include building data infrastructure or research on state-of-the-art DL methods.\n\n\nAs we might have an expectation of the roles and duties in the industry of data science, and have prepared skills and projects based on the roles, we therefore want to breakdown the job title distribution based on the job role.\n","a40ef00e":"## Amount of duties\n<a id=\"dutiesamount\"><\/a>\n\nIn the cases of technology developement, a start up company might only have 3 developers, while a big tech company\nmight have teams focusing on development from start to end, R&D, platform, quality assessment etc. Depending on the condition of the teams and the companies, the duty of jobs in the field of data science also differs. \n\nWe take a look at the amount of duties assigned to the subjects, and further discuss the relationship between duties and the size of data team, also the relationships between the data team and the status of business.","67d4a842":"Among each job role groups, the academic degrees higher than high school contain the most subjects, more than 90% in each group.

While in the job roles related to more machine learning implementation, buidling ML prototypes, experimentation and research, doctoral degree has higher composition than Bachelor's degree, more chances to keep doing research after PhD. \n\nIn the other hand, there are also some subjects without high education can get into the career of data science.","38b3dd08":"## Skills\n<a id=\"skills\"><\/a>\n\nAs tons of data presenting, the process of understanding data can help us lead to the next step on using data in real word, implementing ideas based on data with algorithms, ML, DL. These procedures can be conducted through programming. Starting from the first step of gaining data, cleaning data, knowing data, and then using data, the process might be tough if they're no programming language. In this section, we discuss about the common skills required, in the perspective of programming, data analysis and machine learning."}}
