And I would recommend the brand add some new features as sending out encourage messages to its users and schedule planner on smart devices personalize on the users' data.\n\nFor example, the brand can send out these messages to its users on Wednesday, the day with the highest log-in with a lower work-out number as shown on the above graph. By doing this, it may help to enhance the customers' dependence on the brands, work out more, have more products with her journals. \n\nAnd with the help of the data, we can recognize that users are not likely to do exercise on weekends. Therefore we can train the machine on giving out a reasonable training schedule based on the user's data, like a light training on normal weekday, and end with a great one on Friday. \n\n","25486b0f":"#### Finding\nThe box shows that **users tend to have a longer sleep time on the weekend when compares with the sleeping time on weekday.**","3db94d78":"# Description the data \nFrom the \u201cFitBit Fitness Tracker Data\u201d Dataset, we accessed the data which generated by 30 respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 - 05.12.2016 whose consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring, provided by M\u00f6bius under license CC0: Public Domain. Which means the dataset can be used by us to work on our analysis without restriction under copyright law, and all the data from this dataset is collected with the user's consent.\n\nThe data set includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID or timestamp. Which can be divided into 3 groups: 1. data in minute-level ; 2. data in hour-level ; 3. merged summary data. For this analysis, merged summary data will be mainly applied with the support of data at minute\/hour-level.\n\nWhile the dataset has a few problems that make the final insight may not be very accurate as the data is not up-to-date. First, there's a difference in data size (Nos. of observation: dailyactivity > sleepdata > weightinfo), the analysis in relationship on dailyactivity and weightinfo may lack data supported. Also, the data is collected by voluntary submission, a kind of survivorship bias may occur in the dataset since the better the data performed, the users are more willing to share out, vise versa. \n\nNeed to find how many users occured in all dataset.
