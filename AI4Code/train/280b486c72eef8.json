I added some useful notes along the way to clarify things. This notebook's content is from A-Z Datascience course, and I hope this will be useful to those who want to review materials covered, or anyone who wants to learn the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n## Content:\n### 1. Natural Language Processing step-by-step \n\nThis algorithm will predict if reviews are positive or negative. This will be done by using Bag of Words model. \n\n## Difference between .tsv and .csv\nFor text analysis, we need to use .tsv, as it is Tab Separated Values, which allows commas to be ignored when using each value. If .csv is used, as there are already many commas within sentences, the program will not know where it should separate between columns. Therefore, .tsv should be used.\n\n### 1) Preparing data","7bb83e57":"This changed \"loved\" to \"love\". Now, let's do this for all the sentences. We can use a for loop to go over all the indexes.\n\n\n","aa8b9814":"It seems clear that the algorithm confuses with words that may seem positive on its own, such as \"incredible\" and \"unbelievable\". This means the algorithm wasn't able to catch advanced English styles. Possibly, training on larger dataset will work better. Also, I need to research more advanced NLP algorithms out there. I will write another kernel once I find this. ","67ec10e0":"### 3) Training the model\nWe can apply the same classification algorithm to text, as now text became an independent variable. If not familiar with classification, please [refer to this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sangwookchn\/classification-techniques-using-scikit-learn)\n#Most commonly used: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes","2db06dc6":"The pretrained CountVectorizer is used, as the classifier is trained on this dataset. In the second sentence, as \"bad\" appears twice, the cell corresponding to this sentence and the word \"bad\" will show up as 2."}}
