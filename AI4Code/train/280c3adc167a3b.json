","ae506db0":"Now, we have to understand that those two means are not  **the population mean**.  *The population mean is a statistical term statistician uses to indicate the actual average of the entire group. The group can be any gathering of multiple numbers such as animal, human, plants, money, stocks.* For example, To find the age population mean of Bulgaria; we have to account for every single person's age and take their age. Which is almost impossible and if we were to go that route; there is no point of doing statistics in the first place. Therefore we approach this problem using sample sets. The idea of using sample set is that; if we take multiple samples of the same population and take the mean of them and put them in a distribution; eventually our distribution start to look more like a **normal distribution**.

These optimal parameters are also known as **Hyperparameters**. **The Hyperparameters are model parameters that are set prior to fit the model and determine the behavior of the model.**. For example, when we choose to use linear regression, we may decide to add penalty to the loss function such as Ridge or Lasso. These penalties require specific alpha (the strength of the regularization technique) to be set. The higher the value of alpha, the more penalty is being added. GridSearch finds the optimal value of alpha amoung a range of values provided by us and then we go on and use that optimal value to fit the model and get sweet results.

Let's have a look at it. \n\nWe all know that, any linear equation can be written in the form of..\n\n# $$ {y} = mX + b $$\n\n* Here, m = slope of the regression line. it represents the relationship between X and y. \n* b = y-intercept. \n* x and y are the points location in x_axis and y_axis respectively. \n<br\/>\n\nIf you want to know how, checkout this [video](https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/math\/algebra\/two-var-linear-equations\/writing-slope-intercept-equations\/v\/graphs-using-slope-intercept-form). So, this slope equation can also be written as..\n\n## $$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon \\\\ $$\n\nThis is the equation for a simple linear regression.\nhere,\n* y = Dependent variable. \n* $\\beta_0$ = the intercept, it is constant. \n* $\\beta_1$ = Coefficient of independent variable. \n* $x$ = Indepentent variable. \n* $ \\epsilon$ = error or residual. \n\n\nWe use this function to predict the value of a dependent variable with the help of only one independent variable. Therefore this regression is called **Simple Linear Regression.** \n\nSimilar to **Simple Linear Regression**, there is **Multiple Linear Regression** which can be used to predict dependent variable using multiple independent variables. Let's look at the equation for **Multiple Linear Regression**, \n\n## $$ \\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_n x_n $$\n\n\nIf you would like to know more about **Linear Regression** checkout this [kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/masumrumi\/a-stats-analysis-and-ml-workflow-of-house-pricing). \n\nSo, we know\/reviewed a bit about linear regression and therefore we know how to deal data that looks like this, \n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/3a\/Linear_regression.svg\/1200px-Linear_regression.svg.png)\nHere the data point's in this graph is continous and therefore the problem is a regression one. However, what if we have data that looks like the following, \n\n\nTherefore, we can use Linear Regression to put line like above, Howe\n\nSo, we have talk \n\n\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/rajputhimanshu.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/linear_vs_logistic_regression.jpg)\n<h5 align=\"right\">Nelson Mandela<\/h5> \n![](https:\/\/www.saedsayad.com\/images\/LogReg_1.png)\n<h5 align=\"right\">Nelson Mandela<\/h5> \n","b4811f7b":"## 7b.

Our dependent variable or target variable is something that we are trying to find, and our independent variable is the features we use to find the dependent variable. The way we use machine learning algorithm in a dataset is that we train our machine learning model by specifying independent variables and dependent variable. To specify them, we need to separate them from each other, and the code below does just that.\n\nP.S. In our test dataset, we do not have a dependent variable feature.

But, how do we make sure that our model is performing well? Our model may be overfitting or underfitting. In fact for those of you don't know what is overfitting and underfitting. let's find out.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/fittings.jpg)\n\nAs you see in the chart above. **Underfitting** is when the model fails to capture important aspects of the data and therefore introduces more bias and performs poorly. On the other hand, **Overfitting** is when the model performs too well on the training data but does poorly in the validation set or test sets.  This situation is also known as having less bias but more variation and perform poorly as well. Ideally we want to configure a model that performs well not only in the training data, but also in the test data. This is where **bias-variance tradeoff** comes in. When we have a model that overfits meaning more less biased and more possible chance of variance, we introduce some bais in exchance of having much less variance. One particular group of model I can think of right now is regularization models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net).  These models are build to deal with bias-variance. This [kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/underfitting-and-overfitting) explains this topic really well. Also the following chart given us a mental picture of where we want our models to be. \n![](http:\/\/scott.fortmann-roe.com\/docs\/docs\/BiasVariance\/biasvariance.png)\n\nIdeally we want to pick a sweet spot where the model performs well in training set, validation set and test set. As the model gets more complex, bias decreases, variences increases. However, the most important part is the error rates. We want our models to be at the bottom of that **U** shape where the error rate is the least. That sweet spot is also known as **Optimum Model Complexity(OMC).**\n\nNow what we know what we want interms of upder-fitting and over-fitting, let's talk about how to combat them. \n\nHow to combat over-fitting?\n* Simplify the model by using less parameters. \n* Simplify the model by changing the hyperparameters. \n* Introducing regularization models. \n* Use more training data. \n* Gatter more data ( and gather better quality data).

There is a definite positive correlation between Fare and Survived rated. This relationship reveals that the passenger who paid more money for their ticket were more likely to survive. This theory aligns with one other correlation which is the correlation between Fare and Pclass(-0.6). This relationship can be explained by saying that first class passenger(1) paid more for fare then second class passenger(2), similarly second class passenger paid more than the third class passenger(3). This theory can also be supported by mentioning another Pclass correlation with our dependent variable, Survived. The correlation between Pclass and Survived is -0.33. This can also be explained by saying that first class passenger had a better chance of surviving than the second or the third and so on.\n\nHowever, the most significant correlation with our dependent variable is the Sex variable, which is the info on whether the passenger was male or female. This negative correlation with a magnitude of -0.54 which points towards some undeniable insights. Let's do some statistics to see how statistically significant this correlation is.

When we perform a **t-test** we are usually trying to find out **an evidence of significant difference between population mean with hypothesized mean(1 sample t-test) or in our case difference between two population means(2 sample t-test).** \n\n\n\nThe **t-statistics** is the measure of a degree to which our groups differ standardized by the variance of our measurements. In order words, it is basically the measure of signal over noise. Let us describe the previous sentence a bit more for clarification. I am going to use [this post](http:\/\/blog.minitab.com\/blog\/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis\/what-is-a-t-test-and-why-is-it-like-telling-a-kid-to-clean-up-that-mess-in-the-kitchen) as reference to describe the t-statistics here. \n\n\n#### Calculating the t-statistics\n# $$t = \\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{\\frac{S} {\\sqrt{n}} }$$\n\nHere..\n* $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean. \n* $\\mu$ is the hypothesized mean. \n* S is the standard devaition. \n* n is the sample size. \n\n\nNow, the denominator of this fraction $(\\bar{x}-\\mu)$ is basically the strength of the signal. where we calculate the difference between hypothesized mean and sample mean. If the mean difference is higher, then the signal is stronger. \n\nthe numerator of this fraction ** ${S}\/ {\\sqrt{n}}$ ** calculates the amount of variation or noise of the data set. Here S is standard deviation, which tells us how much variation is there in the data. n is the sample size. \n\nSo, according to the explanation above, the t-value or t-statistics is basically measures the strength of the signal(the difference) to the amount of noise(the variation) in the data and that is how we calculate the t-value in one sample t-test. However, in order to calculate between two sample population mean or in our case we will use the follow equation. \n\n# $$t = \\frac{\\bar{x}_M - \\bar{x}_F}{\\sqrt {s^2 (\\frac{1}{n_M} + \\frac{1}{n_F})}}$$\n\nThis equation may seem too complex, however, the idea behind these two are similar. Both of them have the concept of signal\/noise. The only difference is that we replace our hypothesis mean with another sample mean and the two sample sizes repalce one sample size. \n\nHere..\n* $\\bar{x}_M$ is the mean of our male group sample measurements. \n* $ \\bar{x}_F$ is the mean of female group samples. \n* $ n_M$ and $n_F$ are the sample number of observations in each group. \n* $ S^2$ is the sample variance.\n\nIt is good to have an understanding of what going on in the background.

In any case, when we look at the data, we seem to have an intuitive understanding of where data is leading us. However, when we do statistical tests, we get a scientific or mathematical perspective of how significant these results are. Let's apply some of the trials and see how we are doing with our predictions.\n\n###  Hypothesis Testing Outline\n\nA hypothesis test compares the mean of a control group and experimental group and tries to find out whether the two sample means are different from each other and if they are different, how significant that difference is.\n \nA **hypothesis test** usually consists of multiple parts: \n\n1. Formulate a well-developed research problem or question: The hypothesis test usually starts with a concrete and well-developed researched problem. We need to ask the right question that can be answered using statistical analyses. \n2. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) and Alternating hypothesis($H_1$):\n> * The **null hypothesis($H_0$)** is something that is assumed to be true. It is the status quo. In a null hypothesis, the observations are the result of pure chance. When we set out to experiment, we form the null hypothesis by saying that there is no difference between the means of the control group and the experimental group.\n> *  An **Alternative hypothesis($H_A$)** is a claim and the opposite of the null hypothesis.  It is going against the status quo. In an alternative theory, the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation.\n    \n3. Determine the **test statistic**: test statistic can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. Depending on the standard deviation we either use t-statistics or z-statistics. In addition to that, we want to identify whether the test is a one-tailed test or two-tailed test. \n\n4. Specify a **Significance level**: The significance level($\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, we are ***comfortable\/confident*** with rejecting the null hypothesis a significant amount of times even though it is true. This considerable amount is our Significant level. In addition to that significance level is one minus our Confidence interval. For example, if we say, our significance level is 5%, then our confidence interval would be (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 or 95%. \n\n5. Compute the **T-statistics**: Computing the t-statistics follows a simple equation. This equation slightly differs depending on one sample test or two sample test  \n\n6. Compute the **P-value**: P-value is the probability that a test statistic at least as significant as the one observed would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis was correct. The p-value is known to be unintuitive, and even many professors are known to explain it wrong. I think this [video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E4KCfcVwzyw) explains the p-value well. **The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.**\n\n7. **Describe the result and compare the p-value with the significance value($\\alpha$)**: If p<= $\\alpha$, then the observed effect is statistically significant, the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid. However if the p> $\\alpha$, we say that, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Even though this sentence is grammatically wrong, it is logically right. We never accept the null hypothesis just because we are doing the statistical test with sample data points.\n\nWe will follow each of these steps above to do your hypothesis testing below.\n\n***"}}
