Complete trash. Brainless tripe. Insulting to anyone who isn't an 8 year old fan boy. Im actually pretty disgusted that this movie is making the money it is - what does it say about the people who brainlessly hand over the hard earned cash to be 'entertained' in this fashion and then come here to leave a positive 8.8 review?? Oh yes, they are morons. Its the only sensible conclusion to draw. How anyone can rate this movie amongst the pantheon of great titles is beyond me.\n\nSo trying to find something constructive to say about this title is hard...I enjoyed Iron Man? Tony Stark is an inspirational character in his own movies but here he is a pale shadow of that...About the only 'hook' this movie had into me was wondering when and if Iron Man would knock Captain America out...Oh how I wished he had :( What were these other characters anyways? Useless, bickering idiots who really couldn't organise happy times in a brewery. The film was a chaotic mish mash of action elements and failed 'set pieces'...\n\nI found the villain to be quite amusing.\n\nAnd now I give up. This movie is not robbing any more of my time but I felt I ought to contribute to restoring the obvious fake rating and reviews this movie has been getting on IMDb.\"\"\"\nf1 = clean(rev)\nf2 = is_special(f1)\nf3 = to_lower(f2)\nf4 = rem_stopwords(f3)\nf5 = stem_txt(f4)\n\nbow,words = [],word_tokenize(f5)\nfor word in words:\n    bow.append(words.count(word))\n#np.array(bow).reshape(1,3000)\n#bow.shape\nword_dict = cv.vocabulary_\npickle.dump(word_dict,open('bow.pkl','wb'))","e7be1246":"inp = []\nfor i in word_dict:\n    inp.append(f5.count(i[0]))\ny_pred = bnb.predict(np.array(inp).reshape(1,1000))","d5c3b70f":"## CREATING THE MODEL","e37e75f1":"## 2.
