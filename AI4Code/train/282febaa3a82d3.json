You will be making a quiz similar to this. You may choose your topic. It might look something like this:\n\n```\nI will tell you where to go on vacation!\n\nWhat kind of weather do you like? (warm, cold, neutral)\nwarm\n\nWhat language do you want to speak on vacation? (English, Spanish, French)\nEnglish\n\nCan you afford a flight overseas? (yes, no)\nno\n\nYou are going on vacation to Richmond, Virginia!\n```\n\n\n**Option 2: Choose your own adventure**\n\nYou may have to google \"choose your own adventure\" to see how it works, or check with your peers around you. It might look something like this:\n```\nThere are three doors in front of you, which do you go through? (type door 1, door 2, or door 3)\ndoor 1\n\nBehind door 1 is a lion. What do you do? (fight it, run away, accept death)\nfight it\n\nYou fought it and survived! You lost a leg though.\n```\n\n\n**Want to make it better?**\n* add questions, options, or results\n* make it so that a user can enter multiple versions (\"yes\" and \"Yes\" both work)\n* add a mini game to it!\n* anything else!\n","ed4ef2fd":"# Reflection\n","2598469e":"Rodrigo Alvarado","0253d7cc":"# Make a Plan","bc44f295":"Good start!!\n* It doesn't run.
