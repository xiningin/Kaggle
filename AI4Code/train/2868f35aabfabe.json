More than 50% of the districts are located in the suburbs.\n\nLooking at the wheel we can see the top 4 characteristics of each state - and whether or not the majority of the schools in the state:\n\n* have more than 50% of students identified as Black\/Hispanic;\n* have more than 50% of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch;\n* have good connection to internet or not (almost all observations had the same interval, so we won't look at this characteristic going further);\n* have more than $1,000 per pupil expenditure (marked with deeper red, less than $1,000 marked with lighter red).\n\n\n<h2>\ud83d\udcc5 Student Activity Through Time<\/h2>\n\n* The median percentage of active users on a given day for a product varies widely, from New York having on average ~0.14% activity to states like California or Washington with only 0.1% active users per product on a given day.\n* The Activity Trend is general for almost all states - with increased activity during the school year and dormant activity during holidays, like the Summer Break or towards the end of the year (Winter Recess).\n\n\n<h2>\ud83d\udcda Student Engagement Through Time<\/h2>\n\nThe engagement's pattern looks very similar with the activity one:\n\n\n* After the start of the pandemic and the official closing of schools for the remainer of the year, the median page loads per product has increased visibly for most of the states.\n* Compared to the activity analyzed above, the engagement doesn't decrease so drastically during the summer holiday. This is because lots of Educational Products are used in the free time too.\n* Although the second part of the year (when the School Year 2020-2021 started) most of the states opted for hybrid or from home study, there is a slight decrease in the median engagement per product per 1k students.\n\n\n<h2>\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 States Engagement<\/h2>\n\n* The biggest engagement registered in 2020 is in North Dakota and Arizona (however, we need to keep in mind that these states had data available from only one district).\n* Connecticut and Massachusetts are the states with the biggest true engagement, based on the fact that there was data collected from more than 20 districts for each of these states.\n* We can't say that a region in US is more active than another, as the available states are quite dispersed throughout the country.\n\n<h2>\ud83d\udeb8 Is there an Engagement Gap?<\/h2>\n\n* On average, there is lower engagement in the states that have a majority of black or hispanic students vs the ones that have only a partial number (less than 50%). This trend is mantained ~equal throughout the entire year.\n* There is a lower engagement in the states where the majority of students receive free or reduced lunch vs the states were less than 50% of them do. However, we can observe that this difference narrows in the second part of the year.\n* A very interesting finding is that, although children in states with big expenditure per pupil have registered bigger engagement, there is no significantly big difference between them and states where the expenditure per pupil is much lower. Moreover, the difference narrows even more in the second half of the year.\n\n\n<h1>Learning Products<\/h1>\n    \n<h2>\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e Top Products Overview<\/h2>\n\n* Most used educational products in 2020 were Google products (like Google Docs, Google Classroom, Google Drive, Google Forms, Google Sheets, Google Meet), Youtube and Kahoot!.\n* Compared to these few products, all the others had extremely little to no median engagement throughout the year. Hence, Google and Kahoot! have monopol so far over the online educational instruments.\n\n<h2>\ud83c\udf92\ud83c\udf92\ud83c\udf92 Learning Product Engagement Timeline<\/h2>\n\n* Based on the most engaging 10 products, we can see that there is an increase in the new school year 2020-2021 vs the engagement before the big summer break. This means that students started not only getting used to these products, but also realised that they're here to stay and they need to start using them more often.\n\n* Youtube started increasing in engagement during summer 2020 and sustained it's activity in the new school year.\n\n* Although after the start of the pandemic there has been considerable increase in usage for these e-learning tools, the difference after vs the little time we have available before the pandemic isn't that substantial. This could happen because most of the kids that were active after the pandemic started were also active using these tools before. However, there is a big pool of students that seem to not use these products at all (and this can be seen in the activity percentage).\n\n\ud83c\udfeb\ud83c\udfeb\ud83c\udfeb **Learning Product Engagement on States**\n\n* Illinois, Indiana, New York, Connecticut and Ohio are the states with the biggest engagement in almost all 10 learning products.\n* Utah, California, Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia are the states with the lowest engagement in almost all 10 learning products.\n\n\n<h1>\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1 Recommendation<\/h1>\n\n\n\n* Activity and Engagement increased a bit after the start of the pandemic and then slightly decreased in the beginning of the academic year 2020-2021 (however, this trend isn't shown in top 10 products). This means that both teachers and students started using more diligently a few products that quickly monopolized the others, however the overall average engagement is low and alarming, at least compared to what I would have expected to see.\n* We learned that the states where there are bigger percentages of black\/hispanic students or more pupils that benefit of free\/reduced lunch need better care and attention. North Dakota, Arizona, New York, New Hempshire and Connecticut are the states that stand out in terms of the biggest engagement in comparison to the others. However, the overall low engagement may be caused by:\n    * **Lack of age appropiate skills**: children in Primary and Middle school don't know yet how to properly use the technology and might get stuck and frustrated on the way. If the parent or tutor doesn't know, can't or isn't able to be there for them when they need it, they might fall short and stop using the educational products alltogether.\n    * **Lack of technology resources**: families that have 2 or more children would need to use a distinct laptop\/tablet in the same time during the online courses AND have a proper sepparate (quiet) space to learn. Unfortunately, many families lack these kind of resources.\n    * **Low Emotional Stability**: truth is some children started getting tired of the \"new norm\". Despite the emotional support they have from their teacher, lack of interaction might have accumulated, leading to them not wanting to engage and participate during the online classes and\/or during homework.\n    * **Low energy**: Staying in from of a computer 6 hours a day and then doing the homework (also digitaly) for another 2 to 3 hours can take a toll on children's overall wellbeing. This accumulates to 8+ hours of staying in a chair, 5 times a week, equivalent to a full time job.\n\n* There have been active efforts from teachers **to improve their technological skills as well as overall curriculum**, in an effort to adapt it as much as possible for the \"online\" classrooms. Moreover, they are active in keeping in touch and reaching out more to parents and children. These acts are extremely benefficial, narrowing the communication gap that has been inevitably formed while staying at home.\n\n\n<h1>\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1 Suggestions<\/h1>\n\n\n1. Keeping schools open as much as possible should be a priority, as this solves many problems that the pandemic brought to begin with. To keep the safety, I would move into online format for 2 weeks only classes that have a confirmed case, ~10 days if no new case has been found between the other students.\n\n2. For online classes, teachers should try and brainstorm as many new, fun, out of the ordinary lectures to keep the students engaged. This way, they will join every day with a curiosity in mind: \"What will we do today?\". New games, movies or fun interactive ways to teach might encourage them to pay attention, despite being alone at home and not in a classroom full of people.\n\n3. Better marketing for e-learning products. As we saw, there are only 6-7 products that ar highly used. This is because teachers do not know about other apps and do not have the necessary time to research. Hence, I would designate a new job (part time or full time), where the requirements would be to always be up to date with e-learning tools and to recommend and explain to teachers what and how to use them. Moreover, I would make this customized on a grade and lecture basis: a 1st grade teacher will need different e-learning tools vs. what a math teacher in 8th grade might need. Teachers already have their hands full, so a designated person that will share customized tools for everybody will help grow both the engagement of the students (bringing something new and exciting to the table) and the engagement of the product.\n\n4. The e-learning tools should always be FREE for the end-user: either free by default or paid by the educational institute. Assuming that the teacher or parent can afford any additional subscription for e e-learning tool would be faulty and unrealistic.\n\n5. We should not underestimate the power of these e-learning tools. Even after the pandemic is over, teachers could still use these amazing well thought apps to show young future adults how to navigate through technology and to learn in an interactive different way. Helping the low engagement products gain visibility will benefit the pupils, teachers and overall market tremendously.\n\n6. Teachers should take part in IT courses, so they could get better acquinted with the digital world.\n\n7. Online classes should be shorter and have different curriculum (and engaging, as stated at 2.). Teachers should also coordinate their assignments every week, so pupils would not have an overload of work at once. Parents should be involved as well, to be sure that not only children take part in all their online classes, but that they also have some time appart from the devices. It would be a shame to shorten the time spent at the computer for online classes, but the child to immediately start a game or browse social media afterwards for hours on end. Encouraging them to get outside in a safe manner will benefit their Social and Emotional anxiety.\n\n8. Introduce more psychologists in schools. I would also implement a mandatory 1to1 for each student and psychologist at least every few weeks. This way we can check in as adults and catch early any metal health issue or distress that the child might develop.\n\n9. A big issue I struggle to find a fix to is for smaller children. School's main purpose for Primary pupils is to involve and integrate them into the society, hence any online classes will struggle to meet this goal. Furthermore, little children will need mandatory help and guidance from their parents\/tutors using the technology.
