So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `df.iloc[0:1000]` will return 999 entries, while `df.loc[0:1000]` return 1000 of them! To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `df.iloc[0:1001]`.","842e19ba":"**Exercise 14**: Who produces more above-averagely good wines, France or Italy?
