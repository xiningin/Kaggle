This section will also effectively cover the \"Share\" Phase of the Google Data Analytics Framework since this entire notebook can be viewed as the document that will be shared with others. \n\nAs the goal of this analysis is to understand & spot any trends in users'activities, let's first get a statistical description of the data using the describe() method provided by Pandas ","84ba84b6":"**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the 2 plots above, it can be seen that there is a positive correlation between Total Distance, Active Time & Calories. This is further validated by the generated Correlation Plot between the 3 variables.\nHowever, the values of the Correlation Plot suggest that there is a relatively strong correlation between Total Distance-Active Time & Total Distance-Calories. The positive correlation between Active Time & Calories is weak base on this dataset & thus more research has to be done","0d1fdea0":"Based on the description provided, it can be seen that both Total Distance & Tracker Distance are actually duplicate measurements due to their statistical information being almost the same.\n\nLooking at the timing data recorded (VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes etc), it is hard to make sense of all these values. To better understand how active the users are, its best to compare the minutes the user spend being active against the total time the FitBit is worn by the users. We will have to perform some calculation using the data frame in order to achieve that goal.","7655962b":"As seen from above dataframe, the data is stored in a long format.\n\n**Let's also get some information on our dataset**","530b45bc":"**Before proceeding, let's evaluate the data based on the ROCCC criteria introduced during the Google Data Analytics Course:**\n* *Reliability:* Not reliable due to the small size of 30 being not sufficient to represent the overall population of FitBit Smart Devices users & we have no information on the demographic of the people who participated in the study (eg. Were the participant mainly women or was there a mixture of men & women? Age? etc)\n* *Original:* The datasets are deemed original since we know which organization had prepared the data (FitBit)\n* *Comprehensive:* Based on the initial screening of the dataset, it is quite comprehensive to the user's activity.\n* *Current:* Dataset is not considered current since it was collected in 2016. Advancement in technology within the span of 5 years could have changed how FitBit users, by extension Smart Device Users, use their devices.\n* *Cited:* No information was provided whether other organizations has cited the data prepared by FitBit.\n\nAs there are no gender type specified in the dataset, we are unable to filter out data that is relevant to women (which is the audience of interest for Bellabeat). Since there are no null values present in the dataset, we are ready to move on to the Process Phase.","25f63f0b":"# **Process Phase**\n\nFor the process phase, the tool selected for analysis would be Python. Was supposed to use R but that flagged a warning that all the content thus far would be erased thus the decision to proceed with Python was made. However, concepts from the Google Data Analytics Course shall be applied still.\n\nProgramming approach was selected due to the size of the dataset and that writing out code can help to visualize the analysis logic \/ methodology in my opinion.\n\nTo verify that the dataset is clean for analysis, a final check to see if there are any missing values present within the dataset as illustrated below in the code chunks.\n\n","025dd801":"**Conclusion:** As seen from the distribution plot, on average, users spend approximately 20% of the time being active while wearing their FitBit. Based on the statistical data, the average total time which user wear their FitBit is 1219 mins and the average time a user spend being active while wearing their FitBit is 228 mins.","38341dfd":"Based on the information generated, there are a total of 940 data points and all of which are Non-Null Values. However, noticed how the ActivityDate is defined as an object datatype. Let's change it to use Pandas Datetime Object","f4fe9ec3":"# **Ask Phase** #\n**Problem Statement**\n- To understand how smart devices are used in today's smart device market\n\nHowever, the provided problem statement is too generic, so we shall make it more specific. Since Bellabeat manufactures health-focused smart products, the activity patterns of their users would be of interest to them. Therefore, the newly crafted problem statement is as follows:\n- To understand the activity pattern of smart devices users in the market today.\n\n**Below are questions that shall guide the analysis for Bellabeat:**\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?","f3d6cfae":"**Relationship Between Active Time, Total Distance & Calories**\n\nIt is a common believe that the more active a person is, the more calories they burn.Additionally, we would also like to see how Total Distance relates to Active Time and Calories as well. \n\n**The hypothesis is that:**\n* The greater the Total Distance recorded, the greater the Active Time of the User\n* The greater the Active Time, the more Calories a User will consume\n* Therefore, Total Distance, Active and Calories is hypothesize to have a positive correlation with each other\n\nLet us see if that's what the data shows us.","bb173805":"Let's have a look at the statistical data of the Proportion Of Time Active % as well as visualize its distribution as well","2f46d549":"# **Prepare Phase** # \nThe used for the analysis is provided by FitBit, made available through Mobius to the public. Since the data was not collected directly by Bellabeat, it shall be classified as External Data.\n\n***Note:** Sample size of 30 is too small to properly to represent the entire user base of FitBit. Further analysis to be performed when access to additional smart device data is available*\n\n**Let's proceed to import the dailyActivity Dataset to better understand the data that is being studied in the case study**","23c6c1f5":"Based on the above check, each column is found to 1 unique value and from the dataframe it is clear that the unique value is False. Since isna() returned False for each data point, it confirms that there are no missing values within the dataset. \n\nWith that check done, time to move on to the Analyze Phase."}}
