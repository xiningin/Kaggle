They took on monopoly power with the Federal Trade Commission, ratified a federal income-tax amendment, and gave federal workers a form of disability insurance. But in a rebuke to Progressive victories, the influenza caused a regressive pandemic. Its first wave disproportionately punished the poor, who worked in closer quarters and lived in smaller apartments than their wealthier counterparts.\n\nOne century later, history is rhyming. The pandemic now bulldozing through the United States will, in its own way, be especially punishing for low-income workers, just as they were starting to reverse a generation of widening inequality.\n\nLike 102 years ago, this wave of the pandemic will almost certainly disproportionately punish the poor\u2014not only by arresting the long recovery since the Great Recession, but also by specifically targeting industries where workers are most vulnerable and have the least protection.\n\n\n\n#Low average wages. Fewer Labor Protections. Remote Work? Simply out of question for them. \n\nWorkers in these sectors\u2014salespeople, waiters, hotel desk clerks, groundskeepers, maids, and entertainment attendants\u2014have a few things in common: First, their average annual wages are less than 30,000, including tips, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The typical annual wage for a full-time worker in the U.S. is about 47,000.) Second, they have the fewest labor protections, such as paid sick leave, and in many cases their tips don\u2019t count as income when they apply for unemployment insurance. Third, they can\u2019t do their work from home. Remote work is the labor market\u2019s only remedy against the virus while Americans are in mass lockdown.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/03\/coronavirus-will-supercharge-american-inequality\/608419\/","4f59edc5":"#Observe Convolution on a Numerical Matrix\n\n#Apply convolution and ReLU to the image and display the result.","78809d72":"#Detect the feature with ReLU and see the result","33ec2d0c":"#A rapid response for those most in need.\n\nPandemics expose the weaknesses in every society and widening and persistent inequality was a feature of almost every country, even before COVID-19 broke out.\n\nDeveloping countries, and those in crisis, will suffer the most, along with the already vulnerable all over the world; those that rely on the informal economy, women, those living with disabilities, refugees, and the displaced, as well as those that suffer from stigma.\n\nThe virus is ruthlessly exposing the gaps between the haves and the have nots, both within and between countries.It finds a fertile hunting ground when more than half the world\u2019s people lack essential health services and have little or no social protection. About 100 million people are being pushed into extreme poverty because they can\u2019t afford healthcare.\n\nThe focus on inequality and poverty should help countries to prepare, respond, and fully recover from the pandemic.\n\nConduct quick assessments of the social and economic blowback from COVID-19, so governments can ensure urgent recovery measures and longer-term social protection, especially for the disadvantaged and marginalized.\n\nhttps:\/\/feature.undp.org\/coronavirus-vs-inequality\/\n","d9a49f7f":"#It's not a Democratic Pandemic since the repercussions for those in vulnerability conditons are worst.\n\n#History shows us that plagues can offer tremendous opportunities to break with the status quo.\n\n#The coronavirus has emphasized how fragile and destructive our way of life is, not just for the planet, but also for us.\n\n#It is essential the response is systemic and integrates the health, economic, social and environmental dimensions.\nhttps:\/\/feature.undp.org\/coronavirus-vs-inequality\/","98a0f277":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.xcrm.2020.100073\n![](https:\/\/ars.els-cdn.com\/content\/image\/1-s2.0-S2666379120300938-gr1.jpg)https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2666379120300938","5a73c9ca":"#Some standard kernels used in image processing.","94b46e7c":"#Apply Convolution","7d27f332":"#Instructor:Ryan Holbrook, Data Scientist.
