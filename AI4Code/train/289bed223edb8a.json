In scikit-learn, we would use the predict_proba method instead of predict.","45fa5107":"# Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation metric is AUC, which stands for \"area under curve\".","bbab7b95":"# Goal\n\nIn this competition, we predict whether or not an email is spam.\n\nWe are going to cover the following steps:\n1.
