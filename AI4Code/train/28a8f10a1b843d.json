To find the number of clusters in the data, we need to run the K-Means clustering algorithm for different values of K and compare the results. So, the performance of K-Means algorithm depends upon the value of K. We should choose the optimal value of K that gives us best performance. There are different techniques available to find the optimal value of K. The most common technique is the **elbow method** which is described below.\n","15c210fe":"# **13.

K-Means clustering is used to find intrinsic groups within the unlabelled dataset and draw inferences from them. In this kernel, I implement K-Means clustering to find intrinsic groups within the dataset that display the same `status_type` behaviour. The `status_type` behaviour variable consists of posts of a different nature (video, photos, statuses and links).\n\n\nSo, let's get started.","043cc42e":"# **1. Introduction to K-Means Clustering** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nMachine learning algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories - supervised and unsupervised learning. There are other categories also like semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. But, most of the algorithms are classified as supervised or unsupervised learning. The difference between them happens because of presence of target variable. In unsupervised learning, there is no target variable. The dataset only has input variables which describe the data. This is called unsupervised learning.\n\n**K-Means clustering** is the most popular unsupervised learning algorithm. It is used when we have unlabelled data which is data without defined categories or groups. The algorithm follows an easy or simple way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters, fixed apriori. K-Means algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.\n\nK-Means clustering can be represented diagrammatically as follows:-\n","5df3cf17":"# **15.

K-Means Clustering intuition** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nK-Means clustering is used to find intrinsic groups within the unlabelled dataset and draw inferences from them. It is based on centroid-based clustering.\n\n\n**Centroid** - A centroid is a data point at the centre of a cluster. In centroid-based clustering, clusters are represented by a centroid. It is an iterative algorithm in which the notion of similarity is derived by how close a data point is to the centroid of the cluster.\nK-Means clustering works as follows:-\nThe K-Means clustering algorithm uses an iterative procedure to deliver a final result. The algorithm requires number of clusters K and the data set as input. The data set is a collection of features for each data point. The algorithm starts with initial estimates for the K centroids. The algorithm then iterates between two steps:-\n\n\n## **3.1 Data assignment step**\n\n\nEach centroid defines one of the clusters. In this step, each data point is assigned to its nearest centroid, which is based on the squared Euclidean distance. So, if ci is the collection of centroids in set C, then each data point is assigned to a cluster based on minimum Euclidean distance. \n\n\n\n## **3.2 Centroid update step**\n\n\nIn this step, the centroids are recomputed and updated. This is done by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that centroid\u2019s cluster. \n\n\nThe algorithm then iterates between step 1 and step 2 until a stopping criteria is met. Stopping criteria means no data points change the clusters, the sum of the distances is minimized or some maximum number of iterations is reached.\nThis algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a result. The result may be a local optimum meaning that assessing more than one run of the algorithm with randomized starting centroids may give a better outcome.\n\nThe K-Means intuition can be represented with the help of following diagram:-\n","6d2283d5":"There are 3 categorical variables in the dataset.
