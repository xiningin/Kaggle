We will ask four different questions related to employee retention and job satisfaction of software developers and try to answer them with different data science methods based on this dataset.\n\nThe analysis follows broadly the CRISP-DM (cross-industry standard process for data mining) model. The six major phases of this model are:\n\n* Business Understanding\n* Data Understanding\n* Data Preparation\n* Modeling\n* Evaluation\n* Deployment\n\nWhile the first five steps are roughly reflected in this notebook, the results of the analysis are deployed as a blog post on medium.com.\n\n## Business Understanding\n\nEmployee retention and job satisfaction are important things for a human resource manager to consider. Since IT resources are rare to find these days, this is especially true today. It would be a great opportunity if data science techniques could help here. Therefore, we ask and try to answer four questions:\n\n* Is it possible to predict whether a developer is looking for a new job or not?\n* If so, what are the most important features for such a prediction?\n* Is job satisfaction related to other features recorded in the survey \u2013 like salaries?\n* Do these aspects change from country to country?\n\n## Data understanding\n\nKaggle characterizes the Stack Overflow survey in the following way: \"Every year, Stack Overflow conducts a massive survey of people on the site, covering all sorts of information like programming languages, salary, code style and various other information. This year, they amassed more than 64,000 responses fielded from 213 countries.\"","49472064":"As the correlation numbers are altogether pretty low, we cannot really find a correlation here.\n\n### Last question: Do these aspects change from country to country?\n\nTo answer this question we analyze how job satisfaction (and salary) vary from country to country.","398addad":"As the scatter plot and the increased Pearsons number suggests we have at least a moderate correlation.\n\n## Deployment\n\nPlease see the following blog post for a deeper discussion on the topics outlined above:\n\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/@cornel_77788\/how-data-science-could-help-a-human-resource-manager-5d6e95c87c95"}}
