Introduction\n## 1.1 Primary Goals and Motivation\nExcessive alcohol consumption of teenagers has been a serious issue in different countries. Alcoholism and college drinking can be detrimental to physical and intellectual development of teenagers. While students may drink alcohol to relieve stress or fit in, too much alcohol leads to other mental health issue and harms interpersonal relationship. Drinking alcohol is often assumed to correlates with their academic performance; some social and economic factors may also be related to one\u2019s grades. This may affect college admissions and physical health (brain development). The primary goal of this project is to explore whether students\u2019 habits, especially alcohol consumption, are good predictors of a student\u2019s grade and build a model that predict one\u2019s GPA based on variables including alcohol intakes, parents\u2019 education level, living environment, and health condition. I am interested in the relationship between alcohol consumption and GPA. And If drinking does not significantly predict academic success, what other social & economic factors should be considered when predicting grades?\n## 1.2 Literature Review\nResearch that focus on college students found binging and intoxication correlates negatively with study hours, which reduce GPA. Meanwhile, pure increase in drinking frequency does not seem to affect GPA significantly (Wolaver, 2001). Fewer studies focus specifically on correlation between high school drinking and grades. As cited in Balsa, Giuliano, & French, DeSimone and Wolaver (2005) look specifically into high schoolers and found a negative association between high school drinking and GPA; the results also show that binge-drinkers GPA are averagely 0.4 lower for both genders (2011). \nThe Pagnotta and Amran (2016) study uses the same data set as this project. They approach the data set from a secondary level using data mining and business intelligence; the model\u2019s effectiveness shows a correlation between alcohol intake and grades. Another article establishes a model using random tree method (Hariharan, Krithivasan, & Angel, 2016).\n## 1.3 Data\nTo reach the goal of my project, I choose the student performance data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes the gender, social, economic, and alcohol intake information of Portuguese high school students in math and Portuguese language class (Cortez & Silva, 2008). The attributes in the data set seems relevant and comprehensive enough for the model, which makes this an appropriate data set to incorporate.\n\n\n## Importing packages & Cleaning Data \n\nI am using the student performance dataset from UCI ML, which includes informations of two groups of students in math and Portuguese class respectively. The two csv files consist duplicated informaiton (some are enrolled in both classes), so I need to combine them and drop the duplicated rows.\n\n## 2. The Student Performance Data Set\n### 2.1 Background Information\nThe student performance dataset (named \u201cstudent alcohol consumption\u201d on Kaggle) records the response to a questionnaire of students from two public high school in Portuguese during the 2005-2006 school year. The questions are related to the students\u2019 social, emotional and demographic situation. \nIn Portugal, most students study under the public education system. Unlike the United States, Portuguese students complete 9 years of education before 3 years of high school. The school year is usually separated into trimesters. Students have two trimester scores (the G1 and G2 variables) and a final score (the G3 variable), and they are graded on a 20-point scale, where 0 is the lowest score and 20 is the highest (Cortez & Silva, 2008). This dataset is collected by Dr. Paulo Cortez, an information systems researcher at the Algoritmi R&D Centre, and Ms. Alice Silva, a secondary school teacher at Arcozelo, Portugal. Their intention was to collect information that may reflect the students\u2019 grade, then use data mining (classification and regression) to build a prediction model. While the grades and number of absences are taken from report cards, other attributes are retreived by sending out questionnaire with multiple-choice questions (options were predefined). The questionnaire contains 34 questions, and it was answered by 788 students. However, 111 of the records were discarded due to identification issues. Some parts of the answers from the questionnaire, such as family income and access to computers, are also thrown away because students give mostly unified answers to the questions. When the data was collected, public schools in Portugal still had poor information system, so students mainly use paper in class and filled in physical copies of questionnaires. (Cortez & Silva, 2008). \n### 2.2 Principle of measurement\nMy question is closely related to the dataset because the collectors of the data have similar goals to this project. This social-economics status shapes our understanding to the students\u2019 living condition from multiple aspects, which helps better the prediction. Many attributes have potential correlations with each other. \nHowever, I have to leave some doubts on the preciseness of some attributes of the data, such as weekly study time, family relationship quality, free time, and alcohol consumption. Though the study is anonymous, some students may still fill in non-real or inaccurate answers. For example, weekly study time (1 \u2013 10 hours) is hard to measure, and the response to \u201cfree time,\u201d \u201cgoing out with friends,\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d attributes (all labeled as \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201cvery high\u201d from 1 to 5) are rather subjective. Alcohol consumption is also measure in a similar inaccurate scale; students who drink more alcohol may scale the level of consumption differently, depending on their definition of \u201cvery high (level of consumption).\u201d\n### 2.3 ethical consideration\nThe analysis of the dataset does not seem to harm the represented groups. Instead, it may help educator build a better class environment to better students\u2019 performance. \nHowever, the population represented in the dataset limits the scope of the model and our conclusion. Because all students are from two Portugal public high school, the data set lacks diversity, we cannot extrapolate our findings to high school students in other countries or students in private high school.\n\n### 2.4 Variables\nThe data set has 33 variables and is separated into two csv files, one for each class. During the preprocessing process, I merge the two file and drop the repeated rows. The variables are listed as follow:\n* school - student's school (binary: 'GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira)\n* sex - student's sex (binary: 'F' - female or 'M' - male)\n* age - student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22)\n* address -

Specifically, the plot shows the distinctive difference in number counts of low and high drinking level students; many of those who filled in 5 for both questions are male. \nFrom Figure 4, however, we can get a fuller picture on the relationship between alcohol intake and grades. Interestingly, there is more correlation between workday alcohol intake and final grades. The range of score of the \u201cvery high\u201d drinking level students are smaller; no one in that group are getting very high grades.  \n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)","ce96a788":"## Exploratory Data Analysis\nFirst, I used a heatmap to find out the correlation between all variables. There are little interesting and strong correlations between the variables. Student\u2019s final grade is strongly related to their grades in the first and second trimesters. After the grades comes the number of class failed, which is reasonable because it directly affects the grades of the classes. The weekend and weekday alcohol intake seem to have different correlations with the variables. For instance, workday alcohol consumption has a 0.4 correlation with the \u201cgoing out with friends\u201d variable, while weekend alcohol consumption only has 0.25. However, it is important to note that the relationships between the dozens of categorical variables are not shown in the table. Thus, I move on to create distribution plots with Altair. \n<br \/> The distributions of final grade are identical between two sexes; the density plot for female has higher count because the total number of female students is higher. From Figure 2, one can see the number of boys that consume very high level during the workday is more than 3 times higher than that of the female students. The alcohol consumption distribution for male students is more uniform than female students\u2019.\n\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)","2a4e9eaa":"From this table we can see that G2 contributes the most to the model.
