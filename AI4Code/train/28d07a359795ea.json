For this reason, we typically will only one-hot encode columns with relatively low cardinality.  Then, high cardinality columns can either be dropped from the dataset, or we can use label encoding.\n\nAs an example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, and containing one categorical column with 100 unique entries.  \n- If this column is replaced with the corresponding one-hot encoding, how many entries are added to the dataset?  \n- If we instead replace the column with the label encoding, how many entries are added?  \n\nUse your answers to fill in the lines below.","ea0a6382":"In this exercise, you will work with data from the [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/home-data-for-ml-course). \n\n![Ames Housing dataset image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lTJVG4e.png)\n\nRun the next code cell without changes to load the training and validation sets in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`.
