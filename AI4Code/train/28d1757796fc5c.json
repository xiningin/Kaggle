The network here is outputting three channels. Essentially, each channel is trying to learn to predict a class, and `losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)` is the recommended loss for \nsuch a scenario.

However, suppose you want to know where an object is located in the image, the shape of that object, which pixel belongs to which object, etc. In this case you will want to segment the image, i.e., each pixel of the image is given a label. Thus, the task of image segmentation is to train a neural network to output a pixel-wise mask of the image. This helps in understanding the image at a much lower level, i.e., the pixel level. Image segmentation has many applications in medical imaging, self-driving cars and satellite imaging to name a few.\n\nThe dataset that will be used for this tutorial is the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https:\/\/www.robots.ox.ac.uk\/~vgg\/data\/pets\/), created by Parkhi *et al*. The dataset consists of images, their corresponding labels, and pixel-wise masks. The masks are basically labels for each pixel. Each pixel is given one of three categories :\n\n*   Class 1 : Pixel belonging to the pet.\n*   Class 2 : Pixel bordering the pet.\n*   Class 3 : None of the above\/ Surrounding pixel.","9c071686":"## Define the model\nThe model being used here is a modified U-Net. A U-Net consists of an encoder (downsampler) and decoder (upsampler). In-order to learn robust features, and reduce the number of trainable parameters, a pretrained model can be used as the encoder. Thus, the encoder for this task will be a pretrained MobileNetV2 model, whose intermediate outputs will be used, and the decoder will be the upsample block already implemented in TensorFlow Examples in the [Pix2pix tutorial](https:\/\/github.com\/tensorflow\/examples\/blob\/master\/tensorflow_examples\/models\/pix2pix\/pix2pix.py). \n\nThe reason to output three channels is because there are three possible labels for each pixel. Think of this as multi-classification where each pixel is being classified into three classes.","a0c67fb8":"The dataset already contains the required splits of test and train and so let's continue to use the same split.","06a2bd5e":"Have a quick look at the resulting model architecture:","0e40aafa":"The decoder\/upsampler is simply a series of upsample blocks implemented in TensorFlow examples.","21d9e856":"Let's take a look at an image example and it's correponding mask from the dataset.","da376b7a":"Let's try out the model to see what it predicts before training."}}
