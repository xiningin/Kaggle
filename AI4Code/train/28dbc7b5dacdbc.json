(The first step is definitely collecting data with good quality) \n\nAs we are using **Math** to build models most of the time, representing features with reasonable numeric values is the way to go. However, some of the raw data in real life are not like this.   \n\n**Categorical Features** \n\nCategorical Features are the features whose values are from a finite and discrete set of possible values. For example, the feature 'Sex' in our Titanic data set only has two possible values: 'male' or 'female'. These are not numeric and thus can't not directly used. Moreover, though some categorical features are numeric values, we still need to improve the representation. For example, the feature 'Pclass' in our Titanic data set only has three possible values: '1', '2' or '3'. These are numeric but it is bad pratice to directly use them. 'Pclass' is Ticket class, where\t'1' means 1st class or the best class, and '2' means 2nd or the middle class ,and '3' means 3rd or the worest class. That is equally reasonable to use '3' for the best class,  and '1' for the worest.\n\n\n\n\n**Feature Engineering** \n\nFeature Engineering is transforming raw data into feature vectors.\n\nIn this tutorial, I will demonstrate feature engieering using the Titanic data set step by step.\n\n","8e5d85a5":"Let's load the data and display how the data table looks like."}}
