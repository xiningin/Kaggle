We can do this with the `sns.distplot` command.  ","731fc6a6":"In the code cell below, we create a different histogram for each species by using the `sns.distplot` command (_as above_) three times.

There are four measurements: the sepal length and width, along with the petal length and width.  We also keep track of the corresponding species.

We can create a **two-dimensional (2D) KDE plot** with the `sns.jointplot` command.\n\nIn the plot below, the color-coding shows us how likely we are to see different combinations of sepal width and petal length, where darker parts of the figure are more likely. ","b2804f53":"One interesting pattern that can be seen in plots is that the plants seem to belong to one of two groups, where _Iris versicolor_ and _Iris virginica_ seem to have similar values for petal length, while _Iris setosa_ belongs in a category all by itself. \n\nIn fact, according to this dataset, we might even be able to classify any iris plant as *Iris setosa* (as opposed to *Iris versicolor* or *Iris virginica*) just by looking at the petal length: if the petal length of an iris flower is less than 2 cm, it's most likely to be *Iris setosa*!","ea18a042":"Note that in addition to the 2D KDE plot in the center,\n- the curve at the top of the figure is a KDE plot for the data on the x-axis (in this case, `iris_data['Petal Length (cm)']`), and\n- the curve on the right of the figure is a KDE plot for the data on the y-axis (in this case, `iris_data['Sepal Width (cm)']`).","7e842a42":"# Color-coded plots\n\nFor the next part of the tutorial, we'll create plots to understand differences between the species.

In case you're not familiar with KDE plots, you can think of it as a smoothed histogram.   \n\nTo make a KDE plot, we use the `sns.kdeplot` command.
