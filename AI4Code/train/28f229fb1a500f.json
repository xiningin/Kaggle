Simply put, the only way the sum can be 6 is if all the die rools are 1, because 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6. Whereas for 10 or 20, there is more than one way to make the sum of 6 numbers equal to 10 or 20. So the probability is definitely less likely.\n\n* This is [permutation with repetition](https:\/\/brilliant.org\/wiki\/permutations-with-repetition\/)\n\n* This kind of probability can be predictable with probability distributions as I did before, such as the binomial distribution.
