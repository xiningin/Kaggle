When a user asks a question to a search engine, instead of returning the user a whole document that contains the answer to this question, we want to be able to return the answer directly taken from that document. The motivation is that the user doesn't want to have to manually parse through the document looking for his answer.\n\n## Long Answer Candidates\n\nThe first task in *Natural Question* problems [...] is to identify the **smallest HTML bounding box** that contains all of the information required to infer the answer to a question. The candidates will therefore be bounded by the following html tags:\n- paragraphs;\n- lists;\n    * list items;\n- tables;\n     * table rows. \n\n\nIn this specific problem, **multiple** long-answer-candidates to each question were generated (presumably through an automated process).\n## Annotations\nIt is the goal of the annotators to choose the *best long answer candidate* to answer the question. This *best candidate* is the one that verifies the condition: **The smallest long-answer-candidate that answers the question.** Furthermore, if applicable, the annotators also have to specify the answer (yes or no) in case it is a yes\/no question and lastly also specify set of short answers which should answer the question in less words than the **best long-answer-candidate**, if these can be found in the text.\n\n## Challenge\n\nThe train set essentially contains a lot of manual annotations, in this challenge we want to train a model with those annotations so it learns how to annotate by itself on future questions.","5466269c":"These are candidates which were selected prior to the annotators giving their answer.
