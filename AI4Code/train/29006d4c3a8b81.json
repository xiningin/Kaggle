This combined with our own personal knowledge of how goods are priced relative to a Big Mac, we can make predictions about the denominations of money each currency uses, and the relative price of cheaper or more expensive goods.**","667cda0f":"Before doing any analysis, we need to understand what each value in the data represents and whether it is important for us to know.\n\nFor this we will be looking at the columns provided and what each of them are. ","8bbacfa4":"## Introduction\n\nThe Big Mac index is a measure to compare the purchasing power parity (PPP) - the ability to buy a certain 'basket of goods' using a fixed nominal amount of that country's money or currency - between different countries by making the basket of goods or item of purchase a Big Mac burger. This was developed by The Economist in 1986 as a way to contextualize the exchange rates and PPP values generally used for average consumers.\n\nTo further break it down... <br>\nSince the Big Mac is a burger (with a standard size, recipe, and quality) sold in many countries globally, by comparing the cost of a Big Mac in country A's currency to cost of a Big Mac in country B's currency we can compare the 'purchasing power' of both currencies (i.e. how much big mac each currency can buy). This is important because most people tend to think exchange rate and PPP are the same, but that is not the case. The exchange rate is influenced by household, business, and government activity while PPP is more specific to consumers and households. Knowing how much you can afford to buy in everyday life with a certain currency is a better measure of its value than seeing how much of a different currency it can buy.","24f5e5b7":"*Well this is a mess.*\n\nTracking the `dollar_price` of the Big Mac over time, we cannot identify trends. This may be due to the exchange rate between the USD and each other currency fluctuating resulting in what seems to be inconsistencies in price.\n\nSo, we should try using the other measures of Big Mac price given to us. Those being `adj_price` and `local_price`. These are more likely to stay consistent as they will rely less on external factors such as exchange rates.","b086b02e":"First we should see if there are any trends or major changes for different currencies over time that may indicate major economic events in those specific countries.","748cf89b":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nImage Source: [https:\/\/source.opennews.org\/articles\/how-we-made-new-big-mac-index-interactive\/](http:\/\/)","5cf00ac9":"This figure shows us how the `adj_price` for a Big Mac has changed over time.
