To ensure you can apply these techniques on your own, you will have to apply them to a new dataset (with house prices from Iowa).\n\nThe exercises use a \"notebook\" coding environment.  In case you are unfamiliar with notebooks, we have a [90-second intro video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4C2qMnaIKL4).\n\n# Exercises\n\nRun the following cell to set up code-checking, which will verify your work as you go.","c8f3a00e":"## Step 1: Loading Data\nRead the Iowa data file into a Pandas DataFrame called `home_data`.","ebb54083":"## Think About Your Data\n\nThe newest house in your data isn't that new.  A few potential explanations for this:\n1. They haven't built new houses when this data was collected.\n1. The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.\n\nIf the reason is explanation #1 above, does that affect your trust in the model you build with this data? What about if it is reason #2?\n\nHow could you dig into the data to see which explanation is more plausible?\n\nCheck out this **[discussion thread](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn-forum\/60581)** to see what others think or to add your ideas.\n\n\n**You'll get another email tomorrow so you can keep learning. See you then.**"}}
