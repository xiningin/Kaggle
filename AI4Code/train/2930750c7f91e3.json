Another common sense correlation is that between the nkill and nwound variables. \n\nMost other correlations are minor. Interestingly, there is a corrrelation between whether the individual(s) carrying out the attack were affiliated with a group. That could be due to the rise of terrorist organisations from further afield such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS, or the decline of internal groups such as the KKK or black power. I am not sure which is which. However, it is interesting to note that being affiliated to a terror organisation does not correlate with killing more people. A thing that does correlate well with killing more people on the other hand is whether or not the attack was a suicide attack. \n\n**Train Test split**\n\nNow I need to split our data to a train set (80%) and test set (20%).

I will also try to extend it, for example by predicting the kill count of terrorist attacks as well as whether they are successul. As this is the first time I have ever used Pandas and ML it will largely be a copy of his work so I encourage you to look at his original version - it also has a very good version of some of the variables. \n\nThe Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2016. It includes systematic data on terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 170,000 cases (records).\n\nThis analysis focuses on terrorist attacks in the USA during this 46-year period, which includes 2758 incidents (records). Each incident in the GTD is described with almost 58 variables.

","3afdcaf7":"**1. No max depth or max leaf nodes**","1588546a":"Intuitively, I would say that this model is pretty awful. You would not expect an attack to kill 1124 people. Hoever, you never know, an UNARMED assault may be able to kill 1065 people, especially if the unarmed assaulter is jackie chan. \n\n**Final Questions**\n\n1. How can I improve these models (clearly they could do with some improvement)?\n2. Is there a way to visualise these models?\n3. Are there any models that work better than the random forests and decision trees?\n4. Is there a way to find the ideal value for max_depth, max_leaf_nodes and n_estimators?\n5. As someone new to this field, what advice would you have on learning the ins and outs of these and other models?\n6. What should my next steps be? Are there any models I should look at or should I learn some special maths before progressing? \n\nAs I say, this is the first time I have worked with data and models so any advice, feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreaciated. \n\nAG","f1d7fb0d":"**Creating the classifier to predict successfulness**\n\nAs this is my introduction to using classifiers, I wanted to try out different possibilities. Therefore, I will create four different classifiers and compare the precision of each classifier by looking at values for FPs, FNs, TPs, TNs.\n\n> TN = The model predicts correctly a non-succesful attack\nTP = The model predicts correctly a succesful attack\nFN = The model predicts a succesful attack wrongfully to be non-succesful\nFP = The model predicts a non-succesful attack wrongfully to be succesful\n\n> The Precision(=accuracy of the positive predictions), Recall(=ratio of positive instances correctly detected by the classifier) and f1-score may be more concise metrics, however.\n\n> Precision for 'success' = TP\/(TP+FP) \nPrecision for not 'success' = TN\/(TN+FN) \n\n> Recall for 'success' = TP\/(TP+FN) \nRecall for not 'success' = TN\/(TN+FP) \n\n> The f1-score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.\n\n**1.
