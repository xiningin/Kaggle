Item Similarity Based Recommendation Engine\nTo provide a more personal recommendation to the user we need apply a recommendation engine that consider some kid of similarities between users and theirs items. In other words, it is a recommendation engine based on calculating similarities between a user's items and the other items in our dataset. Usually to define similarity among a set of items, we need a feature set on the basis of which both items can be described. In our case it will mean features of the songs on the basis of which one song can be differentiated from another. \n\nSince our dataset don't have this data, we can use the the [Jaccard index](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jaccard_index) to do an implicit similarity, based on common users, in terms of the users who listen to these songs. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:\n![image](https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/eaef5aa86949f49e7dc6b9c8c3dd8b233332c9e7)\nThe basic idea remains that if two songs are being listened to by a large fraction of common users out of the total listeners, the two songs can be said to be similar to each other. \n\nSo, we need calculate the similarity of each song in the user's list to those in our dataset, using the similarity metric defined previously, but we need attention to it can become a computation-intensive step when we have a large number of songs. To make the computation more feasible,probably you use a cluster or, in our case, we limited ours items to the most popular 5,000 songs so it is quite unlikely that we would miss out on any important recommendations.","99e26f45":"From the first graph above we can see that song title by user distribution is ***skewed***, has a **peak** on the left and a long tail to the right. It **deviates from normal distribution** and is **positively biased**.. As we expect, less than a hundred listen a good number of different songs, but enough to raise the average to above 26.\n\nFrom the **Probability Plot**, we could see that **song title by user** also does **not align with the diagonal  <span style=\"color:red\">red line<\/span>** which represent normal distribution. The form of its distribution confirm that is a skewed right. \n\nWith ***skewness positive of 4.2***, we confirm the **lack of symmetry** and indicate that song title by user are **skewed right**, as we can see too at the song title by user distribution plot, skewed right means that the right tail is **long relative to the left tail**, as we expect in counts. The skewness for a normal distribution is zero, and any symmetric data should have a skewness near zero. A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point.\n\n**Kurtosis** is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers, and **positive** kurtosis indicates a **heavy-tailed distribution** and **negative** kurtosis indicates a **light tailed distribution**. So, with 32.6 of positive kurtosis **song title by user** are heavy-tailed and definitely has **outliers**.\n\nOK, let's take a look at the distribution of the number of times users heard the most popular song.","ef940c64":"[<img src=https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KNcDSyDxhTM\/hqdefault.jpg>](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3X_cRAM4yVo)","bbce537e":"## Introduction\n### Recommendation Engines\nRecommendation engines are a way of modeling and rearranging information available about user preferences and then using this information to provide informed recommendations on the basis of that information.\n\nIt is too important for online businesses, beyond to understanding and segment the customer, which have almost no physical interaction with their customers.  Recommendation engines provide wonderful opportunities to these organizations to not only understand their clientele but also to use that information to increase their revenues. Another important advantage, you can easily integrate a  crude recommendation engine in its interaction with the users and then, on the basis of its performance, make the decision to develop a more  sophisticated version. \n\n### The Million Song Dataset\n\nThe million song dataset is a very popular dataset and is available at https:\/\/labrosa.ee.columbia.edu\/millionsong\/. The original dataset contained quantified audio features of around a million songs ranging over multiple years.\n\nAlthough we will not be using this dataset directly, we will be using some parts of it. Several other datasets were spawned from the original million song dataset. One of those datasets was called The Echonest Taste Profile Subset.

It make it easier to calculate more complex matrix operations. Matrix factorization methods, also called [matrix decompositions methods](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Matrix_decomposition), are a foundation of linear algebra in computers, even for basic operations such as solving systems of linear equations, calculating the inverse, and calculating the determinant of a matrix.\n\nMatrix factorization can be used to discover latent features between two different kinds of entities. For example, we can try to explain a song in mathematical terms by measuring its beats, tempo, and other such features and then define similar features in terms of the user. Once we have consciously defined such \"features\", we can use them to find matches for a user based on some similarity criteria. You can use matrix factorization to discover these latent features and they seem to work great.\n\nThe starting point of any matrix factorization-based method is the utility matrix, a matrix of user Vs item dimension. Not, this is a sparse matrix, since not all item is used by the user. The process of matrix factorization means finding out a low rank approximation of the utility matrix. So we want to break down the utility matrix U into two low rank matrices so that we can recreate the matrix U by multiplying those two matrices:\n\nAssuming the process helps us identify latent factors\/features, meaning as K, our aim is to find two matrices X and Y such that their product (matrix multiplication) approximates R.\n\nX = |U| x K matrix (A matrix with dimensions of num_users * factors)\n\nY = |P| x K matrix (A matrix with dimensions of factors * num_songs)\n\n![iamge](https:\/\/image.slidesharecdn.com\/dlrsworkshop-161201170151\/95\/deep-learning-for-audiobased-music-recommendation-15-638.jpg?cb=1480612282)\n\nTo make a recommendation to the user, we can multiply the corresponding user's row from the first matrix by the item matrix and determine the items from the row with maximum ratings. That will become our recommendations for the user. The first matrix represents the association between the users and the latent features, while the second matrix takes care of the associations between items (songs in our case) and the latent features.

Once we have defined the focus entity, our greatest effort will be to prepare the data according to this entity and to meet the recommended recommendation algorithm.\n\nThe choice of the algorithm also passes through the information we have, but as we have seen, even with few characteristics, we can develop systems of recommendations of diverse complexity and with expressive results for the business.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Use the original Million Song Dataset to get others features and use it on the recommendations.\n- Use others datasets and apply this methods, and extend to cases where the dataset has some hating score for the item.\n- Use a more sophisticated implementation of the matrix factorization routine.\n- Find different ways of handling it and experiment with various measures then \"implicit feedback\".\n- Use some libraries to construct the recommendation engine like scikit-surprise, lightfm, crab and rec_sys.","0e0afe5e":"So, as we can see only 118 users listen to a single song more than 200 times, but, would this be possible?\n\nLet's consider that a song has 3:30 minutes in average and create it for the two most obsessed users and check out what their songs are:","ca81ff23":"Hum, it looks like we have some users obsessed with a single song!
