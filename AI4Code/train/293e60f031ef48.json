Advocates of New York City met with success on the first point, while the Anglicans prevailed on the latter. However, all constituencies agreed to commit themselves to principles of religious liberty in establishing the policies of the College. In July 1754, Samuel Johnson held the first classes in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan. There were eight students in the class. At King's College, the future leaders of colonial society could receive an education designed to 'enlarge the Mind, improve the Understanding, polish the whole Man, and qualify them to support the brightest Characters in all the elevated stations in life.''

This is important because you can understand the attitudes, opinions and emotions of people in your data. \n\nAt a high level, sentiment analysis involves the processing of **natural language and artificial intelligence** by assuming that the actual element of the text is converted to a format that can be read by a machine, and statistics are used to determine the actual sentiment,\n\n### 2.1 Preparing the Data \n\nTo accomplish sentiment analysis computationally, we have to use techniques that will allow us to learn from data that's already been labeled. \n\nSo what's the first step? Formatting the data so that we can actually apply NLP techniques. ","5a4d87f0":"***Awesome stuff!*** But if we want to take it a step further, we can. We've previously learned what **lemmas are** - if you want to obtain the lemmas for a given **synonym set**, you can use the following method:","0c8ac9f3":"Even more, you can do things like get the definition of a word: ","9d827a27":"Note that the X and Y named entitities types all match with one another! Object type matching is an important and required part of this process. \n\n### 5.2 Machine Learning <a id=\"52\"> <\/a>\n\nWe won't be going through an example of a machine learning based entity extraction algorithm, but it's important to note the different machine learning algorithms that can be implemented to accomplish this task of relation extraction. \n\nMost simply, Logistic Regression can be used to classify the objects that relate to one another. But additionally, algorithms like Suport Vector Machines and Random Forest could also accomplish the job. Which algorithm you ultimately choose depends on which outperforms in terms of speed and accuracy.\n\nIn summary, it's important to note that while these algorithms will likely have high accurate rates, labeling thousands of relations (and entities!) is incredibly expensive.   \n\n\n## 6.0 Sentiment Analysis<a id=\"60\"><\/a>\n\n---\n\nAs we saw in the previous tutorial, sentiment analysis refers to the use of text analysis and statistical learning to identify and extract subjective information in textual data. For our last exercise in this tutorial, we'll introduce and use linear models in the context of a sentiment analysis problem.\n\n### 6.1 Loading the Data<a id=\"61\"><\/a>\n\nFirst, we begin by loading the data.

Depending on the content of the sentence, it may be a noun or a verb.\n\nWhat happens when a text is a rhetorical instrument like sarcasm or irony? Of course, this can mislead the sentiment analyzer to misclassify a regular expression.\n\n### 4.2 Unigram Models\n\nDo you remember our word bag model from earlier? One of the features was that the word order was not taken into account. Therefore, the dictionaries can be used to map each word into true values.\n\nUnigram models are models where the order of our model makes no difference. You may be wondering why the unigram models interest us because they seem so simple without leaving their simplicity.

For example, \n\n``` \n[Pp]ython or \\Python|python\n```\n\ncould represent either <i>python<\/i> or <i>Python<\/i>. Likewise, \n\n``` \n[0123456789]\n```\n\nwould represent a single integer digit. The pipe symbols are typically used for interchangable strings, such as in the following example:\n\n```\n\\dog|cat\n```\n\n### 3.4 Ranges\n\nIf we want a regular expression to express the disjunction of a range of characters, we can use a <b>dash<\/b>. For example, instead of the previous example, we can write \n\n``` \n[0-9]\n```\nSimilarly, we can represent all characters of the alphabet with \n\n``` \n[a-z]\n```\n\n### 3.5 Exclusions\n\nBrackets can also be used to represent what an expression <b>cannot<\/b> be if you combine it with the <b>caret<\/b> sign. For example, the expression \n\n``` \n[^p]\n```\nrepresents any character, special characters included, but p.\n\n### 3.6 Question Marks \n\nQuestion marks can be used to represent the expressions containing zero or one instances of the previous character. For example, \n\n``` \n<i>\\colou?r\n```\nrepresents either <i>color<\/i> or <i>colour<\/i>. Question marks are often used in cases of plurality. For example, \n\n``` \n<i>\\computers?\n```\ncan be either <i>computers<\/i> or <i>computer<\/i>. If you want to extend this to more than one character, you can put the simple sequence within parenthesis, like this:\n\n```\n\\Feb(ruary)?\n```\nThis would evaluate to either <i>February<\/i> or <i>Feb<\/i>.\n\n### 3.7 Kleene Star\n\nTo represent the expressions containing zero or <b>more<\/b> instances of the previous character, we use an <b>asterisk<\/b> as the kleene star. To represent the set of strings containing <i>a, ab, abb, abbb, ...<\/i>, the following regular expression would be used:  \n```\n\\ab*\n```\n\n### 3.8 Wildcards\n\nWildcards are used to represent the possibility of any character and symbolized with a <b>period<\/b>. For example, \n\n```\n\\beg.n\n```\nFrom this regular expression, the strings <i>begun, begin, began,<\/i> etc., can be generated. \n\n### 3.9 Kleene+\n\nTo represent the expressions containing at <b>least<\/b> one or more instances of the previous character, we use a <b>plus<\/b> sign. To represent the set of strings containing <i>ab, abb, abbb, ...<\/i>, the following regular expression would be used:  \n\n```\n\\ab+\n```","68ce147b":"## 3.0 Regular Expressions\n---\n\nA regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a string.\n\n### 3.1 Simplest Form\n\nThe simplest form of a regular expression is a sequence of characters contained within <b>two backslashes<\/b>. For example, <i>python<\/i> would be  \n\n``` \n\\python\n```\n\n### 3.2 Case Sensitivity\n\nRegular Expressions are <b>case sensitive<\/b>, which means \n\n``` \n\\p and \\P\n```\nare distinguishable from eachother. This means <i>python<\/i> and <i>Python<\/i> would have to be represented differently, as follows: \n\n``` \n\\python and \\Python\n```\n\nWe can check these are different by running:\n","59a6e6b0":"Now, we go a step further, and **count the number of nounphrases** by **taking advantage of chunk properties.**","ed09eae4":"Using the **links and filenames** from above, we'll officially download the data using the **urlib.request.urlretrieve** method.","d6c4d01b":"\n### 4.2 nltk <a id=\"42\"><\/a>\n\nNext, we'll work through a **similar example as before, this time using the nltk module to extract the named entities through the use of chunk parsing.** As always, we begin by importing our needed modules and example:  ","47ec3230":"## 1.0 Background <a id=\"10\"><\/a>\n\n---\n\n### 1.1 Polarity Flippers<a id=\"11\"><\/a>\n\n\nPolarity flippers are words that change positive expressions into negative ones or vice versa. \n\n#### 1.1.1 Negation <a id=\"111\"><\/a>\n\nNegations directly change an expression's sentiment by preceding the word before it.

This is the case with most written textual data. \n\n### 2.2 What is Information Extraction?<a id=\"22\"><\/a>\n\nWith that said, information extraction is the means by which you acquire structured data from a given unstructured dataset. There are a number of ways in which this can be done, but generally, information extraction consists of searching for specific types of entities and relationships between those entities. \n\nAn example is being given the following text, \n\n```\nMartin received a 98% on his math exam, whereas Jacob received a 84%. Eli, who also took the same test, received an 89%. Lastly, Ojas received a 72%.\n```\nThis is clearly unstructured. It requires reading for any logical relationships to be extracted. Through the use of information extraction techniques, however, we could output structured data such as the following: \n\n```\nName     Grade\nMartin   98\nJacob    84\nEli      89\nOjas     72\n```\n\n## 3.0 Chunking<a id=\"30\"><\/a>\n\n---\nChunking is used for entity recognition and segments and labels multitoken sequences.

Since so much of the data we have available is in the **major format of text,** this is exceedingly important to data science and for Industry !\n\n* A specific common application of **NLP** is each time you use a **language conversion tool.** This techniques used to **accurately convert text from one language to another**(Like **Google Translator**) very much falls under the umbrella of **\"natural language processing.\"**\n\n### 1.3 Why is NLP a \"hard\" problem? \n\n* The language is ambiguous. Once, the explanation of a person's sentence can be very different from another person's explanation. Because of this inability to be constantly clear, it is difficult to have a NLP technique that works perfectly.\n\n### 1.4 Glossary\n\nHere is some common terminology:\n\n<b>Corpus: <\/b> (Plural: Corpora) a collection of written texts that serve as our datasets.\n\n<b>nltk: <\/b> (Natural Language Toolkit) the python module we'll be using repeatedly; it has a lot of useful built-in NLP techniques.\n\n<b>Token: <\/b> a string of contiguous characters between two spaces, or between a space and punctuation marks.
