Quite often, there are for-loop implementations used, which take unnecessary amounts of time.\n\nLet's look at the difference.","08eda2c7":"Wow, Numpy is almost 370 times faster than for-loops. This is going to save lots of time. Imagine having hundreds of features and millions of rows. Using a for-loop would unnecessariy kill your computer.","7b99826f":"Now we are going to perform the dot product of the two vectors. This is the formula used to multiply the different values of the features of a training example and the weights that the model has learned. In deep learning, this process is repeated lots and lots of times. Even simple algorithms like Linear Regression make use of this a lot.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the formula, it is basically multiplying the two vectors element wise and then summing all of the elements. Here is the for loop implementation.","360e49c0":"Wow, vectorization is almost 300 times faster than for-loops. That is impressive.","e0810ea3":"So, first let's create 2 new vectors each with 1 million rows, all with random numbers.","ad07cb47":"# Introduction\n\nSo we all have heard of matrices and vectors, and we use numpy all the time. But what is the importance of it. Why can't we just use a for-loop instead of using the numpy syntax, np.(function_name here). The difference is in performance.\n\nIn this notebook, I will be running only dot products and element wise multiplication. Feel free to fork the notebook and try different input sizes, or different commonly used operations.\n\nVectorized implementations (numpy) are much faster and more efficient as compared to for-loops. To really see HOW large the difference is, let's try some simple operations used in most machine learnign algorithms (especially deep learning).","9ae9360b":"Another important operation is just multiplying the two vectors element wise. Let's see the difference between the for-loop and vectorized version for this.","ee920c77":"# Element Wise multiplication","d9596b67":"I will be using a for-loop to iterate through all of the input sizes (excuse me).","37fb5a40":"# Element Wise Matrix Multiplication\n\nNow let's investigate element wise matrix multiplication. Since this will have a complexity of O(n2), I will use smaller matrix sizes (just enough to see a good difference, but not too large).","9e46be74":"# Dot Products","736b07a5":"Now the vectorized implementation.","5eafbefc":"My God!! Look at the way the for-loop implementation grows and compare that with numpy. Numpy is almost flat, but for loop grows drastically (by the way, the graph actually grows linearly, I have just made the x-axis logarithmic as it makes reading the plot a lot easier.\n\n\n# Summary\n\nIf you are curious, for-loop looks like it is following the time-complexity of O(N). Numpy however, is basically following a complexity of O(1). \n\nMost real-world datasets used for ML\/AI use millions or billions of rows. As you can see from the plot, using vectorized implementations can save a lot of time.\n\n\n\nSo I just have 1 final request: Please use vectorized implementations using numpy or pandas whenever you can. Try to avoid using for-loops, it will save you a lot of time (and money if you use servers).\n\n\nI hoped you like this simple analysis of why you should try using numpy (make friends with the library. It will reward you).","150ad7ca":"# Multiplication by a Scalar","302b2d44":"Wow, vectorized implementation is roughtly 600 times faster!

This way, we can actually compare how each method's time complexity grows."}}
