(right ascension) and Dec (declination) are the coordinates on the sky that correspond to longitude and latitude on Earth. RA measures east and west on the celestial sphere and is like longitude on the Earth. Dec measures north and south on the celestial sphere and is like latitude on the Earth.\n\n* RA is measured in hours minutes and seconds of time. The reason for this is the sky turns once a day to the west as the earth rotates to the east. The celestial sphere moves one hour of RA west per hour of time and 24 hours of RA during the course of the whole day. Since this is a 360 degree rotation, one hour of RA is equal to 15 degrees of turning (360\/24 = 15). Just like lines of longitude, RA lines are also great circles converging on the north and south celestial poles.\n\n* Longitude has the Greenwich meridian as the zero line dividing east and west. On the sky, the zero meridian in RA is labeled 00h 00m 00s. It intersects the celestial equator at a point called the vernal equinox (where the Sun crosses the celestial equator in late March of each year).\n\n* Measurements north and south on the sky are called declinations (commonly abbreviated as Dec, DEC or dec). Just like latitude, declination is measured in degrees, minutes and seconds north (positive) and south (negative), with 60 minutes in each degree and 60 seconds in each minute of declination.\n\n#### WHAT IS GALACTIC LATITUDE AND GALACTIC LONGITUDE\n\n* The galactic coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system in spherical coordinates, with the Sun as its center, the primary direction aligned with the approximate center of the Milky Way Galaxy, and the fundamental plane parallel to an approximation of the galactic plane but offset to its north. It uses the right-handed convention, meaning that coordinates are positive toward the north and toward the east in the fundamental plane\n\n**Galactic Latitude**\n\n* Latitude measures the angle of an object northward of the galactic equator (or midplane) as viewed from Earth. Analogous to terrestrial latitude, galactic latitude is usually measured in degrees (\u00b0)\n\n**Galactic Longitude**\n\n* The galactic coordinates use the Sun as the origin. Galactic longitude (l) is measured with primary direction from the Sun to the center of the galaxy in the galactic plane, while the galactic latitude (b) measures the angle of the object above the galactic plane. Longitude measures the angular distance of an object eastward along the galactic equator from the galactic center. Analogous to terrestrial longitude, galactic longitude is usually measured in degrees (\u00b0).\n\n#### WHAT IS ECLIPTIC LATITUDE AND ECLIPTIC LONGITUDE\n\n* The equatorial coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system widely used to specify the positions of celestial objects. It may be implemented in spherical or rectangular coordinates, both defined by an origin at the centre of Earth, a fundamental plane consisting of the projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere (forming the celestial equator), a primary direction towards the vernal equinox, and a right-handed convention\n\n* A star's spherical coordinates are often expressed as a pair, right ascension and declination, without a distance coordinate. The direction of sufficiently distant objects is the same for all observers, and it is convenient to specify this direction with the same coordinates for all. In contrast, in the horizontal coordinate system, a star's position differs from observer to observer based on their positions on the Earth's surface, and is continuously changing with the Earth's rotation.\n\n* Telescopes equipped with equatorial mounts and setting circles employ the equatorial coordinate system to find objects. Setting circles in conjunction with a star chart or ephemeris allow the telescope to be easily pointed at known objects on the celestial sphere.","30a6e1c9":"#### PRIMARY","2ab6a15d":"# MESSIER 91 - NGC 4548\n\n* Messier 91 (also known as NGC 4548 or M91) is a barred spiral galaxy that is found in the south of Coma Berenices. It is in the local supercluster and is part of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. It is about 60 million light-years away from our galaxy. It was the last of a group of eight \"nebulae\" \u2013 - the term 'galaxy' only coming into use for these objects once it was realized in the 20th century that they were extragalactic \u2013 discovered by Charles Messier in 1781.\n\n* Because of a bookkeeping error by Messier, M91 was for a long time one of the few missing entries in the Messier catalog, not matching any known object in the sky. It was not until 1969 that amateur astronomer William C. Williams realized that M91 was NGC 4548, which was catalogued by William Herschel in 1784. Some sources contend the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4571 was considered as a candidate for this object by Herschel\n\n![](https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/full_width\/public\/thumbnails\/image\/m91_wfc3_4_crop_v2_final-with-tag.jpg?itok=7WPZMHms)\n\n* The spiral galaxy M91 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781. It was the last of the nine objects (M84\u2013M92) that Messier added to his catalog on a single night in March. Located 60 million light-years from Earth with an apparent magnitude of only 11, M91 is one of the faintest objects in Messier\u2019s catalog. In a dark sky, the galaxy can be spotted with medium-sized telescopes in the constellation Coma Berenices most easily during May.\n\n* M91 is one of over a thousand galaxies that make up the Virgo cluster \u2014 a group of galaxies that are gravitationally bound to one another. It is an anemic galaxy, meaning that it has a lower rate of star formation compared to other spiral galaxies.\n\n* This image of M91 combines ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths. It was taken by Hubble\u2019s Wide Field Camera 3 as part of an effort to explore the connections between young stars and cold gas in a variety of nearby galaxies.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/side_image\/public\/thumbnails\/image\/m91-wide.png?itok=Y7JcDo5q)\n\n* This image is composed of Hubble observations taken in visible and infrared light by the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. It captures a small portion of M91, highlighting the galaxy\u2019s lack of red-colored star-forming regions. These regions of molecular hydrogen are common in other spiral galaxies.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/full_width\/public\/thumbnails\/image\/m91.jpg?itok=e2YtOPDL)\n\n\n#### WHAT IS ANEMIC GALAXY\n\n* An anemic galaxy is a type of spiral galaxy characterized by a low contrast between its spiral arms and its disk.\n* The term was coined in 1976 by the Canadian astronomer Sidney van den Bergh to classify galaxies that are an intermediate form between the gas-rich, star-forming spiral galaxies and the gas-poor, inactive lenticular galaxies.","1844a0a6":"### PATH","8a7f6ce5":"# PACKAGES AND LIBRARIES","aca42fb5":"### SPECTRAL RANGES","d98f6196":"#### HST OPTICAL TYPES","46d0c84f":"#### PARSEC AND PARALLAX","e6826101":"* MPC = MEGAPARSEC\n* A megaparsec is a measurement of distance equal to one million parsecs or 3.26 million light years","42fa8892":"#### NEAR INFRARED","cb889660":"# FITS READING\n\n#### WHAT IS FITS FILES?\n\n* Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) is an open standard defining a digital file format useful for storage, transmission and processing of data: formatted as multi-dimensional arrays (for example a 2D image), or tables FITS is the most commonly used digital file format in astronomy. The FITS standard was designed specifically for astronomical data, and includes provisions such as describing photometric and spatial calibration information, together with image\n\n#### FITS IMAGES\n\n* The earliest and still most commonly used type of FITS data is an image header\/data block. The term 'image' is somewhat loosely applied, as the format supports data arrays of arbitrary dimension\u2014normal image data are usually 2-D or 3-D, with the third dimension representing for example time or the color plane. The data themselves may be in one of several integer and floating-point formats, specified in the header.\n\n* FITS image headers can contain information about one or more scientific coordinate systems that are overlaid on the image itself. Images contain an implicit Cartesian coordinate system that describes the location of each pixel in the image, but scientific uses usually require working in 'world' coordinates, for example the celestial coordinate system. As FITS has been generalized from its original form, the world coordinate system (WCS) specifications have become more and more sophisticated: early FITS images allowed a simple scaling factor to represent the size of the pixels; but recent versions of the standard permit multiple nonlinear coordinate systems, representing arbitrary distortions of the image. The WCS standard includes many different spherical projections, including, for example, the HEALPix spherical projection widely used in observing the cosmic microwave background radiation.","07f1ac0d":"### MASKING","727d3101":"### INFORMATIONS","eedfa13f":"#### +\/- REDSHIFT","3b2948ca":"### OBSERVATION IMAGE","ba894d57":"### GETTING IMAGE","48f6c40d":"### READING","d0286042":"#### KPC (KILOPARSECS) PROPER PER ARCMIN","dfa14a0f":"# MATH SHEET\n\n#### FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF DISTANCE IN ASTRONOMY\n\n\"A star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond has a distance of 1 Parsec.\"\n\n* 1 parsec (pc) is equivalent to:\n\n206,265 AU\n\n3.26 Light Years\n\n3.086x1013 km\n\n* 1 light year (ly) is equivalent to:\n\n0.31 pc\n\n63,270 AU\n\n#### GENERAL CONSTANTS\n\n* Speed of Light = c = 3 \u02c6 108 m\/s\n* Gravitational Constant = G = 6.67 * 10 ** -11N m2\/kg2\n* Mass of Earth = MC = 5.97 * 10 ** 24 kg\n* Radius of Earth = RC = 6378 km\n* Mass of the sun = M@ = 1.99 * 10 ** 30 kg\n* Radius of the sun = R@ = 6.96 * 10 ** 5 km\n* Effective Temperature of the sun = T@ = 5778 K\n* Luminosity of the sun = L@ = 3.9 * 10 ** 26W\n* Mass of the Moon = MK = 7.346 * 10 ** 22 kg\n* Radius of the Moon = RK = 1738.1 km\n* Mass of a proton = mp = 1.6726 * 10 ** -27 kg\n* Mass of an Electron = me = 9.109 * 10 ** -31 kg\n* Hubble\u2019s Constant = H0 = 70 km\/s\/Mpc (Note: There is ongoing debate about the actual value)\n* Planck\u2019s Constant = h = 6.626 * 10 ** -34 J s\n* Type Ia Supernova Absolute Magnitude = -19.3\n\n#### GENERAL CONVERSIONS\n\n* 1 Astronomical Unit = 1 AU = 1.5 * 10 ** 8 km\n* 1 Parsec = 1 pc = 3.09 * 10 ** 13km = 3.26 ly\n* 1 Light Year = 1 ly = 9.46 * 10 ** 12km\n* Arc Minute = 11 = p\n* 1 year = 31.557.600 seconds\n* 1 Megaton (energy) = 1.000.000 tons of TNT = 4.184 * 10 ** 15 J\n\n#### LIGHT INTENSITY\n\n* LI = 1 \/ DISTANCE FROM EARTH ** 2\n\n#### VACUUM FREQUENCY\n\nf = c\/\u03bb\n\n* f = Wave frequency (Hz)\n* c = Speed of Light (m\/s)\n* \u03bb = wavelength (m)\n\n#### ORBIT ECCENTRICITY\n\ne = c\/a\n\n* e = Orbital Eccentricity\n* c = Distance from focus to center\n* a = semimajor axis\n\n#### PARALLAX\n\nd = 1\/p\n\n* d = Distance (pc)\n* p = Parallax Angle (arcseconds)\n\n#### HUBBLE'S LAW\n\nv = H0 . d\n\n* v = Recessional velocity (km\/s)\n* H0 = Hubble\u2019s Constant\n* d = Distance\n\n\n#### WHAT IS RADIAL VELOCITY\n\n* The radial velocity of an object with respect to a given point is the rate of change of the distance between the object and the point. That is, the radial velocity is the component of the object's velocity that points in the direction of the radius connecting the point and the object. In astronomy, the point is usually taken to be the observer on Earth, so the radial velocity then denotes the speed with which the object moves away from the Earth (or approaches it, for a negative radial velocity).\n\n#### WHAT IS REDSHIFT\n\n* In physics, a redshift is an increase in the wavelength, and corresponding decrease in the frequency and photon energy, of electromagnetic radiation (such as light). The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and simultaneous increase in frequency and energy, is known as a negative redshift, or blueshift. The terms derive from the colours red and blue which form the extremes of the visible light spectrum.\n\nIn astronomy and cosmology, the three main causes of electromagnetic redshift are\n\n* The radiation travels between objects which are moving apart (\"relativistic\" redshift, an example of the relativistic Doppler effect)\n* The radiation travels towards an object in a weaker gravitational potential, i.e. towards an object in less strongly curved (flatter) spacetime (gravitational redshift)\n* The radiation travels through expanding space (cosmological redshift). The observation that all sufficiently distant light sources show redshift corresponding to their distance from Earth is known as Hubble's law.\n\n![](http:\/\/www.ifa.hawaii.edu\/users\/acowie\/class05\/h10_2.jpg)\n\n* The angstrom or \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m is a metric unit of length equal to 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m; that is, one ten-billionth of a metre, 0.1 nanometre, or 100 picometres. Its symbol is \u00c5, a letter of the Swedish alphabet. The \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m is not a part of the SI system of units, but it can be considered part of the metric system in general\n\n* The spectrum of a galaxy allows you to measure its redshift. In the spectrum above there is continuum light, some absorption lines (e.g. near 7600 A) and some emission lines that are named. The absorption near 7600 A actually comes from light interacting with the Earth's atmosphere, but the emission lines come from glowing gas in the galaxy in the HDF. H alpha is the red Balmer line of neutral hydrogen, O III comes from doubly ionized oxygen, and O II from singly ionized oxygen.\n\n* REST WAVELENGTH :\n\n(normal wavelength observed when not moving in relation to the source) The rest wavelength of a source of electromagnetic radiation is the wavelength as observed if at rest in relation to the radiation source\n\n* OBSERVED WAVELENGTH :\n\nThe observed wavelength \u03bbobs of electromagnetic radiation is longer (called a \u201cred shift\u201d) than that emitted by the source when the source moves away from the observer. Similarly, the wavelength is shorter (called a \u201cblue shift\u201d) when the source moves toward the observer\n\n\n* redshift = (Observed wavelength \/ rest wavelength) -1\n\n* 6 REDSHIFT: 1 BILLION YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n* 8 REDSHIFT: 700 MILLION YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n* 10 REDSHIFT: 500 MILLION YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n#### WHAT IS COMOVING DISTANCE\n\n* In standard cosmology, comoving distance and proper distance are two closely related distance measures used by cosmologists to define distances between objects. Proper distance roughly corresponds to where a distant object would be at a specific moment of cosmological time, which can change over time due to the expansion of the universe. Comoving distance factors out the expansion of the universe, giving a distance that does not change in time due to the expansion of space (though this may change due to other, local factors, such as the motion of a galaxy within a cluster).\n\n* Comoving distance and proper distance are defined to be equal at the present time. At other times, the Universe's expansion results in the proper distance changing, while the comoving distance remains constant.\n\n#### WHAT IS LUMINOSITY DISTANCE\n\n* Luminosity distance DL is defined in terms of the relationship between the absolute magnitude M and apparent magnitude m of an astronomical object.\n\n* Where DL is measured in parsecs. For nearby objects (say, in the Milky Way) the luminosity distance gives a good approximation to the natural notion of distance in Euclidean space.\n\n* The relation is less clear for distant objects like quasars far beyond the Milky Way since the apparent magnitude is affected by spacetime curvature, redshift, and time dilation. Calculating the relation between the apparent and actual luminosity of an object requires taking all of these factors into account. The object's actual luminosity is determined using the inverse-square law and the proportions of the object's apparent distance and luminosity distance.\n\n* Another way to express the luminosity distance is through the flux-luminosity relationship.\n\n### Luminosity of a star:\n\n* Total energy output\n* independent of distance\n\n#### Apparent Brightness of a star depends upon:\n\n* distance\n* luminosity\n\n#### Intrinsic Luminosity:\n\n* Measures the Total Energy Output by the star in Watts\n* Distance Independent (it is a physical property of the star itself)\n\n#### Apparent Brightness:\n\n* Measures how bright the star appears to be as seen from a distance.\n* Depends on the distance to the star\n\n* The Apparent Brightness of a source is a consequence of geometry. As light rays emerge from a source, they spread out in area\n\n* The Apparent Brightness (B) of a source is inversely proportional to the square of its distance (d)\n\n* At a particular Luminosity, the more distant an object is, the fainter its apparent brightness becomes as the square of the distance\n\n* B = 1 \/ d **

Closer = Brighter\n\nMove 2x closer to a light source, It will appear 22=4 times brighter.\n\n* Farther = Fainter\n\nMove 2x further away from a light source, It will appear 22=4 times fainter\n\n* The process of measuring the apparent brightnesses of objects is called Photometry.\n\n#### Two ways to express apparent brightness:\n\n* Stellar Magnitudes\n* Absolute Fluxes (energy per second per area)\n* Both are used interchangeably by astronomers\n\n#### The modern system of magnitudes defines them as follows:\n\n* 5 steps of magnitude = factor of 100 in brightness\n* Bigger magnitude = fainter star\n* The standard of brightness is the star Vega (0th magnitude)\n* Unlike the qualitative system of Hipparchus, the modern magnitude system defines the standard of brightness as the bright star Vega (brightest star in the summer constellation of Lyra), and precisely defines the interval of magnitude. This quantification was done in the 19th century and refined throughout the 20th century.\n\nExamples:\n\n* 10th mag star is 100x fainter than a 5th mag star.\n* 20th mag star is 10,000x fainter than a 10th mag star.\n* Faintest stars measured this far are ~30th magnitude.\n\n#### Count the photons received from a star using a light-sensitive detector:\n\n* Photographic Plates (old-school: 1880s to 1960s)\n* Photoelectric Photometer (photomultiplier tube: 1930s to 1990s)\n* Solid State Detector (e.g., photodiodes or CCDs)\n\n#### Measuring Luminosity\n\nTo measure the Luminosity of a star you need 2 measurements:\n\n* The Apparent Brightness (flux) measured via photometry, and the Distance to the star measured in some way together with the inverse square law of brightness, you can compute the Luminosity\n\nL = 4 \u03c0 d2 B\n\n* The biggest source of difficulty, as usual in Astronomy, is measuring the distance accurately\n* In practice, we can use sensitive electronic instruments and photometry to measure the apparent brightnesses of many hundreds of millions of stars. But, we have good distances (parallaxes) for only about 100,000 stars. Only that number of stars have direct estimates of their Luminosities. Since Luminosity depends on distance squared, small errors in distance are effectively doubled (a 10% distance gives a 20% luminosity).","a2250ea9":"#### DISTANCE"}}
