Here is more info on [resnet models](https:\/\/github.com\/KaimingHe\/deep-residual-networks). We'll be studying them in depth later, but for now we'll focus on using them effectively.\n\nHere's how to train and evalulate a *dogs vs cats* model in 3 lines of code, and under 20 seconds:","9bf75411":"Let's create a new `data` object that includes this augmentation in the transforms.","048a3d94":"## Analyzing results: loss and accuracy","9c3ceab0":"`PATH` is the path to your data - if you use the recommended setup approaches from the lesson, you won't need to change this. `sz` is the size that the images will be resized to in order to ensure that the training runs quickly. We'll be talking about this parameter a lot during the course. Leave it at `224` for now.","f7c07915":"Welcome to the first week of the second deep learning certificate! We're going to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to allow our computer to see - something that is only possible thanks to deep learning."}}
