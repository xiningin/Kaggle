China, the epicenter of the pandemic, has the highest reported cases of COVID-19 at more than 80,800 as of March 17, according to worldometer. Italy has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases at nearly 28,000 cases.\n\"Those are not just things, there are expertly trained healthcare workers who man those domains. There just isn't enough of these resources than what we anticipate needing,\"\n\nFour primary ethical challenges in the healthcare sector:\n\n#TREATMENT\n\nWith treatment\u2014we are talking about ICUs, ventilators, and the staff\u2014the purpose is you are trying to save the severely sick. You are trying to save as many of the severely sick as you can.\" Rationing of critical care resources would be jarring for U.S. clinical staff.\nit is entirely feasible that you would be removing people from ventilators knowing that they are going to die. But you remove people from ventilators when your evaluation of the medical situation suggests that patients are not improving. If a patient is not improving,then you try it out on another patient who might have better luck,\" \n\n#TESTING\n\nThe primary purpose of the test is pure public health epidemiology. It's about keeping track of who has COVID-19 in service of trying to limit the spread of the disease to other people. It's about who is more likely to interact with lots of people, or who is more likely to have interacted with more people.\"\n\n#HEALTHCARE WORKERS \n\nThey have a set of obligations that inclines them to go to work when they get the call. On the other hand, healthcare workers have their own interests\u2014they don't want to get sick, which can incline them not to work. There is an `ethical consensus` that healthcare workers have a prima facie duty to work because of everything that has been invested in them, because of their unique position where not just anybody can replace them, because society looks to them to serve this function, and because they went into this profession and are expected to go into work. However, the obligation of healthcare workers to show up for their jobs is not absolute, Tabery says. \"If hospitals don't have personal protective equipment, they are in no position to tell their staff to show up and work. If a hospital cannot provide even a basic level of safety for their employees to do their job, then they are turning their hospital not into a place to treat patients\u2014they are turning it into a hub to exacerbate the problem.\"\n\n#VACCINE\n\nWhen a vaccine becomes available, policymakers, public health officials, and healthcare providers will face rationing decisions until there is sufficient supply to treat the entire population.The first group you are going to want to prioritize are healthcare workers, who are at risk of getting infected by doing their jobs and saving lives. You would also want to prioritize people who serve essential functions to keep society going\u2014the people who keep the water running, the lights on, police, and firefighters. Then you want to start looking at the high-risk groups,\"\n\nChristopher Cheney is the senior clinical care\u200b editor at HealthLeaders.https:\/\/www.healthleadersmedia.com\/clinical-care\/4-ethical-dilemmas-healthcare-organizations-during-covid-19-pandemic","817cd130":"fox35orlando.com","663f3466":"CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\n  The name, address, telephone and email address of a contact person F.

Guidance for managing ethical issues in infectious disease outbreaks have been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), and includes guidelines on allocating resources, research during infectious disease outbreaks, and the emergency use of unproven interventions outside of research, but again there was no specific guidance on the ethical review of proposals for research during epidemic and emergency situations. 26 A training manual by the WHO on 'Ethics in epidemics, emergencies and disasters: Research, surveillance and patient care', provides an overview on ethics in epidemics, emergencies, and disasters, and seeks to increase core competencies in research and their ethical implications in emergencies, what qualifies as 'research' during emergency responses and would normally qualify for ethics review, and to identify the shortcomings of current normative instruments for use in emergency situations and evaluate alternatives. 27 However, it does not provide a model for communication and collaboration between research ethics committees during emergency situations, nor a standard application form or template to be used for the ethical review of research during emergency conditions. The results of our literature review indicate that there is guidance existing regarding emergency situations with regard to operations under surveillance, and some specific guidance for research in emergency situations. However, no publications exist that could be used to guide research committees regarding expediting research in epidemic or emergency conditions, nor on collaborating when multi-centre research in disaster or emergency situations will be conducted within their jurisdictions.","131cc1a5":"'Bureaucracy, caution, and legal issues provide parameters, and may cause delays in the matter. Rules and guidelines will therefore be necessary to guide the process. A specific template should exist which would be activated during an emergency or epidemic infection.","a256ad53":"Various forms of research are essential in emergency, disaster and disease outbreak situations, but challenges exist including the long length of time it takes to get research proposals approved. Consequently, it would be very advantageous to have an acceptable model for efficient coordination and communication between and among research ethics committees\/IRBs and ministries of health, and templates for expediting (done with speed and efficiency) ethical review of research proposals in emergency and epidemic situations to be used across the Caribbean and in other low and middle income countries. This project involved a literature search and the interviewing of ministry of health officials, public health practitioners, and research ethics committee\/IRB members in Jamaica and St. Lucia, to obtain suggestions for the best model for efficient coordination and communication between research ethics committees (RECs), and developed a template for expediting review of research protocols in epidemic and emergency conditions. K E Y W O R D S research in emergency, ethics review, research ethics, research protocols, research ethics committee \/ IRB, ministry of health'\n\nResearch during these situations could be invaluable, and sometimes has highly beneficial outcomes that include preventive vaccines and speedy treatment to minimize harm. As new and emerging epidemic infections are now occurring regularly in the global village, perhaps a permanent committee in each country that is prepared to address matters of research may be one solution to the current challenges for research in epidemic and emergency situations. The aim should be to minimize harm by saving lives as well as the efficient use of all resources.\n\n\n","3f009c6e":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata @mpwolke","3d63b154":"oregon.gov"}}
