To keep things clear, we'll do this per data type. ","cffafa33":"This is the third time that I've rewritten the kernel of [Data Preparation & Exploration](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/bertcarremans\/data-preparation-exploration) made by [Bert Carrenmans](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/bertcarremans).","f1daa634":"ps_car_12 and ps_car_14","27bf9cfa":"### Checking the cardinality of the categorical variables\n\nCardinality refers to the number of different values in a variable. As we will create dummy variables from the categorical variables later on, we need to check whether there are variables with many distinct values. We should handle these variables differently as they would result in many dummy variables. ","4aea3ab0":"We indeed see the following:\n\n- binary variables\n- categorical variables of which the category values are integers\n- other variables with integer or float values\n- variables with -1 representing missing values\n- the target variable and an ID variable\n\nLet's look at the number of rows and columns in the train data. ","d1ff507a":"### Feature scaling\n\nAs mentioned before, we can apply standard scaling to the training data. Some classifiers perform better when this is done. ","e6cd6382":"## Loading data","6243fec9":"As we can see from the variables with missing values, it is a good idea to keep the missing values as a separate category value, instead of replacing them by the mode for instance. The customers with a missing value appear to have a much higher (in some cases much lower) probability to ask for an insurance claim. ","85e4d34a":"### Selecting features with a Random Forest and SelectFromModel\n\nHere we'll base feature selection on the feature importances of a random forest. With Sklearn's SelectFromModel you can then specify how many variables you want to keep. You can set a threshold on the level of feature importance manually. But we'll simply select the top 50% best variables. \n\nThe code in the cell below is borrowed from the GitHub repo of Sebastian Raschka. This repo contains code samples of his book Python Machine Learning, which is an absolute must to read. ","c1a0b901":"- Only one missing variable: ps_car_11\n- We could apply scaling to deal with the different ranges","2895acfa":"So, creating dummy variables adds 52 variables to the training set. "}}
