Before understanding the plot, let us see what exactly correlation is.\n\nPOSITIVE CORRELATION: If an increase in feature A leads to increase in feature B, then they are positively correlated. A value 1 means perfect positive correlation.\n\nNEGATIVE CORRELATION: If an increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated. A value -1 means perfect negative correlation.\n\nNow lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as MultiColinearity as both of them contains almost the same information.\n\nSo do you think we should use both of them as one of them is redundant. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n\nNow from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated.

There are lot of predictive modelling algorithms to choose from. We must understand the type of problem and solution requirement to narrow down to a select few models which we can evaluate. Our problem is a classification and regression problem. We want to identify relationship between output (Survived or not) with other variables or features (Gender, Age, Port...). We are also perfoming a category of machine learning which is called supervised learning as we are training our model with a given dataset. With these two criteria - Supervised Learning plus Classification and Regression, we can narrow down our choice of models to a few. These include:\n\nLogistic Regression\n\nKNN\n\nSupport Vector Machines\n\nNaive Bayes classifier\n\nDecision Tree\n\nRandom Forrest\n\nLinear Discriminant Analysis\n\nAda Boost Classifier \n\nGradient Boosting Classifier\n\nAnd also compared above given classifiers and evaluate the mean accuracy of each of them by a stratified kfold cross validation procedure and plot accuracy based confusion matrix","1be9eb02":"### Feature engineering\n\nFeature engineering is the art of converting raw data into useful features. There are several feature engineering techniques that you can apply to be an artist. A comprehensive list of them is presented by Heaton (2016). We will use just two techniques:\n\nBox-Cox transformations (Box & Cox 1964)\n\nPolynomials generation through non-linear expansions.\nBefore the application of these techniques, we will just make some adjustments to the data, in order to prepare it for the modelling process.","d496b7e7":"## LogisticRegression","ccac71ba":"### Identifying Missing Value ","efbd5186":"###  result","c48f1b57":"The data has been split into two groups:\n\ntraining set (train.csv)\ntest set (test.csv)\nThe training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d) for each passenger. Your model will be based on \u201cfeatures\u201d like passengers\u2019 gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n\n### Data Dictionary\nVariable\tDefinition\tKey\n\nsurvival\tSurvival\t0 = No, 1 = Yes\n\npclass\tTicket class\t1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd\n\nsex\tMale or Female\n\nAge\tAge in years\t\n\nsibsp\t# of siblings \/ spouses aboard the Titanic\t\n\nparch\t# of parents \/ children aboard the Titanic\t\n\nticket\tTicket number\t\n\nfare\tPassenger fare\t\n\ncabin\tCabin number\t\n\nembarked\tPort of Embarkation\tC = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton\n\nVariable Notes\npclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n1st = Upper\n2nd = Middle\n3rd = Lower\n\nage: Age is fractional if less than 1.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. That's why the name DieTanic. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget.\n\nIt took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.\n\nThe Objective of this notebook is to give an idea how is the workflow in any predictive modeling problem. How do we check features, how do we add new features and some Machine Learning Concepts. I have tried to keep the notebook as basic as possible so that even newbies can understand every phase of it.\n\nIf You Like the notebook and think that it helped you **PLEASE UPVOTE**.
