As long as I've been studying Data Science and Machine Learning, I always saw Kaggle as one of the greates ways to learn more about everything related on these two topics. So here I am!","92f43129":"# Data Prep","95a7057b":"The insights we can take from the plot above are:\n\n* People with `little` saving account and checking account presents higher risk;\n* When customers take some credit for `vacation\/others`, it's a sign that the risk could be high;\n* People who have their own house have lower risk","e087341d":"It's really interesting to see the three main group on the data when we look at `age` and `duration` features. To present you some description with that I thought on:\n\n* **Group 1 (purple):** Here we have young people (from 18 to 40 years approximately) who usually request short term loans (from 0 to 30 years approximately).\n\n* **Group 2 (yellow):** On the cluster above the others, we have people who take loans for a long time (higher than 30 years).\n\n* **Group 3 (green):** The third cluster have older people (with age higher than 40) and short term loans.","bc65b3aa":"If you like this kernel, please **upvote**!","bac3b9ae":"## Insights from Data","a80634e8":"## Clustering Data","49f59930":"### Age and Duration","b70224cb":"Here we will answear the following questions:\n    - What's the content of data?\n    - How are the numerical attributes distributed?\n    - How are the categorical attributes distributed?\n    - What's the influence of Risk and Credit Amount in other features?\n    - Is there any other pattern that may be related to credit risk?","efb21a5a":"___\n* _Looking at score (proba) distribution for a specific model_\n___","95f79a55":"# Reading and Exploring the Data","b16dc220":"## Categorical Features Analysis","e02686fc":"At least, let's prepare a dictionary with the instances of our classifiers and the respective hyperparameters","ee3f59e1":"___\n* _Distribution by risk_\n___","dca922c8":"___\n* _Looking at the feature importance of a specific model_\n___","e0c58da2":"___\n* _For what purpose people tend to apply for higher amount loans in average?

Meanwhile this purpose is only the 6th in terms of total amount given by the loan establishment.\n\nBy the way, people who request credit for `car` purpose representes the main public for the bank\/loan establishment.","c18daa3a":"It seems we finally have a final dataset to analyze a classifying model. Our goal here is to use the features we prepared to predict the loan risk and, for that, we will go through evaluation metrics, ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix and other tools to show how good our models really are.","c2a6f954":"___\n* _Quantity for each category_\n___","3ed61db2":"___\n* _Distribution_\n___","12b71516":"___\n* _Learning curve for a specific model_\n___","52987ebe":"___\n* _Plotting the ROC Curve for the classifiers (train and test)_\n___","db23cb6a":"An overview of the data.","4bf533ad":"### Credit Amount and Duration","4ebd5e55":"___\n* _Is there any purpose in particular with long duration credit requests?_\n___","73ec710a":"**UPDATE:** I just finished my \"German Credit Risk Project\" with a DevOps approach for training a Machine Learning model and scoring production data received for a source. The idea is to simulate what we get in practice. So if you want to take a look at it, please visit my github at [ThiagoPaniniGithub](https:\/\/github.com\/ThiagoPanini\/kaggle_challenges\/tree\/master\/kernels\/01_german_credit_risk) - you will see that the project strucuture have a `\/dev`, `\/models`, `\/pipelines`, `\u00b4\/prod` and other folders, simulating what I consider an organized Machine Learning project for real. The scripts we can pay attention is the `train.py` (for reading the data, building pipelines and training a model) and the `score.py` (for receiving new data, applying the pipelines and scoring the data using the trained model).\n\nI really like you enjoy! At the end of this notebook you can see a little taste of it.","a5c0fadd":"___\n* _How the duration of loan requests are associated with age and credit amount?_\n___","b74a396b":"By looking at the graphs and the model results, it seems we've done a good work on preparing and training the data. By the end, the model LightGBM showd us the best performance among the classifiers used on analysis. Meanwhile, the model **learning curve** shows us that there is space for improvement: the high gap between training scores and validation scores is a proxy that the model could is overfitting the data and so we could work on that to raise up the validation score metric.\n\nFor the next steps, thinking on putting this model on production, we could encapsulate every step in a pipeline and build a python script to receive some entrance base and return the instance score or the instance prediction based on the business problem.","e7e9c3fa":"These categorical analysis provided an overview of our dataset in terms of quantity. For each categorical column, now is possible to know what are the marjority ones. Meanwhile, to give more power to the analysis, let's separate each categorical entry into the risk approach.","158f2eb2":"In this session, we will select some useful features to split the data into different clusters. The aim is to present a better way to understanding the relationship between features and to study how our public could be splitted into clusters.","a4749280":"<font size=\"+1\" color=\"black\"><b>Please visit my other kernels by clicking on the buttons<\/b><\/font><br>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/thiagopanini\/predicting-restaurant-s-rate-in-bengaluru\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" style=\"color:white;\">Bengaluru's Restaurants<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/thiagopanini\/sentimental-analysis-on-e-commerce-reviews\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" style=\"color:white;\">Sentimental Analysis E-Commerce<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/thiagopanini\/credit-fraud-how-to-choose-the-best-classifier\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" style=\"color:white;\">Credit Card Fraud Detection<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/thiagopanini\/global-terrorism-eda-nlp\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" style=\"color:white;\">Global Terrorism<\/a>","94bd8b3e":"On the first look, maybe the main category that demands some attention if `checking_account`. If we look at those ones with _little_ checking account and its distribution by risk, it's almost 50\/50. To make it cleaner for us to conclude, let's repeat this analysis but in a percentage approach.","593ec8e8":"# Libraries","a5ba2b13":"The scatterplots built into the `pairplot` function show us that maybe there is a positive correlation between `credit amount` and `duration` of the credit request.
