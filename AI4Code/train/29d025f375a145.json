Define the model by calling ARIMA() and passing in the p, d, and q parameters.\n2. The model is prepared on the training data by calling the fit() function.\n3. Predictions can be made by calling the predict() function and specifying the index of the time or times to be predicted.","aeba5cea":"Bitcoin predictions are going to be for a month, that is why we need to split the dataset accordingly","52b1d32e":"An **ARIMA** model is a class of statistical models for analyzing and forecasting time series data. ARIMA model is one model for non-stationarity. It assumes that the data becomes stationary after differencing.\n\n**ARIMA** is an acronym that stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a generalization of the simpler AutoRegressive Moving Average and adds the notion of integration.\n\n\n\nThese acronyms describe it pretty well:\n1. **AR**: Autoregression. A model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of lagged observations.\n2.**I**: Integrated. The use of differencing of raw observations (e.g. subtracting an observation from an observation at the previous time step) in order to make the time series stationary.\n3. **MA**: Moving Average. A model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.\n\n\n\nEach of these components are explicitly specified in the model as a parameter. A standard notation is used of ARIMA(p,d,q) where the parameters are substituted with integer values to quickly indicate the specific ARIMA model being used.\n\nParameters are defined as follows:\n\n1. **p**: The number of lag observations included in the model, also called the lag order.\n2. **d**: The number of times that the raw observations are differenced, also called the degree of differencing.\n3. **q**: The size of the moving average window, also called the order of moving average.\n\n\n","0088e6db":"**There are 4 csv files.

Timestamps are in Unix time. Timestamps without any trades or activity have their data fields forward filled from the last valid time period.

The x-axis shows the lag and the y-axis shows the correlation coefficient between -1 and 1 for negative and positive correlation.\n* Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF). The plot summarizes the correlations for an observation with lag values that is not accounted for by prior lagged observations.\nWe can get a basic picture of the parameter interval, and using this heuristic we can  with help of AIC- Akaike information criterion decide which are the best p,q,d for ARIMA"}}
