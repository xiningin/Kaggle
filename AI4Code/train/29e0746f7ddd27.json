In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.\nThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.\n\nMost people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.  However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and\/or  cough associated withdifficulty breathing\/shortness of breath, chest pain\/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.\n\nPeople can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.  This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter) away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails.  People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub.\n[Source](https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019\/question-and-answers-hub\/q-a-detail\/q-a-coronaviruses)","96372dea":"![Coronavirus](https:\/\/cdn.thewire.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/02202453\/fusion-medical-animation-rnr8D3FNUNY-unsplash-1600x900.jpg?resize=*:250px)","d3829629":"# Random Forest","33397086":"# **Data Preprocessing**","935dc278":"# Implementing Model","ea87a7b7":"# Feel free to modify my kernel give me feedbackback where i'm lack","3a8f3083":"# **Predicting Admission to the ICU of confirmed COVID-19 cases**"}}
