In information retrieval, precision is a measure of result relevancy, while recall is a measure of how many truly relevant results are returned.\n\nThe precision-recall curve shows the tradeoff between precision and recall for different threshold. A high area under the curve represents both high recall and high precision, where high precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall relates to a low false negative rate. High scores for both show that the classifier is returning accurate results (high precision), as well as returning a majority of all positive results (high recall).\n\nA system with high recall but low precision returns many results, but most of its predicted labels are incorrect when compared to the training labels. A system with high precision but low recall is just the opposite, returning very few results, but most of its predicted labels are correct when compared to the training labels. An ideal system with high precision and high recall will return many results, with all results labeled correctly.\n\n While recall expresses the ability to find all relevant instances in a dataset, precision expresses the proportion of the data points our model says was relevant actually were relevant.\n \n More information on precision-recall can found here: https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/beyond-accuracy-precision-and-recall-3da06bea9f6c","4eb54081":"**Model Evaluation using Confusion Matrix**\n\nA confusion matrix is a table that is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

As the pelvic_incidence increases, the degree_spondyiosthesis does not increase beyond 200 value. \n\nAnother example, pelvic_tilt_numeric and lumbar_lordosis_angle, as pelvic_tilt_numeric increases, so does lumbar_lordosis_angle, hence proving them to be linearly related to each other. \n\nYou can find more information on how to create pairplots and play around with various nobs for pair plot here: https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/visualizing-data-with-pair-plots-in-python-f228cf529166","8f46a3f0":"**Logistic Regression:**\n\nLogistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary classes. The outcome or target variable is dichotomous in nature, meaning there are only two possible outcomes or classes. It computes the probability of an event occurring. \n\nIt is a special case of linear regression where the target variable is categorical in nature. It uses a log of odds as the dependent variable. \n\nLinear Regression Equation:\n\n![](http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dyd911kmh\/image\/upload\/f_auto,q_auto:best\/v1534281880\/image1_ga8gze.png)\n\ny: dependent variable\nx: features\n\nSigmoid function: \n![](http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dyd911kmh\/image\/upload\/f_auto,q_auto:best\/v1534281880\/image3_qldafx.png)\n\nApply sigmoid function on linear regression:\n\n![](http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dyd911kmh\/image\/upload\/f_auto,q_auto:best\/v1534281880\/image3_qldafx.png)\n\nThe above equation is used for logistic regression.\n\nLogistic Regression is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation approach. In this approach, we determine the parameters that are mostly likely to produce the desired outcome. MLE sets the mean and variance parameters in determining the specific parameter value for a given model. This set of parameters can be used for predicting the data needed in a normal distribution.\n\nTypes of logisitc regression:\n- Binary logistic regression: the target variable has only two possible outcomes such as Spam or Not Spam, Cancer or No cancer.\n- Multinominal logistic regression: the target variable has three or more nominal categories such as predicting the type of wine. \n- ordinal logistic regression: the target variable has three or more ordinal categories such as a restaurant or product rating from 1 to 5. \n\nYou can read more about logisitc regression here: https:\/\/www.datacamp.com\/community\/tutorials\/understanding-logistic-regression-python\n","72e7e05e":"Looking at the correlated data above, here are some observations:\n\nHighly correlated:\n- pelvic_incidence and sacral_slope are highly correlated\n- pelvic_tilt numeric and pelvic_incidence are highly correlated\n- lumbar_lordosis_angle and pelvic_incidence are highly correlated\n- pelvic_radius and pelvic_tilt numeric are highly correlated\n\nWeakly correlated:\n- pelvic_incidence and pelvic_radius are weakly correlated.\n- pelvic_tilt numeric and pelvic_radius are weakly correlated.\n\n**Heat map:**\n\nHeat map allows us to look at the correlated data in a visual manner, which might help us quickly point out variables which are highly correlated, hence helping us on a path towards using those variables for further analysis.\n\nWe will create a heat map from the correlated data below:","915cdba9":"**Confusion Matrix Evaluation Metrics**\n\nLet's evaluate the model using model evaluation metrics such as accuracy.","49cf73a5":"Based on above plot, the black line is the prediction from linear regression and the green circles are the actual values for correlation between pelvic_incidence and sacrel_scrope. \n\nLets take a another example for linear regression, this time looking at relation between: pelvic_tilt_numeric and lumbar_lordosis_angle.","8c5974b4":"As you can see from the heat map, pelvic_radius is weakly correlated with most of the other features in the dataset.
