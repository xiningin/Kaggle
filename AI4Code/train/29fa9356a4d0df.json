the range of 100-300 seconds but after that, the count started gradually decreasing as the time interval increased.\n* There were a total of 328 entries who did not fill anything in this column  and

Let's leave it here and move forward to the Median.\n\n**Median: 626 seconds.**\n\nThis number says that on average a respondent took around 626 seconds or approximately 11 minutes. \n\nUsually the mean and the median are rather close to each other. If not, the problem is in outliers as I explained. As we can see in the below drawn diagram too:","bbf74846":"Let's have a look at how our data actually looks like:","b0ecf609":"Since we have extracted the information, now we will again use the violin plot to gain some particulars.","ad56812f":"# Episode 4: The Last One\n\n### Findings:\n\n* Women were faster than men in filling the survey,\n* Even though they were faster, the median difference was about 45 seconds between them,\n* The Median outclasses the Mean,\n* The people who filled the form under 100 seconds, we are not considering them to be fast in filling the survey,\n* Amongst the people who filled under 100 seconds, nearly 75% of them were men,\n* Most of the respondents who were of the age group of 60+ years took sufficient time (10 min - 17 min) to complete the survey, \n* According to us, it is possible that they are very experienced, which is why they took sufficient time to fill the survey. At that age, it takes some time to recall all the learnings for answering the particular questions so that might be the reason for the ones who took more than 17 min,\n* The age group of the respondents was directly proportional to the time taken by them to fill the survey considering that there was no sudden drastic change between the counts,\n* On average Nigerians took the most time to complete the form (903 seconds) amongst the other countries and,\n* Belgians took the least time to complete the form (503 seconds), \n* Chinese people, Dutch, and Philippines people share the same average time (594 seconds) despite being big differences between their respondents\u2019 count.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWe have used the Kaggle 2020 survey to analyze the use of the time column. From the study, we found some insights on how people responded to the survey in a particular range of time intervals. We found out how much time people took to fill the form and its relation with age, gender, degree, and profession. With our research, we found out that the young generation aged from 18-21 were amongst the fastest ones to fill the survey. This could mean that according to our assumptions that either they were not experienced to provide all the answers to the surveyor or they just filled it for some experience. We also observed the median time taken by the respondents to fill up the survey was the highest amongst the bachelor\u2019s degree followed by just a slight decrease in the master\u2019s degree. However, there were many outliers so we suspected that all the ones who completed the form may have either left the survey open or was interrupted in the middle.","8a6c786d":"# Episode 2: Data Exploration.","fa0e600e":"# Episode 1: Pilot.\n\n![Ready to take a flightt](https:\/\/png.pngtree.com\/png-vector\/20190115\/ourmid\/pngtree-cartoon-airplane-dotted-line-white-paper-plane-yellow-star-png-image_368221.jpg)\n\nWell it's strange how everyone says time is money but no one here seems to use even a penny of it. Don't get **baffled**, we are talking about our not so popular amongst its pals; **The Time Column**.\n\nYou guys might be thinking why time? Well, we were curious to know why hasn't anyone thought of using this column? Was it not enough to provide them insights?\nOr they were not able to come up with any constructive ideas. Even I was one of them, who did not understand what this column is capable of bringing us to the table.\n\nApart from my silly jokes, we all know how tough things were in 2020 for most of us at first. It brought a sense of fear and anxiety around the planet. It has affected every living being. Be it animals or humans with different nationality, level of education, income, or gender. Call it short term or long term, the lockdown has led to psychosocial and mental health implications on most of us.\n\nNearly 81 million jobs were lost during this pandemic period. It\u2019s been around 9 months now that the colleges and schools are shut down. No doubt they are getting a hang of Digital Learning nowadays but for most of the people it\u2019s not the same as physically learning at the campuses. There\u2019s a lot we can add here but the main reason for listing out is so because one question that struck our mind was how did people fill this form in such conditions where many of them were being expelled from their jobs, had no idea about the opening of colleges or school, stuck in different cities and much more. How did they manage to take out time to fill up a survey in such a nerve wrecking year? \nSome saw this pandemic as an opportunity to excel in things which they never couldn't do, that is one of the reasons that the number of participants increased. People were exploring new things on different platforms.\n\nIf I talk about myself, I was quite unsure about how this pandemic would treat me. I realised that this was a Golden opportunity to explore and develop my skills. I got pretty much engaged in learning new domains (From Machine Learning to DevOps to Flutter). \n\nI couldn\u2019t find time to participate in any competition, as one after the other I kept on learning and then the college workload kept on increasing day by day. I saw that Kaggle mailed me to fill up the survey but I probably filled it up after a week or two. This being my very first Kaggle Competition, here\u2019s an approach that I think we might be able to bring something good out of it.\n\nSo here we are, bringing our curious minds to work and try to use every penny of this Time Column.","7f87d032":"* No doubt the median difference was about 45 seconds between men and women, still 80% of the respondents were men amidst the respondents who filled the form in or about 7-12 minutes.\n* Amongst 736 people who filled under 100 seconds, nearly 75% of them were men. ","17c195fe":"* The grass is always greener on the other side! Look closely, isn\u2019t it so?\n\n* Else jokes apart, the white area depicts the distribution of all the null values in our data set. \n","542520d8":"* Approximately **32% of respondents** filled the form in about 7-12 min. \n* 736 people filled the entire form in under 100 seconds. \n* It took me around **15-20 min** to fill up the entire form. So, I'm pretty excited to find out how they filled it so fast. Did they just fill the entire form for the sake of filling it or they actually knew each and everything clearly which was supposed to be filled?","707d0c6c":"# Episode 5: The Last One Part 2\n\n### Future Aspects:\n\n* Hunting down the respondents who were either outlier or filled the form in under 150 seconds on a deeper level. \n\n* How the degree, age, time were correlated to each other with a good visualization?  Similarly the relationship between time, profession, and gender; time, profession, degree, etc. \n\n* Finding out deeper insights just like:  the male respondents who were bachelors and having 2-5 years of experience and aged 26-30 years were the ones who filled this form in under 100 seconds.\n\n* Can outliers help us find some beautiful insights?\n","ee493013":"* Bachelors, Masters, Doctoral had approximately the same percentage count of the respondents who filled out the form in the range of 400-700 seconds. It also shows a trend where the percentage count exponentially or gradually decreases as the time increases. \n* The people in professional degrees also follow a similar trend with the bachelors masters and doctoral but the count of respondents who filled the form in the range of 0-99 seconds are much lesser than the three individual ones.\n* There were a total of 328 entries who did not fill anything in this column  and completed the form under 100 seconds.","3d7393fe":"* In one or the other way we have eliminated the study of outliers but if we study in a small group where the maximum time taken by a respondent was 2000 seconds. So, we can see that the survey should have taken approx. 25 minutes to be filled.\n* We can see that the women have filled the form slightly quicker as compared to men and the median difference was also about 45 seconds.\n* The people who were under \u2018Others\u2019 category were slightly quicker as compared to our other two distributions( i.e. Men and Women).","9bfa2741":"From this we can't gather much information due to many outliers, which is the reason for our positively skewed data. \n\nSo our next approach will be to study the particularly distributed data from which we can gather more information.\n","d137a190":"Violin Plot is best right now according to me because it provides us with the median, upper fence ( tells extreme outlier value), min value and max value and outliers. \n\nThey are similar to box plots except that they show probability density of the data at different values.\n\nThis chart is a combination of a Box Plot and a Density Plot that is rotated and placed on each side, to show the distribution shape of the data. ","17574f7a":"Now let's have a look at our time column and study how is it distributed.","584df8b8":"* There are many outliers according to this graph.\n* The shape of the distribution indicates the time used by the respondents to fill the form is highly concentrated around the median.\n* We can see that our Median is 626 seconds (i.e. 10.43 minutes approx).\n* Upper fence is 1979 seconds. This means that those who took more than 32.98 minutes to fill the form are at a place were they're known as an outlier.","7bb86079":"# Episode 3: The Abandoned Aspect","a9426b01":"## The Median outclasses the Mean\n\nThroughout the notebook, we will be using median instead of the mean, so before moving forward we want to showcase one of our favorite topics: MEAN or MEDIAN.\n\n**Mean:** The mean is the central value of a discrete set of numbers: specifically, the sum of values divided by the number of values. Since our childhood, we are always taught that Mean is the best way to deal with the \u201caverage\u201d of a given dataset or a problem.\n\n**Median:** The median is a value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample. For a dataset, it may be thought of as \u201cthe middle\u201d value. Median can also be used as an alternative to the mean.\n\nThe **purpose of the mean or median** is to provide a one-number summary of a set of data. The idea of mean is quite tricky. Think of it as a way of summarising a whole lot of numbers, in order to make comparisons. Median is intrinsically understandable. It is the middle number when the values are put in order.\n\nSo where am I going with this mean-median thing? When both of their purposes are the same, why am I not using Mean? \n\nWell, **the advantage of choosing the Median over the Mean** is that it does not get skewed so much by a small proportion of extremely large or small values. It gives us a better idea of a \u201ctypical\u201d value. In normal language, a median is not affected by outliers or it is \u201cresistant\u201d because it is not at the mercy of outliers. **Example:** If you have a median of 5 and then add another observation of 80, the median is unlikely to stray far from the 5.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the data that I\u2019ve been exploring throughout the notebook. Let\u2019s calculate the mean and median of the Time column.","dcb545bb":"# References:\n\n1. https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/education\/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-education-insights-education-at-a-glance-2020.pdf\n2. https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7444649\/\n3. https:\/\/www.ilo.org\/asia\/media-centre\/news\/WCMS_763819\/lang--en\/index.htm\n4. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Average\n5. https:\/\/creativemaths.net\/blog\/median\/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHowever%2C%20when%20the%20sample%20size,better%20measure%20of%20central%20tendency.&text=%E2%80%9CUse%20the%20median%20to%20describe,that%20does%20have%20an%20outlier.\n6. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nn9yNoIAL6I","1b59a937":"If you have read carefully you must have noticed that our upper fence is 1979. So, what we did is that we extracted the information from our dataset of the people who filled up the form in less than or equal to 2000 seconds.","3dc50685":"Let's examine the frequency distribution of time column closely.","9b66e7e4":"Before directly diving into the topic my first and foremost task is to **scrutinize all the null values.**\n\nAccording to my learnings so far, this is the best way for me to find null values. You might ask why? Because visualizations are easy to understand rather than checking the null values while going through the count of them in each and every column.","f44fc0f1":"* According to our research we found out that the respondents between the ages 18-21 years have taken the least time to fill the form but the percentage of filling the form under 0-99 seconds was the highest in this age group.\n* The respondents between the ages 22-24 years were slightly slower from the previous age group but faster than the others. As you can see from the graph we saw a decline in the percentage of the respondents of (0-99 seconds).\n* Talking of the number of highest respondents from the age group 25-29 , most of them took sufficient time to fill out the form, there were around 150 respondents who filled under 0-99 seconds.\n* As this goes on, we see a trend where the age group of the respondents is directly proportional to the time taken by them to fill the survey."}}
