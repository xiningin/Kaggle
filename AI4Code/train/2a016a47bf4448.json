construct features according to the following page: [MLB stats GLOSSARY](http:\/\/www.mlb.com\/glossary\/). \n\nI choose 2 features from the \"Defense\" category:\n* \"FPCT\": Fielding percentage\n* \"Out\": including a strikeout, a groundout, a popout or a flyout.\n\n5 features from the \"Offense\" category:\n* \"HR\": home run. \n* \"IBB\": intentional walk.\n* \"TB\": total bases.\n* \"RBI\": runs batted in.\n* \"AVG\": batting average.\n\n5 features from the \"Pitching\" category:\n* \"SV_percnt\": save percentage.\n* \"HLD\": hold.\n* \"BS\": blown save.\n* \"IR\": inherited runner.\n* \"IP\": innings pitched.\n\n5 features from the \"Advanced\" category:\n* \"ISO\": isolated power.\n* \"BABIP\": batting average on balls in play.\n* \"RC\": runs created.\n* \"PA\/SO\": plate

offence scores ranks the second.

Since the model file is too large, I upload the results I obtained to kaggle, not the models.\n","00a78f7f":"If we look at the percentage of different feature categories in a whole, we can see that time is always the most important. Except for that, target 1 is affected a lot by players' performance in a game and target 2 is heavily affected by team related features such as twitter followers, team rankings and winning percentage, instead of team performances.

Also, target 2 is affected by the combination of team expected winning percentage, player status, time and players' performances.\n\n* For target 3 is similar with target 2, except for time features, team twitter followers has some influence on it but not as big as it has for target 2. And the award a player received will also influence the values of target 3. \n\n* For target 4, time, players' award and tatus and also performances are important. And so does team twitter followers.","49e031fc":"However, it is totally diffferent for target 2 since the values in 2020 are consistently bigger than in 2019, while the differences between 2019 and 2018 are similar. Therefore, the postpone of regular season actually increase the target 2. ","048e2a2b":"In the plot above, \"target 2\" value shows a much wider variation but the four engagement measurements change in a similar wary since they are correlated with each other. In  the correlation matrix shown below, we find that \"target 1\" is highly correlated with \"target 2\" and \"target 3\" while \"target 4\" is less correlated with the other three values.  ","5c3197f3":"The trend component shows the rises and falls in the four series, ignoring the seasonality and any small random fluctuations.\n\nFrom the four plots below, we find that target 1 and target 2 have an almost oppsite trend and target 4's trend is totally different from the other 3 measurements.\n\n* For target 1, it goes down from the end of 2019 and remained low until around July 2020 (it may due to the covid).\n* For target 2, it increases when target 1 decreases and started to decrease when target 1 start to rise.\n* For target 3, it drop sharply from July 2019 and started to fluctuate from July 2020 (a similar trend with target 1).\n* Target 4 is the only target value that has a cycle, the single cycle period is about 3-4 months.","d9d883c5":"The seasonality plot shows that all the target measurements have a roughly one-year pattern. Target 1 has an obvious spike around March every year. It should be related to the start of each season. Target 2 and 3 also reach peak around March but they fluctuate before and after the peak. From target 1 to 4, the seasonal patten  is becoming less obvious. As for target 4, it shows a big variation throughout the year, instead of a seasonal pattern\n. ","9c06882d":"Due to covid, the regular season started in July instead of March. I expect that the fans engagement will be different in 2020. To verify my guess, I plot the difference of each target between 2020 and 2019 (from March to August), and then compare them with the difference between 2019 and 2018.","3b21380e":"In 2020, target 4 is lower than in 2019, which may due to the influence of covid.","e7378e80":"To conclude, we find that:\n\n* The 4 target values have very different trend. \n\n* Target 4 has shown a cyclic feature while other values do not.\n\n* Time features and player performance related features are important for all measurements.\n\n* Among the player performance measurement, defence and offence scores are the most influential ones.\n\n* Team twitter followers has a big influence on target 2 but not on other target values.\n\n* Time feature influent players in a different way: \"day\" affect target 3 and 4 more than target 1; its influence on target 1 is very different among players.","c1688c8c":"Before I start to look into the importance of the features, I put the features into 5 categories: \n\n* The \"player performance\" includes features of a players performance in a game.\n* Other player related features include transaction, twitter followers and players' status.\n* The \"team performance\" category include teams' performance in games.\n* Other team related features include team ranking in division and league, team twitter statistics and team winning percentages.\n* The \"time features\" include \"day\", \"month\" and \"year\".","3fa36445":"After taking mean over different players, we can see how the mean of targets move over time and their correlations. ","8f25f64c":"We have find the the target values are related with time. In this part, we are going to explore other features (features related to players, teams, and games, etc).","492a77cf":"The plots below shows the distribution of the three time features for different target values. \n\n* The first row is the importance distribution for \"year\". For most players, the influence of \"year\" is under 0.02. The influence is slightly higher on average for target 2.\n\n* The second row shows the importance of feature \"month\". The effect of \"month\" is much more bigger than \"year\" since the distribution is centered around 0.2-0.3. As the plot for target 4 is leaning to the right, we can conclude that \"month\" has more influence on target 4.\n\n* The feature \"day\" shows a different distribution among different target values. For target 1, the distribution is flat and ranges from 0.1 to 0.6. which means the influence is very different for various players; for target 2, 3 and 4, the distribution is more concentrated around 0.3-0.4.","3dc33c1f":"Target 3 did not change much during 2020, except for a sharp decrease around March (the start of regular season).","c3df5b64":"## Anythig Different in 2020?","f8d65391":"Since we choose the same period each year, if nothing special happens, the value in different years should remain similar and the difference series will fluctuate around 0. As for the difference series of target 1, there's a slight decrease 2020, especially between April and July.","4edafb30":"From the 4 feature importance below, we can see that all the features are related to time features (the cyan bars) and player performance (the red bars\n). \n\nIn addition, the players' performance (red bar), status and twitter followers (yellow bar) are the most important for all the target measurements. \n\nHowever, team performance (green bar) and rankings (blue) in a season do not have much influence.","8750a15f":"### Construct player related features","50f59630":"The \"rosters\" feature shows a player's status (for example, injured or active) at a certain time.","b63b1884":"### Prepare data for random forest\n\nIn this part, I fill the NAN values with -99, which is not in the range of the dataset. And deal with inifinite values and make sure all the features are in correct format for the future modelling procedure.","2e4aeac6":"### Run Random Forest Model and Extract Feature Importance","fe9e0236":"Apart from correlation, the time series plots also shows a calendar related effect, for example, a peak around March (the start of each season). To better understand the seasonal properties, we apply a seasonal decomposition to investigate the trend and seasonality. Since the amplitude of the seasonal variation does not change as the trend rises or falls, I use an additive decoposition.","78e38e94":"### Seasonal Decomposition","7e28ea68":"I also include the number of players' twitter followers and teams' twitter followers as features in the model.","2506068b":"### Visualize the mean and correlation of target values"}}
