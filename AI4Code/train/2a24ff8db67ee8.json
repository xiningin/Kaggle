Those values can affect our meaures of central tendency. \n\nThe distance between the quartile values (Q1 and Q3) is the interquartile range (IQR). \nAn outlier is defined as those observations that are at least 1.5 times the interquartile range above from either Q1 or Q3.

These outliers can be good or bad depending on the problem we are solving. \nFor example: \n* For the manufactoring analysis in a factory, we can have some broken machines that are also makes good with anomalies. So when studying the production standard, maybe we should get rid of these anomalies while making analysis.   \n\n* In performing fraud detection for a financial problem, abnormal behaviors are important to take into consideration, so this time we should keep outiers in the analysis.
