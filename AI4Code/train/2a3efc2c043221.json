Run this cell to load InceptionV1 for your base.","8794903f":"# Conclusion #\n\nIn this first lesson, you learned the basics of **convolutional image classifiers**, that they consist of a **base** for extracting features from images, and a **head** which uses the features to decide the image's class. You also saw how to build a classifier with **transfer learning** on pretrained base. ","b64d6b71":"# Introduction #\n\nIn the tutorial, we saw how to build an image classifier by attaching a head of dense layers to a pretrained base. The base we used was from a model called **VGG16**. We saw that the VGG16 architecture was prone to overfitting this dataset. Over this course, you'll learn a number of ways you can improve upon this initial attempt.\n\nThe first way you'll see is to use a base more appropriate to the dataset. The base this model comes from is called **InceptionV1** (also known as GoogLeNet). InceptionV1 was one of the early winners of the ImageNet competition. One of its successors, InceptionV4, is among the state of the art today.\n\nTo get started, run the code cell below to set everything up.","d3cc1618":"Run the cell below to plot the loss and metric curves for this training run.","2036ee5c":"# 2) Attach Head #\n\nNow that the base is defined to do the feature extraction, create a head of `Dense` layers to perform the classification, following this diagram:\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/i5VU7Ry.png\" alt=\"Diagram of the dense head.\">\n<\/figure>\n","4c0a2b24":"# 4) Examine Loss and Accuracy #\n\nDo you notice a difference between these learning curves and the curves for VGG16 from the tutorial? What does this difference tell you about what this model (InceptionV2) learned compared to VGG16? Are there ways in which one is better than the other? Worse?\n\nAfter you've thought about it, run the cell below to see the answer.","eb827256":"<blockquote style=\"margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto; background-color: #ebf9ff; padding: 1em; margin:24px;\">\n    <strong>Accelerate Training with a Kaggle GPU!<\/strong><br>\nDid you know Kaggle offers free time with a GPU accelerator?

The optimization algorithm we'll use for this course is called [\"Adam\"](https:\/\/keras.io\/api\/optimizers\/adam\/), which generally performs well regardless of what kind of problem you're trying to solve.\n\nThe loss and the metrics, however, need to match the kind of problem you're trying to solve. Our problem is a **binary classification** problem: `Car` coded as 0, and `Truck` coded as 1. Choose an appropriate loss and an appropriate accuracy metric for binary classification.","62d86ab0":"**This notebook is an exercise in the [Computer Vision](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/computer-vision) course.
