To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **scatter plots** to understand patterns in the data.\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou work for a major candy producer, and your goal is to write a report that your company can use to guide the design of its next product.  Soon after starting your research, you stumble across this [very interesting dataset](https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking\/) containing results from a fun survey to crowdsource favorite candies.\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise."}}
