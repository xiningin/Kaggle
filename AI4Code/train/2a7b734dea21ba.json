For example, if a query is formed that scans all of the data in a particular column, given how large BigQuery datasets are it wouldn't be too surprising if it burns through a large chunk of that monthly quota!\n\nFortunately, the bq_helper module gives us tools to very easily estimate the size of our queries before running a query. Start by drafting up a query using BigQuery's Standard SQL syntax. Next, call the estimate_query_size function which will return the size of the query in GB. That way you can get a sense of how much data is being scanned before actually running your query.","e51f1f47":"Interpretting this number, this means my query scanned about ~0.02 GB (or 20 MB) of data in order to return a table of 20 unique action_subtype labels from the dataset.","00b493ef":"## Example SQL Query\nWhat are the unique action_subtypes that can an app_id can be classified as?"}}
