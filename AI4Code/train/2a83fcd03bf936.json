The general outline of the process will be:\n\n- Define and establish client credentials with your spotify developers account\n- Define a source playlist that is the users favorites and a search playlist to examine for recommendations\n- Build functions to extract audio features from a playlist and genre\n- Define a function for creating a similarity score (we will use cosine similarity)\n- Define a function for returning a data frame of recommendations\n- Compare recommendations when Hot Encoding genre or using only audio features\n- Simplify the process by building a pipeline function\n\n","44129fa1":"\n# <H3 align = \"center\">1.

It was tilted a bit towards Hip Hop with a strictly instrumental chistmas song and a country song. However, I would probably not add those to my playlist.","39243b42":"<H3 align = \"center\">Cardinality<\/H3>\n\nBefore I work on making the pipline and getting recommendations, I want to look at the cardinality of the Hot Encoding to ensure that the size of the dataframe isn't excessive when encodeing genres. ","14e128eb":"Wow! what a difference in my subjective opinion. Blinding Lights, Come Together, and Happier Than Ever would all be additions to my list. It looks like incorporating genre resulted in better performance.","7308643a":"\n# <H2 align = \"center\">4.

Define the functions<\/H2>\n\n- First, a function to extract the playlist data into the desired pandas frame format with audio features if it is desired to include genre in the return data frame the genre=True is specified.\n- Second, a function that will create a similaity matrix between the 2 playlists.\n- Third a function for hot encoding\n- Fourth a function for making reccomendations using the similarity matrix.\n- Finally a simple function to pipeline the plalists with a single command.\n\n##### Portions of the origianal source code for these functions before my modifications and additionas can be found at Towards Data Science from Merlin Shaefer at https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/using-python-to-refine-your-spotify-recommendations-6dc08bcf408e\n\n<H3 align = \"center\">Spotify genre data<\/H3>\n\n##### Some important things to note is how spotify tags genres to songs. Each song can be tagged with multiple genres. This is problematic because the genre data we extract will be variable. Additionaly, there is a large number of generes that can be defined or tagged to each song. The distincion between genre types can be subjective in some cases. We are also worried about cardinality. Since One Hot encoding creates a column for each item we could easily add a large amount of columns with minimal benefit. I will explore cardinality for genre more. For this function, we will extract only the first genre listed. I consider it the most relevant becuase the first genre listed to a song is the genre the artist fits into generally.","92add619":"<H3 align = \"center\">Similarity function<\/H3>\n\n- This function will utilize the cosine similarity feature from sikit learn. Other similarity algorithms could be substituted and experimented with. \n- Prior to passing the data into the similarity algorithm it will also be normalized.\n","00f3bca6":"my playlist has 10 unique genres and the BB top 200 has 23 unique genres. This is probably not an excessive amount of additional columns. So next we will get the recommendations.","7d6d6873":"\n# <H2 align = \"center\">3. Define the pipeline function<\/H2>\n\n#### The processing sequence is as follows\n- Extract the playlists into DataFrames\n- Process the playlist for reccomendations using the similarity function and hot encoding if applicable\n- Return the reccomendations to a DataFrame\n\nThe functions were built so it would be easy to make a pipeline function and get the final results with a single command.","2cd384ca":"# <H2 align = \"center\">4. Final Thoughts<\/H2>\n\nThis system doesn't have an objective measure on it's performance other than my opinion. Like a lot of recommendation systems it is disadvantaged with a cold start before improving. The best way to improve performance would be to significantly increase my playlist and choose alternative comparison playlists that might be closer to the type of music I enjoy. I hope you enjoy tinkering with the process.\n\n<H3 align = \"center\">Happy Music Hunting<\/H3>","ff88a155":"<H3 align = \"center\">For more information on the mathematics of similarity algorithms<\/H3>\n<H4 align = \"center\">\n<div class=\"ephox-summary-card\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" align=\"center\" data-ephox-embed-iri=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@sasi24\/cosine-similarity-vs-euclidean-distance-e5d9a9375fc8\"><a class=\"ephox-summary-card-link-thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@sasi24\/cosine-similarity-vs-euclidean-distance-e5d9a9375fc8\"> <img class=\"ephox-summary-card-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/0*MWuD1-9QA7wuPYHU\" \/> <\/a> <a class=\"ephox-summary-card-link\" href=\"Cosine Similarity Vs Euclidean Distance\"> <span class=\"ephox-summary-card-title\">Cosine Similarity Vs Euclidean Distance<\/span>  <span class=\"ephox-summary-card-author\">Vijaya Sasidhar Nagella<\/span>  <\/a><\/div>\n<\/H4>","8f122413":"<H3 align = \"center\">Recommendation Function<\/H3>\n\n- This function will return a data frame with recommendations using similarity scores\n- This function will trim the results into track name and track Id","c0359520":"<H1 align = \"center\">Spotify Recommendation System<\/H1>\n<H2 align = \"center\">\n<img src=\"https:\/\/developer.spotify.com\/assets\/branding-guidelines\/logo.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" align=\"middle\">\n    <\/H2>\n <H3 align = \"center\">by Randy Williams<\/H3>"}}
