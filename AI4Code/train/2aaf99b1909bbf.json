The count of women is around half of the count of men.","b8bcae12":"# Titanic data overview\n\n#### This notebook contains a basic data overview based on a training dataset.\n#### I will use training data because there is more data in it than in the test dataset.","42a1201a":"# Pclass data\n\n##### Pclass is divided into 3 values (1, 2 and 3). The majority of passengers traveled in third class (the lowest). In second and first-class traveled around the same number of passengers in the comparison with third class.","6b74586c":"# Survived data\n\n##### As we can see on the plot, the most of passengers didn't survive. Around 350 people survived a disaster. About 550 passengers didn't be so lucky. This information can be useful when making a predictive model to remove the difference between the amount of data in each class.","34d41c4e":"# Embarked data\n\n##### A lot of passengers started their travel in Southampton (near 650 passengers). The next place where the most of passengers boarded is Cherbourg. The last of town where the passengers boarded on Titanic is Queenstown.","ac1515e1":"# Age data\n\n##### As we can see on the histogram, there were a lot of passengers in age between 20 to 25 years old. Looking at other larger age groups, we can see an increasing decline in the number of passengers.\n\n##### Several passengers travelled with children.","7a14c146":"# Sibsp and Parch data\n\n##### Based on the charts below, we can come to a conclusion that the vast majority of passengers traveled alone. Near 200 passengers traveled with only one sibling or spouse. About 100 passengers traveled with only one parent or child.","f58cc646":"# Fare data\n\n##### The vast majority of passengers paid from 0 to 20. The minimum price somebody paid is 0 (free). The maximum price somebody paid is 512.","0968ab53":"## As we can see below, the dataset consist of 12 columns. \n##### First column is *PassengerId*. The column holds values in the int64 type. Values are unique. Every number means a special identifier of every passenger.\n\n##### Next we have *Survived* column. It determines whether passengers survived a disaster or not. The values are in bit format (0 for passenger who didn't survive and 1 for passenger who survived).\n\n##### Third column consist data about in which class every passenger traveled.\n\n##### 4th column has data about names of passengers.\n\n##### 5th column has data about sex of every passenger.\n\n##### 6th column consist of age data of every passenger.\n\n##### Next 2 columns determine respectively about number of siblings \/ spouses aboard the Titanic\tand number of parents \/ children aboard the Titanic.\n\n##### 9th column has ticket number.\n\n##### 10th column holds passenger fare data.\n\n##### 11th column has number of cabin in which passenger travelled.\n\n##### In the last column we can see a data about port of embarkation."}}
