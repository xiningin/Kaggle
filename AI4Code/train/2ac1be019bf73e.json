I selected few features to look deeper into their correlations with delays. The main feature of interest showed a wide range of values from 0 to 1433 but the most of flights were delayed not more than on 1 hour. It was slowly increasing over the years with a bump at 2003 when the new report system was implemented. \n\n> While looking into carriers I found out that 5 of 29 carriers are responsible for more than 60% of delays but their mean departure delays are relativly low. Southwest Airlines had interesting change of mean delay: first 10 years of observation it was higher that others then in 2005 we see constant decrease. Now I would like to look at their data after 2008 to check if they preserved that tendency. Other 4 carriers were slowly increasing their departure delay means and I wonder if they were able to change the trend or they were highly affected by other factors. There is a sharp increase of mean delay at 2003, probably because the new report system was implemented and data became more accurate.\n\n> As to reported reasons for delays, 'CarrierDelay' and 'LateAircraftDelay' have stronger correlation with departure delays, while 'WeatherDelay' and 'NASDelay' have stronger correlation with arrival delays. Weather shows to have not so huge impact on delay average, LateAircraftDelay tends to be longer at the beginning of the year and CarrierDelay shows that avialines perform evenly with small decrease in November.\n\n> 6 airports that have most of the delays \u2013 Atlanta International Airport, O'Hare Airport, Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, Denver International Airport \u2013 are in top 10 busiest airports in USA so there is no surprise they have a bigger part of delays.","7ca78f11":"Expected strong correlation between DepDelay and ArrDelay, also correlations between DepDelay and CarrierDelay\/LateAircraftDelay, between ArrDelay and NASDelay.","938f06bd":"### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?\n\n> A time plot shows increase in mean delay and its std over the years despite the same amount of data sampled for each year. This may probably mean that flights frequency increases as industry develops and airports become more busy.  \n\n### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?\n\n> Delay reasons correlate differently with delays on departure vs. on arrival. 'CarrierDelay' and 'LateAircraftDelay' occur in airport of origin and therefore have stronger correlation with departure delays, while 'WeatherDelay' and 'NASDelay' have stronger correlation with arrival delays.","376709ac":"### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation.

Since the total amount of rows exceeds 120M I've decided to collect samples of 1000 rows for each year and combine them into one dataset. I used conditional sampling to get rows where Departure Delay is both non-NaN and greater than 0 because it is the primary feature I want to investigate. Columns provide information about flight's date, carrier, aircraft, several types of arriving and departing times, also about cancellations, divertions, delays and their reasons.\n\n### What is\/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?\n\n> In this project I will focus on departure delays and what kind of features may affect it occurrence and duration.\n\n### What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?\n\n> I'm planning to look into relationships between date and delays, what kind of reasons for delay exist and their effect on its duration, airports of origin and destination.\n\n### Cleaning the data according exploration needs","8f670141":"As expected, 'CarrierDelay' and 'LateAircraftDelay' have stronger correlation with departure delays, while 'WeatherDelay' and 'NASDelay' have stronger correlation with arrival delays.\n#### Dinamic of delays over the time\nThe time variables itself did not present any interesting insides so I try to investigate them in conection with mean delay.","4bec75ed":"# Flight Delays Exploration\n## by Julia Kinday\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe dataset reports flights in the United States from 1987 to 2008, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays. Original dataset consists of 22 separate compressed CSV files with US domestic flight data for 1 year in each file. Since the total amount of rows exceeds 120M I've decided to collect samples of 1000 rows for each year and combine them into one dataset. I used conditional sampling to get rows where Departure Delay is both non-NaN and greater than 0 because it is the primary feature I want to investigate. \n\nDuring exploration I droped outliers in Departure Delays and Arrival Delays to get a better picture. \n\nWhile ploting data I used [this source](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/jpatokal\/openflights\/master\/data\/airlines.dat) to get airline names to replace their codes on plots. \n\n## Preliminary Wrangling"}}
