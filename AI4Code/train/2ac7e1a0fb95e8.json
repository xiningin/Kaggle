If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.\n\n* Loan term: Loan for less time period and less amount should have higher chances of approval.\n\n* EMI: Lesser the amount to be paid monthly to repay the loan, higher the chances of loan approval.\n\n* These are some of the factors which i think can affect the target variable, you can come up with many more factors","ac58c8d9":"# 1.2 Problem Statement\n\n* This is a standard supervised classification task.\n* A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. \n* In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).Classification can be of following types:\n\n1. Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features.\n\n2. Binary Classification : In this classification we have to predict either of the two given classes. For example: classifying the gender as male or female, predicting the result as win or loss, etc.\n\n3. Multiclass Classification : Here we have to classify the data into three or more classes. For example: classifying a movie's genre as comedy, action or romantic, classify fruits as oranges, apples, or pears, etc.","1e217c96":"I have referred to https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sazid28\/home-loan-prediction\/notebook for this notebook!"}}
