It also includes TARGET variable which we want to predict.","633ce4f4":"\n# Column Types\n\nLet's look at the number of columns of each data type. int64 and float64 are numeric variables (which can be either discrete or continuous). object columns contain strings and are categorical features. .\n","6d21f3ec":"There is a general approcah where we drop coloumns which have more than 50% missing values. So above table you know which columns you can drop if you decided to drop it.\nWhen it comes time to build our machine learning models, we will have to fill in these missing values (known as imputation). In later work, we will use models such as XGBoost that can [handle missing values with no need for imputation](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/235489\/xgboost-can-handle-missing-data-in-the-forecasting-phase). Another option would be to drop columns with a high percentage of missing values, although it is impossible to know ahead of time if these columns will be helpful to our model. Therefore, we will keep all of the columns for now.","574c26e9":"Let's now look at the number of unique entries in each of the object (categorical) columns.","28394f3f":"\n# Examine Missing Values\n\nNext we can look at the number and percentage of missing values in each column.\n","3a12c1ad":"From above plot, we see this is an [imbalanced class problem](http:\/\/chioka.in\/class-imbalance-problem\/).

The goal of EDA is to learn what our data can tell us. It generally starts out with a high level overview, then narrows in to specific areas as we find intriguing areas of the data. The findings may be interesting in their own right, or they can be used to inform our modeling choices, such as by helping us decide which features to use.\n","550a3ee0":"Most of the categorical variables have a relatively small number of unique entries. We will need to find a way to deal with these categorical variables because most machine learning models deals with only numerical input.","580dff97":"# Imports \nI'm going to use typical data science stack: numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib.","fdf9e6d9":"The test set is considerably smaller and lacks a TARGET column.","d304e33d":"\n# Examine the Distribution of the Target Column\n\nThe target is what we are asked to predict: either a 0 for the loan was repaid on time, or a 1 indicating the client had payment difficulties. We can first examine the number of loans falling into each category.\n","526572cc":"\n# Read in Data\n\nFirst, we can list all the available data files. There are a total of 9 files: 1 main file for training (with target) 1 main file for testing (without the target), 1 example submission file, and 6 other files containing additional information about each loan.\n"}}
