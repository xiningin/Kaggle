Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"19\"><\/a>\n\n\n`Recursive feature elimination (RFE)` is a feature selection technique that helps us to select best features from the given number of features. At first, the model is built on all the given features. Then, it removes the least useful predictor and build the model again. This process is repeated until all the unimportant features are removed from the model.\n\n\n`Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validated (RFECV) feature selection` technique selects the best subset of features for the estimator by removing 0 to N features iteratively using recursive feature elimination. Then it selects the best subset based on the accuracy or cross-validation score or roc-auc of the model. Recursive feature elimination technique eliminates n features from a model by fitting the model multiple times and at each step, removing the weakest features.\n\n\nI will use this technique to select best features from this model.","62e99f16":"**\"Some people walk in the rain, others just get wet.\"**\n\n\nThe above quote belongs to **Roger Miller**.
