To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.","8179fe9a":"We can see that there are a higher number of graduates with very high incomes, which are appearing to be the outliers.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the Coapplicant income distribution.","b11189c4":"### Outlier Treatment\n\nAs we saw earlier in univariate analysis, LoanAmount contains outliers so we have to treat them as the presence of outliers affects the distribution of the data. Let's examine what can happen to a data set with outliers. For the sample data set:\n\n1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4\n\nWe find the following: mean, median, mode, and standard deviation\n\nMean = 2.58\n\nMedian = 2.5\n\nMode = 2\n\nStandard Deviation = 1.08\n\nIf we add an outlier to the data set:\n\n1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 400\n\nThe new values of our statistics are:\n\nMean = 35.38\n\nMedian = 2.5\n\nMode = 2\n\nStandard Deviation = 114.74\n\nIt can be seen that having outliers often has a significant effect on the mean and standard deviation and hence affecting the distribution. We must take steps to remove outliers from our data sets.\n\nDue to these outliers bulk of the data in the loan amount is at the left and the right tail is longer. This is called right skewness. One way to remove the skewness is by doing the log transformation. As we take the log transformation, it does not affect the smaller values much, but reduces the larger values. So, we get a distribution similar to normal distribution.\n\nLet\u2019s visualize the effect of log transformation. We will do the similar changes to the test file simultaneously.","1b055ac0":"<ul><li><b>Accuracy<\/b>: Let us understand it using the confusion matrix which is a tabular representation of Actual vs Predicted values.
