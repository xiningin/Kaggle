One aspect of this optimization is the ability to peer into the internal representation of the trained neural network to let a human expert determine if important information has been lost or is being misinterpreted somewhere along the way. In a recent \"AI Explainability Whitepaper\" [1] from Google, feature attribution is stressed. This is a wonderful method of determining which features most greatly impact the final classification\/coding. Another method uses autoencoders[2] as a data compression means which also can point to flaws in a lossy internal representation of the data.\n\nThis Jupyter notebook proposes a third method to read the robot mind. It uses a reverse calculation and attempts to recreate the original data (in this case, the handwritten grapheme) from an internal state of the neural network. In this way, an expert (or any child with 10+ years of schooling in reading and writing Bengali) can clearly see if important information has been lost, what was lost, and even what layer within the neural network it was lost.\n\n### Please support by upvoting\nIf you feel this is an important area for further research, please upvote this notebook.

The only adjustment made for max pooling is the amount the displayed image is \"zoomed in\" so that it retains the original size of the input for comparison. For example; notice the image degredation when the first max pooling goes from 64x64 to 32x32 (between columns 3 and 4, or equivalently, between the 2nd and 3rd Conv2D). There is a HUGE degredation before the last convolution layer - perhaps due to MaxPooling from 32x32 down to 16x16, perhaps due to the 5x5 filter size, or perhaps something else?\n\n## Big problem with the last Conv2D layer\nIs this because it's closest to the flatten and dense layers (morphed away from the original image becuase of this) or simply due to one-too-many MaxPoolings (leaving it at a 16x16 size from the original 64x64) or the increase in filter size from prior Conv2D at 3x3 to final Conv2D at 5x5??? More investigation is needed\n\n## Impact of Borders\nIn an earlier version of this kernel, I indicated there may be a problem with borders, but improvements to the \"recreation of the original input\" algorithm have shown me that this is not the case. I therefore retract the suggestion that borders need to be added to pad the data.\n## Impact of Resolution\nLooking at the set of twelve \"all correct\" and twelve \"all incorrect\" examples, we see the impact of resolution gets worse and worse with each layer of convolution. This is a natural impact of the initial scaling of images to 64x64, the MaxPooling layers, as well as the strides parameter (not used here). It looks as though the \"all correct\" examples lose some information but enough remains to identify the feature. In the \"all incorrect\" some important detail features are entirely lost by the third convolution (column 4) which occurs after the first \"MaxPooling\" layer. \n\nPossible solutions would be to reduce the use of MaxPooling, and also possibly keep the starting image at a higher resolution. Naturally, these both add to precious resource usage for this contest. \n## Examining the Filters Themselves\nIt is also worthwhile to examine the filters themselves. In all convolutional layers there seem to be no \"duplicate\" filters (no filters in the same convolutional layer that look identical), however, in the later convolutional layers, some look very similar to one another. There may be a method to perform \"pruning\" and use fewer filters.\n","5f52cc1a":"## Basic Model","2bbca58d":"# An that's it for the Mind Reader\nThe above diagrams show the original test image, and then, in subsequent pairs of images, shows the output of the first second and 3rd convolutional layer, each followed by a reconstruction of the original image, based on that output.\n\nAn \"expert\" can clearly see if important information has been lost, what was lost, and even what layer within the neural network it was lost.\n\n### Please support by upvoting\nIf you feel this is an important area for further research, please upvote this notebook.

We can then compare that to the original image to seee if too much information has been discarded. Also a human expert can determine if sufficient information has been retained to perform the classification task.","a90cfb53":"PANv00 - Forked from the notebook \"Bengali Graphemes: Starter EDA+ Multi Output CNN\" https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaushal2896\/bengali-graphemes-starter-eda-multi-output-cnn Courtesy Kaushal Shah [saved trained model for use in this \"no GPU\" analysis kernel] LEADERBOARD SCORE of - 0.9353\n\nPointer to version 00 \nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pnussbaum\/grapheme-mind-reader-panv00 \n\nPANv01 through v12 - Added \"mind reader\" code and removed extraneous code.
