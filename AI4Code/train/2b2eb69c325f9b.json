The company offers business e-commerce platforms for online stores, including payments, marketing, shipping and customer engagement tools to simplify the process of running an online store for small merchants. In 2019 Shopify announced reaching over 1,000,000 businesses in approximately 175 countries. \n**JD.com** is an e-commerce Chinese company headquartered in Beijing that was founded in 1998. It is one of two huge business-to-consumer online retailers, a member of Fortune Global 500 with a total revenue of $67 billion in 2018. \n\n**Alibaba** is the second top e-commerce and technology company in China and a major competitor to JD.com. It was created in 1999 and it's now headquartered in Hangzhou. The company offers sales services via web portals such as business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and consumer-to-consumer, as well as electronic payment services, shopping search engines, and cloud computing services. It' revenue in 2019 was over $56 billion.","482b4770":"Based on the scatterplots, can be said that the data is normally distributed and symmetric around 0.

Alibaba's Opening Price does not have any high picks. However, for Shopify, there 2 distinctive high picks, and the second pick is the all-time highest and still is in progress. \n\n*Note: to get rid of all of the black-boxed messages type \";\" at the end of the code.*","05a3fa72":"This graph is used to visualize the Probability Density of a time series.
