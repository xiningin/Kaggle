We may know the general format, and we can use that along with regular expressions to search the document for strings that match a particular pattern.\n\nThis is where the syntax may appear strange at first, but take your time with this; often it's just a matter of looking up the pattern code.\n\nLet's begin!","1a7003e5":"### The Wildcard Character\n\nUse a \"wildcard\" as a placement that will match any character placed there.

For example, finding all capital letters in a string, or finding a phone number in a document. \n\nRegular expressions are notorious for their seemingly strange syntax. This strange syntax is a byproduct of their flexibility. Regular expressions have to be able to filter out any string pattern you can imagine, which is why they have a complex string pattern format.\n\nRegular expressions are handled using Python's built-in **re** library.
