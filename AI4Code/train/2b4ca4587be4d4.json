Supervised Learning--model is trained with output\n    * Classification:\n        output is categorical\n        e.g.: based on the weight of different coins their value can be predicted\n    * Regression\n    \n2.

Feature Scaling--Similar to Standardization but it is used to adjust all the units of all data available into a uniform (same) measurement for ex:kg,gm into either kg,kg or gm,gm.\n\n"}}
