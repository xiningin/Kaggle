It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids. With certain types you can also give a geeky introduction to machine learning.\n\nThis are the raw attributes that are used for calculating how much damage an attack will do in the games. This dataset is about the pokemon games (NOT pokemon cards or Pokemon Go).\n\nThe data as described by Myles O'Neill is:\n\n ID for each pokemon\nName: Name of each pokemon\nType 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness\/resistance to attacks\nType 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2\nTotal: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is\nHP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting\nAttack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)\nDefense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks\nSP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)\nSP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks\nSpeed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round\n\nOne question has been answered with this database: The type of a pokemon cannot be inferred only by it's Attack and Deffence. It would be worthy to find which two variables can define the type of a pokemon, if any. \n\nTwo variables can be plotted in a 2D space, and used as an example for machine learning. This could mean the creation of a visual example any geeky Machine Learning class would love.","534789f2":"We are aware of the mean and variance concepts.The skewness of the data tells us whether the data is distrbuted normally or skewed or forming lumps.\nAcceptable skewness should be between -2 & +2.\nKurtosis is the peakedness of the distribution.Acceptable kurtosis should be in the range -3&+3.","d66cbd80":"Since generation is categorical,we are not going to examine summary statistics for it,it would be insignificant.\nCategory 1 has highest counts and category 6 being the least.\nWe will examine each of the category.\n","d6627675":"**Univariate Analysis of Data\n\nI will use this kernel as a medium to emphasis the importance of statistics in analytics.\nFirst we will cover what is called as Uni variate data analysis.\nUni - single,we will examine one feature at a time.By the term examine,I mean to say that we will identify few key parameters that we are already aware of some might be new.\n\n\nYou can check this link to know more,\n\nhttps:\/\/www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com\/univariate\/\n\nGoing in order,first we will observe Type I column.\nClearly from the data description,which says Type I captures to which object the pokemon is resistent.\n\nWe will examine what are the unique categories are and how much each category contribute to.\n\n"}}
