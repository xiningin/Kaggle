A low AQI indicates good air quality and low levels of pollution while a higher AQI suggests increased concentrations of pollutants in the air which is extremely detrimental to human health.\n\nThe air quality index is composed of 8 pollutants ((PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb)\n\nAQI scores and categories:\nGood (0\u201350)\nSatisfactory (51\u2013100)\nModerately polluted (101\u2013200)\nPoor (201\u2013300)\nVery poor (301\u2013400)\nSevere (401\u2013500)\n\nIn this notebook, we will be using the day-wise AQI dataset which contains information regarding the daily level of pollutants and AQI in around 26 Indian cities from 2015-2020.\n\nOur notebook has two major parts:\n1.
