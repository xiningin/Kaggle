Even though the country has many rivers,lakes and tributaries which are seasonal or perennial in nature still, during summers and scanty rainfall,people of this country face a lot of issues. India has taken significant steps to reduce poverty but the number of people who live in poverty is still highly disproportionate to the number of people who are middle-income, with a combined rate of over 52% of both rural and urban poor. Although India has made\nimprovements over the past decades to both the availability and quality of municipal drinking water\nsystems, its large population has stressed planned water resources and rural areas are left out. In addition,\nrapid growth in India's urban areas has stretched government solutions, which have been compromised by\nover-privatization. Regardless of improvements to drinking water, many other water sources are\ncontaminated with both bio and chemical pollutants, and over 21% of the country&#39;s diseases are water-\nrelated. Furthermore, only 33% of the country has access to traditional sanitation. India&#39;s water crisis is\noften attributed to lack of government planning, increased corporate privatization, industrial and human\nwaste and government corruption. In addition, water scarcity in India is expected to worsen as the overall\npopulation is expected to increase to 1.6 billion by year 2050. To that end, global water scarcity is\nexpected to become a leading cause of national political conflict in the future, and the prognosis for India\nis no different. Women and children often bear the burden of walking miles each day to find water in\nstreams and ponds. Sickness and the time lost fetching it robs entire communities of their futures. A\nrecent news related to water scarcity was seen in Chennai, where people were crying out loud seeking for\nhelp to resolve the problem. Many farmers in the city committed suicides because of such harsh situation.***"}}
