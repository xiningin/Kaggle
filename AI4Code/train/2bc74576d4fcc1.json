Consider the following simple scenario.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.otexts.org\/sites\/default\/files\/resize\/fpp\/images\/hts1-550x274.png)\n\nHyndman proposes the following methods to estimate the points in this hierarchy. I've tried to simplify the language to make it more intuitve.\n\n### Bottom up approach:\n* Predict all the base level series using any method, and then just aggregate it to the top.\n* Advantages: Simple , No information is lost due to aggregation.\n* Dis-advantages: Lower levels can be noisy\n\n### Top down approach:\n* Predict the top level first. (Eg: predict total sales first)\n* Then calculate **weights** that denote the proportion of the total sales that needs to be given to the base level forecast(Eg:) the contribution of the item's sales to the total sales \n* There are different ways of arriving at the \"weights\". \n    * **Average Historical Proportions** - Simple average of the item's contribution to sales in the past months\n    * **Proportion of historical averages** - Weight is the ratio of average value of bottom series by the average value of total series (Eg: Weight(item1)= mean(item1)\/mean(total_sales))\n    * **Forecasted Proportions** - Predict the proportion in the future using changes in the past proportions\n* Use these weights to calcuate the base -forecasts and other levels\n\n### Middle out:\n* Use both bottom up and top down together.\n* Eg: Consider our problem of predicting store-item level forecasts.\n    * Take the middle level(Stores) and find forecasts for the stores\n    * Use bottoms up approach to find overall sales\n    * Dis-integrate store sales using proportions to find the item-level sales using a top-down approach\n    \n### Optimal combination approach:\n* Predict for all the layers independently\n* Since, all the layers are independent, they might not be consistent with hierarchy\n    * Eg: Since the items are forecasted independently, the sum of the items sold in the store might not be equal to the forecasted sale of store  or as Hyndman puts it \u201caggregate consistent\u201d\n* Then some matrix calculations and adjustments happen to provide ad-hoc adjustments to the forecast to make them consistent with the hierarchy\n\n\n### Enough with the theory. Lets start making forecasts! :P\nThe problem at hand here, has 22170 items and 60 stores . This indicates that there can be around a **million** individual time-series(item-store combinations) that we need to predict!\n\nConfiguring each of them would be nearly impossible. Let's use Prophet which does it for us.\n\nStarting off with the bottoms up approach.\n\nThere are some other points to consider here: \n* Not all stores sell all items\n* What happens when a new product is introduced? \n* What if a product is removed off the shelves?","678cdff6":"## We've correctly identified the order of the simulated process as ARMA(2,2). \n\n### Lets use it for the sales time-series.\n","f9a23f55":"## MA(2) process -- has ACF cut off at lag=2","c512ff93":"## Foot-notes:\n\nI'm not a stats major, so please do let me know in the comments if you feel that I've left out any important technique or if there was any mistake in the content.\n\nI plan to add another kernel about Time-series here which would be about adapting the open-source solutions from the recent time-series competitions ( Favorita, Recruit,etc. ) to this playground dataset.\n\nDo leave a comment\/upvote :) ","f33e4483":"## Now things get a little hazy.

(ie) Two points in a time series are related to each other by only how far apart they are, and not by the direction(forward\/backward)\n\nWhen a time series is stationary, it can be easier to model. Statistical modeling methods assume or require the time series to be stationary.\n\n\nThere are multiple tests that can be used to check stationarity.\n* ADF( Augmented Dicky Fuller Test) \n* KPSS \n* PP (Phillips-Perron test)\n\nLet's just perform the ADF which is the most commonly used one.\n\nNote: [Step by step guide to perform dicky fuller test in Excel](http:\/\/www.real-statistics.com\/time-series-analysis\/stochastic-processes\/dickey-fuller-test\/)\n\n[Another Useful guide](http:\/\/www.blackarbs.com\/blog\/time-series-analysis-in-python-linear-models-to-garch\/11\/1\/2016#AR) \n\n[good reference](https:\/\/github.com\/ultimatist\/ODSC17\/blob\/master\/Time%20Series%20with%20Python%20(ODSC)%20STA.ipynb)\n","4602517e":"# Prophet: \n\nRecently open-sourced by Facebook research.
