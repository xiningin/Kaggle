Therefore, I've been trying to remove these huge logos in the pictures before using them in order to improve my results.\n\nHowever, while doing research online I found that most of the codes already available need a mask of the logo to be removed. I don't really feel like manually making 500 masks on paint so I've been trying to find a way of removing (or at least blur) the logos.\n\nThis code is extremelly simple and does a pretty poor job at removing them as it changes other parts of the image besides the logo.\n\nNext steps? Maybe train another GAN to remove logos and watermarks?","20c71d40":"As I said, pretty bad.","46b70c68":"# 2 - Image without logo","f41726b0":"# Image with the mask applied and smoothed","1e7b7f2d":"# 1 - Image with a logo","1a382701":"# Mask","39c29b24":"# Removing logos from pictures"}}
