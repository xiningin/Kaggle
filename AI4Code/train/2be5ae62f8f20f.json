Insights\n\nWith the nation divided on the conduct of law enforcement, I decided to look into the Washington Post dataset to investigate trends hidden in the numbers.\n\nGiven the current scenarios with protests breaking out across many cities and states, I decided to focus the analysis and visualizations around the following measures:\n\n* Geography - Death toll by State and City. \n* Race - Death toll by race\n* Armed Category - If individuals were armed when they were killed\n* Flee Category - If individuals were fleeing from the police when they were killed\n* Threat Level - If individuals were attacking the police when they were killed\n* Time - Death by race analyzed by Month and Year \n* Body Camera - If police disproportionately kills more of a specific race with or without body camera\n\n\nBasic assumptions. \n\nAs the rules of society and law enforcement tell us, if you encounter law enforcement agent and comply to all their commands, there will be no reason for law enforcement to use lethal force. On the other hand, if you do not comply with commands and try to attack agents in any way, shape or form, law enforcement may use lethal force in case they feel their life is in danger. \n\n\nKey Findings\n\n\n\n1. Individuals that were 'Unarmed', 'Not Attacking', and 'Not Fleeing' from the police accounted for 1.9% of all deaths in the dataset. This was a total of 103 individuals over the last 5 years. Focusing on racial biases, I found that the % of deaths by race were of:\n\nWhite: 44.11%, Black: 30.39%, Hispanic: 18.62%, Other: 2.94%, Asian: 2.94%, Native American: 0.09%. Therefore, 'White' was the most affected race by 'unjustified' shooting situations, followed by 'Black' and 'Hispanic'.\n\n\n2. Individuals that were 'Armed', 'Attacking', but 'Not Fleeing' from the police showed the highest mortality levels. \n\nWhite: 55.44%, Black: 24.52%, Hispanic: 15.53%, Asian: 2.06%, Native American: 1.42%, Other: 1.00%. Therefore, we can see that 'White' leads aggressive encounters with the police by a large margin, followed by 'Black' and 'Hispanic' respectively.\n\n3. Individuals that were 'Armed', 'Attacking', and 'Fleeing' from the police was the second highest mortality levels. \n\nWhite: 46.43%, Black: 31.83%, Hispanic: 18.33%, Native American: 1.53%, Other 0.98%, Asian: 0.87%. In this analysis, we can see that 'White' leads in this category, but there is a substantial increase in the death toll for 'Black'. This is likely because 'Black' has the highest rate of 'Fleeing' from law enforcement. \n\n4. There was no substantial variation in death rates throughout the months of the year. The death rates also remained relatively constant from 2015 through 2019, with less than 1% variation.  \n\n\n5. Regarding Body Cameras, 'White' were killed the most when not using body cameras. Only 9.45% of 'White' deaths were caught on a body camera, followed by 11.75% for 'Hispanic' and 15.71% for 'Black'. 'Asian' was the most likely to be recorded on body cameras, with 17.20%. With these numbers in mind, White were 66.24% more likely to be killed without body camera when compared to Black, and 24.33% more likely to be killed without body camera when compared to Hispanic.\n\n\n\n**Were people primarily armed?**\n\n\nConsidering the entire dataset, the 'Other' race was the lowest armed at 86%, and surprisingly 'Asian' led the armed category at 91.1%, despite the low number of total 'Asian' fatalities.\n\n**Which race fled the most from the police?**\n\n\n'Black' led the flee category at 41.18%, while'Asian' was the least likely race to flee from the police at 19.31%.\n\n**Which race was most likely to attack the Police**\n\n\nIn order to address this issue, I analyzed the likelihood of 'Armed' and 'Unarmed' individuals to 'Attack' officers.\n\nWhen 'Armed', 'Other' was most likely to attack the police at 74.35%, 'Black' at 72.68% and 'White' at 70.10%\nWhile when 'Unarmed', 'White' led the number of attacks at 43.15% and 'Black' following at 41.46%\n\n\n\n**When looking at Geography these were the deadliest States and Cities for White, Black and Hispanic.**\n\n* City: 'Chicago' was the deadliest city for 'Black', 'Los Angeles' the deadliest city for 'Hispanic' and 'Phoenix' the deadliest city for 'White'.\n\n* State: 'California' was the deadliest state for 'Black', 'Hispanic' and 'White'\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, the deadliest states for individuals 'Unarmed' , 'Not Attacking' and 'Not Fleeing' diverged from the states with the highest numbers of total fatalities. These states were:\n\n1. NE: 8.33%\n2. DC: 7.69%\n3. MN: 4.91%\n4. CT: 4.76%\n5. OK: 4.26%\n\n* These numbers account for the percentage of 'Unarmed' , 'Not Attacking' and 'Not Fleeing' killed compared to the total deaths in the state.\n\n\n\nAlmost half of all individuals killed under these circumstances above were 'White'. \n\n1. White: 46.43%\n2. Black: 31.83%\n3. Hispanic: 18.33%\n\n\n\nTherefore, considering only this dataset and disregarding external factors, the analysis does not suggest that the police is disproportionately targeting minorities. In most categories, 'White' led the death toll, followed by 'Black' and 'Hispanic'. A small percentage (1.9%) of deaths were from individuals 'Unarmed' , 'Not Attacking' and 'Not Fleeing', suggesting that 'Police Brutality' is not a predominant source of mortality. Within cases of 'Police Brutality', 'White' was the most impacted, being 50% more likely to die compared to 'Black', and 250% compared to 'Hispanic'.
