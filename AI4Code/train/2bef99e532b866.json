No one complained, as he was the\nbreadwinner in the family, and in any case he was cheaper and\nmore reliable than an alarm clock.\nThe first noise Harry would hear was the bedroom door\nslamming. This would be followed by his uncle tramping along the\ncreaky wooden landing, down the stairs and out of the house. Then\nanother door would slam as he disappeared into the privy. If\nanyone was still asleep, the rush of water as Uncle Stan pulled the\nchain, followed by two more slammed doors before he returned to\nthe bedroom, served to remind them that Stan expected his\nbreakfast to be on the table by the time he walked into the kitchen.\nHe only had a wash and a shave on Saturday evenings before going\noff to the Palais or the Odeon. He took a bath four times a year on\n\nquarter-day. No one was going to accuse Stan of wasting his hard-\nearned cash on soap.\n\nMaisie, Harry\u2019s mum, would be next up, leaping out of bed\nmoments after the first slammed door. There would be a bowl of\nporridge on the stove by the time Stan came out of the privy.\nGrandma followed shortly afterwards, and would join her daughter\n\nin the kitchen before Stan had taken his place at the head of the\ntable. Harry had to be down within five minutes of the first\nslammed door if he hoped to get any breakfast. The last to arrive in\nthe kitchen would be Grandpa, who was so deaf he often managed\nto sleep through Stan\u2019s early morning ritual. This daily routine in\nthe Clifton household never varied. When you\u2019ve only got one\noutside privy, one sink and one towel, order becomes a necessity.\nBy the time Harry was splashing his face with a trickle of cold\nwater, his mother would be serving breakfast in the kitchen: two\nthickly sliced pieces of bread covered in lard for Stan, and four thin\nslices for the rest of the family, which she would toast if there was\nany coal left in the sack dumped outside the front door every\nMonday. Once Stan had finished his porridge, Harry would be\nallowed to lick the bowl.\nA large brown pot of tea was always brewing on the hearth,\nwhich Grandma would pour into a variety of mugs through a\nsilver-plated Victorian tea strainer she had inherited from her\nmother. While the other members of the family enjoyed a mug of\nunsweetened tea - sugar was only for high days and holidays - Stan\nwould open his first bottle of beer, which he usually gulped down\nin one draught. He would then rise from the table and burp loudly\nbefore picking up his lunch box, which Grandma had prepared\nwhile he was having his breakfast: two Marmite sandwiches, a\nsausage, an apple, two more bottles of beer and a packet of five\ncoffin nails. Once Stan had left for the docks, everyone began to\ntalk at once.\n\nGrandma always wanted to know who had visited the tea shop\nwhere her daughter worked as a waitress: what they ate, what they\nwere wearing, where they sat; details of meals that were cooked on\na stove in a room lit by electric light bulbs that didn\u2019t leave any\ncandle wax, not to mention customers who sometimes left a\nthruppenny-bit tip, which Maisie had to split with the cook.\nMaisie was more concerned to find out what Harry had done at\nschool the previous day. She demanded a daily report, which\ndidn\u2019t seem to interest Grandma, perhaps because she\u2019d never been\nto school. Come to think of it, she\u2019d never been to a tea shop\neither.\nGrandpa rarely commented, because after four years of loading\nand unloading an artillery field gun, morning, noon and night, he\nwas so deaf he had to satisfy himself with watching their lips move\nand nodding from time to time. This could give outsiders the\nimpression he was stupid, which the rest of the family knew to\ntheir cost he wasn\u2019t.\nThe family\u2019s morning routine only varied at weekends. On\nSaturdays, Harry would follow his uncle out of the kitchen, always\nremaining a pace behind him as he walked to the docks. On\nSunday, Harry\u2019s mum would accompany the boy to Holy Nativity\nChurch, where, from the third row of the pews, she would bask in\nthe glory of the choir\u2019s treble soloist.\nBut today was Saturday. During the twenty-minute walk to the\ndocks, Harry never opened his mouth unless his uncle spoke.\n\nWhenever he did, it invariably turned out to be the same\nconversation they\u2019d had the previous Saturday.\n\u2018When are you goin\u2019 to leave school and do a day\u2019s work,\nyoung\u2019un?\u2019 was always Uncle Stan\u2019s opening salvo.\n\u2018Not allowed to leave until I\u2019m fourteen,\u2019 Harry reminded him.\n\u2018It\u2019s the law.\u2019\n\u2018A bloody stupid law, if you ask me. I\u2019d packed up school and\nwas workin\u2019 on the docks by the time I were twelve,\u2019 Stan would\nannounce as if Harry had never heard this profound observation\nbefore. Harry didn\u2019t bother to respond, as he already knew what\nhis uncle\u2019s next sentence would be. \u2018And what\u2019s more I\u2019d signed\nup to join Kitchener\u2019s army before my seventeenth birthday.\u2019\n\u2018Tell me about the war, Uncle Stan,\u2019 said Harry, aware that this\nwould keep him occupied for several hundred yards.\n\u2018Me and your dad joined the Royal Gloucestershire Regiment on\nthe same day,\u2019 Stan said, touching his cloth cap as if saluting a\ndistant memory. \u2018After twelve weeks\u2019 basic training at Taunton\nBarracks, we was shipped off to Wipers to fight the Boche. Once\nwe got there, we spent most of our time cooped up in rat-infested\ntrenches waiting to be told by some toffee-nosed officer that when\nthe bugle sounded, we was going over the top, bayonets fixed,\nrifles firing as we advanced towards the enemy lines.\u2019 This would\nbe followed by a long pause, after which Stan would add, \u2018I was\none of the lucky ones. Got back to Blighty all ship-shape and\nBristol fashion.\u2019 Harry could have predicted his next sentence\n\nword for word, but remained silent. \u2018You just don\u2019t know how\nlucky you are, my lad. I lost two brothers, your uncle Ray and\nyour uncle Bert, and your father not only lost a brother, but his\nfather, your other grandad, what you never met. A proper man,\nwho could down a pint of beer faster than any docker I\u2019ve ever\ncome across.\u2019\nIf Stan had looked down, he would have seen the boy mouthing\nhis words, but today, to Harry\u2019s surprise, Uncle Stan added a\nsentence he\u2019d never uttered before. \u2018And your dad would still be\nalive today, if only management had listened to me.\u2019\nHarry was suddenly alert. His dad\u2019s death had always been the\nsubject of whispered conversations and hushed tones. But Uncle\nStan clammed up, as if he realized he\u2019d gone too far. Maybe next\nweek, thought Harry, catching his uncle up and keeping in step\nwith him as if they were two soldiers on a parade ground.\n\u2018So who are City playin\u2019 this afternoon?\u2019 asked Stan, back on\nscript.\n\u2018Charlton Athletic,\u2019 Harry replied.\n\u2018They\u2019re a load of old cobblers.\u2019\n\u2018They trounced us last season,\u2019 Harry reminded his uncle.\n\u2018Bloody lucky, if you ask me,\u2019 said Stan, and didn\u2019t open his\nmouth again. When they reached the entrance to the dockyard, Stan\nclocked in before heading off to the pen where he was working\nwith a gang of other dockers, none of whom could afford to be a\n\nminute late. Unemployment was at an all-time high and too many\nyoung men were standing outside the gates waiting to take their\nplace.\nHarry didn\u2019t follow his uncle, because he knew that if Mr\nHaskins caught him hanging around the sheds he would get a clip\nround the ear, followed by a boot up the backside from his uncle\nfor annoying the ganger. Instead, he set off in the opposite\ndirection.\nHarry\u2019s first port of call every Saturday morning was Old Jack\nTar, who lived in the railway carriage at the other end of the\ndockyard. He had never told Stan about his regular visits because\nhis uncle had warned him to avoid the old man at all costs.\n\u2018Probably hasn\u2019t had a bath in years,\u2019 said a man who washed\nonce a quarter, and then only after Harry\u2019s mother complained\nabout the smell.\nBut curiosity had long ago got the better of Harry, and one\nmorning he\u2019d crept up to the railway carriage on his hands and\nknees, lifted himself up and peeped through a window. The old\nman was sitting in first class, reading a book.\nOld Jack turned to face him and said, \u2018Come on in, lad.\u2019 Harry\njumped down, and didn\u2019t stop running until he reached his front\ndoor.\nThe following Saturday, Harry once again crawled up to the\ncarriage and peered inside. Old Jack seemed to be fast asleep, but\n\nthen Harry heard him say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you come in, my boy? I\u2019m\nnot going to bite you.\u2019\nHarry turned the heavy brass handle and tentatively pulled open\nthe carriage door, but he didn\u2019t step inside. He just stared at the\nman seated in the centre of the carriage. It was hard to tell how old\n\nhe was because his face was covered in a well-groomed salt-and-\npepper beard, which made him look like the sailor on the Players\n\nPlease packet. But he looked at Harry with a warmth in his eyes\nthat Uncle Stan had never managed.\n\u2018Are you Old Jack Tar?\u2019 Harry ventured.\n\u2018That\u2019s what they call me,\u2019 the old man replied.\n\u2018And is this where you live?\u2019 Harry asked, glancing around the\ncarriage, his eyes settling on a stack of old newspapers piled high\non the opposite seat.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he replied. \u2018It\u2019s been my home for these past twenty\nyears. Why don\u2019t you close the door and take a seat, young man?\u2019\nHarry gave the offer some thought before he jumped back out of\nthe carriage and once again ran away.\nThe following Saturday, Harry did close the door, but he kept\nhold of the handle, ready to bolt if the old man as much as twitched\na muscle. They stared at each other for some time before Old Jack\nasked, \u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019\"\"\"\n\n\n\ntext= re.sub(r'\\[[0-9]*\\]', ' ', paragraph)\ntext=text.lower()\ntext= re.sub(r'\\d+', ' ', text)\ntext= text.translate(str.maketrans('','', string.punctuation))\ntext= re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text)","17e3b51a":"# Preparing the dataset\nsentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)\n\nsentences = [nltk.word_tokenize(sentence) for sentence in sentences]\n\nfor i in range(len(sentences)):\n    sentences[i] = [word for word in sentences[i] if word not in stopwords.words('english')]\n    ","9047b526":"# Training the Word2Vec model\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\nmodel = Word2Vec(sentences, min_count=1)\n\n\nwords = model.wv.vocab\nwords\n\n# Finding Word Vectors\nvector = model.wv['stupid']\n#vector\n\n# Most similar words\nsimilar = model.wv.most_similar('door')\n#similar","3daeff9b":"#Creating the Bag of Words model\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\ncv= CountVectorizer()\nX= cv.fit_transform(corpus).toarray()\n\n#Visting the full array\n#import sys\n#import numpy\n#numpy.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)\n#X","a5d078db":"#Creating the TF-IDF model\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\ntf= TfidfVectorizer()\nX= tf.fit_transform(corpus).toarray()\n\n#Visting the full array\n#import sys\n#import numpy\n#numpy.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)\n#X","11c06da3":"# **Word2Vec**","2e02a367":"# **TF-IDF**","127c7cc1":"# **Bag of Words**"}}
