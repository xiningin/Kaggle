Please note that Google AutoML is a **paid service**\n   \n   But dont worry. They give us $300 free credit when creating a new GCP project, and bonus credit when newly start the google AutoML NL service. Also they don't charge automatically if you don't agree it explicitly.\n    - [AutoML Pricing policy](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/natural-language\/automl\/pricing?_ga=2.154004159.-640232925.1583643870&_gac=1.207751462.1584364219.EAIaIQobChMI66KVk8ae6AIV2aqWCh3VQwCxEAAYASAAEgI7ZvD_BwE) \n    - You can check your billing account status [here](https:\/\/console.cloud.google.com\/billing)\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gHLTZoq.png)\n\n2. AutoML tends to work better on larger datasets and **takes a lot of times for training**. In our example, we pick a small dataset (few thousand rows) from [\"Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/nlp-getting-startedwhere) competition. Even for this small dataset, it takes about 3~4 hours for trining.\n\n3. Understanding of GCS structure would help you.\n    - One GCS account can have several projects. The project corresponds to one application. \n    - A project has a storage you can upload or download data. The storage has serveral buckets.\n    - You can make serveral datasets in your project. From one dataset, one model is trained.\n\nSo, **we are going to create GCP project and upload our data to certain bucket. And then, we can make our dataset and develope model.**","787c0af6":"### (optional) Undeploy model\nYou can undeploy the model to stop charges"}}
