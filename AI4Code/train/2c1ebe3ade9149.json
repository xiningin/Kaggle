For instance if p is 5, the predictors for x(t) will be x(t-1)\u2026.x(t-5).\n\n2.Number of MA (Moving Average) terms (q): MA terms are lagged forecast errors in prediction equation. For instance if q is 5, the predictors for x(t) will be e(t-1)\u2026.e(t-5) where e(i) is the difference between the moving average at ith instant and actual value.\n\n3.Number of Differences (d): These are the number of nonseasonal differences, i.e. in this case we took the first order difference.

This is a good indication that the residuals are normally distributed. 2.The qq-plot on the bottom left shows that the ordered distribution of residuals (blue dots) follows the linear trend of the samples taken from a standard normal distribution with N(0, 1). Again, this is a strong indication that the residuals are normally distributed. 3.The residuals over time (top left plot) don't display any obvious seasonality and appear to be white noise. This is confirmed by the autocorrelation (i.e. correlogram) plot on the bottom right, which shows that the time series residuals have low correlation with lagged versions of itself.\n\nThose observations lead us to conclude that our model produces a satisfactory fit that could help us understand our time series data and forecast future values.","792c8d6b":"Any suggetion or feedback is heartily welcomed.
