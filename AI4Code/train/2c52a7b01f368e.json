On the day appointed for the race the two\n            started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on\n            with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare,\n            lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and\n            moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal,\n            and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.\n\n            Slow but steady wins the race.\"\"\"\n\n#Source The Project Gutenberg EBook of Aesop\u2019s Fables http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/21\/21-0.txt\n\n \nlanguage = 'en' # Language of audiobook, en is English \n\n\n","8358acbe":"myobj = gTTS(text=mytext, lang=language, slow=False) #create the object by using text, language and speed\n\nmyobj.save(\"Hare_and_Tortoise.mp3\")  # Saving the converted audio in a mp3 file\n\n\nos.system(\"mpg321 Hare_and_Tortoise.mp3\")  # Playing the converted file ","0b9dfd6b":"# Create an Audiobook\n\n![https:\/\/static.voices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/History-of-Audiobooks.jpg](https:\/\/static.voices.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/History-of-Audiobooks.jpg)\n\nEver wanted to read a book but were too tired or lazy to read?\nHere is a quick and easy way to create an audiobook with less than 10 lines of code!\n\nHope you find it interesting...","532e9ebf":"# Listen to\/Download the Audio file\n\nFor those new to Kaggle,  you will see the some headers including \"Output\" section on the right side panel\n\n![audio%20book.JPG](attachment:audio%20book.JPG)\n\nThe mp3 file is saved in the \"output\" section of the Kaggle notebook. \nClick on the \"Output\" section on the right side panel as in the image above...\n\nYou can play the audio in Kaggle itself or...\n\nYou may download this by using the download icon and the left hand panel and play in your PC!!\n\nTry out some other text you want to convert to audiobooks and share your experiences!\n\n# Happy listening!","d8f2e250":"# The text that you want to convert to audio ","57b881fd":"# Import the required libraries","79c9df96":"![https:\/\/goodereader.com\/blog\/uploads\/images\/audiobooks.png](https:\/\/goodereader.com\/blog\/uploads\/images\/audiobooks.png)","0ed74d5c":"# Install the library in the environment"}}
