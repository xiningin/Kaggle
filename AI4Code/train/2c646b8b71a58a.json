As of now, there are a total of 229 metro stations including the Airport Express stations. The first section of the Delhi Metro opened on 25 December 2002 with the Red Line,[2] and has since been expanded to around 347.66 km(216.03 miles) of route length as of 4 October 2019. The network has nine operational lines and is built and operated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC). The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation makes 2,700 trips per day carrying 1.5 million passengers, who on an average travel a distance of 17 kilometres each.\n\nFor this project, we will try to look at the places surrounding these metro stations and classify them accordng to the similarity of nearby venues. Every one use metro transit to migrate from one place to another for reasons which can be personal of professional. If there are more professional places like companies, offices surrounding a station then it will mostly be used by working professionals. Then there are some stations with many unversities or colleges nearby and is used by Students mostly. Stations which have places like amusement parks, malls, monuments are used by people for recreation. \n\nWe can classify stations by primary usage analyzing the data that contains the number of nearby venues according to their category. This can help plan further extension of the network and find places for new development.","61da393d":"Checking the progress of our data for a final time to make sure we are going in right direction","114d1d24":"__The advantage of using Foursquare api is that venues are classiied in particular categories which will make it easy to calculate the number of venues surround a given location for each category and that is actually the base of our classification.__","bbf83b75":"Plotting the curve ","ef899687":"For a clear visualization we have used the line with their actual color in hexadecimal code. For example, Station on 'Red Line' will be marked with red color. ","ae4eb61c":"So we have the data and using an unsupervised clustering Algorithm known as KMeans Clusteing we will Create clusters.\nTo get started You may know that 'K' Means Numbers of clusters in which data is to be categorized. \nNow problem is we dont know how to evaluate the best K value so we will run the Kmeans algorithm on different values of K. Then we will use some measures or metrics to see which K value will be the most suitable.","011d5bed":"First we will use the 'ELBOW METHOD' to check the most appropriate value of K.","a1ac5c75":"Here too we see that value of silhoutte score is max at cluster 2 but we know that we will need to create more than two clusters.

The Foursquare counts for the venues that we can explore via Foursquare data. This doesn\u2019t take into account other attributes that are essential and impotant to take while making clusters like Venue's size, services it provide, small shops or 'Rehdis' that are usually present almost everywhere. Moreover we do not take into account the Food while analysis as this is the attribute almost equal everywhere.\n\nAlso using Geocoder has some limitations in how accurate the geocoding of an address will be returned. There is also ambiguity with some places due to similar names or changes in names.","6d7843d5":"We see that we cannot make clear prediction from the Elbow curve i.e a value of K after which sum_of_squared_distances is almost stable.\n\nNext Let us try to use anothe method which is known as Silhoutte Score Method.","2d2409e5":"Data Analysis Shows that **Blue cluster\/ Cluster 0** have high value in almost all the fields of College & University, Professional & Other Places, Outdoors & Recreation, Shops & Service and also in other categories for some stations. \n\n1. From the map, if we compare it with the Line station map we see that almost every Station on Red line falls in this cluster. \n2. Moreover, there are small patches in the north and south delhi region where there are many colleges of Delhi university and other institutions.","0ab726ba":"Converting all the line with a integer value so that we can use it easily.\n- Blue line and Green line diverge or branch so simplicity we have taken them as the same line.","345327d5":"<hr>"}}
