The empty string often represents a missing text value.\n\nNumeric data and logical data are generally well-behaved, but strings of text data can be very messy and difficult to work with. Cleaning text data is often one of the most laborious steps in preparing real data sets for analysis. We will revisit strings and functions to help you clean text data in future lesson.","3e191d78":"In Python, \"None\" is a special data type that is often used to represent a missing value. For example, if you define a function that doesn't return anything (does not give you back some resulting value) it will return \"None\" by default.","6b9fd87f":"Similar to math expressions, logical expressions have a fixed order of operations. In a logical statement, comparisons like >, < and == are executed first, followed by \"not\", then \"and\" and finally \"or\". See the following link to learn more: [Python operator precedence](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/reference\/expressions.html#operator-precedence). Use parentheses to enforce the desired order of operations.","5900f8c7":"Floating point numbers or \"floats\" are numbers with decimal values. Unlike integers, floating point numbers don't have unlimited precision because irrational decimal numbers are infinitely long and therefore can't be stored in memory. Instead, the computer approximates the value of long decimals, so there can be small rounding errors in long floats. This error is so minuscule it usually isn't of concern to us, but it can add up in certain cases when making many repeated calculations.\n\nEvery number in Python with a decimal point is a float, even if there are no non-zero numbers after the decimal:","eeafc7b8":"You can convert numbers into boolean values using the bool() function.
