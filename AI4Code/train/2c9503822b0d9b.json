Conclusion<\/p>\n\nIt's clear that there are multiple ways to perform forecasting. Both Prophet-libraries are very easy to use and have some great features! Unfortunately due to a lack of data we weren't capable of further testing the created models. The Prophet models are definitely not the final model, we could add more features like holidays to get an even better performance. I'm honestly really looking forward use these extra features in future projects!\n\nUnderneed you can see a summary of the trained models:\n\n| **Model**  | **RMSE**  | **Remark** |\n|---|---|---|\n| FB Prophet  | \/  | Not enough data |\n| Neural Prophet | \/ | Not enough data|\n| XGBoost | 1015 | \/ |\n| LSTM model | 414 | \/ | \n\n\nThe best performing models was as expected the LSTM model. It took me a little while to get the parameters right, but in the end the prediction looks pretty good and it was well worth the effort! \n\nOverall I found this a really fun and interesting project, testing out multiple libraries on the same dataset.\n\n### Thank you for reading this notebook! Please comment if you have any questions and an upvote would be appreciated!","f244156b":"Yes again both models did a great job at capturing the trend.

Multivariate prophet\n\nA multivariate model, is a timeseries model where the input are multiple features varying over time. Here we'll be focusing on the daily data since we can easily compare it to the model above.\n\nTo add these features we'll use the [.add_regressor()](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/docs\/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.html#additional-regressors) function.","3c284a23":"If we look over a timespan from one week it's clear that less bikes are rented within the weekend.\n\n### 2.2.3. Amount of bike shares in a day\n\n\nWhat about a single day? Since there are two types of days (holiday\/normal day) let's compare these.","99735d5a":"Above you can see that we were training a model with additional regressors. Unfortunately due to a lack of data we cant futher test this. The only solution would be to split the data and define our own function for seasonality, add this to the trained model and then test it again. But for now I'm considering this as \"out-of-scope\".","8dceb135":"It's clear that our model did a good job predicting future bike shares. I'm certain it will be making reliable prediction in the future. Checking the model components (trend + cyclic component [yearly seasonality, weekly seasonality] and effects of the holidays at this stage.","b59ca2e5":"# <p style=\"background-color:skyblue; font-family:calibri; font-size:150%; text-align:center\" id=\"LSTM\"> 7. LSTM Modelling<\/p>\n\nIn this chapter we'll be creating a bidirectional LSTM model. It's basically a LSTM model (RNN) which presents each training sequence forwards and backwards through the layer. Thanks to this it picks up the sequential information about all points before and after it. [Here's](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/develop-bidirectional-lstm-sequence-classification-python-keras\/) another example where Bi-LSTM is used to classify sequences.\n\nIf you're not familiar with recurrent networks I recommend you to read this [notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/thebrownviking20\/intro-to-recurrent-neural-networks-lstm-gru).\n\nWe'll be using the Keras library to implement this model.","84ae1cad":"# <p style=\"background-color:skyblue; font-family:calibri; font-size:150%; text-align:center\" id=\"prophet\"> 3. Prophet<\/p>\n\nOpensource library for univariate timeseries forecasting, Luckely prophets also implements an additive time series forecasting model. More information about the Prophet library can be found [here](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/).\n\n\nIn the documentation of Prophet i found the following.\n\n> Prophet will by default fit weekly and yearly seasonalities, if the time series is more than two cycles long. It will also fit daily seasonality for a sub-daily time series. You can add other seasonalities (monthly, quarterly, hourly) using the add_seasonality method (Python) or function (R).\n([link Specific Custom Seasonalities](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/docs\/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.html))\n\nWhen you're using Prophet it's important to know that you need atleast two full periods (yearly) of your data so that the model can completely capture the trend. Although it is possible to add your own seasonalities and other trend manually to the model (.[add_seasonality](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/docs\/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.html#specifying-custom-seasonalities)) I won't be doing this for now.\n\nIf you're dealing with holidays, check this [link](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/docs\/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.html#modeling-holidays-and-special-events) to add these to your model.\nOther non daily events can be addressed with through this [method](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/docs\/non-daily_data.html#sub-daily-data). As you can see alot of customization can be done to a train model giving you full control of the trend created. That's exactly why I wanted to test this library! \n\n\n<a id=\"univariateprophet\"><\/a>\n\n## 3.1. Univariate Prophet\n\nWe we'll be try to predict both the daily and hourly sales. We'll have to use all of the data since we barely have two full yearly periods of bike shares. Unfortunately this means that evaluating the model with unseen data is not possible.","53816073":"It's clear that when the weather is good (1,2,3,4,7) more bikes are rented then when the weather is bad (10,26)","0be1aeb4":"It seems like there is small peak when the windspeed is at around 25 km\/h.\n\n\n### 2.2.7.

Neural Prophet Modelling<\/p>\n\n[Neural Prophet](https:\/\/neuralprophet.com\/model-overview\/#when-to-use-neuralprophet) is another time series forecasting tool based on the Facebook Prophet. It's developed in a fully modular architecture which makes it easily scalable! This library is pretty young and continuous to add more features to the library. \n\nMore information about how this model works can be found [here](https:\/\/neuralprophet.com\/model-overview\/#when-to-use-neuralprophet). One clear difference is that it now uses a neural network called [AR-Net](https:\/\/github.com\/ourownstory\/AR-Net) to handle the auto-regression part.\n","5968a826":"The prophet library requires some specific transformations.","d7899480":"The xgb model did a good job at capturing the trend. But there is still quite a big difference with the ground truth. Let's see if an LSTM neural network can do a better job at this forecasting.","66cd542d":"Both forecasts are already doing pretty good without that much effort! Let's view their components!","84a9ebfb":"Above you can see the **ProfileReport()**. When looking at the report it's clear that we have a clean dataset. \n\nOne thing I did notice is that the timestamp isn't of the type \"DateTime\". We're gonna change this and also set the timestamp as index.","5ae18c67":"Unfortunately since we needed to use all hour training data it's not possible to evaluate the models we created. We'll have to evaluate them visually instead.","2b52290f":"It's clear that more bikes are rented in summer time then winter time. Could this be related to the temperature? (See chapter 2.2.4)"}}
