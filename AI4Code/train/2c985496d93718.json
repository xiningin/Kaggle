How often does this occur? Generate a `Series`that, for each review in the dataset, states whether the wine reviewed has a null `price`.","f47eaec4":"**Exercise 2**: Create a `Series` from entries in the `price` column, but convert the entries to strings. Hint: strings are `str` in native Python.","bf270768":"**Exercise 4**: What are the most common wine-producing regions? Create a `Series` counting the number of times each value occurs in the `region_1` field. This field is often missing data, so replace missing values with `Unknown`. Sort in descending order.  Your output should look something like this:\n\n```\nUnknown                    21247\nNapa Valley                 4480\n                           ...  \nBardolino Superiore            1\nPrimitivo del Tarantino        1\nName: region_1, Length: 1230, dtype: int64\n```","82f16870":"**Exercise 5**: A neat property of boolean data types, like the ones created by the `isnull()` method, is that `False` gets treated as 0 and `True` as 1 when performing math on the values. Thus, the `sum()` of a list of boolean values will return how many times `True` appears in that list.\nCreate a `pandas` `Series` showing how many times each of the columns in the dataset contains null values.
