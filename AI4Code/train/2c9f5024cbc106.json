Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:\n\n<b>longitude<\/b> : A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west\n\n<b>latitude<\/b> : A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north\n\n<b>housingmedianage<\/b> : Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building\n\n<b>total_rooms<\/b> : Total number of rooms within a block\n\n<b>total_bedrooms<\/b> : Total number of bedrooms within a block\n\n<b>population<\/b> : Total number of people residing within a block\n\n<b>households<\/b> : Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block\n\n<b>median_income<\/b> : Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)\n\n<b>medianhousevalue<\/b> : Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)\n\n<b>ocean_proximity<\/b> :  Location of the house w.r.t ocean\/sea\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThis data was initially featured in the following paper:\nPace, R.
