In this case we can use boxplots from Seaborn library. Box plot is a compact way to show real value statistics (mean and quartiles) by different values of categorical feature. It also helps to find outliers - observations that have very different values from others.","9372ffeb":"First thing you should do after reading the data is to look at first records. It helps to find the data reading errors (for example, when we have 1 column instead of 10 and it has 9 dots with commas in column name). Also it allows to take a closer look at the data and features and their nature (numerical, categorical, etc.).\n\nThan we should plot histograms of feature distributions. Also it can help to understand features nature (power-series distribution or standard or something else). Histogram can help us find some values that aren't similar to each other - outliers.\nIt is convenient to plot histograms using *plot* method of Pandas DataFrame with option *kind='hist'*.\n\n**Example.** Let's plot the histogram of teenager's height distribution. We use method *plot* for DataFrame *data* with options *y='Height'* (the feature which distribution we want to plot).","8960c190":"In this task we will use [SOCR](http:\/\/wiki.stat.ucla.edu\/socr\/index.php\/SOCR_Data_Dinov_020108_HeightsWeights) data containing information about height and weight of 25 thousands teenagers.","6a0a94a0":"One of the most effective methods of basic data analysis is mapping pairwise dependencies of features. We make $m \\times m$ plots (*m* is number of features) where we have histograms of feature distributions in diagonal and scatter plots of two feature dependencies outside. We can do this using $scatter\\_matrix$ method of Pandas Data Frame or *pairplot* of Seaborn library. \n\nTo illustrate this method we add third feature. Let's create *bodymass index* ([BMI](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Body_mass_index)). To do this we use *apply* method of Pandas FataFrame and Python's lambda functions.","ab494468":"Create objects of type matplotlib.figure.Figure (picture) and  matplotlib.axes._subplots.Axes3DSubplot (axes).
