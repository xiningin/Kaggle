Unstructured textual data is produced at a large scale, and it\u2019s important to process and derive insights from unstructured data. To do that, you need to represent the data in a format that can be understood by computers. NLP can help you do that.","a5cb627e":"# What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is a sub-task of information extraction (IE) that seeks out and categorises specified entities in a body or bodies of texts. NER is also simply known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction. NER is used in many fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI) including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.\n"}}
