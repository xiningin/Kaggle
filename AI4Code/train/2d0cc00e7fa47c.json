Impute missing \"embarked\" value\nThere are also just two missing values in the `Embarked` column. Here we will just use the Pandas 'backfill' method.\n","ddbdd97c":"<a id=\"feature-engineering\"><\/a>\n# 3. Add family size column\nWe can use the two variables of **Parch** and **SibSp** to create a new variable called **Family_Size**. This is simply done by adding `Parch` and `SibSp` together.","449409e6":"### Extract title from name\nWe can use a regular expression to extract the title from the `Name` column. We will do this by finding the adjacent letters that are immediately followed by a full stop.\n","d05a5ddf":"<a id=\"impute-missing\"><\/a>\n# 2. Imputation \nWe can see above that there are a few columns with missing values. The `Cabin` column is missing over 1000 values, so we won't use that for predictions, but the `Age`, `Embarked` and `Fare` columns are all complete enough that we can fill in the missing values through imputation.   \n<a id=\"age\"><\/a>\n## 2.1. Impute missing age values\nA simple option for the missing age values is to use the median age value. Let's go a little further and use each passenger's *Title* to estimate their age. E.g. if a passenger has the title of *Dr*, I will give them the median age value for all other passengers with the same title.","281aef9c":"<a id=\"loading\"><\/a>\n# 1. Load packages and data\nFirst step, as always, is to import the necessary Python packages and load the input data as a Pandas dataframe.\n\nI chose to combine the train and test set into one. Since we will have to impute some missing age and fare values, I prefer to do this across the entire dataset, rather than separately across train and test sets. ","2f91188b":"### Use median of title group\nNow, for each missing age value, we will impute the age using the median age for all people with the same title.","507a3a77":"As we can see above, there are quite a few different titles. However, many of these titles are just French versions of the more common English titles, e.g. Mme = Madame = Mrs.   \n\nWe will use the six most common titles, replacing all other titles with the most appropriate of these six.","bed4458a":"# Table of Contents:\n\n- **1.

Below, we see that each title has a distinctly different median age. \n> **Note**: There is no risk in doing this after imputation, as the median of an age group has not been affected by our actions.","557dae6a":"### Use only the most common titles\nLet's take a look at the unique titles across all passengers:","a1df59d7":"# 4.
