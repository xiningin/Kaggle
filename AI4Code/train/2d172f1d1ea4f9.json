One of the problem your client is facing is around identifying the right people for promotion (only for manager position and below) and prepare them in time. Currently the process, they are following is:\n\n    . They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations\/ past performance\n    \n    . Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical\n        \n    . At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., employee gets promotion\n    \n    . For above mentioned process, the final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to their new roles. Hence, company needs your help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle. \n\nThey have provided multiple attributes around Employee's past and current performance along with demographics. \n\nNow, The task is to predict whether a potential promotee at checkpoint in the test set will be promoted or not after the evaluation process.","f59d75d8":"Combining Awards Won, KPI,Previous year rating","659c4be2":"People who are getiting maximum promotions\n    \n    Sales adn markerting bachelors\n    technology bachelors\n    technology masters abd above\n    Analytics, bachelors\n    operations, bachelors\n    operation s masters and above\n","ca7265cf":"Recruitment Channel : ","be79dbd8":"Accuracy :\n        \n        0.4385964912280702.","9b537168":"maximum poeple who got promoted had previous year rating of 3.5 to 5 \n\none poeple is having a rating of 1.0 who os not promoted which is true","24a30c48":"\nApplying GRADIENT BOOSTING","c5595009":"##### Applying Xtreme GRdaient boosting","783a3219":"Maximum Region id is region 2","ef2cc15c":"### Feature Engineering ","0da63ad4":"This column does have much impact on other columns","06a96392":"So basically it is a Classification Problem as we have to know if employee will be promoted or not","c86b3fd0":"#### Feature Engineering\n\n    sum_performance = addition of the important factors for the promotion (awards_won;KpIs_met & previous_year_rating).\n    \n    Total nmber of training hours = avg_training_score * no_of_training\n    \n    recruitment_channel have no impact on the promotion so removed that.","3287b399":"Inferences : \n    \n    Bachelors sales and marketing with age count is very high\n    Bachleors with opetrations\n    then, bachelors in tech and procurement, analytics\n    \n    masters, S adn Marketing\n    then operations\n    tech,procurement, analytics\n    \n    Bachelors sales and marketing are most\n    ","78341fb3":"         559 PEOPLE WHO GOT PROMOTED AND WON AWARDS","7c6ce8d3":"Sales & Marketing\n\nOperations\n\nProcurement\n","62be4abd":"average training score is grouped we can clearly see it\n\n    most people lie on 45-50 bracket with higher intensity\n    a few people lie on 70 bracket\n    50,60,70,85","547efc37":"#### Model Accuracy on Analytics Vidhya : 0.4516129032258064.\n","9a6adf0f":": 0.44629629629629636.","fea3e49c":"0.458","499e912a":"#### Adaboostikng ","fe7dcd21":"#### Max people with 3 years of work ex so its quiet definited that they got promoted the most\n","f8be4c54":"##### Maximum people with rating = 3 \n##### Minimum people with rating = 2.0","dbeef6e4":"maximum poeple who won awards have 3 to 5 previous year rating","74cb5953":"#### most poeple have done 1 Year of training ","7c837216":"Most people who got promoted and won awards are of 30 years of age ","6e7917f1":"0.446","42866b7d":"Sales and Marketing Male are very high\n\nBachelors Operations Female are very high after that procurement,technology"}}
