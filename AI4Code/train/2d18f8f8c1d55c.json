We could go through and check each row by hand, of course, and hand-correct inconsistencies when we find them. There's a more efficient way to do this, though!","cad062f3":"We can see that two of the items in the cities are very close to \"south korea\": \"south korea\" and \"southkorea\". Let's replace all rows in our \"Country\" column that have a ratio of > 47 with \"south korea\". \n\nTo do this, I'm going to write a function. (It's a good idea to write a general purpose function you can reuse if you think you might have to do a specific task more than once or twice. This keeps you from having to copy and paste code too often, which saves time and can help prevent mistakes.)","73135be7":"Now that we have a function, we can put it to the test!","78ced0b3":"And now let's check the unique values in our \"Country\" column again and make sure we've tidied up \"south korea\" correctly.","be4594c4":"# Do some preliminary text pre-processing\n\nWe'll begin by taking a quick look at the first few rows of the data.","b3603ce8":"Next we're going to tackle more difficult inconsistencies.\n\n# Use fuzzy matching to correct inconsistent data entry\n\nAlright, let's take another look at the 'Country' column and see if there's any more data cleaning we need to do.","5d2b4536":"Excellent! Now we only have \"south korea\" in our dataframe and we didn't have to change anything by hand. \n\n# Your turn!\n\nTherre are still some inconsistencies in the dataset.

Inconsistencies in capitalizations and trailing white spaces are very common in text data and you can fix a good 80% of your text data entry inconsistencies by doing this.","b34fa933":"It does look like there is another inconsistency: 'southkorea' and 'south korea' should be the same. \n\nWe're going to use the [fuzzywuzzy](https:\/\/github.com\/seatgeek\/fuzzywuzzy) package to help identify which strings are closest to each other. This dataset is small enough that we could probably could correct errors by hand, but that approach doesn't scale well. (Would you want to correct a thousand errors by hand? What about ten thousand? Automating things as early as possible is generally a good idea. Plus, it\u2019s fun!)\n\n> **Fuzzy matching:** The process of automatically finding text strings that are very similar to the target string. In general, a string is considered \"closer\" to another one the fewer characters you'd need to change if you were transforming one string into another. So \"apple\" and \"snapple\" are two changes away from each other (add \"s\" and \"n\") while \"in\" and \"on\" and one change away (rplace \"i\" with \"o\"). You won't always be able to rely on fuzzy matching 100%, but it will usually end up saving you at least a little time.\n\nFuzzywuzzy returns a ratio given two strings. The closer the ratio is to 100, the smaller the edit distance between the two strings. Here, we're going to get the ten strings from our list of cities that have the closest distance to \"d.i khan\"."}}
