attempts.","7a0dc852":"Kickoffs and Punts both had a peak at penalties of 10 yards. Extra Point attepts had two peaks at 5 and 15 yeards, while Field Goal attempts had a high number of 0-yard penalties. That's probably worth further investigation.","b5cec262":"Punt plays resulted in by far the most penalty yards on special-teams plays with 5,730. Field Goals resulted in the fewest.
