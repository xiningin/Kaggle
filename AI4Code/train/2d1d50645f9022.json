Weekdays are safer, Sundays being the safest.","48d89b1b":"# Inference\n\nWhat we have done here is we checked how many standard deviations is our data above or below the mean. This clearly gives us some interesting insights:\n1. Fridays record the most number of accidents. almost 0.95(STD) above the average accidents per weak.\n2. Saturday, Sunday encounter the least. Sunday lower among the both. What might be the reason? No Jobs ? Not sure Sunday's also mean more amount of outings. But still, since weekends are seeing a sudden decline in number of accidents, it might mean due to no job goers.\n\nNow let's look at the part of the day when accidents occur the most.","bf57cbb4":"So now we would look at how accidents occur on Fridays. Also we look at what time do they occur mostly","15eee046":"# Inference\nSo if we look closely, on Friday's (The most accident prone day) more than half of the accidents occur during afternoons.

Probability of having serious accidents is highest during Fridays, it seems! However the second column which is the conditional probability of a serious accident given that it's a particular weekday shows different story alltogether. \n\n# Inference\nSundays have the highest chance of experiencing serious accidents. Also as we previously concluded, nights have the highest risk of serious accidents we can say Sunday nights have the highest risk of experiencing a serious accident.","cd2b6348":"Now let us see how serious injuries per accidents varry over the parts of days","6daa06d4":"e1W shows what proportion of accidents occuring in a part of the day cause serious injuries.\n1. 2.2% of accidents occuring during afternoons are serious and so on.\n2.

Yeah! Here is one. Just looking at the proportion of serious injuries we might conclude nights are safer as long as serious injuries are concerned. However are they really?\n\nLooking at the secound column, we can see more proportion of total accidents occuring at night are serious. This is a paradox. Blindly looking at a single data reveals wrong results. \n\nNights actually witness larger proportion of serious accidents off total accidents happening at night.
