For the sake of their friendship, any candies left over would be smashed. For example, if they collectively bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30 each and smash 1.\n\nBelow is a simple function that will calculate the number of candies to smash for *any* number of total candies.\n\nModify it so that it optionally takes a second argument representing the number of friends the candies are being split between. If no second argument is provided, it should assume 3 friends, as before.\n\nUpdate the docstring to reflect this new behaviour.","fc97da43":"# Keep Going\n\nNice job with the code.
