The NHANES is a program of studies by US government, designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States, since early 1960\u2019s. The survey consists of cross-sectional interview, examination, and laboratory data collected from a complex multistage, stratified, clustered probability sample representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population with oversampling of non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, Asians, low income persons, and older adults. The survey was approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ethics review board, and all participants provided written informed consent. \nTo Understand the epidemiology of fatty liver disease in the general population and to develop interventions that will reduce the public health burden, liver fat and stiffness biomarkers were assessed for the first time in NHANES 2017-2018 sample by transient elastography .
