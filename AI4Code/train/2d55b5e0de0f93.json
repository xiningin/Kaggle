This silly program demonstrates many important aspects of what Python code looks like and how it works. Let's review the code from top to bottom.","1a6b34ee":"\"Number\" is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but if we wanted to be more technical, we could ask Python how it would describe the type of thing that `spam_amount` is:","547b63b1":"A natural thing to want to do with numbers is perform arithmetic. We've seen the `+` operator for addition, and the `*` operator for multiplication (of a sort). Python also has us covered for the rest of the basic buttons on your calculator:\n\n| Operator     | Name           | Description                                            |\n|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| ``a + b``    | Addition       | Sum of ``a`` and ``b``                                 |\n| ``a - b``    | Subtraction    | Difference of ``a`` and ``b``                          |\n| ``a * b``    | Multiplication | Product of ``a`` and ``b``                             |\n| ``a \/ b``    | True division  | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``                            |\n| ``a \/\/ b``   | Floor division | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``, removing fractional parts |\n| ``a % b``    | Modulus        | Integer remainder after division of ``a`` by ``b``     |\n| ``a ** b``   | Exponentiation | ``a`` raised to the power of ``b``                     |\n| ``-a``       | Negation       | The negative of ``a``                                  |\n\n<span style=\"display:none\"><\/span>\n\nOne interesting observation here is that, whereas your calculator probably just has one button for division, Python can do two kinds. \"True division\" is basically what your calculator does:","06c6afd4":"The first line above is a **comment**. In Python, comments begin with the `#` symbol.\n\nNext we see an example of reassignment. Reassigning the value of an existing variable looks just the same as creating a variable - it still uses the `=` assignment operator.\n\nIn this case, the value we're assigning to `spam_amount` involves some simple arithmetic on its previous value. When it encounters this line, Python evaluates the expression on the right-hand-side of the `=` (0 + 4 = 4), and then assigns that value to the variable on the left-hand-side.","bf9000a0":"# Intro\n\nThis course covers the key Python skills you\u2019ll need so you can start using Python for data science. The course is ideal for someone with some previous coding experience who wants to add Python to their repertoire or level up their basic Python skills. (If you're a first-time coder, you may want to check out [these \"Python for Non-Programmers\" learning resources](https:\/\/wiki.python.org\/moin\/BeginnersGuide\/NonProgrammers).)\n\nWe'll start with a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, you can [skip straight to the hands-on exercise](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/1275163).","39d1b674":"We won't talk much about \"conditionals\" until later, but, even if you've never coded before, you can probably guess what this does. Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity. \n\nNote how we indicated which code belongs to the `if`. `\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"` is only supposed to be printed if `spam_amount` is positive. But the later code (like `print(viking_song)`) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?\n\nThe colon (`:`) at the end of the `if` line indicates that a new \"code block\" is starting. Subsequent lines which are **indented** are part of that code block. Some other languages use `{`curly braces`}` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace can be surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. \n\nThe later lines dealing with `viking_song` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the `if`'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we define functions and using loops.\n\nThis code snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:\n\n```python\n\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"\n```\n\nStrings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks. (But because this particular string *contains* a single-quote character, we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single-quotes, unless we're careful.)","84e2f62a":"In addition to being the names of Python's two main numerical types, `int` and `float` can also be called as functions which convert their arguments to the corresponding type:","dd612e95":"It's an `int` - short for integer.

Python offers a number of cheeky little time-saving tricks like this where operators like `*` and `+` have a different meaning depending on what kind of thing they're applied to. (The technical term for this is [operator overloading](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operator_overloading))","3407a304":"**Function calls:**. `print` is a Python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen. We call functions by putting parentheses after their name, and putting the inputs (or *arguments*) to the function in those parentheses.","7992a0e3":"### Order of operations\n\nThe arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions about the order in which operations are evaluated. Some remember these by a mnemonic such as **PEMDAS** - **P**arentheses, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication\/**D**ivision, **A**ddition\/**S**ubtraction.\n\nPython follows similar rules about which calculations to perform first.
