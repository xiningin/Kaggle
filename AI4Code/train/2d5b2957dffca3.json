Interesting Fact, There are equal no. of Visitors in the Mall for the Agee 18 and 67. People of Age 55, 56, 69, 64 are very less frequent in the Malls.

Also, we can say that the least Income is around 20 US Dollars.\n\nTaking inferences about the Customers.\n\nThe most regular customers for the Mall has age around 30-35 years of age.
