The ImageDataBunch object contains both training set and validation set and a optional test set. \n\nThe ImageDataBunch helps setup the model training process very quickly.\n\nIn the below code, we have notified the ImageDataBunch object that our data is in the \"train\" dataframe and our label column is \"diagnosis\". \n\nAlso, the image sizes are currently non coherent (of different sizes) in our dataset. It is very important to regularize the images to the same size before training. \n\nAlso we have set the batchsize to 64.

A new method for setting the learning rate named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations.

Let's see if we can achieve a higher performance here. To help it along, let's us use larger images too, since that way the network can see more detail. We reduce the batch size a bit since otherwise this larger network will require more GPU memory.","df970ec9":"The evaluation metric for the competition is quadratic kappa score. The good folk's at FASTAI have already implemented this metric.\n\nIn a nutshell, this metric determines the agreement between predicted labels and ground truth.\ne.g. If the prediction of a particular sample is mild but the ground truth is severe, the metric penalizes more compared to if the prediction is mild and ground truth is moderate.","0c9c84ca":"# Looking at the data\n\nBelow, We have defined a path variable to navigate to the data source for the problem.\n\nWe have created 2 different variables for train csv file (which contains image file names and their respective labels) and to the image data source folder itself which contains all the images.

If successful, it will not only help to prevent lifelong blindness, but these models may be used to detect other sorts of diseases in the future, like glaucoma and macular degeneration.\n\nThe dataset contains around 3.5ktraining images of retina which have been labelled by clinicians for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:\n\n0 - No DR\n\n1 - Mild\n\n2 - Moderate\n\n3 - Severe\n\n4 - Proliferative DR\n\nWe will use Fastai to solve this problem. \n## What is Fastai\n\nThe fastai library simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices.
