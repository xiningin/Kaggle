Cost function\n\nCost function is used to calculate loss between actual and predicted output by the network.\n\n<b> P.S. - although cost function and evaluation metric are very similar, there is a fine difference between two. cost function is used for backpropagation, due to which, it needs to differentiable. On the other hand, evaluation metric is used to evaluate a model's performance. <\/b> \n\nFor regression the most popular loss function is Mean Squared Error (MSE) or L2 loss.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1026\/1*SGhoeJ_BgcfqU06CmX41rw.png\" width=\"20%\">\n\nSimilarly, L1 loss or, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is also used for regression task.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1066\/1*piCo0iDgPmESnQkHSwAK6A.png\" width=\"20%\">\n\nFor classification, cross entropy loss is used.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*zi1wKAAGGt1Bn6mqo2MSFw.png\" width=\"40%\">\n\nOther loss function are -\n\n* KL divergence\n* Hinge loss\n* Triplet loss","568ccea5":"## 1e. Optimization\n\nNow that we have the loss calculated, how does NNs learn the model parameters?\n\nAs we need to learn model parameters that minimizes the overall loss, we treat the learning process as an optimization technique which updates the parameters in order to find the local (global) minima.\n\nThe name for one commonly used optimization function that adjusts weights according to the error they caused is called <b> gradient descent <\/b>.\n\nGradient is another word for slope, and slope, in its typical form on an x-y graph, represents how two variables relate to each other: rise over run, the change in money over the change in time, etc. In this particular case, the slope we care about describes the relationship between the network\u2019s error and a single weight; i.e. that is, how does the error vary as the weight is adjusted.\n\n\nThese gradients are used to understand how to update each parameter in order to get the local (global) minima.

Basics of ANN\n\nNeural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns.

Once, loss is calculated, neural network uses $\\textbf{back propagation}$ to learn the weights of the cells in it.\n\nForward propagation is the process of moving forward through the neural network (from inputs to the ultimate output or prediction). Backpropagation is the reverse. Except instead of signal, we are moving error backwards through our model.\n \n<img src=https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*UY4-RIrSVgfuhAkawKIr2w.jpeg>\n\n<img src=https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*0RIBu3Iz-aOOX9dyob_FHA.jpeg>\n\nBack propagation can be thought as a kind of feedback loop for the network.","f116e3f6":"## 1a. Neural Network Architecture\n\nDifferent types of cells are meant for different types of computations. e.g. - \n\n* Dense cell - these are meant for dense computations (basic perceptron)\n* RNN cell - recurrent neural network cell is used where we have to store some temporal information in the NN\n* Convolution cell - convolution cells are just like image filters, which are used to learn new features. Conv cells are mostly popular for image type of data.\n\nEach cell takes input of a fixed dimension and generates intermediate hidden output of fixed dimension. During building the neural network, we need to make sure of the cell inputs and outputs, so that the final layer output matches with the data output dimensions.\n\nIn deep neural networks, multiple layer of multiple such cells are stacked together. e.g. - in the above diagram, we have a simple 1-layer ANN with just dense cells.\n\nDuring the learning process, neural networks learn the weights of each of these cells. These are called the parameters of the neural network.","dbfe3e44":"In this notebook we introduce basics of neural networks.","4f77bacc":"### References\n\n1. https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/common-loss-functions-in-machine-learning-46af0ffc4d23\n\n2. https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/introducing-deep-learning-and-neural-networks-deep-learning-for-rookies-1-bd68f9cf5883\n\n3. https:\/\/pathmind.com\/wiki\/neural-network#forward\n\n4. https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/complete-guide-of-activation-functions-34076e95d044\n\n5. https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/understanding-neural-networks-19020b758230\n\n6. https:\/\/medium.com\/@amarbudhiraja\/https-medium-com-amarbudhiraja-learning-less-to-learn-better-dropout-in-deep-machine-learning-74334da4bfc5\n\n","65e16cca":"# 1b.

Regularization\n\nRegularization is a very useful technique which is used to generalize the performance of neural networks. To reduce overfitting, we need to restrict the weights of the neurons.
