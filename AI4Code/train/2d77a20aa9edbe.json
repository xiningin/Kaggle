This Kernel doesn't contain any modelling, I just randomly guess the output, so that so that you can know if your model is actually **\"learning something\"**.  If you can get a much higher score than this one, that means you are doing it correctly, congrat!","cbf8302e":"## generate output","9ecff738":"##  initial Environment"}}
