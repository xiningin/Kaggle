They're mostly aimed at experienced Python coders who are taking the Python challenge as a refresher. If that doesn't describe you, feel free to skip this one.<\/small>\n\nSuppose we want to create two variables, `a` and `b`, both initialized to 0. The obvious way to do this would be...\n\n```python\na = 0\nb = 0```\n\nBut if you've read a lot of Python code, you may be aware of the following nifty shortcut:\n\n```python\na = b = 0\n```\n\nCan you think of a case where it makes a difference which syntax we use, when initializing two variables to the same value?","0118c2f2":"<hr\/>\n## 6. <span title=\"Spicy\" style=\"color: coral\">\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f<\/span>\n\nThe following is an example of a tricky piece of arithmetic manipulation you might encounter when using Python for visualization.\n\nSuppose we're working with the [QuickDraw dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/google\/tinyquickdraw) of doodled sketches and we want to visualize several sketches at once in a grid-like arrangement.\n\nWe'd like to reserve 2x2 inches for each image, and we'd like the whole grid to be no wider than 16 inches.\n\nThe code below almost works. It does the following:\n\n1. Get a random number of sketches from some category (e.g. bears, stars, hockey sticks...)\n2. Create variables `rows`, `cols`, `height`, and `width`, setting them to numbers we pulled out of the air.\n3. Calls `plt.subplots()` using the variables from step 2, which creates a grid with the given characteristics.\n4. Draws the sketches from step 1 in the grid from step 3.\n\nTry running the cell a few times to see it in action.","af9893ff":"You may have noticed a few problems (with accompanying warning messages printed out):\n\n- We wanted each image to be drawn in a square (with width and height of 2 inches), but they're being drawn inside fat rectangles.\n- Our grid can only fit at most 15 images. If we sample more than that, only the first 15 are shown.\n- If we sample a small number of images, we waste a lot of space.\n\nAll these problems stem from our shoddy approach to step 2 in the code. Instead of using the same grid dimensions every time, they should adapt to the number of images we're showing. For example, if `n = 3`,  we should make a 6\" x 2\" grid with 1 row and 3 columns. If `n = 15`, we should make a 16\" x 4\" grid with 2 rows and 8 columns. (We'll have one empty space in the grid, but that's okay, as long as we don't have whole rows or columns that are empty.)\n\nUpdate the code above to fix the values of `rows`, `cols`, `width`, and `height`, so that our grid adapts to the number of images shown and makes efficient use of space. Run your code a few times to make sure it doesn't generate any warnings.\n\n<small>**Note**: I'm intentionally glossing over the details of steps 1, 3, and 4 of the code. If you're curious about how the functions we imported such as `sample_images_of_category`, or `draw_images_on_subplots` work, you can check out their definitions [here](https:\/\/github.com\/Kaggle\/learntools\/blob\/master\/learntools\/python\/quickdraw.py). The code uses lots of syntax and data structures that we'll cover later, so if it looks like gibberish to you at this point, don't worry. We will *not* be going into the specifics of data visualization using matplotlib or any other library in this course. But fortunately, we have a [track on Kaggle Learn](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/data-visualisation) on just that topic.<\/small>","4f1dfa0e":"Didn't get the right answer?
