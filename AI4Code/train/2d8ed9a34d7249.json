Since I like to min-max the way I play my games, I wanted to know if there were any craftables that sell for more than their parts.\n\n## 1. Inspecting the Data\nWe're going to import the \"recipes\" table, and slice it so that we have the recipe name, the materials list, and the sell price of the item.","2e6e000a":"It looks like the tire toy might be an item we would want to craft to sell. The barrel, not so much.\n\n## 4. Putting this into our table\nNow we'll use list comprehension to iterate over a list of recipe names and calculate the craft-to-sell profit for each recipe.","088e9ae5":"While there's a strong skew towards cheaper items, we can tell that the sell prices for fish and insects is, on average, considerably higher than our \"profitable\" craftables.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\nThe normal ways of generating income (i.e. catching small creatures, harvesting fruit, playing the stalk market) are far more profitable than trying to use the DIY system to generate profit.","3d1885e2":"As you can see, this function will return a dictionary containing the materials and sell prices of our recipe items.\n\n## 3. Return difference between sell price and materials price\nNow we need to make a function that returns the difference between the recipe sell price with the sum of the sell prices of the materials. If the result is positive, then it is more profitable to sell the crafted recipe than to sell all the materials separately and vicaversa.","3842fc0a":"Now that we have this list, let's consider some limitations:\n* If the materials for a recipe were not in the \"other.csv\" file, the craft-to-sell profit will simply equal the sell price of the recipe.\n* Even if we included all item data here, the function does not do a good job of accounting for items crafted from items (such as wooden-block furniture). It can only show if it is more or less profitable to sell a given recipe after crafting it or immediately before assuming all materials are present.\n\nWhile understanding that we likely have some skewed data, let's just check the profit distribution from our new item list.","16c6a318":"OK, so it looks like there's many items that sell for very little profit and many that sell for more (but probably should not be included in the data).\n\nLets compare this to insects and fish, which are far more common as sellable items.","6e5dec78":"Note that we do have the Buy column, but our calculations will basically ignore it for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n## 2. Writing the materials function\nNow let's write a function that returns the material list and sell price for a given recipe."}}
