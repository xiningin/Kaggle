If the InChI is standard, this is followed by the letter S for standard InChIs, which is a fully standardized InChI flavor maintaining the same level of attention to structure details and the same conventions for drawing perception. The remaining information is structured as a sequence of layers and sub-layers, with each layer providing one specific type of information. The layers and sub-layers are separated by the delimiter \"\/\" and start with a characteristic prefix letter (except for the chemical formula sub-layer of the main layer). The six layers with important sublayers are:\n\n## Main layer\nChemical formula (no prefix). This is the only sublayer that must occur in every InChI.\nAtom connections (prefix: \"c\"). The atoms in the chemical formula (except for hydrogens) are numbered in sequence; this sublayer describes which atoms are connected by bonds to which other ones.\nHydrogen atoms (prefix: \"h\"). Describes how many hydrogen atoms are connected to each of the other atoms.\n\n## Charge layer\ncharge sublayer (prefix: \"q\")\nproton sublayer (prefix: \"p\" for \"protons\")\n\n## Stereochemical layer\ndouble bonds and cumulenes (prefix: \"b\")\ntetrahedral stereochemistry of atoms and allenes (prefixes: \"t\", \"m\")\ntype of stereochemistry information (prefix: \"s\")\n\n## Isotopic layer \n(prefixes: \"i\", \"h\", as well as \"b\", \"t\", \"m\", \"s\" for isotopic stereochemistry)\n\n## Fixed-H layer\n(prefix: \"f\"); contains some or all of the above types of layers except atom connections; may end with \"o\" sublayer; never included in standard InChI\n\n## Reconnected layer \n(prefix: \"r\"); contains the whole InChI of a structure with reconnected metal atoms; never included in standard InChI","899a3c0e":"# Import Packages","e3a15b46":"# InChI\n\nThe IUPAC International Chemical Identifier is a textual identifier for chemical substances, designed to provide a standard way to encode molecular information and to facilitate the search for such information in databases and on the web.","d282bd9f":"# Training Data\n\ntrain_labels - This gives the ground truth InChi labels for the training images"}}
