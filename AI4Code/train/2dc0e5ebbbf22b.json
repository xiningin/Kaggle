Since we have the vote counts for both males and females, across various age groups, let's now see how the popularity of genres vary between the two genders in the dataframe. \n\n1. Make the first heatmap to see how the average number of votes of males is varying across the genres. Use seaborn heatmap for this analysis. The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for males, i.e., `CVotesU18M`,`CVotes1829M`, `CVotes3044M`, and `CVotes45AM`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-male group. \n\n2. Make the second heatmap to see how the average number of votes of females is varying across the genres. Use seaborn heatmap for this analysis. The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for females, i.e., `CVotesU18F`,`CVotes1829F`, `CVotes3044F`, and `CVotes45AF`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-female group. \n\n3. Make sure that you plot these heatmaps side by side using `subplots` so that you can easily compare the two genders and derive insights.\n\n4. Write your any three inferences from this plot. You can make use of the previous bar plot also here for better insights.\nRefer to this link- https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.heatmap.html.

Let's add a small condition to it and make sure that all three actors are popular. The condition is **none of the three actors' Facebook likes should be less than half of the other two**. For example, the following is a valid combo:\n- actor_1_facebook_likes: 70000\n- actor_2_facebook_likes: 40000\n- actor_3_facebook_likes: 50000\n\nBut the below one is not:\n- actor_1_facebook_likes: 70000\n- actor_2_facebook_likes: 40000\n- actor_3_facebook_likes: 30000\n\nsince in this case, `actor_3_facebook_likes` is 30000, which is less than half of `actor_1_facebook_likes`.\n\nHaving this condition ensures that you aren't getting any unpopular actor in your trio (since the total likes calculated in the previous question doesn't tell anything about the individual popularities of each actor in the trio.).\n\nYou can do a manual inspection of the top 5 popular trios you have found in the previous subtask and check how many of those trios satisfy this condition.

I remember watching my first movie with my family when I was 5 and 3 years later, I still love movies. But have you ever wondered how some people rate movies as good or bad, awesome or mehh! That's correct. Different people have different perspectives on how they like or dislike movies. To help us select from a plethora of movie option out there, IMDB platform provides us honest reviews by the people for the people.\nLong story short, this assignment will take you through different aspects of how a movie is reviewed by different people from across the globe based on their star cast, genre, story length and many more aspects. \nSo here is what you need to do! Few points:\n    1. Download the dataset & the dictionary that will help you learn the different columns in the dataset\n    2. Start exploring the data by performing EDA (wiki what\u2019s EDA, if you are a dummy like I was initially)\n    3.

Let's see how these top 1000 voters have voted across the genres. \n\n1. Sort the dataframe genre_top10 based on the value of `CVotes1000`in a descending order.\n\n2. Make a seaborn barplot for `genre` vs `CVotes1000`.\n\n3. Write your inferences.

Let's analyse how both the US and the non-US voters have responded to the US and the non-US movies.\n\n1. Create a column `IFUS` in the dataframe `movies`. The column `IFUS` should contain the value \"USA\" if the `Country` of the movie is \"USA\". For all other countries other than the USA, `IFUS` should contain the value `non-USA`.\n\n\n2. Now make a boxplot that shows how the number of votes from the US people i.e. `CVotesUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Make use of the column `IFUS` to make this plot. Similarly, make another subplot that shows how non US voters have voted for the US and non-US movies by plotting `CVotesnUS` for both the US and non-US movies. Write any of your two inferences\/observations from these plots.\n\n\n3. Again do a similar analysis but with the ratings.

This is a very popular website where an average score is determined through the scores given by the top-rated critics. Second, you also have another column `IMDb_rating` which tells you the IMDb rating of a movie. This rating is determined by taking the average of hundred-thousands of ratings from the general audience. \n\nAs a part of this subtask, you are required to find out the highest rated movies which have been liked by critics and audiences alike.\n1. Firstly you will notice that the `MetaCritic` score is on a scale of `100` whereas the `IMDb_rating` is on a scale of 10. First convert the `MetaCritic` column to a scale of 10.\n2. Now, to find out the movies which have been liked by both critics and audiences alike and also have a high rating overall, you need to -\n    - Create a new column `Avg_rating` which will have the average of the `MetaCritic` and `Rating` columns\n    - Retain only the movies in which the absolute difference(using abs() function) between the `IMDb_rating` and `Metacritic` columns is less than 0.5. Refer to this link to know how abs() funtion works - https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/abs-in-python\/ .\n    - Sort these values in a descending order of `Avg_rating` and retain only the movies with a rating equal to higher than `8` and store these movies in a new dataframe `UniversalAcclaim`.\n    ","f6ef958f":"**`Checkpoint 1:`** Can you spot the movie `Tangled` in the dataset? You may be aware of the movie 'Tangled'. Although its one of the highest grossing movies of all time, it has negative profit as per this result. If you cross check the gross values of this movie (link: https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0398286\/), you can see that the gross in the dataset accounts only for the domestic gross and not the worldwide gross. This is true for may other movies also in the list.","1d6c3ec2":"**<u>Observations<\/u> :**\n1. Only the genre, Drama, has the highest value of count ~65\n2.

However scatter plot tells a different story. You can notice that there are some movies with negative profit. Although good movies do incur losses, but there appear to be quite a few movie with losses. What can be the reason behind this? Lets have a closer look at this by finding the movies with negative profit.","f0b9fa5c":"-  ###  Subtask 3.1 Combine the Dataframe by Genres\n\nThere are 3 columns in the dataframe - `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3`. As a part of this subtask, you need to aggregate a few values over these 3 columns. \n1. First create a new dataframe `df_by_genre` that contains `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` and all the columns related to **CVotes\/Votes** from the `movies` data frame. There are 47 columns to be extracted in total.\n2. Now, Add a column called `cnt` to the dataframe `df_by_genre` and initialize it to one. You will realise the use of this column by the end of this subtask.\n3. First group the dataframe `df_by_genre` by `genre_1` and find the sum of all the numeric columns such as `cnt`, columns related to CVotes and Votes columns and store it in a dataframe `df_by_g1`.\n4. Perform the same operation for `genre_2` and `genre_3` and store it dataframes `df_by_g2` and `df_by_g3` respectively. \n5. Now that you have 3 dataframes performed by grouping over `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` separately, it's time to combine them. For this, add the three dataframes and store it in a new dataframe `df_add`, so that the corresponding values of Votes\/CVotes get added for each genre.There is a function called `add()` in pandas which lets you do this. You can refer to this link to see how this function works. https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/version\/0.23.4\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.add.html\n6. The column `cnt` on aggregation has basically kept the track of the number of occurences of each genre.Subset the genres that have atleast 10 movies into a new dataframe `genre_top10` based on the `cnt` column value.\n7. Now, take the mean of all the numeric columns by dividing them with the column value `cnt` and store it back to the same dataframe. We will be using this dataframe for further analysis in this task unless it is explicitly mentioned to use the dataframe `movies`.\n8. Since the number of votes can't be a fraction, type cast all the CVotes related columns to integers. Also, round off all the Votes related columns upto two digits after the decimal point.\n","37efcd0f":"-  ###  Subtask 2.2: Let's Talk Profit!\n\n    1. Create a new column called `profit` which contains the difference of the two columns: `gross` and `budget`.\n    2. Sort the dataframe using the `profit` column as reference.\n    3. Extract the top ten profiting movies in descending order and store them in a new dataframe - `top10`.\n    4.

There will primarily be three lead roles in your movie and you wish to cast the most popular actors for it. Now, since you don't want to take a risk, you will cast a trio which has already acted in together in a movie before. The metric that you've chosen to check the popularity is the Facebook likes of each of these actors.\n\nThe dataframe has three columns to help you out for the same, viz. `actor_1_facebook_likes`, `actor_2_facebook_likes`, and `actor_3_facebook_likes`. Your objective is to find the trios which has the most number of Facebook likes combined. That is, the sum of `actor_1_facebook_likes`, `actor_2_facebook_likes` and `actor_3_facebook_likes` should be maximum.\nFind out the top 5 popular trios, and output their names in a list.\n","5a4ee633":"**`Checkpoint 2:`** Can you spot a `Star Wars` movie in your final dataset?","f448ba0b":"**`Inferences:`** Write your two inferences\/observations below:\n- Inference 1: Top 50% of the US movies have received higer ratings of 8.0+ than top 25% of the non-USA by the people from USA\n- Inference 2: More than 50% of the US movies recieve higher ratings as compared to non-USA movies from the non-USA residents"}}
