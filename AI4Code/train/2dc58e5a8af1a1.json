Introduction\nFor a long time the technology industry has fallen behind other sectors in attracting and employing more diverse people ([link](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/when-it-comes-to-diversity-techs-idealism-keeps-falling-short\/)). In 2018 a forbes arcile quotes: [\"Currently, men hold 76% of technical jobs, and 95% of the tech workforce is white.\"](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lisawinning\/2018\/03\/13\/its-time-to-prioritize-diversity-across-tech\/#3722945516f8). There have been lots of hopes and expectations that diveristy will increase across all work places, and as a Software Developer myself, I would love this to hold true. \n\nObviously, the Kaggle ML and DS Survey results may not be the data to conduct full and in depth investigation on. However that does not mean there is nothing to learn from the data alongside other sources.\n\nIn this notebook, using the 2019 DS and ML Kaggle Survey and other sources, I will investigate:\n - **Is diverisity increasing or decreasing across the Kaggle community?**\n - **Does this change in diversity correlate with changes in technology trends?** (e.g. popular programming languages, changes in job roles)","79de5177":"Unfortunately, it appears the ratio of women in Kaggle surveys have remained almost constant over the last three years. This is not what I was expecting or hoping to see in the data but it is what it is. Are there any possible reasons for this? Can we find anything else out by looking more at the data?","ae50af4e":"Finally looking at the age and gender distribution side by side, we see the majority of the community are young (below 35) and this is true for all genders. To investigate this more fully let's plot the ratio of men to women in each age bracket.","e6ff25c7":"We see clearly approximately 82% of respondants were male this year, 16% female, 2% prefer not to say and <1% prefer to self describe.\n\nNext we will look at the country the participants currently reside in:","bc2391ca":"## 2. A first look at the Kaggle data\nFirst let's import the libraries we will use to analyse and visualise the survey data and read adnd store the data itself.","85e90e04":"Let us check what questions were asked during the survey and therefore which question we can use to access the diveristy of the Kaggle community.","4b4a014c":"> **\"To restore America's competitiveness, we must recruit a new generation of science and technology leaders by investing in diversity.\"** - Barack Obama","6ade3c14":"What I love most about working in Technolgy is how fast everything changes!
