Importing Necessary Libraries\n\nTo start, let's print out the version numbers of all the libraries we will be using in this project. This serves two purposes - it ensures we have installed the libraries correctly and ensures that this tutorial will be reproducible. ","efd855bb":"## 3. Unsupervised Outlier Detection\n\nNow that we have processed our data, we can begin deploying our machine learning algorithms.  We will use the following techniques: \n\n**Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**\n\nThe anomaly score of each sample is called Local Outlier Factor. It measures the local deviation of density of a \ngiven sample with respect to its neighbors. It is local in that the anomaly score depends on how isolated the \nobject is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood.\n\n\n**Isolation Forest Algorithm**\n\nThe IsolationForest \u2018isolates\u2019 observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting \na split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.\n\nSince recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the number of splittings required to \nisolate a sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminating node.\n\nThis path length, averaged over a forest of such random trees, is a measure of normality and our decision function.\n\nRandom partitioning produces noticeably shorter paths for anomalies. Hence, when a forest of random trees \ncollectively produce shorter path lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.","3a1f9b5f":"### It can be clearly seen that the result shows very less Recall value.","723dcae8":"### 2. The Data Set\n\nIn the following cells, we will import our dataset from a .csv file as a Pandas DataFrame.  Furthermore, we will begin exploring the dataset to gain an understanding of the type, quantity, and distribution of data in our dataset.  For this purpose, we will use Pandas' built-in describe feature, as well as parameter histograms and a correlation matrix. "}}
