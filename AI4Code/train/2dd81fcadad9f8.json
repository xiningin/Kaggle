It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.\nYou can find it on Kaggle at the following link: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/uciml\/sms-spam-collection-dataset\n\n**Content**\n\nThe files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.\n\nThis corpus has been collected from free or free for research sources at the Internet:\n\n- A collection of 425 SMS spam messages was manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site. \nThis is a UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages, most of them without reporting the very spam message received. The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully scanning hundreds of web pages. The Grumbletext Web site is http:\/\/www.grumbletext.co.uk\/ . \n\n- A subset of 3,375 SMS randomly chosen ham messages of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), which is a dataset of about 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. \n\n- A list of 450 SMS ham messages collected from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis available at http:\/\/etheses.bham.ac.uk\/253\/1\/Tagg09PhD.pdf . \n\n- Finally, we have incorporated the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big. It has 1,002 SMS ham messages and 322 spam messages and it is public available at http:\/\/www.esp.uem.es\/jmgomez\/smsspamcorpus\/ . \n\nThis corpus has been used in the following academic researches:\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe original dataset can be found here. The creators would like to note that in case you find the dataset useful, please make a reference to previous paper and the web page: http:\/\/www.dt.fee.unicamp.br\/~tiago\/smsspamcollection\/ in your papers, research, etc.\n\nWe offer a comprehensive study of this corpus in the following paper.

Python provides an efficient way of handling sparse vectors in the scipy.sparse package.\n\nThe vectors returned from a call to transform() will be sparse vectors, and you can transform them back to numpy arrays to look and better understand what is going on by calling the toarray() function.\n\nSource: https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/prepare-text-data-machine-learning-scikit-learn\/ "}}
