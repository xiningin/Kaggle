Let's first emphasise on what we expect from our predictions:\n\n**1.** Given a number of water bodies, we don't want a large number of impotable bodies to be classified as potable, as it could lead to a widespread of diseases. In other words, we don't want a large number of False Positives. \n\n**2.** At the same time, we'd want to classify a fair number of potable water bodies as potable, because that is what we're mostly concerned about. \n\n**3.** But the given dataset is skewed towards 0 class, i.e. impotable water bodies have majority over potable. This could result in a model that classifies most of the water bodies as impotable. Such a model will, in fact, yield a high accuracy on test sets, but would have very little advantage in real-world applications.\n\n**Conclusion:** We are looking for a model having a high TP\/FP ratio, in other words, high precision. This is because, practically speaking, the penalty for classifying an impotaple sample as potable should be high, and precision serves the purpose for such situations. However, with a dataset skewed in favor of negative class, high precision could result in low accuracy, or also a large FP.\nKeeping all this in mind, Matthews Correlation Coefficient seems suitable.","1217e606":"There are a total of *3276* training examples, having 9 features and 1 target, i.e. *Potability*.","4d167e94":"Missing values in *ph*, *Sulfate*, and *Trihalomethanes*.

According to WHO, hardness should not exceed 120 to 170 mg\/L.\n\n* **Solids** - Given by Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), or the amount of solids dissolved in water. TDS value of 50 to 250 ppm is deemed safe.\n\n* **Chloramines** - Formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinkning water. Chlorine levels up to 4 mg\/L (or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water.\n\n* **Sulfates** - These are a part of naturally occuring minerals and are dissolved into groundwater. Sulfate levels above 250 mg\/L in water are considered unsafe.\n\n* **Conductivity** - It is the measure of tendancy of water to conduct electricity. According to WHO, Electrical Conductivity (EC) should not exceed 400 \u03bcS\/cm.\n\n* **Organic_carbon** - It is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) below 25 ppm is considered safe.\n\n* **Trihalomethanes** - These may be found in water treated with chlorine. THM values upto 100 \u03bcg\/L are considered fit for drinking water.\n\n* **Turbidity** - It is a measure of light emitting properties of water. According to WHO, turbidity of drinking water shouldn't be more than 5 NTU, and should ideally be below 1 NTU.\n\n* **Potability** - Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.","7ea4e5b7":"The data seems to be grouped by *Potability*, as we only see 0 values in head.\nTherefore, it is best to shuffle this dataset before proceeding.","a56bb1ce":"> ","f53987a5":"There seems to be a slight imbalance in target value.

Hopefully, by the end of this, we will have a model that works decently on this dataset.","3d0fb48d":"# Conclusion\n\nAlthough the stats are not very impressive (from a general perspective), but they came out to be better than expected for this particular dataset. \n\nFinal Model: **Random Forest Classifier, XGB Classifier, or K Neighbors Classifier**\n\nExpected test set MCC: **~0.20-0.25**\n\nExpected test set Accuracy: **~65-70%**","e309cd76":"All features seem to be distributed as a normal distribution. Funny how the features are all balanced, while the dataset is not.","7af938e3":"# **LIBRARIES**","c3a76ede":"> the centering and scaling statistics of RobustScaler is based on percentiles and are therefore not influenced by a few number of very large marginal outliers.","c9147f61":"# Missing Values\n\nThe problem starts by identifying the type and count of missing values. Then we will adopt a suitable algorithm to fill the blanks.","c1e5c439":"# Data Analysis","660b4ef3":"**1.** Except for Logistic regression, the MCC score for the others turned out to be okayish. \n\n**2.** Even though Decision Tree has a good F1 score comparatively, but it didn't account for the large number of False Positives.\n\n**3.** Ada Boost gave better than random results, but just not good enough.\n\nBased on these results, XG Boost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors Classifier have performed slightly better than the rest of the models. Both these models gave similar results, so both are suitable to pass as our final model.","eb635cfc":"Medians for Potability = 0 box and Potability = 1 box seem to overlap in all 3 cases, meaning there isn't any significant relation between Potability and the features in debate. This is congruent to our earlier correlation matrix analysis. \n\nImputing the missing values with mean seems okay, as it won't disturb this dataset."}}
