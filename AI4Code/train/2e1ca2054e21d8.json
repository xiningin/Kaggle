likely to leave the company. Hence, efforts should be made to gather information on industry benchmarks in the current local market to determine if the company is providing competitive wages.\n    - **Over Time**: people who work overtime are more likelty to leave the company. Hence efforts  must be taken to appropriately scope projects upfront with adequate support and manpower so as to reduce the use of overtime.\n    - **YearsWithCurrManager**: A large number of leavers leave 6 months after their Current Managers. By using Line Manager details for each employee, one can determine which Manager have experienced the largest numbers of employees resigning over the past year. Several metrics can be used here to determine whether action should be taken with a Line Manager: \n        - number of employees under managers showing high turnover rates: this would indicate that the organisation's structure may need to be revisit to improve efficiency\n        - number of years the Line Manager has been in a particular position: this may indicate that the employees may need management training or be assigned a mentor (ideally an Executive) in the organisation\n        - patterns in the employees who have resigned: this may indicate recurring patterns in employees leaving in which case action may be taken accordingly.\n    - **Age**: Employees in relatively young age bracket 25-35 are more likely to leave. Hence, efforts should be made to clearly articulate the long-term vision of the company and young employees fit in that vision, as well as provide incentives in the form of clear paths to promotion for instance.\n    - **DistanceFromHome**: Employees who live further from home are more likely to leave the company. Hence, efforts should be made to provide support in the form of company transportation for clusters of employees leaving the same area, or in the form of Transportation Allowance. Initial screening of employees based on their home location is probably not recommended as it would be regarded as a form of discrimination as long as employees make it to work on time every day.\n    - **TotalWorkingYears**: The more experienced employees are less likely to leave. Employees who have between 5-8 years of experience should be identified as potentially having a higher-risk of leaving.\n    - **YearsAtCompany**: Loyal companies are less likely to leave. Employees who hit their two-year anniversary should be identified as potentially having a higher-risk of leaving.","ff1efa68":"# Employee Churn Model with a Strategic Retention Plan: a HR Analytics Case Study","06d9d4ec":"> As shown above, the results from GridSearchCV provided us with fine-tuned hyper-parameter using ROC_AUC as the scoring metric.","937ed6ba":"> Instead of getting binary estimated target features (0 or 1), a probability can be associated with the predicted target. <br> The output provides a first index referring to the probability that the data belong to **class 0** (employee not leaving), and the second refers to the probability that the data belong to **class 1** (employee leaving).\n\n> The resulting AUC score is higher than that best score during the optimisation step.

In other words, the cost of replacing employees for most employers remains significant. This is due to the amount of time spent to interview and find a replacement, sign-on bonuses, and the loss of productivity for several months while the new employee gets accustomed to the new role. <br>","149249d7":"> Let's take a closer look at using the Random Forest algorithm.
