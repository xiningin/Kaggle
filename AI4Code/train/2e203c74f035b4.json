We need to see the reason behind such low participation and how we can encourage women to become more participative. Networking can be a great way for women to connect with other fellow women and help and encourage others. A lot of support groups are present which help to create a friendly and supportive environment for Women in Data Science where they can share knowledge, develop skills and also help others in finding jobs and advance their careers. Some of these groups are:\n>\n    * [Women Who Code](https:\/\/www.womenwhocode.com\/)\n    * [Women in Machine Learning & Data Science](http:\/\/wimlds.org\/)\n    * [Women in Tech Summit](https:\/\/womenintechsummit.net\/)\n    * [Black Women in Computing](http:\/\/blackwomenincomputing.org\/)\n    * [Rladies Global](https:\/\/rladies.org\/)\n    * [PyLadies](https:\/\/www.pyladies.com\/)\n    * [EdTechWomen](http:\/\/edtechwomen.com\/chapters-and-events)\n    * [Widening Natural Language Processing](http:\/\/www.winlp.org\/mission\/)\n    * [Women in Big Data](https:\/\/www.womeninbigdata.org\/)\n    \n\n* The response from the U.S and Indian women is really heartening, although it is still very low as compared to their male counterparts. Africa shows a glimmer of hope with countries like Nigeria and Algeria gearing up. Organizations should team up with the African government and NGOs to provide better opportunities for study and research to these women.\n* The young female populations in Data Science are on the rise with the majority coming from India. This is not surprising as India has one of the highest young brigades in the world. This demographic dividend should be tapped efficiently by reforming the existing Indian education model and introducing high-quality Data science courses in their existing curriculum.\n* The females in the  Science space are highly qualified with the majority having a Master's degree.\u00a0\n* Most of the female Data Scientists are located in the U.S and India. Some women who are not employed have also responded to the survey. There could be multiple reasons for that. They could be students or women who wish to restart their careers after a break. The latter could be provided with assistance by getting them to attend meetups or community events. For the students, a mentorship is a good option.\n* The salary distribution has remained constant over the years but Indian female Data Scientists are paid comparatively less as compared to their counterparts in the U.S.\n\n\n\n# <a>Conclusion<\/a>\n\nSo let's get back to the initial question\u200a-\u200aAre the Geek Girls Rising? It's a mixed feeling. Some areas have shown improvement while a lot of work is required in others. Overall, things appear to be promising and if we could work towards it, future will be better than it is today.\nData science in itself is a combination of diverse scientific disciplines. It makes all the more sense to bring in people from different genders, backgrounds, and ethnicity. This way we can bring in more creativity and allow knowledge, discoveries, and innovation to flourish.\u00a0\nIt will require a collaborative effort from society to make diversity and inclusion a vital part of the ecosystem. As women, we should also make sure that we create a strong support group among ourselves to assist our fellow females in the Data Science and STEM space.

The idea behind these efforts is that attracting and retaining more women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will ultimately enhance innovation and creativity. When women are not involved in these fields, experiences, needs, and desires that are unique to women may be overlooked.\n\nIt is not that there aren't any female role models out there to inspire us.\nDo you remember the iconic photograph of** Katie Bouman in 2019**, watching the black hole's first photograph as it was being reconstructed?

Be it **Margaret Hamilton** or **Grace Hopper** in the past or** Corinna Cortes** and **Fei Fei Li** today; women have made their presence felt with their work. More and more girls are being motivated to take up science and research in school and colleges. A lot of companies today are coming forward to change the world of work. This year, even the United Nations celebrated International Women's Day under the official theme **#BalanceforBetter**, advocating a more gender-balanced world.\n\nHowever, as it may seem, not everything is still so \"gung-ho\" when it comes to women's representation is the Data Science field. The ratios are still skewed, and women still occupy far fewer leadership roles than men. But let's not just assume things but rather use data to verify our assumptions, and the 2019 Kaggle ML & DS survey is an excellent place to start. Let the numbers speak for themselves.\n\n## Objective\nThe objective of this notebook to analyze the survey data to answer an important question: is the women participation in STEM really improving, or is it just a hype?

Let's see which countries made the cut.","e0e47d71":"> **\ud83d\udccc Points to note\u00a0:**\n* Again, leaving out the students, U.S has the maximum number of Data Scientists who took part in the survey, followed by India.\n* The U.S also has the maximum number of Data Analysts participating in the survey, again followed by India.\n* India has the number of Software Engineers participating in the survey.\n* The percentage of unemployed females respondents(~<2%) is also high in India.\n\n## <a>5.4 Percentage of Female Data Scientists over the years <a\/>","78471e64":"> ** \ud83d\udccc Points to note\u00a0:**\n* The number of African females who responded to the survey in 2019 has increased as compared to the previous years. Around 150 females responded to the survey in 2019 whereas, for the previous years, the numbers were even less than 100. However, there is a lot of progress to be still made.\n\n## <a>2.5 Algerian females make an appearance<a\/>\nIt will be also interesting to find out the reason for the increased participation from the African subcontinent.Let's dig in further for more details.","18dc143a":"> **\ud83d\udccc Points to note\u00a0:**\n* The education status of the females is impressive with the majority (~46%)having a Master's degree followed closely by a Bachelor's degree(27%). There are also 16% PhDs who answered the survey.\u00a0\n* The analysis also reveals that there is a certain proportion who have had no formal education past high school. In spite of this, they took the survey which in itself is a commendable thing. They should be encouraged to complete their education either full time or through part-time courses.\n\n## <a>4.2 Educational qualifications of the female respondents, country\u00a0wise<a\/>","446aa766":"> **\ud83d\udccc Points to note\u00a0:**\n* Again, the general pattern remains the same. The percentage of women Data Scientists earning less than 1000 USD is considerably higher as compared to their male counterparts.\n* Female data scientists also seem to pay less in the high salary range. The percentage of women Data Scientists earning more than 200k USD is almost minimal.\n\n","56932017":"# <a>3.

However, It should be kept in mind that a lot of women in India and other countries, generally move to the U.S for their Masters and PhDs.\n* India also tops the list with the maximum number of Bachelor degrees. This is pretty obvious since the majority of women respondents are students in their 20s.\n* There is a general predominance of Master's over other degrees, among all the countries except for Japan which has a higher incidence of a Professional degree.","666274bf":"> ** \ud83d\udccc Points to note :** \n> * The majority of the respondents(both male and female) are from India followed closely by the U.S. In fact, these countries together make up more than 50% of the entire population.\n> * If a country or territory received less than 50 respondents,[they have been grouped into a group named \"Other\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/kaggle-survey-2019\/data) for anonymity.\n\n\n## <a id=\"1\">Comparison of number of respondents w.r.t the previous surveys<\/a>"}}
