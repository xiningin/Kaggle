Through out this project I attempted to visualize the data presented and make analyzations off of it. I came to the conclusion that your class and gender were the most deciding factors on wether you survived or not. If you found any of the information helpful please be sure to give it an upvote! If there are any improvements that you believe should be made dont hesitate to drop a comment.","fc47ab3b":"# Titanic\n\n## Summary\nThis report represents my analysis for the titanic dataset. The main objective was to determine if there were any factors that would've increased a passengers chance of survival. During this analysis we looked at gender, and class status with hopes of discovering their correlation with survival. It is my opinion based on the data provided, both of those factors influenced wether or not you survived.\n\nThis notebook is a very general overview of the titanic dataset. It was used to practice data analysis on a historical dataset.\nThroughtout this notebook you will see visualizations including the gender, class and survival distributions. The goal was to present the available data in an easy to understand format. Someone who has no knowledge of data analysis should be able to get the gist of what happened on this tragic ship.\n\nI hope you find this notebook informal and enjoyable.\n\n\n\n","3172663f":"## Women","79e754de":"## Overview\n* Cleaning data\n* Gender distribution\n* Age distribution\n* Location distribution\n* Class distribution\n\n## Info\n\n* Total passsengers in dataset: 891\n* Total males in dataset: 577\n* total females in dataset: 314\n* Total survivors in dataset: 342\n* Female survivors in dataset: 233\n* Male survivors in dataset: 109\n\n\n"}}
