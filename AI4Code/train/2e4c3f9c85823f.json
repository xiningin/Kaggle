For example, the following list represents a party with 7 guests, in which Adela showed up first and Ford was the last to arrive:\n\n    party_attendees = ['Adela', 'Fleda', 'Owen', 'May', 'Mona', 'Gilbert', 'Ford']\n\nA guest is considered 'fashionably late' if they arrived after at least half of the party's guests. However, they must not be the very last guest (that's taking it too far). In the above example, Mona and Gilbert are the only guests who were fashionably late.\n\nComplete the function below which takes a list of party attendees as well as a person, and tells us whether that person is fashionably late.","eb2d3b22":"## 2.\n\nYou are analyzing sports teams.  Members of each team are stored in a list.

Complete the function below to select the **captain** of the worst team."}}
