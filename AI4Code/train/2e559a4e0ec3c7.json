The most important features appear to be gill-color, spore-print-color, population, gill-size, and odor. Bruises and habit are of almost equal importance, and it goes down from there. \n\nWe are going to try to create a more robust tree by trimming away the less importance features. \n\nNote how the decision tree has been very helpful in discovering the features that we can pretty safely cut out of our model, without the accuracy suffering. We wouldn't have known this before making the decision tree, except perhaps with some expert knowledge of mushrooms. ","6dff736c":"So if our model scored perfectly on precision, recall, accuracy... doesn't that mean our work is done? Well, no. Not really. A perfect score is a sign of overfitting. The decision tree has classified everything a little too specifically by memorizing the training data, and is probably over optimizing at each split in the tree.

","a570e327":"## What are we predicting? \n\nWe are predicting the class of the mushroom (found in `mushrooms['class']`). Specifically, we want to know whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous (e or p), based on it's features. Things like it's odor, habitat, capt shape, color, etc.  ","efe19890":"Note that in the following section I will be comparing some different examples of the Decision Tree trained on our mushrooms dataset. While I will include scoring for the sake of comparison, I am not really trying to optimize the model.

This process is called **encoding**. \n\nWe are going to use Pandas categorical method to do this. This will turn the letters in our categorical data into a different number for each unique letter.
