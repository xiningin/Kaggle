It featured 33 sports, with the indtroduction of skateboarding, sport climbing, surfing and karate. \n\nFor further information about the event, we refer the interested reader to the official [website](https:\/\/olympics.com\/en\/olympic-games\/tokyo-2020).\n","f5e5cd05":"We procced by examining the first entries of the DataFrame.","d3f9f4a2":"The high correlation of about *0.97* is also visible from the scatterplot.

Furthermore, We have showed that **USA**, **Japan** and **Australia** are the top three Countries in terms of participants.\n\n\n- Gender: There is a very high correlation (0.98) between **Male** and **Female** participation for the same discipline. We have noticed that the discipline **Athletics** features the highest number of male and female athletes as it wraps up different subcategories. **Artistic Swimming** and **Rhythmic Gymnastics** is a discipline reserved for Women. Finally, we evidenced that **Handball** and **Rugby Sevens** was practiced more by the Female gender. On the contrary, **Boxing** and **Wrestling** are sports more aligned with the opposite gender.\n\n- Coaches: Most Coaches come from **Japan**, **Spain** and **USA**. We have presumed that the high number of Spanish coaches have trained athletes in many Spanish-speaking Countries.\n\n- Teams:  **Japan**, **USA** and **Italy** lead the ranking. Considering the number of inhabitants in each State, **Italy** is the Country with the highest ratio teams per athletes.\n\n- Medals: **USA**, **China** and **Russia** gained more medals. **Japan** stands out in terms of ratio between gold medals per total medals. It is also remarkable that **Great Britain** gained more than *60* medals with a population consisting of only *67* milion inhabitants. \n\n\nLastly, we have joined the different DataFrames to compare number of athletes, coaches, teams, and medals.
