In actually scenario, it's just a notion to understand, and most floundering question during an interview.","038edc4f":"### Significance of CLT\n\nThe CLT has siginificance for both statistical as well as practical applications.\n\n#### Statistical Significance\n\n* Analyzing data involves statistical methods like hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals. These methods assume that the population is normally distributed. In the case of unknown or non-normal distributions, we treat the sampling distribution as normal according to the central limit theorem\n* If we increase the samples drawn from the population, the standard deviation of sample means will decrease. This helps us estimate the population mean much more accurately\n* Also, the sample mean can be used to create the range of values known as a confidence interval (that is likely to consist of the population mean)\n\n#### Practical Application\nAs an example:\n* Political\/election polls are prime CLT applications. These polls estimate the percentage of people who support a particular candidate. You might have seen these results on news channels that come with confidence intervals. The central limit theorem helps calculate that\n* Confidence interval, an application of CLT, is used to calculate the mean family income for a particular region","85e2a651":"We can also see from the above plot that the population is not normal, right? Therefore, we need to draw sufficient samples of different sizes and compute their means (known as sample means). We will then plot those sample means to get a normal distribution.\n\nIn our example,will draw 30 sample size (10% of total population), calculate thier mean, and plot them in python.","ca5b51a9":"#### Formally defining CLT\n\n> Given a dataset with unknown distribution (it could be uniform, binomial or completely random), the sample means will approximate the normal distribution.\n\nThese samples should be large in size, applicable for random sampling, according to random probability for sampling. The distribution of sample means, calculated from repeated sampling, will tend to normality as the size of your samples gets larger.","3ab4d969":"As, we could see all the columns have equal numbers of row data, hence, there is no missing data.\n\nFor illustration of Central Limit Theorem for sampling we will take \"chol\" cholestrol column.\n\nWe are assuming the column chol is normally distributed. Normally distributed means upon giving graphical representation produces a bell shaped distribution.","707ba2f6":"Interpretation:\n1. We can see the vertical red line, mean of data, almost at the centre of main distribution.\n2. Most of the distribution is in normal but not 100%.\n3. Here, the data point after the 500 on x-axis is an outlier, and the points around 400 maybe or maynot be an outlier since they are very close to out main distribution graph.","537c1a26":"### What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a statistical theory states that given a sufficiently large sample size from a population with a finite level of variance, the mean of all samples from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean of the population.\n\nOhh, wait!. Are you overwhelm with technical terms? let's take an example for a naive understanding.\n\nConsider that we have a section of football team of 30 members in tournament. Now, the question is what willbe the average weight of the team members? seems easy, ahh! right?.\n\nAn amature or normal **apporach** will be take weight of all members and take division of it by the total number of members in the team.\n\nWell, if I say calculate the average weight of all the team in the tournament or, if we increase the discourse, all the individuals from each country who qualified for national team, let's say **SET**.\nSince, expanision in number of person to measure weight is humongous our approach will be changing, measuring the weight of all the individuals will be a very tiresome and long process.","e93f423e":"### Assumptions Behind the Central Limit Theorem\n\nTo use the normal model, we must meet some assumptions and conditions. The Central Limit Theorem assumes the following:\n1. Randomization Condition: The data must be sampled randomly. Is one of the good sampling methodologies discussed in the chapter \u201cSampling and Data\u201d being used? \n2. Independence Assumption: The sample values must be independent of each other. This means that the occurrence of one event has no influence on the next event. Usually, if we know that people or items were selected randomly we can assume that the independence assumption is met. \n3. 10% Condition: When the sample is drawn without replacement (usually the case), the sample size, n, should be no more than 10% of the population.\n4. Sample Size Assumption: Now, how we will figure out how large this size should be? Well, it depends on the population. When the population is skewed or asymmetric, the sample size should be large. If the population is symmetric, then we can draw small samples as well\n\n> In general, a sample size of 30 is considered sufficient when the population is symmetric.","2d8014c3":"When n increases: \n 1. the distributions becomes more and more normal.\n 2. the spread of the distributions decreases.","f2dee138":"### Implementing the Central Limit Theorem in Python","5604b5b5":"We can still see some of the outliers are there, so we need to remove those and after handling outlier we can conclude on the following:\n> Here, we get a good bell-shaped curve and the sampling distribution approaches normal distribution as the sample sizes increase. Therefore, we can consider the sampling distributions as normal and can use these distributions for further analysis.","198d1fe9":"### End Notes\nCentral limit theorem is quite an important concept in statistics, and consequently in data science. It's something critical of  statistics knowledge before getting into data science or even sitting for a data science interview.","a980f9b0":"We will understand the concept of Central Limit Theorem and will see why it is important and when to use it.\n\nFirst, we will understand the CLT and its applicabilityies and followed by an implementation on Heart Disease UCI dataset.","e41a87d8":"## Table of Contents\n1.
