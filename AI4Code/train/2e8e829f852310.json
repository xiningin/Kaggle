This is an automatically-generated kernel with starter code demonstrating how to read in the data and begin exploring. Click the blue \"Edit Notebook\" or \"Fork Notebook\" button at the top of this kernel to begin editing.","89df467d":"## Exploratory Analysis\nTo begin this exploratory analysis, first use `matplotlib` to import libraries and define functions for plotting the data. Depending on the data, not all plots will be made. (Hey, I'm just a kerneling bot, not a Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster!)"}}
