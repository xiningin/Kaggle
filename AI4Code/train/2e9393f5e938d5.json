Towards this goal, you'd like to create a plot that shows a rolling average of the daily number of taxi trips.  Amend the (partial) query below to return a DataFrame with two columns:\n- `trip_date` - contains one entry for each date from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017.\n- `avg_num_trips` - shows the average number of daily trips, calculated over a window including the value for the current date, along with the values for the preceding 15 days and the following 15 days, as long as the days fit within the two-year time frame.  For instance, when calculating the value in this column for January 5, 2016, the window will include the number of trips for the preceding 4 days, the current date, and the following 15 days.\n\nThis query is partially completed for you, and you need only write the part that calculates the `avg_num_trips` column.  Note that this query uses a common table expression (CTE); if you need to review how to use CTEs, you're encouraged to check out [this tutorial](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/as-with) in the [Intro to SQL](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-sql) micro-course.","1ba31eb2":"### 3) How much time elapses between trips?\n\nThe (partial) query in the code cell below shows, for each trip in the selected time frame, the corresponding `taxi_id`, `trip_start_timestamp`, and `trip_end_timestamp`. \n\nYour task in this exercise is to edit the query to include an additional `prev_break` column that shows the length of the break (in minutes) that the driver had before each trip started (this corresponds to the time between `trip_start_timestamp` of the current trip and `trip_end_timestamp` of the previous trip).  Partition the calculation by `taxi_id`, and order the results within each partition by `trip_start_timestamp`.\n\nSome sample results are shown below, where all rows correspond to the same driver (or `taxi_id`).  Take the time now to make sure that the values in the `prev_break` column make sense to you!\n\n![first_commands](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qjvQzg8.png)\n\nNote that the first trip of the day for each driver should have a value of **NaN** (not a number) in the `prev_break` column.","51db2de0":"**[Advanced SQL Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/advanced-sql)**\n\n---\n","d7572803":"The following code cell fetches the `taxi_trips` table from the `chicago_taxi_trips` dataset. We also preview the first five rows of the table.  You'll use the table to answer the questions below.","719da0b3":"# Introduction\n\nHere, you'll use window functions to answer questions about the [Chicago Taxi Trips](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/chicago\/chicago-taxi-trips-bq) dataset.\n\nBefore you get started, run the code cell below to set everything up.","06d94fc8":"### 2) Can you separate and order trips by community area?\n\nThe query below returns a DataFrame with three columns from the table: `pickup_community_area`, `trip_start_timestamp`, and `trip_end_timestamp`.  \n\nAmend the query to return an additional column called `trip_number` which shows the order in which the trips were taken from their respective community areas.  So, the first trip of the day originating from community area 1 should receive a value of 1; the second trip of the day from the same area should receive a value of 2.  Likewise, the first trip of the day from community area 2 should receive a value of 1, and so on.\n\nNote that there are many numbering functions that can be used to solve this problem (depending on how you want to deal with trips that started at the same time from the same community area); to answer this question, please use the **RANK()** function.","7bd42f36":"# Keep going\n\nMove on to learn how to query **[nested and repeated data](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/nested-and-repeated-data)**."}}
