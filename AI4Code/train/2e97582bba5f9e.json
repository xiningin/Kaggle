It comes from the database of our corporation. There are archiving anomalies. We are working on a new version of MeteoNet and will take into account these anomalies. Meanwhile, you can detect these anomalies by checking the file sizes. For a given file category (zone, level, model type), the files must have exactly the same size. So if some files are smaller than the other one, then these files have anomalies.
