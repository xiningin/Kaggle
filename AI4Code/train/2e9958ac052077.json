Good news for DS aspirants from MHD.**  \n\nIn HHD and LHD, data science workloads is yet to pickup at their organizations with compare to other two categories.  Because primarily 1 or 2 members working in DS space in their organization.\n\nMaturity level on DS and real time usage of DS by VHHD's Organization is overwhelming. Because 35% of them mentioned that their organizations are having having well established ML methods & use ML for generating insights.  It is obvious to expect because 25% of VHHD participants are Data Scientist.  \n\n**16% of orgs from MHDs are having well established ML methods, which is higher than the HHD country (14%).  This is also expected because in MHD 25% of respondents mentioned, 20+ Data Science work load is there in their org.**\n\n**It is provocative to see that close to 23.2%, 29.2%, 31.8% and 51.9% of participants from VHHD, MHD, HHD and LHD countries are not using ML models or they don't know about the same.  Even though their organizations are not using ML still these kaggle participants have upskilled themselves and actively participated in kaggle survey. Bravo!!!.**\n\n\n## Let us do the Compensation Analysis across HDI categories:\n\nLet us do compensation analysis across HDIs.  Also, let us check that in terms of Gender as well.","4e6d23f2":"54%, 43% of participants from MHD, LHD countries are between 18-24 Age Category. 31% and 17% from both HHD and VHHD. \n\n**Its astonishing to see that we have 54% and 43% of young kagglers participated from both MHD and LHD.  It could be that DS career started booming in these countries and attracting youngsters.  But in both HHD and VHHD young kagglers participation is comparatively low.  On the contrary in the VHHD and HHD countries Seniors (above 50 years) are active in DS activities.**\n\nAs these countries are developed and people from these countries could be already working in DS or similar types of job for quite some time.\n\nLet us check the young kagglers role across all HDIs.","9089a25f":"66+% of people from MHD and LHD are more active on data analysis using code in the recent past only.

Cheer up guys!!!!**\n\n**6.3% and 1.8% people from both VHHD, HHD are writting code to analyze data for 20+ years.  And 7% from VHHD are seniors (50+). Salute them!!!! This shows the maturity level in these developed countries in this field.  DS career is not started just now and its there for long time and could have been used in pockets.  Let them guide all youngsters to succeed in this field!!!! **\n\n8+% from MHD and LHD have never written code for data analysis. Lets look at their roles.  35% in both MHD and LHD are students.  That makes sense, hence so far they did not write code for data analysis.  Lets look at the tools used by these students.\n\n55% and 63% from MHD and LHD of are using Excel.  It makes sense.  **But 28% and 13% from MHD and LHD are using local environments.  This seems to be contradicting, when they have not written code then what they will do in local environment??? I don't know :-(.  Anyone knows please tell me.**\n\n\n## What language Kaggler's are using and recommending to aspiring DS","b21bd798":"**Top 3 ML Products:**\n- Azure_ML_Studio (5.4+%)\n- Google_ML_Engine (5.1+%)\n- GoogleSpeech-to-Text (3+%).\n\n**Google seems to be dominating in this segment.**\n\nBewildering to see that 31+% of people across all HDIs are not using any of these ML products.

Almost half (47%) of VHHD people are not using any big data or analytics products.\n\n7.1 to 9.8% people across HDIs are using 2 big data or analytics products on regular basis.\n\n\n**Based on all of the above analysis it is very much evident that still ML Products, ML Tools, RDB and Big Data \/ Analytics products have not got the popularity in the Data Science field.  This is very much evident in the VHHD category.**\n\nWith the current market **Google seems to be having big pie in this business segment.**\n\n# Does HDI affects taste or interest of the Human?\n\nOne interesting analysis has been done to check whether the taste or interest of people on Technology, Platform, Tools etc would differ based on their countries HDI factor?  What do you think?  \n\nWhen the deep dive analysis was done on this, taste or interest seems to be uniform among Female Participants across all categories and same hold true for Male also.  For instance, if we take ML Algorithm, Linear Logistic Regression and Decision Trees or RF seems to be popular among Female participants than Male participants from their respective categories.\n\n**Sounds interesting!!!!

Either these DS courses could be helping them to earn more salary or their Learning Appetite is high.\n- Female Vs Male participation ratio is higher than average in almost 14 countries from this category. This is interesting.\n\n**HHDs are Running:**\n- These adults are already running in this DS career space.\n- Female Vs Male participation ratio is higher than average in almost 6 countries.\n- Experienced programmers are part of this group who are writing code for 20+ years for data analysis. \n- They are highly educated and primarily holding Master's degree and Doctoral degree. \n- MHDs are giving heavy competition to them and if they don't run fast MHD could overtake them in the future.\n\n**MHDs are Walking:**\n- These kids started walking and some are running in this DS career.\n- Almost half of Kagglers from this group are youngsters (18-24 years) & primarily students.\n- As youngsters are getting into this space we can expect that in future MHD could perform well in this DS field.\n- We have some matured organizations who are currently using ML\n- Female Vs Male participation ratio is higher than average in almost 6 countries.\n- Students from this group seems to be using advanced processors like TPU than Data Scientis from their group. This shows their interest and growth in this DS field.\n\n \n**LHDs are Crawling:**\n- These babies are crawling and some active babies started walking in this DS career.\n- Close to half of Kagglers from this group are youngsters (18-24 years) & primarily students.\n- 12% of these Youngest (18-21 years) Kagglers are performing Data Scientist role.  This shows the zeal of the people in this space and some already started performing the role.\n- Only one country participated from this category.  When more countries join in this DS space they could perform well in DS career.\n- Students from this group seems to be using advanced processors like TPU than Data Scientis from their group. This shows their interest and growth in this DS field.\n- Higher % of Female PhD holders are there in this group (almost double than Male PhD %).\n- This is the only Category where >=100 K compensation being earned by Females (3%) than Males (1%).  \n\nCloud computing and Automation seems to be at Walking stage in this DS field.\n\n**Let me conclude my analysis with a closing note: *Let Seniors and Super Seniors from VHHD and HHD show path to youngsters coming in this fascinating field of Data Science across the world especially from MHD and LHD.

In this analysis, we are going to look at whether the interest in this fascinating field is there across the world regardless of Human Development Index (HDI) or not?  Lets do deep dive in this and understand more on this.\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. (Reference: http:\/\/hdr.undp.org\/en\/content\/human-development-index-hdi)\n\nHuman Development Index data is available @ http:\/\/hdr.undp.org\/en\/data#.\n\n\nHDI classifications are based on HDI fixed cutoff points, which are derived from the quartiles of distributions of the component indicators. The cutoff points are HDI of less than 0.550 for low human development, 0.550\u20130.699 for medium human development, 0.700\u20130.799 for high human development and 0.800 or greater for very high human development. (Reference: http:\/\/hdr.undp.org\/en\/content\/human-development-indicators-and-indices-2018-statistical-update-readers-guide)\n\nUsing above cut off points, we can categorize countries in this survey data as **Very High Human Developed (VHHD), High Human Developed (HHD), Medium Human Developed (MHD), Low Human Developed (LHD).**  \n\nI presume, it is fair to assume that in this survey, people who reside in a country are residents of those countries or representing the characteristics of the people from that country in the DS field.\n\nFor this analysis, we will not consider the records which has country name as Others.  As we can't determine the HDI for those countries (as actual country name is masked) let us exclude those records. \n","472ff75e":"**Its stunning to see that close to 30%+ of participants from across all categories have spent only zero USD on ML \/ Cloud computing products at their work in the past 5 years.  But still they have upskilled in this space (probably on personal interest) and (actively) participating in Kaggle surveys.  This shows interest on ML is increasing regardless of the HDI factor. This is being proven again and again.**\n\nClose to 11% from VHHD are spending >100K USD on ML \/ Cloud computing products at their work.  It again shows their maturity in this space.\n\n**It is marvelous to see that even LLD is having 2% of participants spending >100K USD on ML \/ Cloud computing products at their work.  In this scenario also, MHD has slightly overperformed than HHD.**\n\n43+% of participants across all categories are using Local development environments like JupyterLab, R Studio. That shows the popularity of this tool. \n\n**Its interesting to see that still MS Excel, Google sheets are used by around 15% to 30% of participants across all categories. That shows the power of these simple and regularly used tools. It could be mainly because of its good analytical capabilities.**\n\nBI softwares, Advanced statistical softwares and cloud based softwares like AWS etc are yet to pickup in this space, as it's usage between 3% to 9% across all HDI categories.\n\nOnly VHHD has 9% of cloud data based S\/Ws.
