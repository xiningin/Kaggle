For example, `max`.\n\nBy default, `max` returns the largest of its arguments.

Python functions are allowed much more flexibility. The `print` function is a good example of this:","0dcde7b7":"Unsurprisingly, Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description. However, when I write a function, I can provide a description in what's called the **docstring**.\n\n### Docstrings","f90b2567":"Python evaluates an expression like this from the inside out. First it calculates the value of `abs(-2)`, then it provides help on whatever the value of that expression is.\n\n<small>(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers! In Python, even something as simple-seeming as an integer is actually an object with a fair amount of internal complexity. After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the voluminous help output above will make more sense.)<\/small>\n\n`abs` is a very simple function with a short docstring. `help` shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like `print`:","68d95d05":"Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:","040f049d":"When applied to a function, `help()` displays...\n\n- the header of that function `abs(x, \/)`.

The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of \"null\" in other languages.)\n\nWithout a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.","6d2dbd11":"> **Aside: example calls**\n> The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The `>>>` is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function.
