I remember when I started out learning programming, I was intimidated by the swarm of coders online that were building amazing projects, tools, and products. Forget online, I was borderline depressed by the immense subject knowledge that my peers at University had. I felt like a nobody. I never thought I'd be able to do any of that. It was way too hard! But day after day, line after line, error after error, my knowledge compounded and I became a reasonable software engineer. And now, I'm beginning to explore the world of Data Science. As I learn the foundational concepts, I'm finding myself in the same situation - the same intimidation, the same fear, the same imposter syndrome. But, this time around, I'm also confident that if I put in the hard work, if I learn the foundations well, if I persevere, I will reach where I want to.\n\nSo, I want to explore the Kaggle Data Science community and bring to light a few sections of people who persevered, and were duly rewarded. \n","51008948":"Finally, let's look at those of us seeking the 'sexiest job of the 21st century', i.e. those of us who have been using code to analyze data since < 1 year (of which I am a part!)\n\nThese are the group of people, who with the right guidance and support, and with the right mentality, can learn to become experts at working with data(supposedly the new oil). \n\nLet's do this.
