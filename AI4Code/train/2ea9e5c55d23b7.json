by the FDA at this time.\n\nOnce the FDA has that safety data for two months on half the participants, then the FDA will decide whether something called an emergency use authorization, which means can this vaccine be distributed because it seems to have more benefit than risk.

The U.S. government is hoping for at least 20 million doses from Pfizer by the end of the year, if not more.\n\nThese companies have already been manufacturing doses on the anticipation and hope that they'll be effective. So I think as soon as the FDA clear then, then that will really change pace quite quickly, because then it's all about distribution and administration\" .\n\nWhen they've spoken about having 40 million doses by the end of this year to be able to vaccinate 20 million people in the month of December, assuming FDA authorization, that's of course reliant on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the ones for which we now have Phase 3 data.\nhttps:\/\/abc11.com\/moderna-vaccine-pfizer-covid\/8021881\/","9d162e37":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          Distribution of Covid-19 Vaccine\n     <\/h2>\n\nThe initial roll out will only be for high-risk individuals: front-line healthcare workers, first responders and those in long-term care facilities.\n    \nThe general public could have access to it by May or June of next year.\n    \nMany of the leaders should stand up and support vaccination: for a country to restart, get businesses back, it's going to be critical to have vaccination acceptance across the board.\"    \nhttps:\/\/abc11.com\/health\/public-could-get-access-to-covid-19-vaccine-by-summer-nc-doctor-says\/8234876\/","cb5ff83c":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          Safety and Efficacy of the Vaccine.\n     <\/h2>\n\nNearly half (51 percent) of Americans said they would definitely or probably get a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available today, a September KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation) report found.

In later months, as the vaccine becomes more widely available, they expect to expand to additional vaccination sites in the Duke system.\n    \nThe Pfizer vaccine requires two doses administered three weeks apart to be effective.\n    \nAfter receiving each dose of the vaccination, team members will need to wait under observation for a short period of time.

By Niall McCarthy - Dec 1, 2020 \n    \nThe research shows that the U.S. had secured 1.01 billion doses from six different companies up to November 20 which represents the highest quantity of any government apart from India which has made agreements for 1.6 billion.   \n    \nPfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna both account for 100 million U.S. doses each while the U.S. is also set for 500 million doses of the vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. It offers 70 percent protection according to trials, though it is believed this can be increased to 90 percent by tweaking the dose. \n    \nThe rest of the U.S. supply is made up of candidates that have not reported detailed testing results and it includes vaccines developed by Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and Sanofi-GSK.\n    \nModerna has reported some more good news from its trials, stating that its Covid-19 vaccine candidate has a final efficacy of just over 94 percent with nobody who received it during trials falling severely ill. That has paved the way for the company to apply for emergency usage authorization in the U.S. and Europe. That puts Moderna around a week behind Pfizer and BioNTech who already took that step with their own vaccine that emerged from trials with an efficacy of 95 percent.\n    \nWith the pandemic worsening and the race to roll out the first vaccine heating up, governments around the world have already reserved close to 10 billion doses before a single candidate has even reached the market. 2.6 billion further doses are under negotiation or reserved as optional expansions of existing deals. The findings come from Duke University who have been aggregating and analyzing publicly available data on vaccine procurement and manufacturing.  \nhttps:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/23660\/umber-of-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-secured-by-the-us\/\n    \n    ","10aa48e3":"#More than 20 countries, including many poorer nations, have ordered the vaccine, which costs less than some rival shots #and is easier to distribute.\n\nThe trial data was released on Nov. 23, when developers hailed \u201ca vaccine for the world\u201d.

AstraZeneca and Oxford's stories clash on COVID-19 vaccine, By Ludwig Burger, Kate Kelland, Abhirup Roy - DECEMBER 3, 2020\n\nAstraZeneca and Oxford University have given conflicting accounts of how they came upon the most effective dosing pattern for their COVID-19 vaccine, a rare instance of public dissension between major institutions collaborating on a pivotal project.\n    \nThe discrepancy, reported for the first time by Reuters, centres on the regimen administered to a smaller group of volunteers in the late-stage trials, of half a dose followed by a full dose. This diverged from the original plan of two full doses, given to the majority of participants.\n\nThe half-dose pattern was found to be 90% effective, versus the 62% success rate of the two-full-dose main study, based on interim data.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">A Trial \"Serendipitiness\"<\/p>\n    \nAstraZeneca\u2019s research chief told Reuters 10 days ago, when interim trial data was released, the half-dose was given inadvertently as a first shot to some trial participants, and emerged as a stroke of fortune - \u201cserendipity\u201d - that scientists expertly harnessed.\n    \nUncertainty over how the dosing regimen came about raises questions about the robustness of the data, according to some experts who said it risked slowing down the process of gaining regulatory approval for the shot and denting public confidence.\n\nTrust is at a premium when it comes to vaccines and we must not do anything that might in any way undermine it.\n    \nThere is also the potential impact on AstraZeneca, whose shares have underperformed rival vaccine developers that have also announced successful results, partly due to concerns from scientists about the relatively small sample size for the half-dose sub-group that led to the 90% efficacy finding.\nhttps:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-insigh\/fortune-or-foresight-astrazeneca-and-oxfords-stories-clash-on-covid-19-vaccine-idUSKBN28D2A7","4a5ac16c":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          Overcoming the Top Challenges of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution\n     <\/h2>\n\nBy Samantha McGrail\n    \n    \nThere are many questions regarding the roles of federal, state, and local governments, financing and coverage of a vaccine, and how to address racial disparities, communication, and public trust through a distribution plan.\n    \nOne vaccine concern cited in the KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation) report was the inadequacy local governmental distribution networks for COVID-19 vaccine distribution because the networksare mainly versed in delivering childhood vaccines and not adult vaccines. \n\nResearchers stressed that governments must significantly expand their distribution channels and partnerships for vaccine administration to reach target groups with a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nAdditionally, when a COVID-19 vaccine is approved, there will only be few doses available early on, so the doses will need to be rationed. \n\nBut the rollout for these vaccines will be unpredictable. Therefore, it is important that flexibility is implemented and realistic expectations by federal officials on initial supply are set forth.\n\nAnother major issue with current vaccines is that several of them must be preserved at extremely cold temperatures, which requires specialized equipment not readily available at many sites.\n\nBut one solution to combat this issue is to implement a distribution approach that involves distributed networks of federally managed cold chain sites and use of mass vaccination to reach target populations, KFF stated.\n    \n\n    \n#Two-doses for immunization - Careful tracking of doses and follow-up with each individual \n    \n    \nCurrently, many of the leading vaccine candidates require two-doses for immunization and will require careful tracking of doses and follow-up with each individual. But this presents its own set of challenges.\n\nTo address this issue, the CDC and local jurisdictions are currently in the process of implementing a new vaccine tracking system to monitor COVID-19 vaccine administration and help with multiple dose tracking.\n\nFinally, vaccines may be released on an accelerated schedule and some may be administered under an emergency use authorization without having gone through a full safety review initially. \n\nTherefore, the government is planning on implementing enhanced safety monitoring to track vaccine adverse events, researchers noted. This will ensure the safety of the vaccines and establish evidence of any adverse events in the months following administration. \n\nThe pandemic has had devastating health and economic impact and disproportionate impact in some communities, particularly communities of color.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">49% of Black Americans would NOT GET a COVID-19 vaccine<\/p>\n    \n    \nA KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation) report released last week found that 49 percent of Black Americans would not get a COVID-19 vaccine even if it was determined safe and effective. \n\nBut one simple way to combat this issue is effective outreach strategies developed in partnership with and directed toward black communities. This will be critical to building public trust and willingness to get vaccinated, researchers stated.\n\nCommunication and trust of all Americans are also major issues in the current pandemic, specifically regarding a COVID-19 vaccine.\nhttps:\/\/pharmanewsintel.com\/news\/overcoming-the-top-challenges-of-covid-19-vaccine-distribution","62275bfe":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          Moderna trial and how it differs from Pfizer vaccine\n     <\/h2>\n\nUNC doctor working on Moderna trial explains how it differs from Pfizer vaccine, By  Michael Perchick\n    \nMedical officials are expressing enthusiasm following Moderna's release of Phase 3 data, showing their vaccine was up to 94.5% effective.\n    \nEveryone was almost too impressed with the Pfizer data although they are happy to take it at face value. Now, they've got a second trial, using the same sort of vaccine styles. This is a vaccine method that they've never used before\". \"So to get two different companies using the same platform to come up with a similar vaccine, each with really outstanding efficacy, they kind of co-confirm each other.\" That doctor was referring to mRNA vaccines.\n\n\"They're done using vaccines harnessing part of the virus called mRNA. What that does - it's not a technique that they have an opportunity to use for other infections before.\n    \nThe Moderna vaccine included 30,000 volunteers, half of whom received the vaccine, the other half a placebo. UNC (University of North Carolina) was a host site for one of the studies, and 175 participants took part in the trial there. \n    \nIt's a remarkable result. They were hoping for 60, 70%. But it's really truly remarkable that it's so effective. And they learned also that in terms of severe disease, that no person that received the vaccine developed severe disease, which is really terrific.\n    \nModerna's results showed just five instances of a person receiving the vaccine and becoming affected, none of which involved serious symptoms. Still, the company cautioned the study is ongoing as scientists and researchers continue to study participants.\n\n\"What is the durability of this vaccine - the Moderna vaccine - and the Pfizer vaccine? Probably it's going to take at least a year to know for sure.\"\n\nWhile both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have very high efficacy rates, there is one key difference between them.\n\nModerna doesn't have the same cold-chain requirements as the Pfizer vaccine. That's the main difference. The Pfizer needs to be kept very, very cold - minus 70 degrees centigrade or lower.\nhttps:\/\/abc11.com\/moderna-vaccine-pfizer-covid\/8021881\/    ","5b1b4c72":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          COVID-19 vaccines are showing they may be highly effective in preventing the virus.\n     <\/h2>\n\nRaleigh man shares experience as participant in Moderna COVID-19 vaccine trial, By Morgan Norwood\n    \nIt takes six weeks to go through the process of becoming vaccinated with Moderna and the antibodies to work in you.

Duke University anticipated that the FDA could move quickly so they are preparing for an expected early shipment of the Pfizer vaccine to Duke, along with final guidance from the FDA, later this month.\n\nBased on guidelines developed by the state, Duke healthcare workers who are most likely to be exposed to COVID-19 (also known as SARS-CoV-2) in the course of fulfilling their job responsibilities will be among the first group eligible to receive a vaccine. This includes employees in both clinical and research areas. It is important to note that:\n\nEligible faculty and staff in clinical and research areas will be contacted in the coming weeks with additional information \n    \nInitial supplies will be limited.\n    \nCurrently, there are no plans to require COVID-19 vaccination.\n    \nThe vaccine will be provided at no cost.   \nhttps:\/\/today.duke.edu\/2020\/12\/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-information-duke-community    ","690edace":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          50% efficacy for a COVID-19 vaccine to be considered for approval\n     <\/h2>\n\n    \n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Raising the bar above 90% of efficacy<\/p>    \n    \nWhile U.S. regulators have said a minimum of 50% efficacy for a COVID-19 vaccine to be considered for approval, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have set a high bar, reporting efficacy data above 90% for their shots.\n\nIndependent scientists have expressed concerns that the AstraZeneca-Oxford half-dose group - with just over 2,700 participants - was too small to yield a robust efficacy result.\n\nThat\u2019s a fraction of the tens of thousands of participants in trials that resulted in the high efficacy data from Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s vaccines.\nhttps:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-insigh\/fortune-or-foresight-astrazeneca-and-oxfords-stories-clash-on-covid-19-vaccine-idUSKBN28D2A7","e316888c":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          Codes by Shrushrita Sharma\n     <\/h2>\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/shrushritasharma\/understanding-basic-image-operations\/comments","3c799895":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          When will the general public have access to a COVID-19 vaccine?\n     <\/h2>\n\nBy Josh Chapin - Wednesday, November 25, 2020  \n    \n\nAn infectious diseases doctor at Duke University Hospital is thrilled with some of the results coming in about a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna have reported that they should have enough efficacy and safety data to apply for an Emergency Use Authorization by the end of November.\n\n\"The flu vaccine efficacy is very dependent on what the strains are circulating at any given time so to hit a 90% in a flu vaccine would be a banner year,\" \n\nSome have shown to have a 95% efficacy which is much more than was expected. The FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee will have a public hearing and within two to four weeks, the FDA may grant emergency authorization for Pfizer, Moderna or both by the end of December. \nhttps:\/\/abc11.com\/health\/public-could-get-access-to-covid-19-vaccine-by-summer-nc-doctor-says\/8234876\/    "}}
