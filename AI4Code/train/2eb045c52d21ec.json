We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n\n1. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.\n2. What metric would you report for this dataset?\n3. What is its value?","96332d90":"## Question 2\n\nFor this question you\u2019ll need to use SQL.
