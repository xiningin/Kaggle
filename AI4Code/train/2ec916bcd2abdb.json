But Radhe is up against a dangerous new outlaw Rana (Randeep Hooda), who will stop at nothing to rule the city.\nRadhe Review: Set entirely in Mumbai, \u2018Radhe Your Most Wanted Bhai\u2019 is a Salman Khan actioner that doesn\u2019t try to be anything else, ever. Radhe is an encounter specialist with 97 encounters and 23 transfers to his credit, in the last 10 years. Now, as the city is in the grip of a dreaded drug mafia, it\u2019s time for Radhe to make a comeback and kick some butt. But between beating up the bad guys and saving lives, Radhe also finds time to flirt with his boss\u2019 sister Diya (Disha Patani).\nFor such a typical big-ticket Bollywood potboiler, most of what Radhe features, is on expected lines. For such films, the battle is always about striking a balance between falling for the clich\u00e9s and offering some novelty, whilst keeping the entertainment quotient high.\nDirector Prabhudheva, of course, gives into many such temptations that potentially derail the narrative, but thanks to the relentless action and a formidable villain, the film remains watchable, in parts.\nWhile it begins with a scene where the bad guy is bashing up another crook, a series of confrontation scenes between Salman and Randeep that follow are action-packed. The action choreography (by Myeonghaeng and Anbariv) is raw, brutal and with quite a lot of bloodshed.\nHowever, there are way too many distractions along the way. Leading among them is the film\u2019s heroine Disha Patani. She is the perfect eye-candy and adds plenty of glamour to the scenes, but her track is literally counter-productive to the story. The naivety of her character gives her little scope to perform and also dilutes the gravity of the subject at hand. All urgency comes to a grinding halt when it is song and dance time. The songs come at the most inopportune time in the film. Among them, the title track (by Sajid-Wajid) and Dil De Diya featuring Jacqueline Fernandez (by Himesh Reshammiya) stand out. The background score (by Sanchit and Ankit Balhara) is loud but adds to the impact where needed.\"\"\")","c4045610":"translation=pipeline('translation',model='Helsinki-NLP\/opus-mt-en-fr')","5caced05":"translation('Hell how are you?')","72a3d4f5":"We pass the option grouped_entities=True in the pipeline creation function to tell the pipeline to regroup together the parts of the sentence that correspond to the same entity","8a998736":"## Using any model from the Hub in a pipeline\nThe previous examples used the default model for the task at hand, but you can also choose a particular model from the Hub to use in a pipeline for a specific task \u2014 say, text generation","107a05fc":"By default, this pipeline selects a particular pretrained model that has been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis in English.
