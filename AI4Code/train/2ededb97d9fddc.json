We could take a historgram of each column, but that only tells you how many families would prefer that date and not how many people would be there on that date. Since not all families are the same size, this allows us to determine what days can be filled by first choice days.\n\nThere is a clear pattern to the data where there are three days of high popularity followed by four days of lower priority. Presumably, the three days are weekends.","2000d860":"# Gain Understanding of Penalties\n\nThe compensation package is pretty easy to understand, but the accounting penalty is not as straight forward.\n\nThe heatmap below shows that there is a steep penalty for a sudden drop in attendance, but not much of a problem for a sudden increase. Unfortunately, no money is gained for having more people than the day before.","8b683070":"# Explore Family Size Distribution\n\nEven though the dataset shows the distribution of family sizes, it is good to validate that our data looks right."}}
