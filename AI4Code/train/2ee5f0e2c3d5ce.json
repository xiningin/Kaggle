Thus it may be imperative to prioritize vaccine distributions accordingly.\n\n#### Limitations\n\n- It's important to note that not enough data is available to accurately assess a worldwide hospital admission rate. Other countries such as Sierra Leon or Vietnam may have higher rates but we don't have the data to show it. Thus this report may be skewed and must be used for educational purposes only not to inform policy decisions.\n- Another challenge to note is with the data source. The notebook runs with an uploaded csv file not fetched from a url. So I can't easily refresh and fetch for updates.\n"}}
