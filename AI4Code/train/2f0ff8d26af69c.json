It's relatively fast.","a55c61e9":"## Power Efficiency Trend\n\nPower efficieny tends to be better for newer supercomputers. Supercomputer Fugaku, the dark datapoint, has a typical power efficiency.","38845d69":"# Fastest Supercomputers\n\nThe [supercomputers in 2021](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ramjasmaurya\/top-ranked-supercomputer-2021) dataset contains information on the top ranked supercomputers globally. This notebook is used to create visualizations and observations from the dataset. This notebook is part of a homework assignment.","b2add3bf":"## Cumulative Speed\n\nThis section assumes a risky assumption: supercomputers are not decomissioned or upgraded and relabeled as a new supercomputer entry in the rankings. Cumulative supercomputer speed has a visually linear line on a log y scale, suggesting computational power is increasing exponentially with time. Eyeballing the chart, in the past 10 years, there's been on the order of 100x growth in computational power among supercomputers. The implications of this trend continuing for the next 10 years is interesting considering. Combined with improvements in artificial intelligence techniques and greater access to them, how far off is a technological singularity anyway?","a3defd70":"### Top 20 Supercomputers\n\nSupercomputer Fugaku in Japan is the fastest supercomputer at 442010 TFlops\/s. It uses 30 up to 30 megawatts of power. This is an absurd amount of power consumption."}}
