As an athlete you are more likely to represent your nation irrespective of gender if your weight is in the range of 60 to 76 kgs, Height in the range of 160cm to 190 cm and in the Age range of 20 and 26 years**\n\n**2. Specific to seasons, Taller and heavier athletes get more chances of representing the nation in Summer Olympics (This might be because of events like Weight Lifting, Wrestling, boxing etc.) while comparitively shorter and lighter athletes are preferred for Winter Olympics**\n\n**3. The Distribution of Height and Weight in Summer Olympics represent a distribution very close to Normal distribution while in case of Winter Olympics the distribution is more wider that a normal distribution**","f46428a0":"**From the Facet Grid Analysis it can be seen that the relation between Height and Weight in the winter season is much tighter than that in the summer season for both male and female athletes**\n\n**This gives us a new dimension that the height and weight of the athletes during the summer and winter season of the Olympic games has seen a different relation between them. Let's analyse this using the below subplots**","e8f19e21":"**The Analysis of Height and Weight of the athletes using the above plot also gives a clear pattern that a large number of athletes are in the height range of 160m to 190cm and in the weight range of 60 and 76 kgs**"}}
