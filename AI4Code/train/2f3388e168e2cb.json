Lets Model our CNN\n\nI used the Keras Sequential API, where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\nThe first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important.\n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\nDropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting.\n\n'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network.\n\nThe Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional\/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end i used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier. In the last layer(Dense(10,activation=\"softmax\")) the net outputs distribution of probability of each class.\n","d670eb0c":"## Lets visualize, understand and convert data","763ab399":"## Algorithm\n![](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/4Th58KC\/bg3.png)\n\nAs shown in Figure given above, our framework consists of three parts: data preprocessing, feature extraction, and regression analysis. \n\nIn the data processing phase, we divide the raw meta-data features into two parts, i.e., the time-related ones, and the time-unrelated ones. The time-related ones include the \u201cpostdate\u201d and \u201ctimezone\u201d. The rest are time-unrelated ones, i.e., related to users and items. For the time-related ones, we deal with the \u201cpostdate\u201d from the perspective of multiple time scales, and add the \u201ctimezone\u201d as an additional feature. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid model \nfor the subsequent two phases. More specifically, we use a CNN model consisting of four convolution layers and three full-linear layers on social cues to learn a high-level representation of the data in the feature extraction phase. In the regression analysis phase, we use XGBoost directly to make popularity predictions given the high-level features extracted by CNN.\n\n","2f98c7ca":"# Convolutional XGBOOST Tutorial \n## Accuracy=99.557\n\nThis Kernal compares the classification capability of DenseNet Layers in CNN and XGBoost and Proposing a new model of Convolutional XGBoost which uses Convolutional layers for feature extraction and XGBoost for classification.\n\nWe Know that XGBoost is one of the best ensemble learning algorithms which works well for various ML applications.
