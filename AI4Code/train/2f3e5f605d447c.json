You can subscribe by choosing the LA Air Quality sensor from the I3 Data Marketplace.\n\nCO2 Data\nCO2 data is measured in PPM or parts per million.  OSHA set the permissible exposure limits at 5000 PPM.  Read more about this in the [USA Food Safety and Inspection Service Carbon Dioxide Health Hazard Information Sheet](https:\/\/www.fsis.usda.gov\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/bf97edac-77be-4442-aea4-9d2615f376e0\/Carbon-Dioxide.pdf?MOD=AJPERES)\n\nTVOC Data\nTVOC stands for Total Volatile Organic Compounds.  This device measures TVOCs in PPB or parts per billion.  Other devices may measure TVOCs in ug\/m3.  To learn more, search Google for \"TVOC\" and you will find many good resources.","12686c69":"Most of the time, CO2 levels are about 400.  On July 19, from 10:10 until 10:24, CO2 levels are very high!  At this time, I took this device outside, turned on my car, and put the sensor near the exhaust.  On July 23, from 10:54 until 11:21, CO2 levels spike again.  What do you think happened?","2ee71532":"Take a look at the following chart.  Do you see anything strange, or perhaps a bit scary?"}}
