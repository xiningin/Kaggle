Moreover, most of the code is  written in Javascript, CSS and HTML. However, I think a data scientist must be also capable of building small functionnal applications for selling his models and justify of his business & marketing skills which are often neglicted if the field. To do so, having the basic knowledge and some beginner skills of web developpement seems to be quite an advantage. This is the main purpose of this kernel: showing that it is possible and not very complicated to build a small app like this, without a strong knowledge of web developpement.\n\nThanks for reading ! The code is available here on my [**github profile**](https:\/\/github.com\/nicohlr), don't hesitate to explore it, to star it and to contribute if you liked the project.","4ad399b0":"In this notebook I'll show you how I've built my own fifa player browser, called \"Fifafinder\" (what an original name!) using this [**kaggle FIFA 19 complete player dataset**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/karangadiya\/fifa19) and the python package [**Flask**](http:\/\/flask.pocoo.org\/docs\/1.0\/).\n\nThis is an app without any pretention, if you are familiar with Flask you'll find it very simple as well as the code. However, if you don't know the basics of web developpement, you may be surprised by how simple it is to build an app like this, by learning only some HTML, CSS and Javascript.","b380b21c":"## **Conclusion**"}}
