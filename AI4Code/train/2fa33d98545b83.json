It is clear that finding negative tweets goes very well for the Network but deciding whether is positive is not really.

Note that **embed_dim**, **lstm_out**, **batch_size**, **droupout_x** variables are hyperparameters, their values are somehow intuitive, can be and must be played with in order to achieve good results. Please also note that I am using softmax as activation function. The reason is that our Network is using categorical crossentropy, and softmax is just the right activation method for that.","8951232b":"As it was requested by the crowd, I extended the kernel with a prediction example, and also updated the API calls to Keras 2.0. Please note that the network performs poorly. Its because the training data is very unbalanced (pos: 4472, neg: 16986), you should get more data, use other dataset, use pre-trained model, or weight classes to achieve reliable predictions.\n\nI have created this kernel when I knew much less about LSTM & ML. It is a really basic, beginner level kernel, yet it had a huge audience in the past year. I had a lot of private questions and requests regarding this notebook and I tried my best to help and answer them . In the future I am not planning to answer custom questions and support\/enhance this kernel in any ways.

After that, I am filtering the tweets so only valid texts and words remain.  Then, I define the number of max features as 2000 and use Tokenizer to vectorize and convert text into Sequences so the Network can deal with it as input."}}
