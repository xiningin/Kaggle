However, if we analyze the recall we observe the value of 0.73, that is, of all 'delay' events we are correctly classifying 73% of our target category.\n\nIf it is very important to have a better performance in classifying our target category (for example if we were talking about classifying diseases), we could evaluate the threshold and favor the recall over precision, in this way, we would start to classify many flights that do not would delay, however, we would get right most of the delays.","9fbb5031":"Day of week 4 (Wednesday) has the highest incidence of delays.\n\nRegarding the days of the month, although more distributed, the 24th and 2nd are the ones that stand out.","531d9c08":"As we can see any flight with delay was diverted.","f4424e2a":"# Conclusion\nWe conclude that the variable 'DEP_DEL15' is the most relevant for understanding flights that arrive late to their destination.
