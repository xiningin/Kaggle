Scientists have used Hubble to observe some of the most distant stars and galaxies yet seen, as well as the planets in our solar system.\n\nIn its over 30 years of operation, Hubble has made observations that have captured humanity\u2019s imaginations and deepened our knowledge of the cosmos. It will continue to do so for years to come.\nhttps:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/mission_pages\/hubble\/about","bd5959b8":"#\"Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing.
