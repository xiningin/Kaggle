First I read the Data that given train.csv and test.csv\n2. Then I realize In Credit line utilization Column there is some Values which devided with dot (.) and also with comma (,) i replace all commas with dots.\n3. Then I do Outlier Treatement for the data like the i realocate values that bigger than uppercap and lower then lowercap \n4. Then after checking data i got the information that there are lots of missing values in data set thats why i used Missing value imputer. i repleaced missing values with average for each colomun \n5. Then i created new variables with Weight of evidence. ewhyich woE first some variables  like \"Credit line util\" and \"numbers of late loans 90+\" created bin variables such as devided 4 part then created weight of evidences variables. I got 4 variables\n6. First i treid linear regression i got 83.3 (on public LB)\n7. Then I changed it to RandomForest then i played with hyperparameters manualy to see the result.\n8. While working i have used also future importance for to see which values are more important \n9. Used Pipes Standart scaler etc.\n10. for the Score i used accuracy then realize it is not right way then i switch to Roc aug score \n     arc = roc_auc_score(X_test.defaulted_on_loan, predict[:,1])\n11. with the model i got from train data i used it for test data and created the 12. column for prediction \n12. Saved csv\n\n","0882efb4":"# ****Explain for the Model Subbission****"}}
