The former two at least make it up by excelling elsewhere.\n* No special Pokemon have standout HP or special defense.\n* Water-type Pokemon have average statistics across the board, which confirms our earlier hunch as they're the most common type of Pokemon. (Game balance +1 )\n* Rock-type and Steel-type Pokemon still have the absolute best defense but lack in speed.
