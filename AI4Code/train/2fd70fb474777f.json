PCA works by considering the variance of each attribute because the high attribute shows the good split between the classes, and hence it reduces the dimensionality.\n\n#### Applications of Principal Component Analysis:\n* PCA is mainly used as the dimensionality reduction technique in various AI applications such as computer vision, image compression, etc.\n* It can also be used for finding hidden patterns if data has high dimensions. Some fields where PCA is used are Finance, data mining, Psychology, etc.","fb4fb353":"# find best n_components:\nto find best n_components, we creat models with 1 to 40 n_components to compare explained_variance of each model. explained_variance must be 90 or higher.","9c3b760e":"#### so n_components  of our model must be 30 or higher.","0d924c0d":"# Import the Dataset:\n#### for know about this dataset, you can check this [website](https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/Pen-Based+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits)"}}
