When the number of annotators is more than 10^1.5, the target score peaked towards 0.7. Looking at the data description page, this phenomenon is intentional due to imposed strategy, although we are not presented with the details:\n> Some comments were seen by many more than 10 annotators (up to thousands), due to sampling and strategies used to enforce rater accuracy.\n\nBy analysing the number of annotators, we can exploit the information to give more attention to comments with more annotators when we train our model. This initial analysis suggests the possibility of various weight for each comment depending on the number of annotators. \n\nThe following sub-sections about subtypes and identities are common in other EDA kernels as well, but it is good to re-visit them. I see subtypes are being used as auxiliary attributes during training but not identities, what could be the reason?","a2319124":"The most popular identity is regarding *gender* followed by *religion* and *race*, still not so dominating as *insult* subtype.

Indeed some stopwords are a good predictor (his, will, an, by), so definitely we have to tailor which stopwords to be removed.

PO: possessive ending (person's)\n2. CD: digits\n3. UH: interjection (uh, yeah, ah)\n4. IN: preposition\/conjunction (on, in, but)\n\nThis means, we should put more attention when we are handling those words during preprocessing. It is better to keep numbers, but maybe we can change them as a same token (\"DIGIT\"). Handling possesive ending seems relevant. Interjection, which seems to be meaningless, is worth a second look. Lastly, we need to be cautious about stopwords removal, does it remove prepositions?

This may also be the case for interjection. In terms of digits and preposition, however, higher proportion tend to be a safe comment.\n\nNote that since the POS tags correlation with the target value is really small either for positive and negative, it might not be that useful for predicting target value. Nevertheless, it offers a hint if using stopwords provide better results than removing them.","428370d3":"# Toxic Comment Analysis","9664118c":"The internet has given people the freedom of speech like no other. Yet, quoting the late Uncle Ben:\n> with great internet connection, comes great responsibility\n\nIndeed, it is tempting to just use word embedding combined with a sequence-based model such as LSTM , but I won't understand why does it work in this case. Does it really solve the biased prediction problem? Not to mention why auxiliary attributes improve the performance of the model and is widely used. For this reason, I reside to the \"traditional\" EDA method, hoping to get a better sense of the dataset before preprocessing or developing any models. There is no fancy stuff going on, but I believe we can still learn a thing or two using simple methods.\n\nIn this kernel, I explore some features of the toxic comments that is not commonly discussed in other EDA kernels. First, I look into annotators and their labels. Since every comments can have different number of annotators, is there any difference in the agreement level? Next, I revisited toxic subtypes and identity columns to see whether those attributes can help us identify toxic comments. I continue with lexical analysis, hoping to find any distinguishable characteristics between toxic and safe comments. Finally, I dig deeper into the unintended bias and see what kind of comments are misclassified using a simple keyword-based prediction.\n\nCan we capture some toxic villains today?","cd0daf13":"And if we group the identity columns:","f749e81b":"The purpose of the lexical analysis is to see comments characteristic before moving on to understanding them semantically. Can we get some clue about the toxicity of a comment based on the total number of characters in the comment or the average word length? Another aspect that we can investigate is the part-of-speech. The hypothesis is that toxic comments consist of adjectives. Let's consult the data to find the answer:","3dabf371":"We can see which terms have the highest weight by using the average of TF-IDF value:","f29ea798":"Looking at some examples of false positive, we can observe some comments that have arguable target value. I cannot understand why \"Effin moron\" and \"Crooked Jerk!\" are not considered toxic comments. Even a comment like \"You're a stone-cold MO-Ron.\" has a target value of 0. Those might suggest that we have to take extra measure in cleaning the dataset.\n\nWe can also see comments that have target value really close to the toxic threshold (0.5) have be rounded as \"safe\" comments questionably. \"Overpaid, childish, morons\" is definitely an insult, but still half of 71 annotators considered it to be safe. As the data is imbalanced, it is considerable to neglect comments with doubtful target value during training, maybe it is good to ignore comments that has value between 0.4 to 0.6.\n\nFinally, we can see the \"biased\" classification of a comment if we are using keyword-based modeling. As this competition suggested, using keywords only is not sufficient to predict toxic comments. Many safe comments are labelled as toxic due to the keywords, while it really depends on the context. \"There is no white supremacist in the White House.\" is an excellent example of a safe comment (target value = 0) that might be mis-classified due to 2 occurrences of \"white\" word. And we know that this is a difficult task when the model is only presented with a two-word comment \"Not clowns?\" and asked to determine whether it is toxic or not without any additional context when the word \"clown\" is used in other comments with a mixed sentiment. Hard, even for sequence-based models. Or is it?","12096e9f":"## 3.2 Naive Bayes","4d3bb8e8":"Looking at the examples, it seems this subtypes are not supposed to be mutually exclusive. The example of *sexual_explicit* also has some degree of *insult* (\"...rethuglican rugrats, pleasure, or, on rare occasion, shooting Ping Pong balls...\"). Similarly with the example of *obscene* which include some sort of threat (\"Quarantine should end with a bullet between the eyes ... Bear spray to the face.\"). How related each types and also with the target?","e8e0af68":"Toxic comments account only 8% of the training data, meaning we are dealing with **imbalanced** dataset. How about the actual agreed toxicity level distribution of the annotators?","a4d2d8ed":"Well, there is no significant difference between toxic and safe comments in any of the plots. We can observe, barely, that toxic comments tend to be longer with more number of tokens (or words). However, there is an usual spike for non-toxic comments with more than 950 characters. Seems some safe comments are (extremely) elaborative, but in general the longer means more likely to be toxic, also as shown by the number of sentences plot.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that using a lot of capital letters and punctuation marks (e.g. a burst of exclamation or question marks) might signal toxic comments. However, there is no evidence of such thing in terms of capital letters and non-alphanumeric proportion. If that's the case, then using lower-case and removing alpha-numeric should be fine. It is worth to take another look at this with POS analysis.","e6cbe48a":"These are the key insights I have gathered from this EDA that should help during preprocessing and when building the actual model:\n1. We are dealing with imbalanced dataset (92% vs 8%). I do not see any public kernels talk about how to handle this issue (or if we **should** handle this issue).\n2. There is a correlation between the number of annotators and the toxicity value, which might suggest to take number of annotators into account during training. Not as feature, of course, because the test set does not provide the number of annotators. It can be useful as a sample-weighting method.\n3. The most popular toxic subtypes is insult, it dominates other subtypes. Even more intriguing, it has a (really) high correlation with target value, which bear a thought if the toxic definition in this dataset is actually \"insulting\".\n4. Identity attributes are not helpful to predict target value due to the low label availability and absence of correlation.\n5. There is a negligible difference in comment length, capital letters proportion, and alpha-numeric occurrence between toxic and safe comments. One can consider to do lowercase transformation and remove punctuations.\n6. Some measurement into preprocessing: Don't remove digits (rather, replace to a \"DIGIT\" token, for example). It is an indication of a safe comment. Also, not all stopwords should be removed.\n7. Some comments have a questionable target value, which means cleaning the (noisy) dataset is important before training the model. How to detect them? This is a subject for another kernel.\n8. Comments with target value in the edge of the threshold is not reliable, consider ignoring comments with target value too close to 0.5. Or better yet, train a separate model to identify this (Ensemble?).","c45723af":"With such low correlation, identity columns are not a promising auxiliary attributes. Except *race* and *sexual_orientation*, the correlation to target is almost 0. Even *race*, which has the highest correlation, only score 0.22.","313ec55c":"# 1. Understanding Toxic Annotations","d3fbe973":"Because we are dealing with imbalanced dataset, I am using sample weighting. As the number of safe comments are twice the number of toxic comments in the sample, the weight of the toxic comments are twice the weight of a safe comment during training. In other words, we force the model to perform well on predicting a toxic comment correctly.","d7af2d02":"It is remarkable how a human can call another human with obscure words in an online forum. Based on personal observation, I suspect toxic comments contain more adjective than safe comments. Fortunately, NLTK has a default POS tagger for english. It might not work that well for online forum contents due to colloquial languages, but it can help us to some extent in verifying our hypothesis.\n\nFor the POS analysis, I am going to use downsampling for the non-toxic class mainly due to memory limitation. Downsampling is done randomly.","df66fefc":"We want to model a comment being toxic given the term weights of words in the comment. We calculate the probability by looking at the probability of a toxic comments among all comments, probability of each word in a toxic comment, and the probability of the word itself among all corpora.\n\nBecause we have 6.857 words in our vocabulary, each comment is represented as a vector with length 6.857, and most of the elements are zeros. In the end, our goal is to see which words are predictors of toxic\/safe comments.","a679c1e3":"As shown, it is clear that *insult* is the dominant type of toxic comments. The number of *insult* comments is 10x the number of the closest next two categories: *obscene* and *identity_attack*. I am not quite sure what each type means, it is good to see an example for each:","69fafc17":"As expected, most of the comments were deemed non-toxic by all of the annotators. However, when it comes to toxic comments, it is hardly unanimous. The number of comments with target score equal to 1.0 is really small. Another boggling thing is the number of annotators for each comment can be different. Is it correct to assume that more annotators means more believable? Let's check if the toxicity of a comment is related to the number of annotators.","8b4e3625":"It is interesting to see that among the highest average tf-idf are mostly what are usually considered as stopwords (he, so, an). We can see that those terms have the highest weights, but are they a good predictor for toxic comments? Naive Bayes to the rescue.","0a360c74":"To my surprise, *insult* and *target* correlation score is really high: 0.93! Although *obscene* and *identity_attack* have 0.49 and 0.45, respectively, but 0.93 is just another level. Maybe we should focus on predicting *insult* as the definition of *toxic*?","f403e74e":"# 4. Lesson Learned","7dceffdb":"Let's find out which sub-types are the most common.","0aafbdac":"As we are interested about *insult* subtypes, is there any correlation between the identity columns to the subtypes?","374cc6f1":"## 1.4 Toxic Subtypes and Identity Correlation","222428fe":"Although small, these POS tags have positive correlation with the target value:\n1. PR: pronouns (her, hers, himself)\n2. PD: predeterminers (all, half, both)\n3. JJ: adjectives\n4. RP: particles (about)\n\nThey are not as significant as expected, but we can get a sense of the construction of a toxic comment. Let's see the CFD:","b1d7b1f0":"One of the weakness of TF-IDF is the inability to capture the similarity of the same word on different forms. As an illustration, \"available\" and \"availability\" are just as different as \"apple\" and \"duck\". The only way to capture the relationship between words are their co-occurrences in sentences. To handle this, I am using a stemmer. Stemming is not a fool-proof technique because we will lose some degree of information by doing so. However, as I want to analyze which word is the most relevant for a toxic\/safe comments, not building the most accurate model, stemming should come in handy for now. Also, stopwords are not removed as preposition and interjection are positively correlated with safe comments.","baad9e94":"## 2.1 Lexical analysis","14858eec":"## 3.1 TF-IDF","c0e08b4f":"The first reason why identity columns are not as helpful as subtypes is the data availability. Only 22.45% of the training set are labelled and half of them are not considered toxic. Let's explore the distribution of comments that have been labelled with identities:","2f029d76":"After we analyse the lexical characteristic of the comments, we are ready to touch the surface of semantic analysis. I am using a simple method called Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to capture the importance of a word in a comment. TF-IDF has many flaws, of course, but it is a quick way of feature engineering without building any models. Moreover, it is definitely better than just a frequency-based bag-of-words. Subsequently, I use (yet another) simple naive bayes model to find which terms are important predictors.","af169a84":"There seems to be two clusters in terms of the number of annotators: below 10^1.5 and above 10^1.5. Is there any difference in the toxicity agreement of those two clusters?","21124c9c":"Of course *identity_attack* is somewhat correlated with the identity columns, but we do not find any meaningful correlation between any of the identity groups with either *target* or *insult*. Thus, identity columns are not really helpful when we want to predict *target*."}}
