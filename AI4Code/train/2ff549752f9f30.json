As expected, we can see that the United States is leading by 5 million vaccination from the second country, as they have the most COVID19 cases and deaths in the world. Followed by the United States is China, India and the United Kingdom, which also have been severely impacted by the virus. The United Kingdom is the leader of Europe, followed by England (which is part of the United Kingdom), Germany and Russia. Not suprisingly, these countries have all developed their own vaccines, due to the impact COVID19 has had on their population and on their economy.","5bde1221":"I have imported more libraries than just the ones used in the Seaborn introductory course, such as numpy and os. I need to use these libraries to allow me to use more commands.","023b8680":"The question that I hope to answer with the data is: \"What country is leading in the vaccination race? The factors that will help me determine this are: the total number of people vaccinated and completely vaccinated (people administered with 2 vaccines), the progress of daily vaccinations in the country, and total vaccinations per hundred people).","e9b062ac":"The bar plot above shows 2 interesting patterns: the United States is extremely advanced in complete vaccinations compared to the rest of the world, with approximately thirty eight million people who have been completely vaccinated. This is due to the fact the US has had the most cases and deaths, meaning that by completely vaccinating people, their not taking any chances; In the last graph, China was second on the list of total number of people vaccinated, but in terms of complete vaccinations (people administered with two vaccines), its not even on the bar plot above. The reason for this could be that because China's population is so high, it simply cannot afford too provide everyone they vaccinate with two vaccines, but if we look at India, the second most populated country in the world, they are second in complete vaccinations, so it could be that either India has more vaccines availabe, or that the Chinese goverment does not feel the need to give each person two dozes of the vaccine.","5c40b5f4":"The code cell above allows me to import the csv file \"covid-world-vaccination-progress\", read the file into a variable (data), and loads the first five rows of the data table.","f66b11d4":"The line plot above shows the progress of daily COVID19 vaccinations in the United States, China, India, and the United Kingdom (the four most advanced countries in terms of total vaccinations in the world). We can see that the US has reached the highest number and fastest progress of people vaccinated daily, which isn't a suprise since they are leading in the total number of vaccinations and complete vaccinations, as demonstrated by the bar graphs above. The United States and India seem to have a steady incline since December 2020, while on the other hand, until March this year, the United Kingdom seems to not have done much prgress at all. This could be due to the large waiting list of countries in Euroupe that need the vaccine. Another interesting pattern demosntrated in the line plot is that in late January this year, China's daily vaccination progress dropped significantly. The most positive aspect of the line plot is that this month, the progress of daily vaccination seems to be growing in all four countries."}}
