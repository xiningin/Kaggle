acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. BRIC term was\noriginally coined by economist Jim O\u2019Neil predicting that these four countries will have bigger\nimpact on global economy. South Africa joined the association of BRIC in year 2010. Since\n2009 BRICS have yearly meeting where leaders discuss various topics like economy, science,\ntechnology, security and trade.\nI want to find out how BRICS countries have developed over the years. The Goldman Sachs\npublished a report in 2003 on BRICS titled \u201cDreaming with BRICs: The path to 2050\u201d.\nI want to see how accurate this report was in terms of predicting the future of BRICS Economic\ngrowth. I want to compare the economic growth of BRICS countries with each other as well\nas with the other developed nations, additionally I want to find out the relationship between\neconomic growth and life expectancy. This will be interesting study to see how countries with\ndiverse economies and diverse political system came together to help each other with economy,\ntrade and business.\n","a77dc50e":"# 2.4 Population Growth and Working age population rate\nPopulation growth is defined as annual percentage change in the population of country. Goldman Sachs had predicted the decline in population growth rate in BRICS. In figure 9 we can see\nthat China, Brazil and India\u2019s population growth rate is decreasing gradually over the years.\nSouth Africa and Russia\u2019s population growth is varying over the years, but after 2013 their\npopulation growth is decreasing like other BRICS countries.\nWorking age population rate is defined as the percentage of population that engages in labor\nmarket either by working or looking for work. Goldman Sachs had predicted that the working\nage population will decline over the years in BRICS countries.Figure 10 shows the working age\npopulation rate of BRICS. We can see that working age population rate is declining in China\nand India. Brazil\u2019s working age population rate was increasing from 1989 to 2005 and after 2005\nit is slowly decreasing. Russia\u2019s rate decreased from 1989 to 2003 and after that it increased\n\ntill 2016 then it is dropping slowly. South Africa\u2019s rate was decreasing slowly till 2008 then it\ndropped till 2010 and then it has increased after that.","26816cef":"# 2.2 GDP mean growth rate\nTo show how BRICS countries have grown over two decades, I have calculated the average\ndecade growth rate for BRICS and compared them with the three developed nations average\ndecade growth rate.Figure 6 shows the average decade percentage GDP growth rates in the\nBRICS and in US, UK and Japan. We can see that the percentage growth is slowed down in\nBRICS in 2009-2019 except India. The developed nations GDP growth is not slowed down. The\nglobal recession of 2008 might be the reason behind this declined growth in BRICS countries\n(except India). Goldman Sachs reportedly closed BRICS fund after not getting desired growth\nin these countries.\nAs of 2019 USA is ranked first in terms of GDP and China is second. Whereas India is at\nfifth rank. Goldman Sachs had predicted that in year 2050 China will become the top\nmost economy in the world and India will be at third rank in terms of GDP. Looking at the\ndecade growth rate of China and India it might be possible for them to reach that position.","9931b868":"# 2.3 GDP per Capita (ppp)\nGDP per capita (PPP based) is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using\npurchasing power parity rates and divided by total population. An international dollar has the\nsame purchasing power over GDP as a U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP per capita\nis sometimes associated with standard of living. Figure 8 shows the GDP per capita in BRICS\nand G6 countries. There is variation in growth in BRICS countries. Russia\u2019s GDP per capita\nis growing rapidly compared to other BRICS counties after 2004. China\u2019s GDP per capita has\ncrossed the Brazil and South Africa. India has the lowest GDP per capita compared to other\nBRICS countries. On the other hand there is no variation in GDP per capita growth in G6\nnations.All of the G6 nation\u2019s GDP per capita is increasing parallelly over the years. One thing\nto note here is that all of the BRICS countries have less GDP ppp than G6 nations.","fc821843":"\n# 2.1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\nGDP is total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within\ncountry\u2019s borders in specific time period.As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it\nfunctions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given country\u2019s economic health.\nG6 is an unofficial group of France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain. Above figure shows the GDP of BRICS and G6 countries in US dollars using base year as a 2010.\nWe can see that China\u2019s GDP growth is fast as compared to G6 nations. China has highest\nGDP as compared to other BRICS nations as well as G6 nations. Goldman Sachs had predicted\nthat China\u2019s GDP will cross UK and Germany before 2010 and will cross Japan\u2019s GDP in year\n2016 \n\n\nAs we can see in following figure that their prediction was accurate, and China crossed Japan\u2019s\nGDP in 2009. India is growing fast too, it has crossed the GDP of the Brazil, Russia and it\nhas reached at the GDP of other G6 nations except Germany. Goldman Sachs had predicted\n1\nthat India\u2019s GDP will be higher than Italy and France before 2020, and their prediction was\naccurate \nThe Brazil\u2019s GDP isn\u2019t growing as same pace as China or India\u2019s GDP. Goldman Sachs had\npredicted that Brazil will cross Italy\u2019s GDP in year 2025 in reality Brazil crossed Italy\u2019s GDP\nin year 2009  The Russia\u2019s GDP growth is similar to Brazil. Goldman Sachs had\npredicted that the Russia\u2019s GDP will be more than Italy\u2019s GDP in year 2018 but in reality\nRussia didn\u2019t crossed Italy\u2019s GDP ","a06525a6":"# 2 Analysis\n\n\n\n","614a0fb4":"# 2.5 GDP per capita (ppp) and life expectancy\nLife expectancy refers to the age a person can expect to live.I wanted to see if GDP per capita growth implies increased life expectancy. Due to increased GDP per capita people have improved standard of living and because of that they might be able to afford good healthcare and live longer. Figure 11 has two y-axis and four subplots for each country in BRIC. It shows the change in GDP per capita over the years as well as change in life expectancy over the years. In figure 11 we can see that GDP per capita and life expectancy show parallel trends for China and India. We can assume that as the GDP capita increased so the life expectancy in these countries over the years. In case of Brazil we can clearly see the correlation between life expectancy and GDP ppp till 2009, but after that we can see GDP per capita\u2019s increase or decrease did not affected the life expectancy. In case of Russia life expectancy dropped from 67.02 to 65.04 during 1998-2003 while GDP per capita increased. Figure 12 shows the GDP per capita growth over the years as well life expectancy over the years for South Africa.We can see that life expectancy dropped from 63.2 to 53.4 during 1992-2005 while GDP per capita increased","60298368":"# 3 Conclusion\nGoldman Sach\u2019s prediction were pretty accurate regarding economic growth in China and India. In his 2016 interview with CNBC Jim O\u2019Neil said that he got two out of four countries right. According to him China and India were performing well. The predictions for Brazil\u2019s GDP growth were accurate too. Russia\u2019s GDP didn\u2019t grew as expected but it\u2019s GDP per capita ppp increased rapidly as compared to any of the BRICS or G6 countries. The 2008 recession really impacted the GDP growth rate in BRICS countries except India, but the rate of growth in BRICS countries is still higher than developed economies like USA, Japan and United Kingdom. Goldman\u2019s Sach\u2019s had predicted that India\u2019s GDP per capita will be lesser than other countries and their prediction was accurate.They were also accurate about population growth decline in BRICS countries as after 2016 BRICS countries show the decline in population growth rate. Working age population rate prediction were only right for China and India as working age population rate is decreasing in these countries. Life expectancy and GDP per capita has perfect correlation for countries like India and China,so the increase in GDP per capita seems to have impact on life expectancy for these two countries, but we also need to consider the fact that correlation does not imply causation. On the other hand for other countries of BRICS we can\u2019t really say that life expectancy and GDP per capita are correlated. Which doesn\u2019t mean that GDP per capita is not important when it comes to improving life expectancy in these countries. There might be other factors which impact the life expectancy. The individual income growth might be affecting the life expectancy instead of aggregate economic growth. Follow up research of impact of economic growth on income inequality can improve the findings in this paper"}}
