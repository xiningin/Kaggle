Typical sources of low back pain include:\n\nThe large nerve roots in the low back that go to the legs may be irritated\nThe smaller nerves that supply the low back may be irritated\nThe large paired lower back muscles (erector spinae) may be strained\nThe bones, ligaments or joints may be damaged\nAn intervertebral disc may be degenerating\nAn irritation or problem with any of these structures can cause lower back pain and\/or pain that radiates or is referred to other parts of the body. Many lower back problems also cause back muscle spasms, which don't sound like much but can cause severe pain and disability.\n\nWhile lower back pain is extremely common, the symptoms and severity of lower back pain vary greatly. A simple lower back muscle strain might be excruciating enough to necessitate an emergency room visit, while a degenerating disc might cause only mild, intermittent discomfort.\n\nThis data set is about to identify a person is abnormal or normal using collected physical spine details\/data."}}
