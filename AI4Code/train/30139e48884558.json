Cleaning data is very challenging. It took me dozens of hours and bunchs of effor to get data in shape. I doubt when people say most of time in data science, you will deal with data cleaning. Now I sadly know it's true.\n2. In searching for Normality of X, I was unable to log transform X because of negative values. These negatives came from standard scaling performed beforehand. I am thinking that if I first perform log-transformation, then scale the data later, so I could get benefits from both process with nicer distributions of X features.\n3. Tuning did not make sense as much as I hoped. The baseline of very simple linear regression was 0.69 in R2. Then I did not get any improvement after all the tuning. There are some reasonable explains:\n    * I perfectly cleaned the data. Oh, I hope so.\n    * Ridge - a linear regression with L2 regularization was too simple for predictions.\n    * Is there a better transform than a log, like a square root?","6f8f5487":"### Modeling\n\nThe most important part of this sections is ***B - Linear Regression with Cross Validation***, that I am carrying on both modeling and tuning carefully.

Yes, we got it. The shape is not fan-out, not spreading. Points locate within a quite parallel limits.\n* Normality. We got it, too. On the scatter plot, there are a bit outliers on the upper, but no any dense on one side. Then, look at the histogram on the right, quite perfect nomarl, huh.\n* Linearity between X and y. I am not so sure. It is worth an extensive study.\n\n* Outliers. There are some of them on the higher top.
