Decisions:**\n\n* To be able to visualize the small bars properly, we have restricted the x axis limit from -200 to 1000.\n\n**Primary Insights**\n\n* As expected the sub categories with the maximum average percent change belong to 'Learning and Curriculam' and 'Classroom Management', which we also highlighted in the earlier plots.\n\n\n* Learning and Curriculam:\n    * The sub category 'Content Creation and Curation' got the maximum growth in terms of average percent change in the digital engagement between 1st and 4th quarter.\n    * Next to that was \"Digital Learning Platforms\", which is also expected because people moved more and more to digital learning after covid.\n    * And there are many other product sub categories that had increased engagement in the last quarter like, \"Sites, References and Learning Materials\", \"Courseware and Textbooks\", \"Streaming services\", \"Learning Materials and Supplies\", etc. This also an expected trend.  \n    \n    \n* Classroom Management: \n    * The sub category within 'Classroom Management' which saw the maximum average percent of growth is \"Virtual Classroom-Video Conferencing and Screen Sharing\", reasonably so because post covid most of the educational institutions and schools have resorted to virtual classroom and video conferencing tools to continue their interactions with students.\n    \n    \n* Shools andd District Operations:\n    * Most of the sub primary function categories within this category have seen a negative average percent change in engagement from 1st quarter to 4th quater, which means there is a decrease in engagement for such sub categories. For example the engagement has decreased for sub categories like Human Resources, Safety Compliances, Student Information Systems etc. The products of these sub categories are generally useful when schools are in operating state, and hence are expected to see a negative impact on their usage post covid.","52f68718":"## 2.3 Products Data","633e0287":"**Description:**\n\nIn this section we will analyze the daily engagement trend for each sub-category in the PEF Main category 'CM'.

And as part of Digital Learning, the students also engaged more with product sub categories like, \"Sites, References and Learning Materials\", \"Courseware and Textbooks\", \"Streaming services\", \"Learning Materials and Supplies\", etc, which are all related to Learning and Curriculam.

A learning management system (LMS) is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation and delivery of educational courses, training programs, or learning and development programs. The learning management system concept emerged directly from e-Learning. (Source-Wikipedia). This rise seems logical because schools being shut down all over the country after covid, might have resulted in an increased dependency on e-learning and LMS.\n\n* There is a significant decline in the engagement for 'School Management Softwares-Mobile Device Management' sub-category post covid. The most likely reason for such phenomenon seems to be the shutting down of schools during lockdowns and schools and students being able to rely on Digital platforms for their learning thus minimizing the need for school management softwares. **The plot for the daily trend in sub-category 'School Management Softwares-Mobile Device Management'is given below separately, which clearly shows the decrease in the total engagement post covid.** ","25ee5758":"* Connecticut, Utah, Messachusetts and Illinois are top 4 states with maximum number of districts in the dataset while Arizona, North Dakota, Minnesota and Floarida are the ones with lest number of districts in the dataset.","a7893314":"#### 2.2.4 How districts with different socio-economic status are distributed across locales","ca80d0cd":"* Total 59% of the districts are in the suburbs while the towns have the least number of districts(approx. 6%)","38798b3c":"**PLOT**","a15acf17":"**PLOT**","e5b9b687":"**Remarks:**\n\n* In the plot we can see that larger number of districts have low or moderate per_person_expenditure.
