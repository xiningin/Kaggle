They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter .\n\n#### As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.\n\n#### Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation . Thus a potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.\n\n## Introduction\n\n#### Firstly, we will take a look in the behaviour of our data! We are going to use a couple of manifold learning algorithms in order to visualise the high dimensional data in a 2D plot!\n\n#### Lastly, we will use some machine learning approaches to correctly identify Pulsar Stars. We want to find the best algorithm, accuracy-wise, however, we need to find which one provides the most important features to identify Pulsar Stars.","444ce542":"#### How many samples do we have for which class?","e801f1a5":"#### We can see that PDFs are very separated! That means that we found good news! Not-pulsar-stars samples are very near each other (lower variance), in the other hand, pulsar stars samples seem to has a higher variance, therefore, the behaviour of each pulsar star may vary among distinct stars, meaning the uniqueness of this phenomena!"}}
