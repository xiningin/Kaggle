This age mean that some player can contribute a lot into the club and at the same time club can used them max of their capacity.\n\nAverage transfer fee during this season quite big. It show each club would spend around USD 14 million on this season to complete their team. This is double compare to 19 years ago club only spend USD 7 million to complete their team.\n\nIn 2018-2019 also we record that all transfer fee are USD 3.4 billion and this is a lot of money transaction but take a look at 19 years ago transaction are only USD 1.8 billion and nowadays it almost double.\n\nThis significant amount of money show that football club are getting rich and player also are getting a lot of money compare to 19 years ago.","7102c5ec":"**Conclusion**\n\nOn season 2000-2001 we cannot implement any type of machine learning model to predict transfer fee based on age because most of the club on this season doesnt care about age.\n\nClub only thinks about capability of player no matter how age is he.","7ffbed9d":"Data above shows that Kylian Mbappe is most expensive player with a value of USD 135 million.

Kylian Mbappe receive USD 135 million when he is 19 years old compare to Luis Figo receive on 27 years old.\n\nHere we can see club nowadays doesnt care about peak age. They are been awarded no matter what age player are. As long performance of the player are in top level, amount of money will be more and more. \n\nNowadays Real Madrid are not spend much like Paris Saint German. When we talk about rich club, PSG will be our main team nowadays.","5b495b2b":"In season 2000-2001 most club like to purchase centre forward, maybe it because of club during that time dont have a lot of attacker and with addition of centre forward they hope that a lot f goal will happen on this season.","2a4dfd7d":"Centre Forward still a favourite choice of most club.
