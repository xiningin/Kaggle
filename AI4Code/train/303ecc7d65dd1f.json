It decreases based on the infectious period, so the higher \u03b3 is, the more quickly people die\/recover and move on to the final stage in Equation (4).

The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. As of 16 April 2020, more than 2.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 140,000 deaths. More than 532,000 people have recovered, although there may be a possibility of relapse or reinfection. The deaths per diagnosed cases varies significantly between countries.\n\nThe virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking. While these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces, up to 72 hours on some It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.\n\nRecommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews and stay-at-home orders, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. \n\n","3132bffa":"# Worst Case Senario\n\nWhen people dont care that they are sick no hygene no doctors and not even a bit of isolation between different class of people \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\n**A person meets and infects maximum 10 people a day constantly and initial population is 1**"}}
