Furthermore, it looks like there is quite a lot of variance in the number of coffees sold on Saturday, whereas days like Tuesday have a much more compact distribution.\n\nMore exploration is needed; there are obvious potentially-confounding variables still at play. For example, Edinburgh is quite tourism-heavy, so there could simply be a much larger number of patrons on the weekend. Viewing the data normalizing by total number of transactions may be the logical next step. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nMore visualizations to come! Please leave any thoughts you have thus far!","fbfd9ac8":"# Do We Drink More Coffee During the Week?\n\nHere's a fun little analysis of  data from a bakery called \"The Bread Basket\", which is located in the historic center of Edinburgh. Of course, this data is from one local in Scotland, so clearly cannot truly be generalized, but still fun to look at nonetheless. My assumption looking at this data is that we tend to drink more coffee on weekdays to power us through the work day.\n\nThis is a work in progress! Please upvote and leave a comment with what you'd like to see next, or questions about what I have done so far.","fb0db1d3":"## Import and Clean Data\n\nWill use pandas to import the data, retain only coffee transactions, group by date, and add a \"day of week\" variable."}}
