It is important to understand which aspects of the service influence a customer's decision in this regard. Management can concentrate efforts on improvement of service, keeping in mind these priorities.\n\n### Data Description :\n\nThe case study is from an open-source dataset from Kaggle.The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features such as CustomerId, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance etc.<br>\n\nLink to the Kaggle project site:https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/barelydedicated\/bank-customer-churn-modelingPoints \n\n### Marks Distribution:\nThe points distribution for this case is as follows:\n1. Read the dataset\n2. Drop the columns which are unique for all users like IDs \n3. Distinguish the feature and target set \n4. Divide the data set into trainingand test sets \n5. Normalize the train and test data\n6. Initialize & build the model. Identify the points of improvement and implement the same the same.\n7. Predict the results using 0.5 as a threshold \n8.
