One such method is [Principal Component Analysis (PCA).](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Principal_component_analysis)\n\nThe objective of the PCA is to summarize the data through components that best explain its variance. It is important to note that in performing such a procedure, some of the information contained will certainly be lost. For data visualization, PCA is useful since most of the information can be explained by 2 or 3 dimensions.","8bfe3313":"Considering the example of Iris flowers, the Principal Component Analysis can explain, in only 2 dimensions, more than 97% of the information in the original data set, which has 4 variables.\n\nAfter performing the analysis, we have as a result the chart below. It shows the dispersion of the data in 2 dimensions and can be understood as an aggregation of the previous set of graphs, which greatly facilitates the interpretation.","97d5a56d":"In this way we can, even more clearly, verify the existence of different patterns for each type of flower.\n\nIn addition to being a powerful resource for exploratory visualizations, dimensionality reduction methods are also often used in the phase known as Feature Engineering, but this subject deserves a separate article.\n\nThank you!","481c2ce4":"The problem is that virtually no real problem can be explained well in up to 3 variables. In this case, a common procedure is generation of paired charts.\n\nConsidering the famous Iris data set, we would have:","8d682ec4":"### How to view data sets with more than 3 dimensions\n\nVisualization is one of the most important tasks during the exploratory analysis of any set of data. In general, we should not limit our interpretations to descriptive statistics.\n\nFJ Anscombe has proven this by showing 4 sets of data that, despite having virtually identical averages, variances and correlations, are totally different:\n\n![](https:\/\/media.licdn.com\/dms\/image\/C4E12AQFS1wg6hiH14Q\/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232\/0?e=1543449600&v=beta&t=K9KQZLY4MUBEbzugqEsisOLQh5A9ZsBAOJNIN0z5CI0)\n\nThese sets, shown in the figure above, became known as the [Anscombe Quartet](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anscombe%27s_quartet). Other similar examples (a little more curious) can be seen [here](https:\/\/www.autodeskresearch.com\/publications\/samestats).\n\nIf on the one hand the visualization facilitates interpretation, on the other hand it is limited in relation to the number of dimensions. It is a fact that we, humans, can not see more than three dimensions.\n"}}
