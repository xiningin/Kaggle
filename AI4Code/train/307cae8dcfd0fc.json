Note that I don't mean that they should be purely added, but that they are an indicator of confidence in these measurements. They are based on Poisson statistics (more details of how these values are calculated here: https:\/\/daslab.stanford.edu\/site_data\/pub_pdf\/2014_Seetin_MIMB.pdf)\n\n> Large errors can signify multiple things, but most likely that at that given position, there probably were not enough sequencing reads to give a very confident measurement. ]\n\n\nLet's have a look at those columns!","838a5107":"Quite a lot of spikes and very large ones too!
