Perhaps we can encourage more buying if we promote the product as *the* choice option. Clearly state why it is the 'recommeded' product. This might result in higher buying ratio like that for 'Referral'.  \n\n`Social`\n* Has a high portion of the traffic, but a tiny fraction of the purchases.  \n* Mean purchase amount is low, so is the portion of our revenue.  \n* It would be easy to write 'Social' off as worthless. However, this channel presents a unique opportunity! Why is it that our views are not translated into purchases?  \n* I reccomend the marketing team takes advantage of this huge traffic stream and focus on converting these views to purchases! This will require some in-depth research.\n\n`Direct`\n* 3rd highest traffic share, 3rd highest purchase share.  \n* The mean purchase amount is high, and this generates the 2nd most of our revenue.  \n* This is an important channel! I think some users save the URL and come back later to buy. How they see the URL before saving is most likely after an Organic Search, Social, or Referral, respectively. But we canot know for sure. The only thing we can do is as I recommended for 'Organic Search'. Promote the product as *the* choice.\n\n`Referral`\n* Has a fairly sizeable portion of the traffic, but a disproportionally large portion of purchases!  \n* Mean purchase amount is not particularly high, but this is where most of our revenue comes from currently.  \n* When a user is on some starting website and that site refers them to some product, then the user probably feels like the authors of the starting website has done the research and narrowing down of options on their behalf, and that they can trust their reccomendation. This explains the high purchase ratio.  \n* Referrals are arguably the most important for the company right now. Focus on promoting the products to authors of websites!!!\n\n`Display`\n* Has a small traffic share, and a small number of purchases.  \n* The mean purchase amount is, however, very high!!! Only due to the small number of visitors is the share of our revenue low.  \n* Here is another excellent opportunity for the marketing team! The Display channel certainly encourages users to spend highly. Perhaps the alure of the visual banner is enticing enough to convince users to spend highly?  \n* I reccomend increasing the number of these advertisements! Specifically target demohraphics that are likely to spend big! We will discover who these demograhics are later...\n\n`Paid Search`, `Affiliates`, and `Other`\n* These have low traffic share, and low number of our purchases.  \n* Their mean purchase and share of our revenue are likewise not very high.  \n* Im not sure that these are worhtwhile to expand on.

When someone clicks on a hyperlink to go to a new page on a different website, Analytics tracks the click as a referral visit to the second site.  \n* 'Paid search' marketing means you advertise within the sponsored listings of a search engine or a partner site.  \n* 'Affiliate' marketing is a marketing arrangement by which an online retailer pays commission to an external website for traffic or sales generated from its referrals.  \n* 'Direct' traffic is most often the result of a user entering a URL into their browser or using a bookmark to directly access the site. Essentially, Direct sessions occur any time Google Analytics cannot determine another referring source or channel.  \n* Display marketing channel can be made up of any number of traffic sources as long as the medium of the traffic sources is 'display', 'cpm' or 'banner' and 'Ad Distribution Network' matches 'content'.  \n* 'Social' marketing channel can be made up of any number of traffic sources as long as the medium of the traffic sources is 'social', 'social media', 'social-media', 'social network', or 'social-network'.  \n* Other: anything else.  \n \n\nNow lets Visualize:","6f982ec6":"We can use `make_countsum` to numerize this feature.\n\n### 7.18.4. hits_page.pagePathLevel2\nSTRING \tThis dimension rolls up all the page paths in the 2nd hierarchical level in pagePath.","92be70b8":"The hypothesis was correct.

These are the larger operating systems.  \n`Windows` users are the most frequent, and therefore it makes sense that they have the 2nd most purchases. They also have the 2nd highest mean purchase amount, and make 2nd most of our revenue. These users have potential - if marketing can convince a higher proportion of these users to purchase, then their contribution will almost certainly rival that of the Mac users.  \n`Macintosh` users are 2nd most frequent visitors, but dominate in purchases. They have the 3rd highest mean purchase amounts, and therefore are the primary source of our income. This is an important demographic! If marketing can manage to increase their mean purchase even slightly, this will result in massive earnings!  \n`Android` users are the 3rd highest count of visitors, but are unlikely to purchase. Their mean purchase is 4th highest, but due to low number of purchases they make very little of our revenue. Marketing needs to find a way to encourage a higher fraction of purchases to go through. Andoid users need to be supported, as they could otherwise have made a significant share of our income.  \n`iOS`: Similar to Android, they have a fairly large share of visitors, but the number of purchases are relatively small. Their mean purchase amount is only 6th highest, which all leads to a tiny share on our revenue. This is a difficult situation, because we need to encourage more purchases, but also higher mean spending amount. Perhaps special products could be designed for these users, but I doubt that the investment to do that will translate to significantly higher revenue generated.  \n`Linux` users are a small number, but they make 4th most of our sales. They also have 4th highest mean purchase amounts. Due to the small number of visitors, their revenue share is very small. Perhaps more Linux users need to be encouraged to visit the store.  \n`Chrome OS` is an interesting one! The number of users are small, but they are 3rd highest in number of sales! Their mean purchase amount is also the highest overall! They are, inceredibly, 3rd highest revenue generators. It is only due to their small number that they do not have a significantly higher revenue share. Chrome is part of Google, so it should not be too surprising that they are relevent in Google Store (GStore). Here, marketing should focus on promoting Chrome OS as a product. The technical team should maintiain excellent support for these users. If the number of users grow due to great technical support, then it would translate to a significant boost in income for GStore.  \n**All others**: Other OSs have an almost insignificant share of visitors, and therefore of sales.

India, the UK, Canada, *etc* have potential to become a significant source of revenue.  \n\nLets take a look at all countries now to see which to target for converting visits into purchases.

In fact the number of purchases from other continents are surprisingly small!\n* Aside from the Americas, the estimate for mean purchase amount is probably not very reliable.\n* Africa has an enormous mean purchase amount. Keep in mind however, that there were only 8 sales in Africa. A single high spender may have caused the mean purchase amout to inflate to this extent.\n* Since the Americas are the vast majority of our sales numbers, they also contribute to nearly the entirety of our revenue.  \nMarketting should focus on converting European and Asian visits into purchases. This is currently a lost opportunity for revenue generation.

This can occur due to the tiny number of sales in these regions.  \nThe reccomendations are similar to before: subcontinents other than northern america need to be encouraged to purchase. Their respectable visitor numbers are not being utilized!  \nIt looks like we can again make a binary variable, where all categories except 'Northern America' can be grouped together.\n\n# 6.6. geoNetwork_country\nSTRING \tThe country from which sessions originated, based on IP address.  \nPerhaps subContinent is still too vague.
