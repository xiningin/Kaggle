While it is fairly easy to measure correlations between series - when one goes up the other goes up, and vice versa - it's another thing to observe changes in one series correlated to changes in another after a consistent amount of time. This <em>may<\/em> indicate the presence of causality, that changes in the first series influenced the behavior of the second. However, it may also be that both series are affected by some third factor, just at different rates. Still, it can be useful if changes in one series can predict upcoming changes in another, whether there is causality or not. In this case we say that one series \"Granger-causes\" another.","931e1e5b":"> We can clearly see that trend is increasing day by day, One thing to notice here is trend is exponential and thus Exponential smoothing using Holt Winters method can be a good model to match the trend.

These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.\nYou can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.\n\n### To prevent the spread of COVID-19:\n\n* Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.\n\n* Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n\n* Don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.\n\n* Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.\n\n* Stay home if you feel unwell.\n\n* If you have a fever, a cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance.\n\n* Follow the directions of your local health authority.\n\n**Avoiding unneeded visits to medical facilities allows healthcare systems to operate more effectively, therefore protecting you and others.**"}}
