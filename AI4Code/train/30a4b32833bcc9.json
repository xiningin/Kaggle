decreasing?\n\nAs we see in the graphs below, the number of incest rape victims going down but the number of other rape victims is growing every year, and that makes us afraid about what will happen in the future, Is these numbers will stay growing or what?","5f5f9f7f":"# Rape victims in each state \n\nhere before we look to each state and its groups of victims we want to see the number of rape victims in the 2 groups.\n\nbetween 2000-2010 there is 190K reported cases to police, most of these reported cases were in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra.\n\nand in Lakshadweep, Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Puducherry, we saw low victims number, that is meaning in these states we have aware communities of the rape harm on women, not likes the other cites that have large victims of rape because reasons we don't know, maybe the high population and non-education in these states, or poverty, Actually, we can't know the real reasons of these high numbers until we do a careful study about these communities.\n","ab0e73ad":"# **Rape victims in India between 2000-2010**\n![](https:\/\/static.dw.com\/image\/51558912_303.jpg)\n\n#Introduction\n\nIn this notebook, we use the CSV file from the big data set on crimes in India.\n\nIn this CSV file, we have information about rape victims in India between 2000-2010,  here rape victims separated into 2 groups, incest victims rape, and other victims of rape.\n\nthere is information about every state in India on the same dates and their rape victims, their groups, and their age.\n\n\n","5f9156d0":"# Victims of incest rape\n\nNow we want to look at incest rape victims, there is 4219 cases reported to police between 2000-2010, most of these reported cases were in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and in Arunachal Pradesh, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Dahman & Diu, we don't have any reported incest rape case for these 10 years between 2000-2010.\n\nfinally nice numbers of incest rape victims above 50 years near 0 in each state, only in some states we have few cases 5 - 8 cases in 10 years.\n\nBadly, when we go to see the number of incest rape victims, the numbers start going high, as we see in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh there are about 200 victims in the last 10 years, also the total number of victims is 513.\n\nAlso, we move to the other age category from 14-18 years, the numbers are heigher than the past categories, the total number of victims there is 1042, just in Madhya Pradesh we have about 270 victims.\n\nNow we move to the other age category from 18-30 years, numbers are going higher and higher about 1882 victims in these ages, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh still in the lead in each category.\n\nnicely, when we move to the penultimate category the numbers start back down again, the total number of incest rape victims is 517 in these 10 years.\n\nthe last age category victims up to 10 years, it's the second place for the lowest number of victims.\n\nbadly, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh still in the lead in each age category in incest rape victims, Are they will still in the lead in the other rape victims?\n\nWe will see now if they will still in the lead or not.\n\n\n","65fcc929":"# Goodbye\n\nfinally, we finished our notebook about rape victims in India between 2000-2010, we saw there are states that have huge numbers than others in rape victims and this number is growing every year if the friends in India didn't do anything, that means it will be a disaster.\n\nThe woman is half of the community, and we have to respect them and save them, they are our mums, sisters, daughter and our wives, we don't have to accept these things for them, everyone in India has to move to change this situation, we have to save our women in India and in every country around the world.\n\nBefore we say goodbye, I'm wishing good health for everyone in India these days because we hear that the number of deaths of covid-19 in India it's fast-growing, may God protect and save our friends in India.\n\nGoodbye friends.","4e492b74":"# Victims of other rape\n\nNow we move to the other group of rape victims, the total number of rape cases that reported to police is about 185K between 2000-2010, badly Madhya Pradesh still in the lead with West Bengal, Chhattisgarh fall back few places but it still has high rape victims.\n\nThe states that we mentioned before as no incest rape victims, now take different places in other rape victims Lakshadweep and Daman & Diu still have lowest numbers than others, but the other states in this situation take different numbers.\n\nNow let's look at each age category, first victims above 50 years, badly, we have here numbers Madhya Pradesh still in the lead and Chhattisgarh back on top after Madhya Pradesh, the total number of this category victims is 954.\n\nSadly, numbers in the other age category from 10-14 years it has grown exponentially, we have about 12K victims, most of these victims in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, Lakshadweep recorded 0 victims in this category in these 10 years between 2000-2010.\n\nNow we move to other categories from 14-18 years, also numbers there is grown fast than before, we have about 27K victims between 2000-2010 distributors on 36 states, Madhya Pradesh still in the lead with Maharashtra, also here Lakshadweep recorded 0 victims in these 10 years.\n\n The other age category from 18-30 years, numbers here are horrible about 110K victims between 2000-2010, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal in the lead, Chhattisgarh takes far place now, Lakshadweep recorded 5 victims in these 10 years but it hasn't the lowest numbers of victims, Daman & Diu recorded 3 victims in these 10 years and that put it in the last of this list.\n\nPenultimate age category from 30-50 years, numbers there going down to 31K victims between 2000-2010, Madhya Pradesh didn't let anyone take their place in the two groups and in every age category it's also still in the lead therewith Assam, Lakshadweep recorded 2 victims between 2000-2010, but also there it's not in the last of this list, Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli recorded 1 victim in these 10 years. \n\nNow we almost finish this notebook, there are just a few things I want to talk about, but before we go to the other section, as we saw here and in the past section, there are some states that stayed in the last of our list in each category and each group, also there are some states still in the lead in each section like Madhya Pradesh, that's mean there is something make these states have low numbers of rape victims and these states have high numbers, I suggest to make an accurate survey on these states and try to know why these states are better than others."}}
