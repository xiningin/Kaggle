It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.\n\n        Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\n\n**Python is Interpreted\u2212** Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\n\n**Python is Interactive** \u2212 You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\n\n**Python is Object-Oriented** \u2212 Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\n\n**Python is a Beginner's Language** \u2212 Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games."}}
