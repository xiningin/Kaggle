Secondly, we are seeing that injured player has higher directional and orientation changes compared to non-injured players in natural turf and slightly in synthetic turf. \n\nConclusion: We are seeing a high mean in direction, orientation changes. But we are not seeing any difference in different surface.","989c326c":"# Proposal for reducing injuries based on our findings\nNow we saw surface, environment and movement contributions in injuries. But how do we solve this problem and reduce injuries?\n\nWe have to follow what FIFA has done. FIFA created a very important program called 'FIFA Quality Program' where they use some criteria to identify different materials for the game. One of them is FIFA quality turf. NFL is one of the top organization for American football. Because American football is vastly different from soccer, we have to make our own 'NFL Quality Standard Program'. Where the NFL can use criteria for identifying turf that does not contribute to injury rather, it helps reduce the risk of injuries.\n\n* **Proposal 1**: Improve field response mechanism for artificial Turf. \"Artificial turf is a harder surface than grass and does not have much \"give\" when forces are placed on it\" [1]. We have to solve this problem. We have to make our artificial turf that mimics the natural grass. Because when players toys are bend or stressed during play and the turf doesn't help in that situation then player got injured in toy or ankle. \n\n* **Proposal 2**: Make artificial turf relief heat of the sun or in general. Because we saw a high temperature contributes to injuries. And artificial turf tends to retain heat compared to natural turf. \n\n* **Proposal 3**: American football is very tense and high contact game. Often player needs to move fast in any direction, jump and stop or tackle the player with high speed. For that high acceleration, speed and velocity are essential. But we saw in our analysis that in most injury play the acceleration and other movement metrics is high. But synthetic turf surfaces do not release cleats as readily as natural turf. For not releasing cleats like natural turf, players got injured. We have two ways to solve that problem.\n\n    1. Improve field rubber and traction mechanism: We have to improve our field rubber and silicon and other variables for making easy releasing cleats and also we have to make sure it doesn't produce more friction or force that cause problems in player movement. \n    \n    2. Use shoes that are exclusively built for synthetic turf: While many cleats manufactured today for football can be used on artificial turf or natural surfaces, many moulded cleats are designed and better served for use on artificial turf. The moulded cleats tend to provide better traction on artificial surfaces, whereas detachable studs on cleats tend to be too thick for artificial turf and do not provide adequate grip on such a surface [2].\n    \n    \n    \n* **Proposal 4**: One of the best benefits about artificial turf is that it needs less maintenance and most of the time it surfaces are plain and in rain, it doesn't have any decay or any other effect. In natural turf, the surface easily got problem after each game and in rain, the surface got a massive problem. One of the problems is not a plain surface. We saw in our analysis that heel and foot have mostly occurred in natural turf. \n\n  And from research [1] we know that foot and heel injuries occurred mostly because of uneven surface. So we have to make sure that natural turf that in each game and in-between game we have to repair natural turf. These will mostly reduce heel and foot injuries. **But we have to use real-time field analysis camera that uses machine learning to assess field condition. This way the NFL can make sure that field condition is good in the game. **\n  \n\n* **Proposal 5**: One of the important things we found in our analysis is that most of the injuries happened in the player first 10 games. Secondly, we found that for injuries player has less experience with the injured surface, field and play type compared to the non-injured player. For that reason, we can say that player having less experience in playing surface, the environment is one of the main causes of injury. To solve this problem, we have two ways. \n\n    1. Assess player fitness and FM score: We have seen that 72% of the injuries happened during the first 10 games of each player. So to solve this problem we have to inform players, teams, coaches and teams about this information. And advice them to make sure to assess player fitness and functional movement score before games. \n    \n    Also, we found that most of the injured player's previous game field is different. So coaches should make sure that player got enough practice on the field that he is going to play. ","464c9d61":"# Mean acceleration, speed, distance, direction, orientation, directional changes and orientation changes","56ca67d3":"# Main findings and results \n* **Result 1**: Previously we know, Synthetic turf has significantly higher injury rates on synthetic turf compared with natural turf (Mack et al., 2018; Loughran et al., 2019). Now we found that Toes and Ankle injuries are higher in synthetic turf compared to natural turf. Heel and foot injuries are higher in natural turf compared to synthetic turf. \n\n* **Result 2**: Temperature in injury play is higher compared to non-injury play. That means higher temperature contributes to injuries. Also, we found that most of the injuries happened in the outdoor stadium. \n\n* **Result 3**: 72% of injuries happened during the first 10 games of individual players. This is one of the important findings. Because this will help players, team, coach and supervisor to take previous necessary steps to reduce injury. We also found that the field that player got injured, in 55% injuries the field type is different from the immediate previous game. And goes up to 63% in synthetic turf. \n\n* **Result 3**: We have created several movement metrics for identifying injury risk in player movement. All of these metrics results are \n    1. **Numer of Declaration, acceleration, no acceleration\/deceleration in last 20 seconds**: We have noted that all these metrics slightly higher in the injured players but we don't find any significant differences in different surface condition. But we found that the number of declaration and acceleration are higher in synthetic turf. \n    2. **Mean acceleration, speed, distance, direction, orientation, directional changes and orientation changes**: We found injured players have higher mean direction, orientation, directional changes and orientational changes compared to the non-injured players. But we don't find significant differences in a different field. \n    3. **Max acceleration, speed, distance, direction, orientation, directional changes and orientation changes**: Among all these metrics, we found one metrics are useful. That is max-acceleration. We found that max acceleration is higher in injured player compared to the non-injured players and we found that max acceleration is very high in synthetic turf compared to natural turf.
