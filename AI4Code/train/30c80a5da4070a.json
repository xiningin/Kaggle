It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.Prophet is open source software released by Facebook\u2019s Core Data Science team. It is available for download on CRAN and PyPI.\nfor more https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/","6176ccf4":"#Download data","d14c13c9":"#Read csv file","5e0608ed":"# Forcasting","bee6b40a":"#Rename\n","5ced950c":"#Import","dab53d5b":"#Plot forcast data","faafc1c7":"## Voilin plot (give us probablity density of data )","0a22cdac":"# visualisation","932715f5":"# Modelling"}}
