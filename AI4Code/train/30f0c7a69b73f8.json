There are many higher-level libraries you could use instead, for example `sklearn` or `statsmodels`.  ","e64dbe84":"### Setup training data\nFirst let's read in our training data.  Kernels do not yet support enough memory to load the whole dataset at once, at least using `pd.read_csv`.  The entire dataset is about 55M rows, so we're skipping a good portion of the data, but it's certainly possible to build a model using all the data.","8cf7b494":"### Train our model\nOur model will take the form $X \\cdot w = y$ where $X$ is a matrix of input features, and $y$ is a column of the target variable, `fare_amount`, for each row. The weight column $w$ is what we will \"learn\".\n\nFirst let's setup our input matrix $X$ and target column $y$ from our training set.  The matrix $X$ should consist of the two GPS coordinate differences, plus a third term of 1 to allow the model to learn a constant bias term.  The column $y$ should consist of the target `fare_amount` values.","00eb7ef0":"We expect most of these values to be very small (likely between 0 and 1) since it should all be differences between GPS coordinates within one city.  For reference, one degree of latitude is about 69 miles.  However, we can see the dataset has extreme values which do not make sense.  Let's remove those values from our training set. Based on the scatterplot, it looks like we can safely exclude values above 5 (though remember the scatterplot is only showing the first 2000 rows...)","6694a357":"Now let's quickly plot a subset of our travel vector features to see its distribution.","f415ec79":"Special thanks to Dan Becker, Will Cukierski, and Julia Elliot for reviewing this Kernel and providing suggestions!","8d08662a":"## Ideas for Improvement\nThe output here will score an RMSE of $5.74, but you can do better than that!  Here are some suggestions:\n\n* Use more columns from the input data.  Here we're only using the start\/end GPS points from columns `[pickup|dropoff]_[latitude|longitude]`.  Try to see if the other columns -- `pickup_datetime` and `passenger_count` -- can help improve your results.\n* Use absolute location data rather than relative.  Here we're only looking at the difference between the start and end points, but maybe the actual values -- indicating where in NYC the taxi is traveling -- would be useful.\n* Use a non-linear model to capture more intricacies within the data.\n* Try to find more outliers to prune, or construct useful feature crosses.\n* Use the entire dataset -- here we're only using about 20% of the training data!"}}
