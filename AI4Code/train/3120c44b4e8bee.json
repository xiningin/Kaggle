The acquired startups had the highest amount of investments and the startups that closed had the least. \n> What I'm thinking:\n* My analysis might be completely wrong.\n* But if it is not, I have a theory why. The startup culture in general is getting to a point where all they focus on is raising the next round of funding instead of servings its customers properly, mainly because the investors want them to keep spending their investments by getting multiple offices and huge team. I think its because even if the startup fails it would acquied by some other company since it has a lot of assets,therefore the investors win anyway. So the companies that get acquired usually have a huge amount investment.\n* **Thats just what i think... let me know what you think in the comments below.**","cfc48bdb":"### Does more money equal more suceess?","c76a9d1f":"#### Just some calculation to figure out the funding duration of each startup","6a0c2b0e":"### Should a startup raise money fast or slow?","83dac36a":"### Startups that take grants, are they all sucessfull?\n\nDefinition: Startup grants consist of a sum of money that groups offer to small companies and nonprofits to help them with their work. Grants aren't like loans. Organizations don't have to put up collateral or pay late fees or interest. In fact, organizations don't have to pay back grants at all\n\n>What I'm thinking: \n* Well 92% of them are still operating and only 2.5% of them closed. So I think its safe to say they are mostly successfull.\n* Grants by their very own definition are usually given to highly promising startups so this was sort of predictable i guess.","0dca533e":"**Thats all folks.
