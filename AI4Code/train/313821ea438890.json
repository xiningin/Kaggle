Though it is more evident in time series data.\n\n#### In plain terms autocorrelation takes place when there's a pattern in the rows of the data. This is usual in time series data as there is a pattern of time for eg. Week of the day effect which is a very famous pattern seen in stock markets where people tend to buy stocks more towards the beginning of weekends and tend to sell more on Mondays.

A linear model might not be able to *efficiently* explain the data in terms of variability, prediction accuracy etc. \n\nA tip is to remember to always see the plots from where the dependent variable is on the y axis.
