The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975.[1][2] It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's \"Ask Marilyn\" column in Parade magazine in 1990:[3]\n> \n> *Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?*\n\nThe right choice would be to switch door.\n\nIn this notebook we show this by simulating 1 000 000 cases and show how many times you win if you choose to switch or stay"}}
