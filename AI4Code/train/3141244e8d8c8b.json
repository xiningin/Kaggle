Male literacy rate in Bangalore district of Karnataka is 91.01 percent. Female literacy rate in Bangalore district of Karnataka is 84.01 percent which is amazing.\n- This massive difference can also be due to the social media effect where people want showoff the good places they go and share their experience.","3aaf0682":"## Introduction","3a148bb0":"##  Hope you guys liked the efforts and insights.
