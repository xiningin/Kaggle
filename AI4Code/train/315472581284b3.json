Linear relationships can be expressed either in a graphical format where the variable and the constant are connected via a straight line or in a mathematical format where the independent variable is multiplied by the slope coefficient, added by a constant, which determines the dependent variable.","055c8db4":"# Intermediate Seaborn\n\n### I will use seaborn library and dataset for this project.","87ef2603":"source : https:\/\/lytongblog.wordpress.com\/2018\/12\/21\/correlation-between-two-variables\/","f0933171":"source: https:\/\/mode.com\/blog\/violin-plot-examples\/","79429a7a":"**Let's look closely at the variables.**","053ffc9e":"![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/552\/1*2c21SkzJMf3frPXPAR_gZA.png)","05029f48":"source: https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/understanding-boxplots-5e2df7bcbd51","19b5b0c0":"<img src=\"\/\/images.ctfassets.net\/fi0zmnwlsnja\/sdfgtcRp16wTNOcRceGQm\/5bfcb73d2261d49ff20dd7857e0152b1\/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_11.36.10_AM.png\" width=\"400px\">"}}
