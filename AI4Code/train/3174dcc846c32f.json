This approach is indeed similar to human learning under the supervision of a teacher. The teacher provides good examples for the student to memorize, and the student then derives general rules from these specific examples.\nModels are fit on training data comprised of inputs and outputs and used to make predictions on test sets where only the inputs are provided and the outputs from the model are compared to the withheld target variables and used to estimate the skill of the model.\n\n**Unsupervised Learning**\nWhereas when an algorithm learns from plain examples without any associated response, leaving to the algorithm to determine the data patterns on its own. This type of algorithm tends to restructure the data into something else, such as new features that may represent a class or a new series of un-correlated values. They are quite useful in providing humans with insights into the meaning of data and new useful inputs to supervised machine learning algorithms. \nAs a kind of learning, it resembles the methods humans use to figure out that certain objects or events are from the same class, such as by observing the degree of similarity between objects. Some recommendation systems that you find on the web in the form of marketing automation are based on this type of learning.\nCompared to supervised learning, unsupervised learning operates upon only the input data without outputs or target variables. As such, unsupervised learning does not have a teacher correcting the model, as in the case of supervised learning.\n\n**Reinforcement Learning**\nWhen you present the algorithm with examples that lack labels, as in unsupervised learning. However, you can accompany an example with positive or negative feedback according to the solution the algorithm proposes comes under the category of Reinforcement learning, which is connected to applications for which the algorithm must make decisions (so the product is prescriptive, not just descriptive, as in unsupervised learning), and the decisions bear consequences. In the human world, it is just like learning by trial and error. \nErrors help you learn because they have a penalty added (cost, loss of time, regret, pain, and so on), teaching you that a certain course of action is less likely to succeed than others. An interesting example of reinforcement learning occurs when computers learn to play video games by themselves. \nIn this case, an application presents the algorithm with examples of specific situations, such as having the gamer stuck in a maze while avoiding an enemy. The application lets the algorithm know the outcome of actions it takes, and learning occurs while trying to avoid what it discovers to be dangerous and to pursue survival. You can have a look at how the company Google DeepMind has created a reinforcement learning program that plays old Atari\u2019s video games. When watching the video, notice how the program is initially clumsy and unskilled but steadily improves with training until it becomes a champion.\nReinforcement learning describes a class of problems where an agent operates in an environment and must learn to operate using feedback. The use of an environment means that there is no fixed training dataset, rather a goal or set of goals that an agent is required to achieve, actions they may perform, and feedback about performance toward the goal.","32bf0d2e":"# Machine Learning","b0f3c58e":"![](https:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/wiki\/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx\/__key\/communityserver-wikis-components-files\/00-00-00-00-05\/7002.5_5F00_1.PNG)","f90d1e06":"# Overview of the Machine Learning Process","0d5f87d7":"**What are we going to do in this series of Learning?**\n\nWe will be focusing on Supervised Learning.","31835539":"![](https:\/\/englishlive.ef.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2018\/09\/Finding-the-Correct-Question-Words-e1577042882901.jpg)","5868c972":"Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process for doing data mining.

This is a very costly process, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. The most basic disadvantage of any Unsupervised Learning is that it\u2019s application spectrum is limited. \n\nTo counter these disadvantages, the concept of Semi-Supervised Learning was introduced. In this type of learning, the algorithm is trained upon a combination of labeled and unlabelled data. Typically, this combination will contain a very small amount of labeled data and a very large amount of unlabelled data. The basic procedure involved is that first, the programmer will cluster similar data using an unsupervised learning algorithm and then use the existing labeled data to label the rest of the unlabelled data. The typical use cases of such type of algorithm have a common property among them \u2013 The acquisition of unlabelled data is relatively cheap while labeling the said data is very expensive.
