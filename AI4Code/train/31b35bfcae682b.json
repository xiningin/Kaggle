I will also create another dataset using only 5 components that make up to the 76% variability as can be seen below:","40e5cb96":"Let's create a copy of the data that remains unchanged with the pre-procecssing:","a03caf05":"From the heatmap, it can be seen that there are some features that are highly correlated (shown in dark red for positive correlation and dark blue for negative correlation), with each other and cannot be considered as indipendent variables that we need for modeling. The features with white or very light colors however, can be condidered as indipendent. Let's examine some of the examples of correlated features below:","68fa30a4":"Here the DBSCAN has found 95 outliers which is about 4.89% of our dataset which is acceptable as we should remain under 5% when detecting the outliers. This is not the optimal output that was expected, as it wasn't possible to detect more clusters and there was always too many observations considered as outliers.\n\nAs there aren't any other information to decide about the outliers I will simply drop the outliers from the dataset:","4a18f83d":"Let's read the dataset and look inside:","c13783be":"As it can be seen in the plots, there are many outliers, including some very extreme ones that would reduce the performance of the models. As in the data documentations they aren't enough information on the features and expert knowledge cannot not be accessed at the current time, it is not possible to examine the outliers to decide which ones can be removed. In the following, I will use DBSCAN as a method to remove the outliers in a more automatic way:","9043dca0":"## Feature Skewness\n\nWhen we talk about normality what we mean is that the data should look like a normal distribution. This is important because several statistic tests rely on this (e.g. t-statistics).\n\nIf the dataset is skewed, then the Machine Learning model wouldn\u2019t be able to do a good job on predictions. To resolve the issue of the skewed features we can apply the a log transform of the same data, or to use the Box-Cox Transformation. Let's see how skewed are our numerical features:"}}
