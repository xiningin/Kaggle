I, myself, have been through all those tasks, especially the pesky errors of a library not being included in the project. \n\nThis brought out a thought of finding a way to get all of the libraries imported in one go. After a lot of scouring of the web, I found this library which does it all, yet, it lacked a little bit of documentation and details about which all libraries had been imported. With this, I intend to make a note about all the libraries present in the library. \n\nThis is basically to unify the experience one might go through while locating this library\/ importing all of the libraries when an error throws up. \n\n","b84040c7":"### Machine Learning\n- Sklearn - **sklearn**\n- OneHotEncoder - **OneHotEncoder**\n\n(All the other libraries can be added to the library for further use)\n\n### Deep Learning\n\n- TensorFlow - **tf**\n- Keras - **keras**\n\n### NLP\n\n- NLTK - **nltk**\n- Gensim - **gensim**\n- Spacy - **spacy**\n\n### Helper libraries:\n- Sys - **sys**\n- Os - **os**\n- re - **re**\n- glob - **glob**\n- Path - **Path**\n- Pickle - **pickle**\n- DateTime - **dt**\n- TQDM - **tqdm**\n","cd998867":"The library can be found at: [https:\/\/github.com\/8080labs\/pyforest]()","f9fd47b1":"### Installation:","4d8f8322":"#### Pandas Profiling\n","cbe9c96a":"### Legend: \n Name - **Call**","537fd4a3":"## List of libraries in the Pyforest library and their calls: ","bc6644be":"This feature of the library gives an insight to all the libraries imported currently. \nPyforest uses the method of _Lazy Imports_, which signifies that a library is _only_ imported when is has been called into use. \n\n\nLazyImport Example: \n\n- As this library removes the use of _import pandas as pd_ {Or any other library}, the pandas library can directly be called with the _pd_ name. \n- When pd is used once in the program, the Pyforest library calls the _Pandas_ library from itself and imports it automatically. \n\nThis signifies, that during the beginning of the program, the active_imports() would be an empty list. \nAs soon as any other function\/library is used, the library associated with it would import itself within the program.
