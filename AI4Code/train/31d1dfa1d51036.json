Syntactic Ambiguity\nExample:- Teacher strikes idle kids.\n        Machine Interpretation :- Teacher strikes + idle(verb) + kids   ( teacher striking makes kids idle)\n        Human Interpretation :- Teacher  +strikes + idle kids           ( teacher strikes idle kids)\n        \n2. Ambiguity is pervasive. Phrase structure and dependency structure between words make different interpretations. More and more ambiguity.\n\n3. Segmenatation issues , idioms , new words that has never seen before and many more","da288199":"**Word tokenization and Normalization**\n* Lemma :- same stem , part of speech , rough word sense Example :- Cat and cats same lemma but differnt word forms ( the full inflected surface form)","17fd1ad8":"**Regular Expressions**\nIt is a formal language to specifying text strings.\n1. Disjunctions  :- [A-Z] Any letter between this range , [ !] will match all non- alphanumeric alphabets.\n2.
