Transfer learning, particularly models like Allen AI's ELMO, OpenAI's Open-GPT, and Google's BERT allowed researchers to smash multiple benchmarks with minimal task-specific fine-tuning and provided the rest of the NLP community with pretrained models that could easily (with less data and less compute time) be fine-tuned and implemented to produce state of the art results. Unfortunately, for many starting out in NLP and even for some experienced practicioners, the theory and practical application of these powerful models is still not well understood.\n\n### What is BERT?\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), released in late 2018, is the model we will use in this tutorial to provide readers with a better understanding of and practical guidance for using transfer learning models in NLP. BERT is a method of pretraining language representations that was used to create models that NLP practicioners can then download and use for free. You can either use these models to extract high quality language features from your text data, or you can fine-tune these models on a specific task (classification, entity recognition, question answering, etc.) with your own data to produce state of the art predictions.\n\nThis post will explain how you can modify and fine-tune BERT to create a powerful NLP model that quickly gives you state of the art results.\n\n### Advantages of Fine-Tuning\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use BERT to train a text classifier. Specifically, we will take the pre-trained BERT model, add an untrained layer of neurons on the end, and train the new model for our classification task. Why do this rather than train a train a specific deep learning model (a CNN, BiLSTM, etc.) that is well suited for the specific NLP task you need?\n\n### Quicker Development\n\nFirst, the pre-trained BERT model weights already encode a lot of information about our language. As a result, it takes much less time to train our fine-tuned model - it is as if we have already trained the bottom layers of our network extensively and only need to gently tune them while using their output as features for our classification task. In fact, the authors recommend only 2-4 epochs of training for fine-tuning BERT on a specific NLP task (compared to the hundreds of GPU hours needed to train the original BERT model or a LSTM from scratch!).\nLess Data\n\nIn addition and perhaps just as important, because of the pre-trained weights this method allows us to fine-tune our task on a much smaller dataset than would be required in a model that is built from scratch. A major drawback of NLP models built from scratch is that we often need a prohibitively large dataset in order to train our network to reasonable accuracy, meaning a lot of time and energy had to be put into dataset creation. By fine-tuning BERT, we are now able to get away with training a model to good performance on a much smaller amount of training data.\nBetter Results\n\nFinally, this simple fine-tuning procedure (typically adding one fully-connected layer on top of BERT and training for a few epochs) was shown to achieve state of the art results with minimal task-specific adjustments for a wide variety of tasks: classification, language inference, semantic similarity, question answering, etc. Rather than implementing custom and sometimes-obscure architetures shown to work well on a specific task, simply fine-tuning BERT is shown to be a better (or at least equal) alternative.","53c6525b":"We'll also create an iterator for our dataset using the torch DataLoader class. This helps save on memory during training because, unlike a for loop, with an iterator the entire dataset does not need to be loaded into memory.","15bddccf":"## Attention Masks\n\nThe attention mask simply makes it explicit which tokens are actual words versus which are padding.\n\nThe BERT vocabulary does not use the ID 0, so if a token ID is 0, then it's padding, and otherwise it's a real token.","b0608acb":"When we actually convert all of our sentences, we'll use the tokenize.encode function to handle both steps, rather than calling tokenize and convert_tokens_to_ids separately.","5237a204":"## Optimizer and Learning Rate Scheduler\n\nNow that we have our model loaded we need to grab the training hyperparameters from within the stored model.\n\nFor the purposes of fine-tuning, the authors recommend choosing from the following values:\n\n* Batch size: 16, 32 (We chose 32 when creating our DataLoaders).\n* Learning rate (Adam): 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5 (We'll use 2e-5).\n* Number of epochs: 2, 3, 4 (We'll use 4).\n* The epsilon parameter eps = 1e-8 is \"a very small number to prevent any division by zero in the implementation\" (from here).\n\nYou can find the creation of the AdamW optimizer in run_glue.py","84003c79":"## Converting to PyTorch Data Types\n\nOur model expects PyTorch tensors rather than numpy.ndarrays, so convert all of our dataset variables.","e386af6c":"## Required Formatting\n\nThe above code left out a few required formatting steps that we'll look at here.\n\nSide Note: The input format to BERT seems \"over-specified\" to me... We are required to give it a number of pieces of information which seem redundant, or like they could easily be inferred from the data without us explicity providing it. But it is what it is, and I suspect it will make more sense once I have a deeper understanding of the BERT internals.\n\nWe are required to:\n\nAdd special tokens to the start and end of each sentence.\nPad & truncate all sentences to a single constant length.\nExplicitly differentiate real tokens from padding tokens with the \"attention mask\".\nSpecial Tokens\n[SEP]\n\nAt the end of every sentence, we need to append the special [SEP] token.\n\nThis token is an artifact of two-sentence tasks, where BERT is given two separate sentences and asked to determine something (e.g., can the answer to the question in sentence A be found in sentence B?).\n\nI am not certain yet why the token is still required when we have only single-sentence input, but it is!\n\n[CLS]\n\nFor classification tasks, we must prepend the special [CLS] token to the beginning of every sentence.\n\nThis token has special significance. BERT consists of 12 Transformer layers. Each transformer takes in a list of token embeddings, and produces the same number of embeddings on the output (but with the feature values changed, of course!).\n\n### Illustration of CLS token purpose\n\nOn the output of the final (12th) transformer, only the first embedding (corresponding to the [CLS] token) is used by the classifier.\n\n\"The first token of every sequence is always a special classification token ([CLS]). The final hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification tasks.\" (from the BERT paper)\n\nI'm not sure why the authors took this strategy instead of some kind of pooling of all the final vectors, but I'm sure that if pooling were better they would have gone that route.\n\nAlso, because BERT is trained to only use this [CLS] token for classification, we know that the model has been motivated to encode everything it needs for the classification step into that single 768-value embedding vector.\n\n### Sentence Length & Attention Mask\n\nThe sentences in our dataset obviously have varying lengths, so how does BERT handle this?\n\nBERT has two constraints:\n\nAll sentences must be padded or truncated to a single, fixed length.\nThe maximum sentence length is 512 tokens.\nPadding is done with a special [PAD] token, which is at index 0 in the BERT vocabulary. The below illustration demonstrates padding out to a \"MAX_LEN\" of 8 tokens.\n\n\n\nThe \"Attention Mask\" is simply an array of 1s and 0s indicating which tokens are padding and which aren't (seems kind of redundant, doesn't it?! Again, I don't currently know why).\n\nI've experimented with running this notebook with two different values of MAX_LEN, and it impacted both the training speed and the test set accuracy.\n\nWith a Tesla K80 and:\n\nMAX_LEN = 128  -->  Training epochs take ~5:28 each, score is 0.535\nMAX_LEN = 64   -->  Training epochs take ~2:57 each, score is 0.566\nThese results suggest to me that the padding tokens aren't simply skipped over--that they are in fact fed through the model and incorporated in the results (thereby impacting both model speed and accuracy). I'll have to dig into the architecture more to understand this.\n\n### Sentences to IDs\n\nThe tokenizer.encode function combines multiple steps for us:\n\n* Split the sentence into tokens.\n* Add the special [CLS] and [SEP] tokens.\n*  Map the tokens to their IDs.\n\nOddly, this function can perform truncating for us, but doesn't handle padding.","8138f5b1":"## Tokenization & Input Formatting\n\nIn this section, we'll transform our dataset into the format that BERT can be trained on.\n\n### BERT Tokenizer\n\nTo feed our text to BERT, it must be split into tokens, and then these tokens must be mapped to their index in the tokenizer vocabulary.\n\nThe tokenization must be performed by the tokenizer included with BERT--the below cell will download this for us. We'll be using the \"uncased\" version here."}}
