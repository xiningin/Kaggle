have a huge impact on the mass population. During early days people began to ingore until it became the pandemic and took a loss of human live. Since the time of its spread many countries tried different strategy to find the vaccination againt it. Now, fortunately we have landed at the time where we have got the vaccination for COVID-19, its just the beginning of the distribution of vaccinations, many countries still have not received the vaccination which we can visualize later on the graph. Anyway the ray of hope against the COVID-19 has begun and all thanks to the countries who put their soul and effort for the development of such a vaccination against COVID-19.
