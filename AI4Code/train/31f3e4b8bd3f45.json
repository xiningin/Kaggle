Mainly, normal distributions can allow for negative random variables while log-normal distributions include all positive variables.\n\nOne of the most common applications where log-normal distributions are used in finance is in the analysis of stock prices. The potential returns of a stock can be graphed in a normal distribution. The prices of the stock however can be graphed in a log-normal distribution. The log-normal distribution curve can therefore be used to help better identify the compound return that the stock can expect to achieve over a period of time.\n\nNote that log-normal distributions are positively skewed with long right tails due to low mean values and high variances in the random variables.","70f0fac4":"Considering the same example that we used in Mean\n\nheight_of_boys = 168,170,165,163,164,168,166,167,164,165,169,163,166,400<br>\ntotal_no_of_boys = 14<br>\nsorted_heights = 163, 163, 164, 164, 165, 165, 166, 166, 167, 168, 168, 169, 170, 400<br>\nSince the length of list is even we have to find out the average of middle elements i.e. 7th and 8th element in this case\n\nMedian = (166+166)\/2<br>\nMedian = 166\n\nHere, even thought there was a outlier (400) still we got our central tendency (median) where maximum of the data are distributed","2b109764":"You might wonder that if Pearson correlation coefficient is giving direction and strength of relationship, then why is it necessary for another correlation coefficient?\n\nThe reason for this is, Pearson correlation coefficient finds the correlation just w.r.t linearity.

In a normal distribution 68% of the results fall within one standard deviation and 95% fall within two standard deviations.\nWhile most people are familiar with a normal distribution, they may not be as familiar with log-normal distribution. A normal distribution can be converted to a log-normal distribution using logarithmic mathematics. That is primarily the basis as log-normal distributions can only come from a normally distributed set of random variables.\n\n\nThere can be a few reasons for using log-normal distributions in conjunction with normal distributions. In general most log-normal distributions are the result of taking the natural log where the base is equal to e=2.718. However, the log-normal distribution can be scaled using a different base which affects the shape of the lognormal distribution.\n\nOverall the log-normal distribution plots the log of random variables from a normal distribution curve. In general, the log is known as the exponent to which a base number must be raised in order to produce the random variable (x) that is found along a normally distributed curve.","ca3107ce":"<img src='https:\/\/ars.els-cdn.com\/content\/image\/3-s2.0-B9780124078215000048-f04-01-9780124078215.jpg?_'>","fec6d45c":"# Population ","9ecce442":"We will discuss about: <br>\n    Population      -> Population mean<br>\n    Sample          -> Sample mean<br>\n    Random Variable -> Discrete & Continuous","f88c178a":"It is very important to understand these graphs, we will discuss one by one:<br>\nFigure 1: \u03c1 is +1\nWe can clearly see the when X is increasing, Y is also increasing which means it is directly proportional and since they are in a line, the pearson correlation coefficient will be +1.\n\nFigure 2: 0<\u03c1<+1<br>\nAlthough the relationship is directly proportional but values (dots) are not on the same line and so the value of \u03c1 ranges from 0 to +1 (positive because directly proportional and the value depends on the distance of all the points w.r.t the line)\n\nFigure 3: \u03c1=0\nThere is absolute no trend or pattern in this graph.

One can delete the record but with that one might lose some important data.\n\nSo for handling the data, central tendency is used which is nothing but Mean, Median and Mode.
