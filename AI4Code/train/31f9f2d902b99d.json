So, we'll start simple.\n\n## Explore a pattern\n\nRemember that the sample submission file in **gender_submission.csv** assumes that all female passengers survived (and all male passengers died).  \n\nIs this a reasonable first guess?  We'll check if this pattern holds true in the data (in **train.csv**).\n\nCopy the code below into a new code cell.  Then, run the cell.","40ad38a0":"The code above calculates the percentage of male passengers (in **train.csv**) who survived.\n\nFrom this you can see that almost 75% of the women on board survived, whereas only 19% of the men lived to tell about it. Since gender seems to be such a strong indicator of survival, the submission file in **gender_submission.csv** is not a bad first guess!\n\nBut at the end of the day, this gender-based submission bases its predictions on only a single column.  As you can imagine, by considering multiple columns, we can discover more complex patterns that can potentially yield better-informed predictions.  Since it is quite difficult to consider several columns at once (or, it would take a long time to consider all possible patterns in many different columns simultaneously), we'll use machine learning to automate this for us.\n\n## Your first machine learning model\n\nWe'll build what's known as a **random forest model**.  This model is constructed of several \"trees\" (there are three trees in the picture below, but we'll construct 100!) that will individually consider each passenger's data and vote on whether the individual survived.  Then, the random forest model makes a democratic decision: the outcome with the most votes wins!\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AC9Bq63.png)\n\nThe code cell below looks for patterns in four different columns (**\"Pclass\"**, **\"Sex\"**, **\"SibSp\"**, and **\"Parch\"**) of the data.  It constructs the trees in the random forest model based on patterns in the **train.csv** file, before generating predictions for the passengers in **test.csv**.  The code also saves these new predictions in a CSV file **my_submission.csv**.\n\nCopy this code into your notebook, and run it in a new code cell.","77364efa":"Logging into Kaggle for the first time can be daunting. Our competitions often have large cash prizes, public leaderboards, and involve complex data. Nevertheless, we really think all data scientists can rapidly learn from machine learning competitions and meaningfully contribute to our community. To give you a clear understanding of how our platform works and a mental model of the type of learning you could do on Kaggle, we've created a Getting Started tutorial for the Titanic competition. It walks you through the initial steps required to get your first decent submission on the leaderboard. By the end of the tutorial, you'll also have a solid understanding of how to use Kaggle's online coding environment, where you'll have trained your own machine learning model.\n\nSo if this is your first time entering a Kaggle competition, regardless of whether you:\n- have experience with handling large datasets,\n- haven't done much coding,\n- are newer to data science, or\n- are relatively experienced (but are just unfamiliar with Kaggle's platform),\n\nyou're in the right place! \n\n# Part 1: Get started\n\nIn this section, you'll learn more about the competition and make your first submission. \n\n## Join the competition!\n\nThe first thing to do is to join the competition!  Open a new window with **[the competition page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic)**, and click on the **\"Join Competition\"** button, if you haven't already.  (_If you see a \"Submit Predictions\" button instead of a \"Join Competition\" button, you have already joined the competition, and don't need to do so again._)\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/07cskyU.png)\n\nThis takes you to the rules acceptance page.  You must accept the competition rules in order to participate.  These rules govern how many submissions you can make per day, the maximum team size, and other competition-specific details.   Then, click on **\"I Understand and Accept\"** to indicate that you will abide by the competition rules.\n\n## The challenge\n\nThe competition is simple: we want you to use the Titanic passenger data (name, age, price of ticket, etc) to try to predict who will survive and who will die.\n\n## The data\n\nTo take a look at the competition data, click on the **<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\/data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Data tab<\/b><\/a>** at the top of the competition page.  Then, scroll down to find the list of files.  \nThere are three files in the data: (1) **train.csv**, (2) **test.csv**, and (3) **gender_submission.csv**.\n\n### (1) train.csv\n\n**train.csv** contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 passengers, to be exact -- where each passenger gets a different row in the table).  To investigate this data, click on the name of the file on the left of the screen.  Once you've done this, you can view all of the data in the window.  \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cYsdt0n.png)\n\nThe values in the second column (**\"Survived\"**) can be used to determine whether each passenger survived or not: \n- if it's a \"1\", the passenger survived.\n- if it's a \"0\", the passenger died.\n\nFor instance, the first passenger listed in **train.csv** is Mr. Owen Harris Braund.  He was 22 years old when he died on the Titanic.\n\n### (2) test.csv\n\nUsing the patterns you find in **train.csv**, you have to predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (in **test.csv**) survived.  \n\nClick on **test.csv** (on the left of the screen) to examine its contents.  Note that **test.csv** does not have a **\"Survived\"** column - this information is hidden from you, and how well you do at predicting these hidden values will determine how highly you score in the competition! \n\n### (3) gender_submission.csv\n\nThe **gender_submission.csv** file is provided as an example that shows how you should structure your predictions.  It predicts that all female passengers survived, and all male passengers died.  Your hypotheses regarding survival will probably be different, which will lead to a different submission file.  But, just like this file, your submission should have:\n- a **\"PassengerId\"** column containing the IDs of each passenger from **test.csv**.\n- a **\"Survived\"** column (that you will create!) with a \"1\" for the rows where you think the passenger survived, and a \"0\" where you predict that the passenger died.","b9ceae25":"# Part 2: Your coding environment\n\nIn this section, you'll train your own machine learning model to improve your predictions.  _If you've never written code before or don't have any experience with machine learning, don't worry!  We don't assume any prior experience in this tutorial._\n\n## The Notebook\n\nThe first thing to do is to create a Kaggle Notebook where you'll store all of your code.  You can use Kaggle Notebooks to getting up and running with writing code quickly, and without having to install anything on your computer.  (_If you are interested in deep learning, we also offer free GPU access!_) \n\nBegin by clicking on the **<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\/kernels\" target=\"_blank\">Code tab<\/a>** on the competition page.  Then, click on **\"New Notebook\"**.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/v2i82Xd.png)\n\nYour notebook will take a few seconds to load.  In the top left corner, you can see the name of your notebook -- something like **\"kernel2daed3cd79\"**.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/64ZFT1L.png)\n\nYou can edit the name by clicking on it.  Change it to something more descriptive, like **\"Getting Started with Titanic\"**.  \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uwyvzXq.png)\n\n## Your first lines of code\n\nWhen you start a new notebook, it has two gray boxes for storing code.  We refer to these gray boxes as \"code cells\".\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/q9mwkZM.png)\n\nThe first code cell already has some code in it.  To run this code, put your cursor in the code cell.  (_If your cursor is in the right place, you'll notice a blue vertical line to the left of the gray box._)  Then, either hit the play button (which appears to the left of the blue line), or hit **[Shift] + [Enter]** on your keyboard.\n\nIf the code runs successfully, three lines of output are returned.  Below, you can see the same code that you just ran, along with the output that you should see in your notebook.","6e644d0c":"Before moving on, make sure that your code returns the output above.  The code above calculates the percentage of female passengers (in **train.csv**) who survived.\n\nThen, run the code below in another code cell:","d26d938a":"Your code should return the output above, which corresponds to the first five rows of the table in **train.csv**.  It's very important that you see this output **in your notebook** before proceeding with the tutorial!\n> _If your code does not produce this output_, double-check that your code is identical to the two lines above.  And, make sure your cursor is in the code cell before hitting **[Shift] + [Enter]**.\n\nThe code that you've just written is in the Python programming language. It uses a Python \"module\" called **pandas** (abbreviated as `pd`) to load the table from the **train.csv** file into the notebook. To do this, we needed to plug in the location of the file (which we saw was `\/kaggle\/input\/titanic\/train.csv`).  \n> If you're not already familiar with Python (and pandas), the code shouldn't make sense to you -- but don't worry!  The point of this tutorial is to (quickly!) make your first submission to the competition.  At the end of the tutorial, we suggest resources to continue your learning.\n\nAt this point, you should have at least three code cells in your notebook.  \n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ReLhYca.png)\n\nCopy the code below into the third code cell of your notebook to load the contents of the **test.csv** file.  Don't forget to click on the play button (or hit **[Shift] + [Enter]**)!","d8f201b7":"# Part 4: Learn more!\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, we strongly suggest our (3-hour) **[Intro to Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-machine-learning)** course, which will help you fully understand all of the code that we've presented here.  You'll also know enough to generate even better predictions!","a7d63fda":"Make sure that your notebook outputs the same message above (`Your submission was successfully saved!`) before moving on.\n> Again, don't worry if this code doesn't make sense to you!  For now, we'll focus on how to generate and submit predictions.\n\nOnce you're ready, click on the **\"Save Version\"** button in the top right corner of your notebook.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n- Ensure that the **\"Save and Run All\"** option is selected, and then click on the **\"Save\"** button.\n- This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **\"Save Version\"** button.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen.  Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**.  \n- Click on the **Output** tab on the right of the screen.  Then, click on the **\"Submit to Competition\"** button to submit your results.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7oIbXdh.png)\n\nCongratulations for making your first submission to a Kaggle competition!  Within ten minutes, you should receive a message providing your spot on the leaderboard.  Great work!"}}
