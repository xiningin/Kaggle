Also exports these files to binary, in order to speed their load in subsequent uses.\n\n> For this task, we use the function created by Alexey Kupershtokh (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexeykupershtokh\/safe-memory-reduction)","30fb90cf":"### This script will perform the following tasks:\n\n* Creates the columns `DT`: the `TransactionDT` (Delta time) from seconds to days.\n* Creates the columns `Dxachr` referenced to the `DT` Delta days. These columns are days from a specific date or point in the past, so substracting the days passed since the begining of the dataset (`DT`), we can get that specific \"date\" delta.\n\nWe initially were not intended to work with test data, and we were partitioning or own test data from train for our final bootcamp project purposes.\n**Finally we decide to use full train for train and validation and test with test file, submitting the results to kaggle as we were participating in the competition.**"}}
