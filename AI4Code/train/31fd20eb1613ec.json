If the development of the stenosis or occlusion is gradual, blood supply to the tissues and organs slowly diminishes until organ function becomes impaired.**","20971646":"### Compare Models(Based on scores)<a id='26'>","c8e59dac":"### Fbs vs target vs age<a id='13'>","4ea4afdb":"#### XGBoost Classifier","5dc48df9":"#### Heatmap (Correlation)<a id='22'>","39043d71":"### ca vs target vs sex<a id='18'>","46fef11c":"***<font color='green'>From the above figure, we can observe that the distribution of the age of the person who doesn't have heart disease shifted downward and to the left of those who have heart disease.***","52868cbc":"#### <font color='red'>Scratch code for calculating Two Sample t-Test with Unequal Variance\n\n-Formula for calculating degrees of Freedom for this t-test:<br>\n    \n<img src='https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/bf9929fa7098ff7e57a5c421c0fdcb3eea20435f' height=\"400\" width=\"300\">\n","0c7d8255":"Our target variable is quite balanced.","3373a93d":"#### Chest Pain Type \n- Value 0: **asymptomatic** \n- Value 1: **atypical angina** \n- Value 2: **non-anginal pain** \n- Value 3: **typical angina**\n\nIt's believed by a doctor that among the patients who have heart disease 30% of them have asymptomatic chest pain, 25% have an atypical angina chest pain, 40% have a non-anginal pain and 5% have typical angina.\nFrom the given sample of 136 patients who have heart disease test whether the belief of the doctor is true at **alpha**=0.05.\n\n**<font color='blue'>Null Hypothesis** -:            Probability distribution of chest pain is P(asymptomatic)=0.30, P(atypical angina)=0.25, P(non-anginal pain)=0.40, P(typical angina) = 0.05\n**<font color='blue'>Alternative Hypothesis**: -\t  Probability distribution of chest pain is not defined in null hypothesis\n\n<img src='https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/thmb\/ns7d4DC1AqVGme2p1-WYqC26r_s=\/768x0\/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()\/latex_ac74fec08532861eb5f8b87226ebf396-5c59a6fcc9e77c00016b4195.jpg' height=\"400\" width=\"300\">\n\n**Oi** - Observed Frequencies <br>\n**Ei** - Expected Frequencies","9f2301bc":"#### Population Density Function of Age ","b49bb854":"Here I am interested in finding the difference between the population parameter (mean of age) of the person having heart disease and not having heart disease or in simple terms it means that I am interested in finding the average age of the person based on whether or not he\/she had heart disease. \n\nTwo Groups are there Group A(0) consist of the people who have heart disease and Group B(1) consist of people who don't have heart disease.
