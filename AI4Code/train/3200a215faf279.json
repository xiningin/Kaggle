presented representation will help agents learn more efficiently and they can better orient themselves on the playing field. Also, it provides an understanding of which unit they currently control, where the enemies are and where the halite is located.\n\nThe suggested solution allows getting the highlighted current location of a player and obtaining a forecast of the most optimal action for him. However, the current reward system doesn't allow evaluating the actions of each controlled unit individually and its contribution to the total reward for the game step. Consequently, the next task will be the development of a more detailed reward function for different game strategies.\n\nPerhaps my work will be useful to someone, and I will be glad to receive any comments regarding possible omissions and mistakes.","68e54b23":"### Rendering of initial state","c6406d97":"# Board Image Representation\n\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n[Part 1.
