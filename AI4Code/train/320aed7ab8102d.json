The bad news is that the locations aren't standardized, so there will be some preprocessing of the data required.\n\nSometimes they're in `City, State` format, other times `City, Country`, and in one case I noticed `City, State, Country`. \n\nThe top student locations are primarily large cities in the United States and India: New York (pop 8.6mm), Bengaluru (pop 12.34mm), and Los Angeles (pop: 4mm).\n\n","dedbf2a4":"The site seems to skew heavily toward the computer industry, which I suppose isn't unexpected!\n\nIt's a bit odd that one of the top headlines is \"Assurance Associate at PwC\".
