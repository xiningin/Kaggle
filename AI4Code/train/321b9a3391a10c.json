Pupular vaccines used around the world are Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna.\n2. Type of vaccines used in Europe are pretty consistent. Most of them are Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna compare to other regions which are quite diverse.\n3. Countries in Western Asia generally have higher total vaccinations ratio especially in Israel and United Arab Emirates compare to other Asia countries.\n4. In Northern Europe, United Kingdom has highest total vaccinations ratio and quite a gap to others.\n5. Northern Africa has lowest total vaccinations ratio after Southern Asia.","3a2d63bf":"# Steps followed:\n1. Basic Detail about data sheet\n2. Top 20 countries which vaccinate more people\n3.
