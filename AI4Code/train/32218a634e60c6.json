Get a Degree will decrease your chance of getting unemployed even in times of pandemic, as companies do prefer University graduates. While looking at historical data of the past 2 years we can see the trends of unemployed people with and without a degree. It seems it's getting hard for people to get a job in general with time, but people with a degree are still better as their numbers are always low in the spectrum and they tend to get more options in all types of fields.\n\nEven in India people with degrees perform well in the job sector, they still have problems with unpaid works but as people get more experience in the field they tend to go long way. There are limitations for people without a degree but it's not impossible to get jobs even if you don't have a formal degree, you just need to get more coding experience and experience in general to score better-paying jobs. In my opinion, having more coding experience and work experience tends to improve your chances and opportunities. \n\nIf you didn't have a chance to get a formal degree, you can always try to get certificates online or professional certificates to improve your resume.\n","5eafc88f":"## Cleaning data and removing students, unemployed and other professions","170c9132":"We can clearly see the winner on the map where the majority of people without a degree are from India and the USA.

","ca0c8efe":"While comparing Pay range of participants of the Top Five countries we can observe that majority of Kagglers are unpaid workers or with an annual income of fewer than 999 dollars. This is quite interesting as I thought it was due to demography or low working wages, but It seems the USA and Japan have the same peaks at 0-999$. I think these participants are in the early stages of their career and willing to work for free to get some experience. We will be looking more deeply into data to explore more information.","c804b9e4":"In this part, we will be exploring Pay gap of participants with and without a degree.

It seems like the majority of people are either from the USA or from India. If we look deeper we start to see European and African countries with a degree are emerging. The countries lie Nigeria, Spain, the UK and Germany are prominent on this map. This shows that the literacy rate of these countries is a determining factor of a person getting into University Degree or not. ","e990d01c":"Participants without a degree who have more coding experience are most students and are transitioning into the field of machine learning and data science and the same goes for the software engineers. This trend is seen in the previous part too. We will be focusing more on jobs percentage by eliminating Unemployed, student and other from data to make some sense.

","c8242d38":"This bar plot is an overview of the current meta of the pay gap of participants without a degree. It seems quite clear that most people are unpaid works or have less than 999 dollars per year income. This can be due to demography as developing countries pay less to compare to more developed economies, where they have unions and minimum wages. The rest of the pay ranges are equally spread so there is no particular information we can get out of it.","0073ca80":"## Exploring Demography Participatns with degree","ce43a1de":"## Male and Female VS Age Group","ec0d4995":"The trend is quite similar and people with and without a degree are mostly into Software engineering, Data Scientists, and Data Analyst jobs.

","58676be5":"<H1 style=\"text-align: center\"> Introduction <\/H1>\n \n\nIn the past decade, computer science has evolved and the importance of **Data Science** has become the new norm, every company s looking to invest more in **Machine learning**. This is where someone like me who never had an Interest before got curious and started learning more about this world of Kaggle, it took me 3 months to get hold of some of the basic and advanced tools used by **Data Scientists**. I am using those same tools to evaluate this data set and come up with the best conclusion. In this Notebook, I will be telling you the story of data and I will be sharing my own experience so that any beginner can learn from my mistake and get ahead.\n\n<center><img src='https:\/\/www.yorkhotel.com.sg\/uploads\/9\/8\/1\/8\/98182264\/accomplishment-celebrate-ceremony-267885_orig.jpg' alt=\"Degree\" style=\"width: 1000px\"> <\/center><br>\n\n> www.yorkhotel.com.sg\n\n\n\n## Big Question \n\nThe big question is how do we determine whether getting a degree is necessary for getting into Data Science and eventually scoring Data Science Job.  My sole focus will be on survey participants who had no formal degree and comparing them with other participants. In my opinion degree, the online platform has improved and due to COVID19, people get their skills through the online platform such as Kaggle, Udacity, DataCamp, edx, DataQuest, Udemy, Codecademy, and Coursera. These platforms are beginner friendly and it has paved the way for the less privileged people to get skills free. The ost COVID19 era will look different as more people will learn online.\n\n## To do list\n- Analyzing Dataset\n- Analyzing different Age groups\n- Finding the relation between age groups and different professions\n- Analyzing Different Sex\n- Comparing Job titles of participants with a degree and without a degree\n- Finding if coding experience improves job opportunities and comparing it with Degree and without.\n- Finding the unemployment rate in each category\n- Analysing Past survey data\n- giving my conclusion of the weather getting a degree is important to score a better job and better opportunities.","28704400":"Looking at the heat map it clearly shows how Kaggle is dominated by students who just start coding, but it doesn't give us a clear picture about on having coding experience will improve the chance of getting better opportunities, for that we need to go deep.","3dbb7411":"### 2020 DataSet","ffbafffc":"Exploring and cleaning the 2019 Data Set and further changes will be made later in the project. This data set is quite different from 2020 and I have to open a CSV file to find similar columns to compare. In the end, when I recognize similar columns it becomes easy for me to handle data.","d3031458":"Focusing on participants without a degree will make things simple to understand and later we will be comparing those results.","edb97249":"As we can see the trend in both with and without a degree are quite similar and only a few people have a pay range greater than 200,000 dollars a year. Even though it is quite similar but people with a degree have a lesser percentage in pay rage on 0-999 dollars as compare to without a degree. We need to take another step by add countries into the equation to make it more clear what these numbers describe.","434ba87d":"In India, there are fewer opportunities for people with no Degree, as you can see only one peak at a price range of 25,000-29,999 dollars range at Data Science. In we compare both categorical plots we can see that having a Degree can improve getting into all kinds of the field as participants are more evenly spread and have more options to chose from.","be56e0db":"There are three peaks in the bar chart of participants with less coding experience, which are Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and Software Engineers.  Participants with more coding experience are similar but they don't have a peek at data analysts, instead, they had peaked at Research Scientists.  In short, We started to predict participants who are joining this platform are from most Data Science and Software engineering backgrounds.  ","3dec04af":"Dividing the 2020 data frame into two different pandas data frame based on Education (With formal Degree\/ Without Formal Degree). I used this so that I can keep all the content in the data and split them into two other data frames. In the end, no data lost.","c0545f69":"Comparing both bar charts we can see that there is a huge difference in Pay ranges between participants with\/without a degree. Participants with degrees have evenly spread pay rage and have a peek at 0-999 dollars, but if we look at barplot of participants without a degree, which is more saturated towards 0-999 dollars pay rage. It is becoming quite clear to me that majority of unpaid or unemployed data scientists are from India so we will be going deep into Inda in the next part.","79b18919":"When we look deeper into the percentage of participants with and without Degree it makes it clear that most of the people who are using Kaggle are young generation and without a degree, with more than 30+ % of participants are in the age range of 18-21 years. We will be looking at more parameters to determine the reasons and look deep into the specific pattern.","38c0cecf":"## Exploring DataFrame","fcf32327":"In this part, we will be looking at some of the Current jobs held by people without a University Degree.
