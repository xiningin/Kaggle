The t-test between loftus and guest could not reject the null hypothesis of idential average scores but the t-test between durante and the guest scores was lower then our threshold of 0.05 so we reject the null of idential average scores. A suspicion that I held for a very long time. Durante's average rating has statistically significant different scores than the average guest scores. Yet Loftus does not. ","b07c3455":"Even though they are dependent these scores differ enough statistically for their averages to be considered different. \n\nExamples for use are scores of the same set of student in different exams, or repeated sampling from the same units. The test measures whether the average score differs significantly across samples (e.g. exams). If we observe a large p-value, for example greater than 0.05 or 0.1 then we cannot reject the null hypothesis of identical average scores. If the p-value is smaller than the threshold, e.g. 1%, 5% or 10%, then we reject the null hypothesis of equal averages. Small p-values are associated with large t-statistics.","2b6c2a7d":"I looked at the average between the co-hosts and the guest, and the average between just the hosts. The hosts have a slightly slower average rating. The interesting thing to note that the average is almost 2.5, this might be a normal distribution but we can investigate futher to confirm. ","f78bbf98":"This is a lot higher than I would have thought it would have been. In context, each episode is suggested by a guest or a fan so it makes sense that feminist podcast viewers would tend to suggest films that influenced them in a postive way. ","14151dd4":"Since loftus and durante were not statistically different in average scores let's see if we can use the host's average rating for each move to see if there are statistical different ratings for each genre. ","20050c23":"Hello all, I have been listening to the Bechdel cast off and on here for about two years and lately I've been wondering about a couple things on the show. What's the pass rate for films on the show, how the nipple rating differ between each co-host and guest, and how the genre is affects the rating. \n\nFirst, let's look at the test results. ","08102992":"https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/scipy\/reference\/stats.html","55a58a17":"So the mean is 2.37, the median is 2.33, and the standard deviation is 1.39. It approximates a normal distribution.\n\nNow, let's see if there is a statistical difference between the host's and the guest's average ratings. I have a feeling that Durante tends to hold movies to a higher standard (maybe due to the two film degrees) and want to investigate. I also want to see if the guest's ratings are statistically different than the host's ratings. I will use a p value of 0.05.","5af86b8c":"So the prediction for Paraside was 2.54, actual was 2\nStella got her groove back actually was 3.75\nand death becomes her was 2.67\n\nSo two out of the three were fairly acurrate based only on Genre. \n\nOne thing that the show points out is that if a movie subverts the sterotypes of the genre then it will have a better rating. This is why How Stella got for groove back had such a high rating but an inaccurate score. This dicodomy of a sterotype of a genre will have a more accurate prediction and a \"refreshing take\" a genre will bring a source of error.  However, sterotypes are still very prevelent in blockbusters hence why I chose the genre to predict the rating. ","e02f6f86":"According to Scipy, \"We can use this test, if we observe two independent samples from the same or different population, e.g. exam scores of boys and girls or of two ethnic groups. The test measures whether the average (expected) value differs significantly across samples. If we observe a large p-value, for example larger than 0.05 or 0.1, then we cannot reject the null hypothesis of identical average scores. If the p-value is smaller than the threshold, e.g. 1%, 5% or 10%, then we reject the null hypothesis of equal averages.\"\n\nSource: https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/scipy\/reference\/generated\/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html\n\nThis clearly is laughable because they are not truely independent samples, they constantly ask each other how many nipples the other two are giving out but it still shows that these are not statistically different. The hosts are a united front. "}}
