This is a collusive act involving the fraudulent seller and an accomplice.\n* **Bidding Ratio**: A shill bidder participates more frequently to raise the auction price and attract higher bids from legitimate participants.\n* **Successive Outbidding**: A shill bidder successively outbids himself even though he is the current winner to increase the price gradually with small consecutive increments.\n* **Last Bidding**: A shill bidder becomes inactive at the last stage of the auction (more than 90\\% of the auction duration) to avoid winning the auction.\n* **Auction Bids**: Auctions with SB activities tend to have a much higher number of bids than the average of bids in concurrent auctions.\n* **Auction Starting Price**: a shill bidder usually offers a small starting price to attract legitimate bidders into the auction.\n* **Early Bidding**: A shill bidder tends to bid pretty early in the auction (less than 25\\% of the auction duration) to get the attention of auction users.\n* **Winning Ratio**: A shill bidder competes in many auctions but hardly wins any auctions.\n* **Auction Duration**: How long an auction lasted.\n* **Class**: 0 for normal behaviour bidding; 1 for otherwise.","eb527173":"I'll start the Data Preparation section with normalization.

In simpler words, PCA is often used to simplify data, reduce noise, and find unmeasured \u201clatent variables\u201d. (Volpi, 2020)\nWe've already separated independants variables and the target variable, therefore we can apply PCA straight away.","e506ecb5":"PCA dimensionality reduction method allows us to choose the number of components we need to use. Apart from PCA in LDA we can't control the number of components they will be always reduced by one from number of classes we have represented as a target variable. However, LDA is a better use for solving classification problems as it creates a clear separation between classes. ","5658e2f6":"Next ML model I want to use is a DecisionTreeClassifier. Decision Tree is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that uses a set of rules to make decisions. The intuition behind Decision Trees is that we use the dataset features to create yes\/no questions and continually split the dataset until we isolate all data points belonging to each class. Every time we ask a question we add a node to the tree. The result of asking a question splits the dataset based on the value of a feature, and creates new nodes. The algorithm tries to completely separate the dataset such that all leaf nodes, i.e., the nodes that don\u2019t split the data further, belong to a single class. These are called pure leaf nodes. In the end, the algorithm can only assign one class to the data points in each leaf node.

On this stage we set questions we need to answer with the project's outcome.

I determined most important features which can be used in future for data mining. Both of model had perfomed really well and satisfied the accuracy requirements. I tuned hyperparameters and compared perfomance of two models. I was able to implement two dimensionality reduction techniques and compared the results.","b6285b5d":"The Evaluation phase is different from the Modeling technical evaluation.
