K-NN is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm. If we try to understand the concept of lazy, unlike eager learning, lazy learning does not have a training phase. It does not learn the training data, instead it \u201cmemorizes\u201d the training data set. When we want to make an estimate, it looks for the nearest neighbors in the whole dataset.\n\n# instagram:cuneytaykac_"}}
