If the interest rates are low, the mortgages are relatively cheaper for the borrower as they have to pay less interest, which leads to an increased amount of mortgage applications. A high mortgage interest rate means the mortgage borrower pays a high amount of interest to the lender, which makes the mortgage less attractive for the borrower. Interest rate changes have a significant impact on mortgage applications, as was seen in November of last year, where a sudden increase in interest rates led to a large peak in mortgage applications. The main difference between the mortgages offered by these types of companies lies in the mortgage interest rates. Even a small difference in mortgage interest rates can often save or cost the borrower a vast amount of money, due to the large sum of a mortgage.\n\nIn general, there are two types of mortgage interest rate: variable rates (ARM) and fixed rates. Variable interest rates are generally lower than fixed interest rates, but can change every month. Fixed interest rates are slightly higher, but are fixed for a certain period of time. A fixed interest rate is generally preferred when the mortgage interest rates are expected to rise, or when the borrower wants to know its monthly expenses upfront. A variable interest rate (ARM) is preferred when interest rates are expected to decrease. If a financial institution has a significantly higher interest rate than its competitors, it will generally receive fewer mortgage applications as the independent mortgage advisors will forward its customers to a different mortgage lender.\n\nFinancial institutions sometimes increase their interest rates during the summer months, and at the end of the year, as there is less personnel available to handle the requests due to vacations and holidays. With less personnel available they can handle less mortgage requests, so in order to keep the processing time the same they choose to reduce the input, by increasing the interest rates. Financial institutions may also specifically keep interest rates low for mortgages with a certain fixed interest period.

It can be used both for classification and regression. It is also the most flexible and easy to use algorithm. A forest is comprised of trees. It is said that the more trees it has, the more robust a forest is. Random forests creates decision trees on randomly selected data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It also provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance. Random forests has a variety of applications, such as recommendation engines, image classification and feature selection. It can be used to classify loyal loan applicants, identify fraudulent activity and predict diseases.\n\n- Random forests is considered as a highly accurate and robust method because of the number of decision trees participating in the process.\n\n- It does not suffer from the over fitting problem.
