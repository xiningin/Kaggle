Welcome to another one of my World Famous Starter Kernels! I usually create a generic starter kernels with a couple of really bad pie charts just to show how to load data and work with it. When working with this dataset, it wasn't long before I realized that I had *no idea* what I was doing.  I'm no GIS expert and this data was on a whole new level for me. It took a lot of time to figure out how to handle shape files and projection systems -- I learned that working with GIS data is not easy. What is a CRS? What packages should I use? Anyway, I had some fun and took the opportunity to learn about it. This kernel is the process I took and I hope it's helpful. Feel free to as questions here or in the forums: [https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/center-for-policing-equity\/data-science-for-good\/discussion](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/center-for-policing-equity\/data-science-for-good\/discussion)\n\nThanks to CPE for sharing and hosting ths challenge!","2860ec60":"With the X and Y coords converted to llongitude and latitude I can convert this dataframe to a GeoPandas Dataframe ","bac76db8":"This prepped.csv contains some crime records with a strange header and even stranger X,Y coordinates.\n\nAccording to [http:\/\/www.earthpoint.us\/Convert.aspx](http:\/\/www.earthpoint.us\/Convert.aspx) \n\n    By default, the X coordinate, or Easting is specified first and the Y coordinate, or Northing is specified second. However, the order can be reversed if coordinates are explicitly labeled.
