Mechanically Ventilated** <\/span>\n\n#### There are many different types of mechanically ventilated types of buildings but the general properties remain the same. Mechanical ventilation systems circulate air using ducts and fans, rather than relying on airflow through holes or cracks in a home's walls, roof, or windows. It is primarily driven by fan. Important to note: different climate will implement different types of mechanical ventilation.\n\n    \nStructure            |  Air ducts\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.thegreenage.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Mechanical-assisted-night-ventilation.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"\/>  | <img src=\"https:\/\/www.designingbuildings.co.uk\/w\/images\/f\/fa\/Ventilation_ductwork.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"\/>\n    \n","5fb36a7c":"### There are 4 types of building cooling strategy in the dataset: Mechanically ventilated, Naturally ventilated, Air conditioned and Mixed mode\n#### Here are the descriptions and explanation for each of them","979757db":"### Here we were able to define a new generalized columns for Climate!
