Therefore, poor FT shooters like Andre Drummond,\nand good 3FG% shooters like Stephen Curry are overrated in this estimate.\n\nWith more statistics, such as FTA\/FTM, FGA\/FGM, and 3FGA\/3FGM a more accurate\nestimate can be made.

Introduction\nThis is a simple estimatation of the season total projected fantasy points for all players based on ESPN's standard fantasy scoring format.
