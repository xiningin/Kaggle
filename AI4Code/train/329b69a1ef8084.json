For example, when democrats were around 85, there seemed to be quite a few dark indigo circles when there were about 45 independents, and when democrats were at 75 and indepdnents were at 40. I think this signifies more overlap, meaning the specific amounts of independents correlated to the specific amounts democrats is more popular. I chose to use indigo because it combines blue and purple, the two parties' colors. ","06ec5a09":"Something I found interesting was that for the number of democrats that voted yes, about half the amount of independents also voted yes. For example, when 80 democrats voted yes, about 40 independents voted yes. I think this has to do with the amount of democrats and indepdents being sampled, as there are usually more democrats than independents in general. ","61f1ce5c":"In general, it seems as though that the relationship of indepdents who said yes with an increasing amount of democrats saying yes is direct. However, there are some outliars. For example, when Dem Yes is at 90, The mean of independents who said yes was significantly lower than than when 89 democrats and 91 democrats said yes. I decided to choose a blue color scheme because it represents the democratic party, and as more democrats are saying yes, the blue is becoming darker. "}}
