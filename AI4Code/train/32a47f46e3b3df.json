If\nnumber is even, then collatz() should print number \/\/ 2 and return this value.\nIf number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.\nThen write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps\ncalling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1.\n(Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any integer\u2014sooner\nor later, using this sequence, you\u2019ll arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren\u2019t\nsure why. Your program is exploring what\u2019s called the Collatz sequence, sometimes called \u201cthe simplest impossible math problem.\u201d)\nRemember to convert the return value from input() to an integer with\nthe int() function; otherwise, it will be a string value.\nHint: An integer number is even if number % 2 == 0, and it\u2019s odd if\nnumber % 2 == 1.\nThe output of this program could look something like this:\nEnter number:\n3\n10\n5\n16\n8\n4\n2\n1\nInput Validation\nAdd try and except statements to the previous project to detect whether the\nuser types in a noninteger string. Normally, the int() function will raise a\nValueError error if it is passed a noninteger string, as in int('puppy'). In the\nexcept clause, print a message to the user saying they must enter an integer."}}
