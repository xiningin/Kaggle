The goal is to quickly refer to the meter_reading for all the sites to identify outliers and gaps.\n\n- [Plot for Site 0 to 5](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arnabbiswas1\/eda-meter-reading-for-site-0-5)\n- [Plot for Site 6 to 10](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arnabbiswas1\/eda-meter-reading-for-site-6-10)\n\nNote: I have used plotly for this EDA so that the exact value of meter reading at a particular time stamp can be quickly referred from the figure. For the buildings which just have only one type of meter, to display the meter type, please hover the mouse over the line plot. For buildings with multiple meter types, different types of meters are explicitly mentioned along with the color code.\n\n**Unfortunately, because of the size, this notebook takes few minutes to get rendered completely. So, please wait for sometime once you open the page.**","a2b2dca0":"# meter_reading site 13"}}
