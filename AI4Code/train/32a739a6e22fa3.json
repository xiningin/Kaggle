I would suggest that this is due to the fact that experts (who actually are experienced people) spend much more time to train their skills in real practice than taking theoretical courses on the Internet.

This may be due to the fact that in 2011 online learning platforms weren't as popular.\n\nWe can see that in 2012 Business Finance courses start to gain popularity and grows steadily for the next 3 years, and then in 2015 growth slows down. And also it's seen that the amount of Web Development courses stats to increase at the same time with Business Finance, but not so fast at first. Just in 2014 Web Development increases dramatically and going up very fast. Apparently, that growth is going on in 2017 too, but we can't affirm it for sure due to lack of data.\n\nAnd more creative directions Music and Design also started to increase faster since 2012-2013.

And if there are many reviews it means that people are very interested (even if the course turned out to be bad for them). \n\nTherefore, the logic here is to find some kind of public interest index and sort the data by it. I'm going to sum numbers of subscribers and reviews and this number will be our index.","b1d91864":"So, I assume that the most financially attractive courses are the ones which have not more than mean subject price.\n\nNow I'll find mean content durations for each subject.","f45d9cd9":"The most engaging Graphic Design courses.","d34d280a":"Create the function for searching 5 the best free courses by every subject. I will print 5 courses by every subject just because it's interesting for me to look over top-5. Then I'm going to consolidate the first ones.","18ee791b":"The table below presents 4 courses that turned out to be the best free ones in their subject on Udemy platform.","d1fc0082":"# What are the best free courses by subject?","6265bd7b":"There are 6 duplicates, so we need to remove them.","9b0b03d4":"The Web Development courses have the biggest public interest index, furthemore it's almost 1,5 times bigger than all other subjects' indexes together have. And this despite the fact that the mean price of Web Development courses is also more than others.\n\nAlso comparing Business Finance and Graphic Design, we can see that despite the Business Finance courses' lower public interest and higher price that subject has more amount of engaging courses than Graphic Design subject.","0e4554d3":"And now we can sort received values.","cdaeb36f":"# Which courses offer the best cost benefit?","a90ae06d":"I assume that this task needs to be solved by dividing the subjects. I guess that different subjects may have different \"attractiveness indicators\" and therefore the results.\n\nI'm going to split up the data by subjects first. Then I will find mean course prices, mean content duration and mean public interest index for each subject separately.","f2c025df":"Eventually, I suggest that the most engaging courses in each subject are the ones which: \n- are cost not more than mean subject price;\n- have at least the mean content duration or more;\n- have the public interest index not less than mean one.\n\nLets find suitable courses.","519262f4":"The most engaging Musical Instruments courses.","170f9578":"If you are here reading this - thank you very much! It was my first real analysis of real data with python. Which was a very interesting experience for me. I'm sure that some things I've done in the research could be written in a much shorter way. But I'm just learning :)\n\nSo, any comments and advices are expectable. Thanks :)","a1191702":"What was the annual increase of courses in general and for each subject separately?","58ec6bed":"# What are the most popular courses?","869d6b11":"Among the best free courses by every subject all of them are for beginners and all levels. ","c801b380":"Let's look for some artefacts in numeric data of the DataFrame.\n\nWe can have the zero values in price column, subscribers amount or reviews. But if there any courses without lectures it probably can have some effect on the research.","4203433a":"It was pretty expectable because the business and money will exist forever (at least 'til the world ends). And also looking at how and in what directions our world is developing now, people realize that web technologies will be demanded for many decades in the future. \n\nLet's find out how many courses per levels there are on Udemy.","87c8bd7c":"According to the proposed selection conditions the most engaging courses were found for each subject:\n- 32 courses among the Business Finance subject;\n- 11 coures among the Graphic Design subject;\n- 9 courses among the Musical Instruments subject;\n- 34 courses among the Web Development subject.\n\nBesides, if you look at the values calculated above, you can also see some more interesting things.","ea22aacc":"It's surprising for me that there is an intermediate level course on the 4th place of the top. I thought that the most popular courses will be only for beginners or all levels.","7c1e1936":"If we talk about the best cost benefit, so we should search among the paid courses. Let's exclude free courses from DataFrame and remaining ones assign to a new variable. ","11abdda9":"# What are the most engaging courses?","6548223b":"# Data preparation."}}
