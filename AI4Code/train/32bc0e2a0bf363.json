should dig in deep.","faa46dbf":"The above graph shows that Deepak Chahar has a good strike rate in powerplays and even though he has only bowled fewer balls in death overs comparing it with powerplays still **8.42** is an incredible strike rate.\n***Note:*** Strike rate in middle-overs is inf because he didn't pick any wickets till date in middle overs and didn't bowl many deliveries.","b7509f38":"Eventhough  deppak chahar has only played  4 seasons(consistently for only last two seasons) i found out deepak evolved as a bowler over the years.In the first two seasons he didnt get much chance but after getting chance to play consistently in every matches he proved his potential as newball bowler who can swing the ball in both ways and even bowled at death really well with strikerate of 8.2 whenever he got a chance.","00fc219b":"The above graph shows us that Deepak Chahar had mostly bowled in powerplay because he is swing bowler who can move the ball in both ways only in the last season(2019) he bowled some overs at death and middle this shows he is growing over the years as a bowler (adding yorkers,slower balls into his armory) only then he can bowl at every stage of the game."}}
