What's strange is that the same can be seen for students who didn't get any free\/reduced lunch plans. \n\nWho would have thought there can be a connection between the test scores of a student, and whether the student is offered free\/reduced lunch plans? \n\nHowever, I wouldn't be quick to conclude that yet. There seems to be some connection between race\/ethnicity, parental level of education of the student with the lunch plans as well. So those could be the main underlying reason between the difference caused due to lunch plans.
