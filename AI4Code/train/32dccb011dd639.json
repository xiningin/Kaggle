We should focus on spreading awareness of increasing technology among users with ads.\n* Selling tables results in loss so we can either increase the price of table or we can sell it alongside other products such as chairs to cover up for the loss or both.Similarily smaller supplies should be sold in packs or as extra item with relevant products.\n* Same Day shipping should be provided on a few selected more profitable products as they can cover up for the extra expenses.\n* Most customers prefer to buy products in packs of 2 or 3 which costs a little less than when bought individually.\n* 20 % discount works best for attracting customers as well as producing sales and profit.However it might not work for some products which are bought in less quantity.\n","94b25a0b":"## <div id=\"ship\">4.

They produce highest profit.\n* Phones are second to copiers in the race of profit generation and the reason for this is the quantity of phones sold which is a lot higher in comparison to copiers.\n* Envelopes are sold in low quantity thus have low sales but they generate 42.27% profit on total sales.\n* Paper have low order count but high quantity which means these are purchased in bulk and about 43.39% of their total sales is profit.\n* Bookcases and Supplies having decent sales but results in loss.\n* Tables affect the profit in most negative way by losing about 8.5% of total sales.","7f680350":"### Observations\nCustomers prefer to place order for same day but same day delivery gets less profit which makes sense as it must be costly.
