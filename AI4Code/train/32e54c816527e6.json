The mean value is 38 i.e. on an average the value of age attribute is 38.\n2.  Age is having the standerd deviation 13.71 which indicates the deviation of an observation from the mean.    \n3.  The value of Age attribute varies from 17 to 90.\n4.  The 1st quartile is 28 i.e. 25% of the observations lies below 28.\n5.  3rd quartile is 48 which indicates that in 75% of the observations the value of age is less than 48.\n6.  The difference between 1st quartile and the minimum is lesser than the difference between 3rd quartile and the maximum which is showing that the data is more dispersed after the value 48.\n7.  The difference between mean & median is not significantly high but the difference between 3rd quartile & maximum made the distribution right skewed.\n\n\n>  **For fnlwgt :**\n1.  This is the sampling weight corresponding to the observations.\n2.  finalweight seems to be rightly skewed since there is very large distance between median & maximum value as compared to minimum & median value.\n\n\n> **For capital-gain :**\n1.  For capital-gain, the mean is 1079.06 and median is 0, which indicates that the distribution is highly right skewed.\n2.  From the qurtiles it is clearly visible that 75% observations are having capital gain zero.\n3.  capital-gain is concentrated on the one particular value i.e. zero and other are spread after 3rd quartile which results as the large standard deviation(7452.01).\n4.  capital-gain shows that either a person has no gain or has gain of very large amount(10k or 99k).\n \n\n> **For capital-loss :**\n1.  This attribute is similar to the capital-gain i.e. most of the values are centered on 0(this can be told using the summary statistic as minimum is 0 and values lie under 75 percentile is also zero.\n2.  Mean is 87 but median is 0(i.e. mean is greater than median this tells us that it is right skewed distribution).\n\n\n> **For hours-per-week :**\n1.  This attribute means number of working hours spend by an individual in a week.\n2.  In this data the hours per week atrribute varies within the range of 1 to 99.\n3.  75 percentage of the people spend 45 or less working hours per week.\n4.  The IQR is very less i.e. [40-45] which indicates that 50% of the observations are concentrated between 40 & 45.\n5.  Observations are very sparse below 25th percentile and after 75th percentile.\n6.  Using quartiles we can say that data is approximately symmetric.\n4.  Minimum is 1 hour per week & maximum value is 99 hours per week means person spending 99 working hours per week are very rare events. We will later analyze that which workclass they belong.","9707e688":"### ii.
