Since our female customers prefer the TM195 and TM498 compared to TM798 model, we should run promotional offers on the TM195 and TM498 models for the female customers on Mother's day\/Women's day etc. Also, we can run campaigns during those specific days to spread awareness on health and fitness. We can also endorse some female athletes to promote these two models.\n    \n2. We can brand the TM195 model as budget-friendly, TM498 model as mid-range, and TM798 model as professional treadmills.\n    \n3. We can endorse some athletes to promote TM798 to increase it's customer base, since it is the least sold model.\n    \n4. We can run promotional offers on TM798 time-to-time, as it is of high price (assumed as people with more income buy this model), so than we can encourage our mid-budget customers to give this model a thought. This strategy might reduce profit margin per model, but on long run, should increase the sales of this model. Considering this model might be the most profitable model, in long run, with discounted price and higher customer base, this should provide overall higher profit margin.\n    \n5. Since our primary customer base is of age 23-33 years, we can run promotional campaigns in schools and colleges to emphasize on health and fitness, and encourage the youngsters and their parents to consider buying this model. This should expand our customer base for the people below 23 and above 33 age as well.\n    \n6. We can also check with gyms if they are interested in upgrading their treadmills or buying new treadmills in bulk with some discount.","b24dba00":"<font color='green'>\n&nbsp;\n\n### Product Profiles based on Conclusive Observations:\n    \n#### TM195:\n1.
