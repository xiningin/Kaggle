You should refer to the \"Data Exploration\" chapter of the \"Introduction to Data Mining\" book (available at https:\/\/www-users.cs.umn.edu\/~kumar001\/dmbook\/index.php) to understand some of the concepts introduced in this tutorial notebook. The notebook can be downloaded from http:\/\/www.cse.msu.edu\/~ptan\/dmbook\/tutorials\/tutorial3\/tutorial3.ipynb.\n\nData exploration refers to the preliminary investigation of data in order\nto better understand its specific characteristics. There are two key motivations for data exploration:\n1. To help users select the appropriate preprocessing and data analysis technique used.\n2. To make use of humans\u2019 abilities to recognize patterns in the data.\n\nRead the step-by-step instructions below carefully.

Parallel coordinates have one coordinate axis for each attribute, but the different axes are parallel to one other instead of perpendicular, as is traditional. Furthermore, an object is represented as a line instead of as a point. In the example below, the distribution of values for each class can be identified in a separate color.\n\n**<font color=\"red\">Code:<\/font>**","ab8cd2e7":"## 3.1. Summary Statistics\n\nSummary statistics are quantities, such as the mean and standard deviation, that capture various characteristics of a potentially large set of values with a single number or a small set of numbers. In this tutorial, we will use the Iris sample data, which contains information on 150 Iris flowers, 50 each from one of three Iris species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. Each flower is characterized by five attributes:\n\n- sepal length in centimeters\n\n- sepal width in centimeters\n\n- petal length in centimeters\n\n- petal width in centimeters\n\n- class (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica) \n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n\n- Load a CSV data file into a Pandas DataFrame object.\n\n- Compute various summary statistics from the DataFrame.\n\nTo execute the sample program shown here, make sure you have installed the Pandas library (see Module 2).","7f044e82":"**3.** For the qualitative attribute (class), count the frequency for each of its distinct values.\n\n**<font color=\"red\">Code:<\/font>**","266f2cdb":"Note that count refers to the number of non-missing values for each attribute.","d12ee5d7":"**1.** First, you need to download the <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/Iris\">Iris dataset<\/a> from the UCI machine learning repository.\n\n**<font color='red'>Code:<\/font>** The following code uses Pandas to read the CSV file and store them in a DataFrame object named data.

Data Visualization\n\nData visualization is the display of information in a graphic or tabular format. Successful visualization requires that the data (information) be converted into a visual format so that the characteristics of the data and the relationships\namong data items or attributes can be analyzed or reported.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to display the Iris data created in Section 3.1. To execute the sample program shown here, make sure you have installed the matplotlib library package (see Module 0 on how to install Python packages).","39d81697":"**4.** It is also possible to display the summary for all the attributes simultaneously in a table using the describe() function. If an attribute is quantitative, it will display its mean, standard deviation and various quantiles (including minimum, median, and maximum) values. If an attribute is qualitative, it will display its number of unique values and the top (most frequent) values. \n\n**<font color=\"red\">Code:<\/font>**","90378305":"**5.** For multivariate statistics, you can compute the covariance and correlation between pairs of attributes.\n\n**<font color=\"red\">Code:<\/font>**"}}
