We can, however, take a look at box plots for each of our interesting nominal variables. The idea is to look for separation of home values according to category. We are graphically answering questions like _\"Is the average cost of a home significantly different between neighborhoods X, Y, and Z?\"_.\n\nTo refresh our memories on what some of our nominal variables are:\n\n- __Neighborhood__ - What neighborhood is the home located in.\n- __MSZoning__ -Identifies the type of zoning (agricultural, commercial, etc.)\n- __Condition1 & Condition2__ - Proximity to urban features such as railroads, parks, etc.\n\n\n### Neighborhood:\n\nI have created a boxplot of neighborhoods ordered by there average home value. Visually, we do see a rough ordering to these neighborhoods. Is this variance in sale price due to differences between neighborhoods, or is it more due to differences within individual neighborhoods (for example, is the mean home value of neigborhood X quite high compared to neighborhood Y because there is a billion dollar mansion at the end of the street, while all the other homes are relatively cheap?).

","88bee9b8":"## Checking For and Dealing With Missing Data\n\nOur next round of analysis will focus on our missing data. We want to know why the data is missing, and how we might be able to fill in the blanks. For example, data might be missing for a home's basement simply because the home doesn't have a basement. The data dictionary that came with this dataset shows that, for most variables, the value \"NA\" signifies that the home does not have the feature in question. It may simply come down to mis-recorded values. In those cases we simply need to change \"NaN\" to \"NA\" (or 0, if we've already label encoded the variable).\n\n__Warning: This section is long and tedious.__ There is A LOT of missing data in both our training and testing sets. This data cannot be ignored if we wish to get really good results. This part of the process is necessary. I encourage you to focus on the following thought process:\n\n1. look at a missing data point for a specific variable. \n2. See if the variable associated with that missing data is connected to a second variable.\n3. Determine if the missing data point can be accounted for by the related variable. \n\nYou will see many examples of this process below. \n\n### Missing Data in Training Set:\n\nFirst we will address the gaps in our missing training data. ","d4fd1c3c":"## Dropping Features With Low Correlation to Sale Price\n\nRecall that we performed two types of testing on our predictor variables. Correlation for the continuous\/ordinal data and ANOVA on the categorical data. For both sets of tests, there were variables that responded poorly to the testing.

Again, only a test will tell. Let's go ahead and run such a test on all of these questionable categories. While we have already seen clear association between ordinal variables and __SalePrice__ we will include them in this analysis as well. \n\n### Performing Analysis of Variation (ANOVA)\n\nWhile visual inspection of our nominal variables by boxplot is a good start, we need to find out if there is any statistically significant differences between our variable categories when considering sale prices. In order to to answer that question, we will perform ANOVA F-testing to each variable. What this test tells us is, given a variable like __Neighborhood__, is the variance in price that we see across neighborhoods due more to variance between neighborhoods or more from variance within neighborhoods. ","1501e69b":"# Feature Engineering\n\nIn order to make good predictions, our variables should describe the underlying factors that influence home prices. Sometimes, the data we are handed can be improved by taking a new view. For example, a given variable like __MisFeature__ may provide good information in a 'between the lines' sort of way. It has the following possible values:\n\n       Elev\tElevator\n       Gar2\t2nd Garage (if not described in garage section)\n       Othr\tOther\n       Shed\tShed (over 100 SF)\n       TenC\tTennis Court\n       NA\t  None\n\nFrom this variable we can ascertain whether or not a home has a large shed, or even a tennis court. But a large shed and a tennis court are two entirely different entities. A tennis court almost certainly adds more value to a home than a shed or a second garage. To bring that information to the forefront, we can split __MiscFeature__ into separate variables like __HasShed__, __HasTennis__, etc. While a predictive algorithm often can pick up on underlying information on its own, bringing these variables to the forefront make it more likely the model will succeed.\n\nBelow, I am adding some features to the data that I think may be useful:","16f8fa5f":"## Warmup 2: Checking Basic Intuitions\n\nAs our second warm up exercise, let's check our intuition that it's not just quantity but quality that counts toward final sale price:","83819a78":"With the exception of entry 949, missing basement data can also be chocked up to the home having no basement.

","6ab2b16b":"### Tuning Regularization Terms $\\alpha$ and $\\lambda$\n\nAccording to the XGBoost documentation, these parameters are analogous to the `l1` and `l2` regularization parameters. Even though I used K-Fold CV on my training set, and the results are good on the test set, my model performed much worse on the Leader Board data. This indicates to me that overfitting may still be an issue. For that reason, I have decided to tune these two parameters.","c34a212c":"# Exploratory Data Analysis of Home Prices \n\nThis first section will focus primarily on EDA and missing value imputation. I'm going to hide most of the code, so that it doesn't detract attention from the analysis. However, I will show code for the imputation of missing values, as I think many readers would benefit from it. My goal is to outline a process for building an intuition as to what variables are at play, and which have the greatest impact on sale price. I also want to evaluate relationships between variables because it will give insight on how we might intelligently fill missing data. After this analysis is complete, I will move on to predictive modeling.\n\nBecause predicting home prices is a regression problem, I'll be focusing my analysis on the following ideas (in no particular order):\n - __Variable Distributions__ - We will want to make sure that our continuous variables are normally distributed for the purposes of having well formed data to feed to our regression model. This includes our target variable, __SalePrice__.\n - __Finding and Dealing with Missing Data__ - In this final phase, we will analyze what variables have missing values, why they are missing and how we might deal with the missing data. For example, we will see that the variable __PoolQC__ which describes pool quality and condition has the majority of its entries missing. Should we keep the variable? Perhaps it is missing data, because it is associated with homes that don't have pools. Or should we drop it? Or create a new variable that simply describes \"Has Pool\" in a yes or no sort of way. \n - __Linearity of Continuous Variables__. If our variables have linear relationships with Sale Price, then when we get new, unseen data on for sale homes, the final sale price will be easier to predict. If our data does not have a linear relationship, then we must either transform the data, or consider non-linear regression models for prediction.\n - __Strength of association.__ Provided that a variable is related to Sale Price, how strong is that relationship? In other words, is a particular variable worth keeping or not? Often this can only be answered by making predictions with AND without the variable in question, then checking the accuracy of the prediction. Our analysis will simply give us an idea of what variables to experiment with.\n - __ANOVA F-Test of categorical variables against sale price.__ Unlike continuous variables, we can not necessarily determine traditional linear relationships between categories and continuous data. For example, we might easily be able to say \"The more little Timmy studies (variable X) the better his test scores (variable Y)\". However, let's say little Timmy has 3 math books to choose from and must study for an upcoming test. Now, variable X has possible values of book A, book B, or book C, while variable Y is still his test score. Because the books have no underlying rank or order, we cannot give them meaning through numbers. Without order, linear relationships are impossible. Instead we will use the idea of variance of outcome, based on textbook. Through ANOVA, we may look at the outcome of Timmy's test scores after using each of three books. While there may be differences between his test scores, we must dig deep to find out if those differences can really be attributed to his choice of study material. \n\n","6bd79461":"If we assume that any given neighborhood has a single zoning category, we can fill in missing __MSZoning__ data by looking at the associated neighborhood.

We appear to have a lot of information that is redundantly encoded in our variables. For example we would expect __TotRmsAbvGr__ would correlate to well to __BedroomAbvGr__, and we see exactly that. Sometimes it is beneficial to drop highly correlated predictor variables because many models operate much more efficiently on independent data. \n\n### Isolating Predictor vs Response Variable Association:\n\nWe want our predictor variables to be highly correlated with our outcome, so we will look at those values individually below:","833f2901":"Next, we want to address any gaps in the competition test data. These gaps will need to be filled before we can make good predictions, so let's go ahead and get it out of the way, too. \n\nFrom the below visualization of missing test data, we see that there is actually a more diverse range of missing values than in the training data. This means we may have to slightly tweak how we fill the gaps. ","787fcdca":"This time, it looks like there is zero information about this home's basement.

These are very different features, and so this variable may not be particularly useful. A shed will obviously add less value to a home than a tennis court.

Or, alternatively, we can extract these features and add them as their own variables. As it stands, I believe most algorithms would have a hard time with data such as this.

With a full dataset, we are almost ready to apply deeper statistical analysis of our data. However, in order to model our data's relationships, we must first convert our non-numeric data to number format.  \n\nWe will split our variables into their three types: __continuous, ordinal and nominal__.\n - __Continuous__ : variables whose values are on a continuous range, typically with an infinite number of possible values. Examples include a child's height, speed, or depth. \n - __Ordinal__ : variables whose values are discrete and finite, but which have underlying order. A variable that classifies disease severity into 'mild', 'moderate' and 'severe' is one such example. Only three values, non-continuous, but with an underlying rank.\n - __Nominal__ : variables whose values are discrete categories with no underlying order.

Here is a summary.\n\n## Relationships in the Data\n\n### Continuous Data\n\nThere is moderate to high correlation between sale price and the features describing lot size, above ground living area and garage size. Additionally, while the association appears to be linear in above grade living area and garage area. However, there is some indication of a non-linear relationship between lot area and sale price. It might be worth investigating, and is an indicator that the data needs to be transformed before applying machine learning. \n\nSome variables that did not show promising correlation to sale price:\n\n- __BsmtFinSF2__\n- __LowQualFinSF__\n- __3SsnPorch__\n- __PoolArea__\n- __MiscVal__\n\n### Categorical Data (Ordinal)\n\nMost of our variables seem to be a good fit for predictive modeling. The data that did not seem to be impactful (at least in a one vs. one comparison) is:\n\n- __BsmtFinType2__\n- __ExterCond__\n- __BsmtHalfBath__\n- __YearSold__\n- __Utilities__\n\nA couple notable exceptions are the low association between __SalePrice__ and __ExterCond__, which was unexpected.\n\nAdditionally, there is an inverse association with __OverallCond__. This seems to indicate that better overall condition of a home negatively impacts sale price. This is unlikely to be true, and so I will address this and other issues below in the 'caveats' section.\n\n### Categorical Data (Nominal)\n\nMost of our nominal data seems to impact sale price. There are some indications that the following variables might not, however:\n\n- __HasTennis__\n- __HasGar2__\n\n### Caveats\n\nCorrelation\/association at a univariate level is not necessarily an indicator of true association when there are many variables at play in the data. It is important to note that things get complicated (i.e. Simpson's Paradox) when more than one variable is at play. For this reason we will not immediately dismiss the above variables that do not seem to have a strong relationship with sale price. At first, we will include them, and then if our predictions need improvement, we will experiment with removing some of them.\n\nSecond, we did not focus on the interrelations between independent predictor variables. Leaving in highly correlated variables can cause over-fitting (the phenomenon where the machine learning model knows the data it learned on very well, but cannot predict with accuracy the outcome with never before seen data). However, since we expect that the new data will have identical multicollinearity (because the training data is a random subset of all of the data), I hope that it will not cause any issues. ","9c8c89aa":"## Hyper-Parameter Tuning\nWe will iteratively tune a couple of parameters at a time. This is a time consuming process, because for each possible parameter value in the grid, `GridSearchCV` is performing k-fold cross validation. Therefore, if you wish to reduce tuning time, you may pass `cv=3` or `cv=2` into the `GridSearchCV` object. It defaults to 5 folds. \n\nThis operation can take 10-20 minutes per round of tuning, depending on your machine's performance.\n\n### Tuning `max_depth` and `min_child_weight`:\nWe will tune these two parameters first, over a grid of values incremented by two. After the first round of tuning we will select the best parameters and tune again from one below to one above the first results.","6ec8a4b0":"### Tuning the number of trees and learning rate:\n\n`n_estimators` is the parameter that dictates the number of trees to iteratively add to the model.

","d446ef4e":"## Looking at Relationships Between Variables:\n\nNow, we must consider the association between our predictor variables and our response variable. Because we are dealing with a continuous response variable, but have some categorical features, we will have to think carefully about how to measure association. \n\n### Broad Overview by Heatmap (Ordinal\/Ranked and Continuous Data):\n\nWe will work first with our ranked\/ordinal and continuous variables, as traditional \"correlation\" is easier to see with these types of variables. This is because correlation, by definition, is a measure of the strength of a linear relationship. Linear relationships only occur among data that can be measured continuously, or discrete data whose levels are evenly spaced in their impact. For the ordinal data, I propose either using Kendall's $\\tau$ or descritizing sale prices and using Goodman and Kruskal's $\\gamma$. Since Kendall's $\\tau$ is included in the scikit learn library, we need not write our own method. \n\nFirst, let's take a high level look of all of our candidate variables' relationships with heatmaps:","79642d98":"So indeed, all 690 instances of missing data in __FireplaceQu__ are associated with homes that don't have fireplaces. According to the variable description, these values should be \"NA\" not \"NaN\".

Namely, the data dictionary specifies a value of 'NA' or 'None' when the home doesn't have the feature in question. However, when I inspect the dataset, there are a lot of 'NaN' values instead. So we'll go through the above variables and determine the answer to 'Does this feature exist in this home?'. If the feature does not exist, we will insert a value of 'NA' or 'None'. If it turns out the feature does exist, we will fill the missing value with either the mode (for categorical data) or the median value (for continuous data).","b03772ad":"### Tuning `gamma`:\nWe'll now tune our regressor for gamma, holding the parameters we have already tuned fixed.","520e0227":"The above graphic describes each predictor variable's correlation to sale price, in descending order. Some interesting relationships stand out, one example being __GarageCars__ being moderately negatively correlated to Sale Price. We see the same interesting reverse correlation between __LotShape__ where apparently sale price tends to go up as the shape of the lot becomes more irregular. \n\nThis view of variable relationships is somewhat naive. When one or two variables are at play, univariate analysis is more trustworthy. However, when we begin to include more variables, there are cases where the apparent (calculated) correlation and the true correlation between the two variables is very much different (sometimes even completely reversed). One such phenomenon is called \"Simpson's Paradox\".\n\nAdditionally, traditional __Pearson's $r$__ correlation typically used for continuous data only measure's linear relationships. 'Spearman's rho ($\\rho$)', however is used to detect monotonic increase or decrease, and is therefore better suited to find both linear and non-linear relationships. In fact, if we see that  $\\rho$ is much greater than $r$, it is a sign that there is a non-linear relationship between the two variables in question. \n\n","0211daa0":"Our response variable appears to be right skewed, so is a candidate for log transformation.
