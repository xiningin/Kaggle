Run the following cell to set up the feedback system.","50e89613":"**[Data Visualization Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/data-visualization)**\n\n---\n","528216d9":"## Step 2: Specify the filepath\n\nNow that the dataset is attached to the notebook, you can find its filepath.  To do this, use the **Workspace** menu to list the set of files, and click on the CSV file you'd like to use.  This will open the CSV file in a tab below the notebook.  You can find the filepath towards the top of this new tab.  \n\n![ex6_filepath](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EssGpuJ.png)\n\nAfter you find the filepath corresponding to your dataset, fill it in as the value for `my_filepath` in the code cell below, and run the code cell to check that you've provided a valid filepath.  For instance, in the case of this example dataset, we would set\n```\nmy_filepath = \"..\/input\/fivethirtyeight-comic-characters-dataset\/dc-wikia-data.csv\"\n```  \nNote that **you must enclose the filepath in quotation marks**; otherwise, the code will return an error.\n\nOnce you've entered the filepath, you can close the tab below the notebook by clicking on the **[X]** at the top of the tab.","4a9e0998":"## Step 1: Attach a dataset to the notebook\n\nBegin by selecting a CSV dataset from [Kaggle Datasets](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasets).  If you're unsure how to do this or would like to work with your own data, please revisit the instructions in the previous tutorial.\n\nOnce you have selected a dataset, click on the **[+ Add Data]** option in the top right corner.  This will generate a pop-up window that you can use to search for your chosen dataset.  \n\n![ex6_search_dataset](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cIIWPUS.png)\n\nOnce you have found the dataset, click on the **[Add]** button to attach it to the notebook.  You can check that it was successful by looking at the **Data** dropdown menu to the right of the notebook -- look for an **input** folder containing a subfolder that matches the name of the dataset.\n\n![ex6_dataset_added](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XOCpdak.png)\n\nYou can click on the carat to the right of the name of the dataset to double-check that it contains a CSV file.  For instance, the image below shows that the example dataset contains two CSV files: (1) **dc-wikia-data.csv**, and (2) **marvel-wikia-data.csv**.\n\n![ex6_dataset_dropdown](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UZOsR6S.png)\n\nOnce you've uploaded a dataset with a CSV file, run the code cell below **without changes** to receive credit for your work!","9dd83685":"**_After the code cell above is marked correct_**, run the code cell below without changes to view the first five rows of the data.","7c4971c4":"## Step 3: Load the data\n\nUse the next code cell to load your data file into `my_data`.  Use the filepath that you specified in the previous step.","d8d88202":"## Step 4: Visualize the data\n\nUse the next code cell to create a figure that tells a story behind your dataset.  You can use any chart type (_line chart, bar chart, heatmap, etc_) of your choosing!","b93cc4e9":"Now it's time for you to demonstrate your new skills with a project of your own!\n\nIn this exercise, you will work with a dataset of your choosing.  Once you've selected a dataset, you'll design and create your own plot to tell interesting stories behind the data!\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.","139988ff":"---\n**[Data Visualization Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/data-visualization)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
