The data consists of 10 variables: 'Daily Time Spent on Site', 'Age', 'Area Income', 'Daily Internet Usage', 'Ad Topic Line', 'City', 'Male', 'Country', Timestamp' and 'Clicked on Ad'.*\n\n*The main variable we are interested in is 'Clicked on Ad'. This variable can have two possible outcomes: 0 and 1 where 0 refers to the case where a user didn't click the advertisement, while 1 refers to the scenario where a user clicks the advertisement.*\n\n*We will see if we can use the other 9 variables to accurately predict the value 'Clicked on Ad' variable.

This implies that users of the age between 20 and 40 years can be the main target group for the marketing campaign. Hypothetically, if we have a product intended for middle-aged people, this is the right site for advertising. Conversely, if we have a product intended for people over the age of 60, it would be a mistake to advertise on this site.*"}}
