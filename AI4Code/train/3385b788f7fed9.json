Was your idea too easy? Too hard? Just right?\n* If you had unlimited time, what would you add to this project?","f423419e":"I am going to do a project like the president project except it tells you what homoework youshowuld do first. I will expand it to take multiple answers as well.  ","3a099c34":"You will have one of two options for this project. \n\nBoth options must include:\n* At least one logical operator (and, or, not)\n* Conditional statements\n\n\n**Option 1: President Project**\n\nWrite a program that reports whether or not someone is eligible to run for president in the U.S. You should do the following in your program:\n\nAsk the user for their age and store it in a variable.\n\nAsk the user if they were born in the U.S.\n\nAsk the user how long they\u2019ve been a resident in the U.S.\n\nUse an if\/else statement with the proper comparison operator to print You are eligible to run for president! if they have the following credentials:\n\n* They are at least 35 years old\n* They were born in the U.S.\n* They have been a resident for at least 14 years\n\nAlso, print why the user is not allowed to run for president.\n\nAn example run of your program might look like this:\n```\nAge: 19\nBorn in the U.S.? (Yes\/No): Yes\nYears of Residency: 19\nYou are not eligible to run for president.\nYou are too young. You must be at least 35 years old.\n```\n\u2026 or like this:\n```\nAge: 40\nBorn in the U.S.? (Yes\/No): No\nYears of Residency: 5\nYou are not eligible to run for president.\nYou must be born in the U.S. to run for president.\nYou have not been a resident for long enough.\n```\n\nWant to make it better?\n* Allow a variety of yes or no answers (ex. 'yes', 'Yes', 'YES', 'yEs'...)\n* Tell the user whether they are eligible to run for Congress. To run for Congress, you must be at least 25 years old and have been a citizen for at least 7 years. Also, they must live in the state they want to represent.\n* If the user is eligible to become president, point them to online resources about how to run for president.\n* Allow the user to choose their country at the start. Then, ask questions relevant to running for president\/ prime minister of that country. You will have to look up the requirements for other countries.\n\n**Option 2: Buzzfeed Quiz**\n\nTo explain this choice, take [this buzzfeed quiz.](https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/abelle13\/design-your-room-in-the-loft-and-ill-tell-you-wh-f1qwgbjsa6)\n\nYou will be creating a quiz like this. You must use logical operators (and, or not). Include at least 4 unique results for each of at least 4 questions. Use the same questions every time. \n\nFor example, for the New Girl quiz, if someone chooses option a for question 1 **and** option 3 for question 2, then they are Jess. Here is some example output:\n\n```\nWhich New Girl Character are you??\n\nDo you consider yourself sporty or artsy? artsy\n\nDo you spend more than an hour getting ready in the morning, or less? more\n\nWhich job would you rather have: modeling or working in business? business\n\nYou are Schmidt! \n```\n\nMake sure you are using logical operators. In this example, the person is Schmidt because they chose artsy **and** more than an hour **and** business. \n\nYou may use an existing BuzzFeed quiz that already exists, coding the logic to show your undestanding of the program inputs, commands, and output. \n\n","32a240f9":"Type your name here","5f7df79e":"### Rubric","0965857e":"# Project: Boolean Variables & Operators"}}
