Unfortunatelly, this is not the case.\nThere can be 2 reasons for that:\n- First, sum of the students total_weight value doesn't adds up to 200 (Total weight of all assessments for all modules). This implies that these students failed to attempt all of the assessments.\n    - If this is the case, students would get a 0 for their unattempted assessments.\n    - \"mark\" variable is calculated with this approach by assigning a 0 for missing assessment marks.\n\n\n\n- Second interpretation can be, eventhough these students have attempted more assessments than given in the dataset, marks of other assessments are not included in the dataset.\n    - If this is the case, unattempted assessments are ignored.\n    - Weighted average of the assessment marks that are included in the dataset (attempted assessments) are calculated and recorded as \"adjusted_mark\". \n","c62568a9":"- Orange and green distributions are getting wider towards the upper side of the graph.

High attempted_weight suggest trusting on adjusted_mark or mark whereas if it is low, relying on final_result label makes more sense.**\n\n\n\n**For students with \"Distinction\"**\n- If they have attempted_weight of 200 (attempted all assessments), their final_result will be decided according to adjusted_mark and mark (same in this case). In this case individual assessment marks are more trustworthy compared to final_result value because they add up to expected value 200.\n- If they have attempted_weight between 150 and 200;\n    - If adjusted_mark> 70 --> accept as it is\n    - If adjusted_mark < 70 --> grey points, leave as it is\n- If they have attempted_weight lower than 150, uncertainity is high for adjusted_mark. Therefore, we will mostly trust on final_result labels.These points will be ordered according to \"mark\" value and retaining their order, their adjusted_mark value will be assigned between 70 and 100 according to their order.\n    \n   \n\n**For students with \"Pass\"**\n- If they have attempted_weight of 200 (attempted all assessments), their final_result will be decided according to adjusted_mark and mark (same in this case).\n- If they have attempted_weight between 150 and 200, \n    - If adjusted_mark > 80 --> accept adjusted_mark, assign Distinction\n    - If adjusted_mark < 80 --> grey points, leave as it is\n\n- If they have attempted_weight lower than 150, again, high uncertainty of \"mark\". Therefore, we will mostly trust on final_result labels.These points will be ordered according to mark value and retaining their order, their adjusted_mark value will be assigned between 40 and 70 according to their order. This approach is used again because with decreasing total_weight, we mostly rely on already given final_result value. Therefore, assigned adjusted_mark according to given \"Pass\" label.\n    \n    \n**For students with \"Fail\"**\n- If they have attempted_weight of 200 (attempted all assessments), their final_result will be decided according to adjusted_mark and mark (same in this case).\n- If they have attempted_weight between 150 and 200,\n    - mark > 40 --> adjusted_mark = mark and label = \"Pass\"\n    - mark < 40 --> grey points, leave as it is\n- If they have attempted_weight lower than 150. Again, uncertainity is high. Rely on final_result.Same approach will be followed as in \"Pass\" and \"Distinction\" sections. These values will be ordered according to mark value and retaining their order, their adjusted_mark value will be assigned between 0 and 40 according to their order.\n    ","0b2177f5":"Module CCC adds up to 300 and module GGG adds up to 100 -- these 2 will be investigated.","591ce321":"<a id=\"section2\"><\/a>\n# 2.Data Cleansing\nThis part of the notebook will focus on handling the missing values and semantic errors.","c586f13e":"<a id=\"section2.1\"><\/a>\n## 2.1 Missing Values","2f80a060":"<a id=\"section1\"><\/a>\n# 1.

Opposite is correct for \"resource\".\n\n- \"total_clicks\" is an interesting feature because it can be evaluated as a measure of efficiency. Again, we see that group1 students have a higher rate of mark increase due to unit increase in total_clicks. \n\nThese results suggest that if a student is a member of group2, she\/he may consider to use \"resource\" page to study. This is side of VLE that group2 students benefit more than group1 students. \n\nOn the other hand, group1 students may choose to focus on \"outcontent\" or \"questionnaire\" which they create more value spending time in this pages compared to group2 students.\n\nThe analysis performed above investigate one aspect in online education --Personalisation-- which can totally change the way we learn in the future. Personalisation is much convinient in online education compared to traditional in-class style. \n\n**It is important to note that the observed relationship above between student success and type of study resource is a correlation and we are not able establish a causation relationship because it requires a controled study whereas the data is observational.**\n\n**In order to clearly state the differences between causation and correlation, one example could be the relationship between cancer risk of a person and carrying a lighter which is a positive correlation. On the other hand, causation is the relationship between cancer risk and smoking. If we investigate people carrying lighter, we would see that these people would be more likely to get cancer eventhough carrying lighter obviously doesn't have any affect on health.**"}}
