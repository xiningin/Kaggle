It has a lot of options, flexibility and functions for reading and processing data.\n\nOne of the challenges with using pandas for reading large datasets is it's conservative nature while infering data types of the columns of a dataset often resulting in unnecessary large memory usage for the pandas dataframe. You can pre-define optimal data types of the columns (based on prior knowledge or sample inspection) and provide it explicitly while reading the dataset.\n\nThis is the method used in the [official starter notebook of the RiiiD competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sohier\/competition-api-detailed-introduction) as well.\n\nDocumentation: https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/docs\/","2cfa0400":"## Format: pickle\nPython objects can be stored in the form of pickle files and pandas has inbuilt functions to read and write dataframes as pickle objects.\n\nRead more: https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/pickle.html","1c0220e4":"## Large datasets\n![dataset.png](attachment:dataset.png)\n\n> As a Data Scientist or Kaggler, we crave for more data\n\nHow many times have you complained about not having good enough data for working on a particular problem? Plenty I'm sure.   \nHow many times have you complained about having too much data to work with? Maybe not many but it's still a better problem to have.\n\nThe most common resolution in the scenario of having too much data is using a part\/sample of it that fits in the RAM available. But that leads to wastage of the unused data and sometimes loss of information. Many times there are ways to overcome this challenge without the need of subsampling. A single solution might not cater to all requirements and so different solutions can work in different scenarios.\n\nThis notebook aims to describe and summarize some of these techniques. The [Riiid! Answer Correctness Prediction](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/riiid-test-answer-prediction) dataset is quite a nice sample to experiment on since the plain vanilla ***pd.read_csv*** will result in an out-of-memory error on Kaggle Notebooks. It has over 100 million rows and 10 columns.\n\nDifferent packages have their own way of reading data. The methods explored in the notebook (Default ***pandas*** and rest alphabetically):\n\n* [Pandas](#Method:-Pandas)\n* [Dask](#Method:-Dask)\n* [Datatable](#Method:-Datatable)\n* [Rapids](#Method:-Rapids)\n\nApart from methods of reading data from the raw csv files, it is also common to convert the dataset into another format which uses lesser disk space, is smaller in size and\/or can be read faster for subsequent reads. The file types explored in the notebook (Default ***csv*** and rest alphabetically):\n\n* [csv](#Format:-csv)\n* [feather](#Format:-feather)\n* [hdf5](#Format:-hdf5)\n* [jay](#Format:-jay)\n* [parquet](#Format:-parquet)\n* [pickle](#Format:-pickle)\n\nNote that just reading data is not the end of the story. The final decision of which method to use should also consider the downstream tasks and processes of the data that will be required to run. But that is outside the scope of this notebook.\n\nYou will also find that for different datasets or different environments, there will be different methods that work best. So there is no clear winner as such.\n\nFeel free to share other approaches that can be added to this list.","ff77fffe":"## Methods\nBefore exploring various methods let's once confirm that reading the dataset using the default pandas setting fails.","02271955":"All the formats of the dataset (except csv since it's already provided in the competition) are available in this dataset: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rohanrao\/riiid-train-data-multiple-formats","5dde7a84":"## There is no winner or loser\n![choice.png](attachment:choice.png)\n\nEach method has it's own set of pros and cons. Some examples are:   \n* **Pandas** requires a lot more RAM to handle large datasets.\n* **Dask** can be slow at times especially with transformations that cannot be parallelized.\n* **Datatable** doesn't have a very exhaustive set of data processing functions.\n* **Rapids** is not useful if you don't have a GPU.\n\nSo it's a good idea to explore various options and finally choose whichever appropriately fits the requirements. I strongly believe in not marrying a technology and continuously adapting to newer ideas, better approaches and ultimately the best possible solutions for building data science pipelines.\n\nEven in my personal experience I've found different approaches working well on different datasets.
