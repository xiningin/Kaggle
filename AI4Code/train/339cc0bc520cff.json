We will predict the sales of the products in the stores.\n\n# XGBoost\nThis is a Machine Learning algorithm that deals with structured data, and uses the gradient boosting (GBM) framework at its core.\n\nBoosting is a sequential technique which works on the principle of an ensemble. It combines a set of weak learners and delivers improved prediction accuracy. At any instant t, the model outcomes are weighted based on the outcomes of previous instant t-1. The oucomes predicted correctly are given a lower weight and the ones miss-classified are weighted higher.\n\nThus the basic idea behind boosting algorithms is building a weak model, making conclusions about the various feature importance and parameters, and then using those conclusions to build a new, stronger model and capitalize on the misclassification error of the previous model and try to reduce it. \n\nThe default base learners of XGBoost are tree ensembles. The tree ensemble model is a set of classification and regression trees (CART). Trees are grown one after another, and attempts to reduce the misclassification rate are made in subsequent iterations. \n\n\n","d2632de3":"Only Item_Weight and Outlet_Size have missing values.\n\nItem_Weight is a continuous variable.
