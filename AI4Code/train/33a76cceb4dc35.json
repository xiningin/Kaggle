The potential for electricity to be generated from solar sources can avoid emissions from electricity from fossil fuels.\n\n#### Societal Impact\n\nJob creation: when cities or companies decide to build and operate solar energy facilities, the projects often help to create numerous jobs.\n\nEconomics: with more people able to find employment as a result of the increased number of jobs created by the development and operation of solar energy panels, more people would have money to contribute to a nation's economy. Also, manufacturing solar energy is less expensive than burning fossil fuels, which is the traditional method of generating electricity.\n\nHealth: generating energy from solar panels emits very little pollution into the air, and thus solar energy is a much cleaner source of energy than the burning of fossil fuels. Cities or areas that decide to use solar energy to power the buildings would thus enjoy a cleaner quality of air in the region, which in turn can make the citizens and workers in the area healthier.\n\n#### Methodology\n\nGoogle Insights Explorer estimates the technical solar potential of all buildings in a region. Knowledge about building shapes is calculated using a machine learning algorithm using data from Google Maps and overhead imagery.\n\nTechnical potential includes electricity generated by the rooftop area suitable for solar panels assuming economics and grid integration are not a constraint. There are many definitions of technical potential and other definitions may affect results by 25% or more. Based on their definition of technical potential, installations meet the following criteria:\n\n**Sunlight**: Every included panel receives at least 75% of the maximum annual sun in the area.\n\n**Installation size**: Every included roof has a total potential installation size of at least 2kW.\n\n**Space and obstacles**: Only areas of the roof with enough space to install 4 adjacent solar panels are included. Obstacles like chimneys are considered.\n\n\n#### Unit\n\nMetric tons of yearly CO2 savings\n\n#### KPI Score Conversion\n\nGiven that the name of the cities were note consistent, we complete the following steps to join datasets:\n\n1.

Project Sunroof\nProject Sunroof primarily works to encourage the private adoption of solar energy by providing a set of tools to facilitate the purchase and installation of solar panels. Using data from Google Maps to calculate shadows from nearby structures and trees and taking into account historical weather and temperature patterns, the Project Sunroof website calculates how much money a user can expect to save yearly by making use of solar power. In addition, the Project Sunroof website also provides a list of local solar power retailers capable of installing solar panels in that area\n\n***Considerations:***\nAt this current time, rooftop solar potential data is only available for cities in the United States.\n\n***Data Usage:***\nOpen sourced data for Project Sunroof is available at the Census Tract and postal code level and hosted as part of Google's BigQuery public datasets. For the analysis in this notebook, geospatial analysis was completed to map the Census Tract data to the regions involved in the CDP study.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.google.com\/get\/sunroof)\n","3484e93f":"When assessing social inequality in a region, it is important to recognize that many of the indicators intersect and overlap with each other. For example, inequality in wealth can influence access to health care, housing opportunities, access to education and job opportunities. (2) This too can be considered when discussing indicators or determinants that influence climate change. For example, increasing levels of C02 emissions can have serious consequences for humans and their environment. Potential effects on human activity can results in increases in water depletion, a greater number of hazardous weather events which then lead to infrastructure damage, changes in food supply, and water quality. Building an automated insight generation system dependent on performance indicators that considers these factors, can help cities develop or adapt their plan and can also assess the efficacy of plans that are also in progress.\n\nReferences\n\n(1)- https:\/\/www.un.org\/esa\/desa\/papers\/2017\/wp152_2017.pdf \n\n(2)- https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14693062.2019.1596873","c31e06b6":"<a id=\"section-toc\"><\/a>\n\n<table background=none >\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th style=\"text-align:center\">Section<\/th>\n            <th style=\"text-align:center\">KPI Name<\/th>\n            <th style=\"text-align:center\">Type<\/th>\n        <\/tr>\n    <\/thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td style=\"text-align:center\" rowspan=5>\n                <a href=\"#section-one\">1.

It is useful in setting energy use benchmarks and goals. Energy consumption can include electricity, fuel oil, natural gas, steam and other forms of thermal energy.\n\nThe energy consumption in a building is split between grid electricity used for activities such as lighting and fuel combustion used for heating or cooking. The total energy consumption can be broken out by percentage for each.\n\nLow values should be pursued.\n\nA declining trend is positive.\n\n\n#### Methodology\n\nFor a given year, calculate as:\n\nNumerator: Total kilowatt-hours for all non-residential buildings in a city\n\nDenominator: Total squared meters of non-residential floor space in a city. Floor space is a measurement of the total three-dimensional area of the unit that is enclosed from weather by exterior walls, which is also where most energy-consuming activities occur.\n\n#### Unit\n\nRatio: Total kilowatt-hours for all buildings in a city\/ Total squared meters of non-residential floor space in a city.\n\n#### KPI Score Conversion\n\nGiven that the name of the cities were note consistent, we complete the following steps to join datasets:\n\n1.

Housing is usually the principal economic asset of poor urban households, providing not only shelter and personal security, but also often their livelihood. Damage or loss to housing, due to a natural hazard, together with essential domestic possessions, therefore, places enormous strain on household economies, given the high monetary cost of replacing lost assets. Urban poverty is understood to have many additional dimensions - including inadequate provision of infrastructure and basic services. \n\n#### Methodology\n\nFor any given year we calculate this as a ratio of number of individuals with an income after taxes and transfers that is less than 60% of the median income over the total number individuals in a region.\n\n#### Unit\n\nRatio.\n\n#### KPI Score Conversion\n\nGiven that the name of the cities were note consistent, we complete the following steps to join datasets:\n\n1.

Cities that are successful in keeping temperatures below the threshold can reduce their energy usage and therefore mitigate CO2 emissions.\n\n\n#### Methodology\n\nDegree days assume that when the outside temperature is 18\u00b0C, we don't need heating or cooling to be comfortable. Degree days are the difference between the daily temperature mean, (high temperature plus low temperature divided by two) and 18\u00b0C. If the temperature mean is above 27\u00b0C, we subtract 27\u00b0C from the mean and the result is Cooling Degree Days. If the temperature mean is below 18\u00b0C, we subtract the mean from 18\u00b0C and the result is Heating Degree Days.\n\n#### Unit\n\nTotal number of days exceeding temperature thresholds (Upper: 27\u00b0C \/Lower: 18\u00b0C)\n\n#### KPI Score Conversion\n\nGiven that the name of the cities were note consistent, we complete the following steps to join datasets:\n\n1.

Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Here we consider water depletion where higher values indicate a larger impact on the local water supply and decreased water availability for downstream users. \n\nBaseline water depletion is similar to baseline water stress; however, instead of looking at total water withdrawal (consumptive plus non-consumptive), baseline water depletion is calculated using consumptive withdrawal only.\n\n\n#### Societal Impact\n\nA lack of water due to high water depletion can pose a major obstacle to economic prosperity with many sectors relying on the precious resource in their operations. \n\nThese macroeconomic ramifications can have far-ranging consequences on an individual level as well. With the slowing of business operations leading to reduced profits, businesses are likely to be forced into laying off some of their workforces, leading to reduced consumer spending power among vulnerable communities.\n\n#### Unit\n\nRisk rating from 0-5.\n\n#### KPI Score Conversion\n\nGiven that we needed to map the meaurement points to the CDP cities, we complete the following steps to join datasets:\n\n1.

These 8 areas relate to both environmental and social issues in the assessment of cities participating in the CDP surveys. Within these areas, there are KPIs that are related to direct CDP survey responses while others explore opportunities to further delve into the assessment of the efficacy of a city meeting their goals. \n\nThe framework for developing effective performance measurements was to link indicator outputs to potential actionable outcomes that participating cities were already partaking in or could potentially invest in towards creating an environmentally sustainable society. A key part of this framework was to also identify, where possible, the potential social impact within a city that intersects and stands to be affected by the established KPI factors. As a result, the KPIs that have been developed were based on the following criteria:\n\n1.\tThe indicator is already being measured or could be measure and the data is currently available\n2.\tThere are appropriate baselines that exist for comparison to measure between cities\n3.\tThe measurement can show change over time for adaptation and modification of actionable outcomes\n4.\t The indicator is meaningful on both at a local (city) and global (country) scale \n\nOur KPIs also fall under one of three types of indicators:\n\n1.\tInput KPIs: are measures of the resources that go into a service\n2.\tOutput KPIs: are direct measures of the results of the deployment of resources. Often referred to as service management KPIs, they measure short-term changes as a result of inputs\n3.\tImpact KPIs: reflect long-term effects that are closely related to the purpose of the activity. Many cannot be measured within program timeframes. They usually involve changes to well-being or performance as a result of behaviour change.\n\n**NOTE:** When developing our KPIs we recognized that KPIs directly related to the CDP survey data questions were all input KPIs.\n\nIn total we developed 39 KPIs amongst the 8 areas of concentration we identified. For each of our impact and output KPIs we discuss the rationale and relevance, societal impact, methodology, units of measurement and data sources. Each of our input KPI\u2019s are directly drawn from the CDP City Questionare responses. The questions involved primarily contain binary responses or are drawn from fixed set of response options. \n","56bc4423":"<a id=\"section-seven-eight\"><\/a>\n\n### 7.8 Riverine Flood Risk\n\n#### Description \n\nHere we look at the percentage of the population expected to be affected by river flooding in any given year.\n\n#### Rationale\n\nFlood risk is assessed using hazard (inundation caused by river overflow), exposure (population in flood zone), and vulnerability. The existing level of flood protection is also incorporated into the risk calculation. It is important to note that this indicator represents flood risk not in terms of maximum possible impact but rather as average annual impact. The impacts from infrequent, extreme flood years are averaged with more common, less frequent flood years to produce the \u201cexpected annual affected population.\u201d \n\nHigher values indicate that a greater proportion of the population is expected to be impacted by riverine floods on average.\n\n#### Societal Impact\n\nImmediate impacts of flooding include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, non-functioning of infrastructure facilities and deterioration of health condition owing to waterborne diseases. In addition, economic activities come to a standstill, resulting in dislocation and the dysfunction of normal life for a period much beyond the duration of the flooding. Similarly, the direct effect on production assets, be it in agriculture or industry, can inhibit regularly activity and lead to loss of livelihoods. The spillover effects of the loss of livelihoods can be felt in business and commercial activities even in adjacent non-flooded areas and can more adversely affect individual in lower socio-economics groups.\n\n\n#### Unit\n\nRisk rating from 0-5.\n\n#### KPI Score Conversion\n\nGiven that we needed to map the meaurement points to the CDP cities, we complete the following steps to join datasets:\n\n1.

Tectonic hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and mountain avalanches are a result of the movement of the Earth\u2019s crust. These types of hazards are generally not preventable and usually unpredictable. Climactic hazards such as flooding, tropical storms, and droughts occurs when a particular region as has specific weather conditions that results in such weather events. Such hazard risks are increasing due to population growth, urbanization, pressure on marginal land and changes to the natural environment. In addition, due to climate change and increasing global surface temperatures, the possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for more powerful storms to develop. More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical storms. Rising sea levels expose higher locations not usually subjected to the power of the sea and to the erosive forces of waves and currents.

The existing level of flood protection is also incorporated into the risk calculation. It is important to note that this indicator represents flood risk not in terms of maximum possible impact but rather as average annual impact.

In addition, economic activities come to a standstill, resulting in dislocation and the dysfunction of normal life for a period much beyond the duration of the flooding. Similarly, the direct effect on production assets, be it in agriculture or industry, can inhibit regularly activity and lead to loss of livelihoods.

They are interconnected as water quality has a huge impact on water supply and oftentimes can also determine the supply availability and options. Water quality standards for surface waters can vary significantly in regions due to different environmental conditions, ecosystems, and the reliance from both commercial and residential uses. There are two main ways in which we can classify water use. One type is in-stream use; this includes hydroelectric power, boating and swimming, for example. While in-stream activities do not use up the water, they can degrade the water quality through pollution. The other type of water use is the withdrawal of water, and this classification includes household use, industry use, irrigation, livestock watering and thermal and nuclear power. Most withdrawals are consumptions, meaning that the activity uses the water and does not return it to the source.

Our framework for our KPIs are discussed in more detail in the methodology section of the notebook.  \n\n2.\t**Data Selection**: the quality of composite indicators depends largely on the quality of individual indicators. Indicators should be selected on the basis of their analytical soundness, measurability, relevance to the phenomenon being measured, and relationship to each other. Our relevance, soundness, and measurability of our KPIs is discussed in further detail under each KPI section. The criteria for our KPIs are discussed in the methodology section.\n\n3.\t**Imputation of Missing Data**: in most statistical series, composite indicators are plagued by problems of missing values. In many cases, data are only available for a limited number of areas or only for certain data components. Missing values can render the composite indicator less reliable for the areas for which only limited information is available and can distort the relative standing of all indicators in the composite. For our index we account for missing data by using two approaches. (1) When there was sufficient regional data, we used a nearest neighbour approach to impute missing values (2) When the data for a certain KPI was only available for a limited subset of cities, we did not impute values given the risk of the value potentially representing incomparable areas (we took the average index of the remaining indicators)\n\n4.\t**Multivariate Analysis**: multivariate analysis can be helpful in assessing the suitability of the dataset and providing an understanding of the implications of the methodological choices (e.g. weighting, aggregation) during the development of a composite indicator. For our index, we considered the principal component\/factor analysis, however due to the fact a significant amount of the input KPIs are binary indicators, this would affect the performance and usefulness of index. Instead we opted to use cluster analysis, to group comparable cities in terms of their similarity with respect to the different regional characteristics.  \n\n5.\t**Normalisation**: indicators are expressed in a variety of statistical units, ranges or scales. First, they must be adjusted on dimensions such as size\/population\/income and smoothed through time against cyclical variability. Next, they need to be put on a common basis to avoid adding up apples and pears. Normalisation serves this purpose. For our index we used a combination of normalisation techniques to ensure that cities and KPIs were compared appropriately. These techniques included min-max scaling and percentile ranking.\n\n6.\t**Weighting**: weights usually have an important impact on the composite indicator value and on the resulting ranking especially whenever higher weight is assigned to indicators on which some regions excel or fail. Weighting methods can be statistical, based on public\/expert opinion, or both. For our index we used a relative weighing scheme that is in line with those used by the [Climate Change Performance Index](https:\/\/www.climate-change-performance-index.org\/methodology), with modification made to accomodate the additional factors.\n\n7.\t**Aggregating Indicators**: aggregation combines the values of a set of indicators into a single summary \u2018composite\u2019 or \u2018aggregate\u2019 measure. For our index we took the average of the normalised scores.\n\n8.\t**Sensitivity Analysis**: sensitivity analysis quantifies the uncertainty caused by each individual assumption, which identifies particularly sensitive assumptions which might merit closer consideration. For our index we implemented a sensitivity assessment based on the imputation method leveraged. We compare the distributions of the index scores based on the two imputation schemes leveraged in order to assess the stability of the results. \n\n\nPlease see below a summary report documenting key findings of our CDP Index about each city which highlights the best performing cities, and making comparisons between regions. Using this index, cities can learn from each other as they establish their own policies and actions plan and pivot and make adaptations to existing plans to minimize their environmental footprint, accommodate population growth, promote economic opportunity all taking into account social inequality and creating opportunities for citizens within lower socioeconomic groups.\n\n","20e2ae9a":"### Comparisons to CDP Responses","541fcbb8":"<a id=\"section-six-two\"><\/a>\n\n### 6.2 Emission reduction action plan in place\n\n#### Description \n\nHere we specifically look at data provided from the CDP Cities Questionaire.

A composite indicator is formed when individual indicators are compiled into a single index, on the basis of an underlying model of a multi-dimensional concept that is being measured. \n\nThere are currently a number of existing indices that tackle various aspects of climate change. The two that we identified as a foundation for to help build the CDP Sustainability Index are the following:\n\nClimate Change Performance Index (CCPI): the CCPI is an independent monitoring tool of countries\u2019 climate protection performance. It aims to enhance transparency in international climate politics and enables the comparability of climate protection efforts and progress made by individual countries. The ranking results are defined by a country\u2019s aggregated performance in 14 indicators within the four categories \u201cGHG Emissions\u201d, \u201cRenewable Energy\u201d and \u201cEnergy Use\u201d, as well as on \u201cClimate Policy\u201d.

Using 32 performance indicators across 11 issue categories, the EPI ranks 180 countries on environmental health and ecosystem vitality (2)\n\nReferences:\n\n1: https:\/\/www.climate-change-performance-index.org\/ \n\n2: https:\/\/epi.yale.edu\/ \n","6e57ad4b":"<a id=\"section-seven-seven\"><\/a>\n\n### 7.7 Exposed Economic Capital Stock (Susceptibility to environmental conditions)\n\n#### Description \n\nHere we look at the regional estimates of the economic value of the exposed assets, as well as their physical characteristics in urban and rural scenarios including an estimation of population too. The global exposure dataset is developed at 1km spatial resolution at coastal areas and at 5km spatial resolution everywhere else on the globe. It includes economic value, number of residents, and construction type of residential, commercial and industrial buildings, as well as hospitals and schools.\n\n#### Rationale\n\nThis information is key to assess the potential damages from different environmental natural hazards to each of the exposed elements. \n\nHigher values indicate regions with a larger potential disaster impact.\n\n#### Societal Impact\n\nDisaster events impact both developed and developing countries, in the latter, they can cause a sharp increase in poverty. As disasters pose an important challenge to development, it is important to assess their global, regional, economic, and social impacts. Most economic assessments of the impacts of disasters have concentrated on direct losses\u2014that is, the financial cost of physical damage.\n\n\n#### Methodology\n\nA top-down approach where statistical information including socio-economic, building type, and capital stock at a national level are transposed onto the grids of 5x5 or 1x1 using geographic distribution of population data and gross domestic product (GDP) as proxies.\n\nFor more information please see: https:\/\/risk.preventionweb.net\/ \n\n#### Unit\n\nUs dollar value per region\n\n#### KPI Score Conversion\n\nGiven that we needed to map the meaurement points to the CDP cities, we complete the following steps to join datasets:\n\n1.
