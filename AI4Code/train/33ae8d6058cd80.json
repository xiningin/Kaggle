The TB epidemic in Zimbabwe is fuelled by the severe parallel HIV pandemic (adult HIV prevalence rate 15.2%), making TB the second leading cause of death. The TB mortality rate (excluding HIV+TB) is 33\/100,000, increasing four-fold among patients with both TB and HIV\n(132\/100,000). Seventy percent of people living with TB also have HIV.\n\nZimbabwe has a low coverage of TB diagnostic services with only two TB laboratories offering TB sputum culture microscopy. The other available laboratory facilities are scarce and only conduct smear microscopy which has a lower sensitivity, especially in cases of TB\/HIV co-infection and which cannot detect drug resistance. \n\nZimbabwean migrants often do not have access to facilities due to their transient behavior. When crossborder Zimbabwean migrants live in neighboring countries such as Botswana and South Africa, they are particularly hard-to-reach. This is because of the many challenges they may encounter as they try to access health services. For instance: irregular migrants often avoid using public ealth facilities in host countries out of fear of being intercepted and deported; long distances between the health facilities and the main road network affects attendance; negative attitudes of health workers can impact turnout; lack of time, the cost of travel and health services, and opportunity cost also have a negative impact.\n\nIn addition, poverty and a poor understanding of TB disease can cause migrants to put off care seeking. The overcrowded living conditions in host countries render them more susceptible to TB infection. In many cases, presumptive TB cases of this hard-to-reach group are initiated on TB treatment without the requisite  diagnostic tests and with poor follow-up due to their mobility patterns.\n\nEfficiently monitoring TB incidence and prevalence in this population requires innovative approaches and active case finding.\nhttp:\/\/www.stoptb.org\/assets\/documents\/global\/awards\/tbreach\/w4docs\/International%20Organization%20for%20Migration%20(IOM),%20Zimbabwe.pdf","d9eab684":"#Relapse and Reinfection - Recurrent TB\n\nThe results collectively illustrate that greater understanding of the differences between relapse and reinfection types of recurrent TB can provide important information for the design of more effective downstream TB control interventions.

Microbiol., 14 August 2018 | https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/fmicb.2018.01858\n\nDifferences in Characteristics Between Relapse and Reinfection Cases\n\nTuberculosis (TB) recurrence can result from either relapse of an original infection or exogenous reinfection with a new strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The aim of this study was to assess the roles of relapse and reinfection among recurrent TB cases characterized by a high prevalence rate of drug-resistant TB within a hospital setting.\n\nFor reinfection cases, reemergence of rifampicin-resistant isolates harboring double gene mutations. In conclusion, their data demonstrate that relapse is a major mechanism leading to TB recurrence. Moreover, male patients are at higher risk for reinfection. The extremely high rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among reinfection cases reflects more successful transmission of MDR-TB strains versus non-resistant strains overall.\n\nPerson chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to compare proportions of patients in each subgroup or rates of drug resistance. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated in the univariate analyses. The multivariate models were carried out by forward stepwise logistic regression procedures to identify factors that independently affected reinfection.\n\nThey further compared characteristics between relapse cases and reinfection cases. Overall, there were significantly more reinfection cases among male versus female patients, indicating that male gender is a risk factor for TB reinfection (OR 95%). In contrast, ages, drug resistant profiles, the presence of comorbidities and the timing of a recurrent episode had no influence on percentage of relapse cases. https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fmicb.2018.01858\/full","07ffcdf9":"#Plotting after NaN removal","b25f2303":"#COVID-19 worsens Zimbabwe's health crisis\n\nAuthor:Munyaradzi Makoni - Published:August 15, 2020DOI:https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/S0140-6736(20)31751-7\n\nYears of neglect and doctors' strikes have pushed the Zimbabwean health system to the brink.
