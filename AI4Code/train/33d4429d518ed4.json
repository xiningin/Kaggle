Ordered Dictionary from collections\nOrderedDict preserves the order in which the keys are inserted. A regular dict doesn\u2019t track the insertion order, and iterating it gives the values in an arbitrary order and won't give ordered representation everytime. This is noticeable when the dict size is large.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YXdHQAk.png)","0ea32170":"Now that John Wick has learnt of the basics, it's 3rd chapter; end to an epic trilogy.

Anyway, even though I was reluctant, I decided it's better to slow down instead of stopping, so even though reluctant, I tried switching to writing kernels just to ease things off.\n\n**If you found this kernel helpful please consider upvoting it!**\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/PcPq7a9.png)","fe922d13":"### 36.
