A 0 would represent a certain word isn't included, whereas a 1 means that word is included. A short review of a few words would have a matrix of almost entirely 0's (ie. the vast majority of unique words across all reviews aren't present in the review), with just a small number of 1's. This is necessary for the logistic regression algorithm used below.","73bd7dc3":"I'll make a train and test set, with 80% of the data being the train set and 20% being the test set.
