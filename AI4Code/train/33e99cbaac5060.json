For that purpose I am going to use [pyLDAvis](https:\/\/pyldavis.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/readme.html). The pyLDAvis is designed to help users interpret the topics in a topic model that has been fit to a corpus of text data.\n\nClick in the image to interact with the visualization yourself. Here you have some tips to help you understand the plot:\n\n- Each bubble represents a topic. The larger the bubble, the higher percentage of the number of tweets in the corpus is about that topic. \n- Blue bars represent the overall frequency of each word in the corpus. If no topic is selected, the blue bars of the most frequently used words will be displayed. \n- Red bars give the estimated number of times a given term was generated by a given topic. \n\n\nThe further the bubbles are away from each other, the more different they are. A good topic model will have big and non-overlapping bubbles scattered throughout the chart."}}
