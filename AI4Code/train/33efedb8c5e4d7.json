Implementation of Neural Network in Keras <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"8\"><\/a>\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- The implementation of Neural Network in Keras comprises of three steps:-\n\n     - Compiling the model with the **compile()** method.\n     - Training the model with **fit()** method.\n     - Evaluating the model with **evaluate()** method.\n     \n     \n- These steps are as described below.\n","bf6640e6":"[Go to Top](#0)","9dbf7196":"- To facilitate the entry of data into our neural network we must make a transformation of the tensor (image) from 2 dimensions (2D) to a vector of 1 dimension (1D). \n- That is, the matrix of 28\u00d728 numbers can be represented by a vector (array) of 784 numbers (concatenating row by row), which is the format that accepts as input a densely connected neural network. \n- In Python, converting every image of the MNIST dataset to a vector with 784 components can be accomplished as follows:","0c5dd5cc":"### View the corresponding labels\n\n- To see its corresponding label we can write the following Python code:","21e199dd":"- Now, our dataset is ready to be fed in the neural network.\n- We will program it in Keras in the following section.","69273e14":"It returns the value of \"3\", as expected.","6335946b":"## 5. Data normalization in Keras <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"5\"><\/a>\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- The MNIST images of 28\u00d728 pixels are represented as an array of numbers whose values range from [0, 255] of type uint8. \n- It is usual to scale the input values of neural networks to certain ranges. \n- In this example, the input values should be scaled to values of type float32 within the interval [0, 1]. \n- This can be done with the following lines of Python code:","912dff40":"## 11. Generate predictions <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"11\"><\/a>\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- We have build the ANN model to classify the MNIST digits.\n\n- Now, we need to know how we can use the trained model to make predictions. \n\n- It consists in predict which digit represents an image. \n\n- In order to do this, Keras supply the **predict()** method.\n\n- To test this method we can choose any element. \n\n- For simplicity, we will take one from the test dataset x_test. For example let\u2019s choose the element 11 of this dataset x_test.","b9d81d25":"- **True Positives (TP)**, **True Negatives (TN)**, **False Positives (FP)** and **False Negatives (FN)** are the four different possible outcomes of a single prediction for a two-class case with classes \u201c1\u201d (\u201cpositive\u201d) and \u201c0\u201d (\u201cnegative\u201d).\n\n- A **False Positive (FP)** is when the outcome is incorrectly classified as positive, when it is in fact negative. A **False Negative (FN)** is when the outcome is incorrectly classified as negative when it is in fact positive. **True Positives (TP)** and **True Negatives (TN)** are obviously correct classifications.\n\n- With this confusion matrix, the accuracy can be calculated by adding the values of the diagonal and dividing them by the total:\n\n**Accuracy = (TP + TN) \/ (TP + FP + FN + TN)**\n\n\n- There is another metric called **Sensitivity (or recall)** that tells us how well the model avoids false negatives:\n\n**Sensitivity = TP \/ (TP + FN)**\n\n\n- From the confusion matrix, several other metrics can be obtained.\n\n- But in this case, there are 10 classes instead of 2. So, in this case, Scikit-learn package can be used to evaluate the quality of the model by calculating the confusion matrix.\n\n- The following code can be used to generate the confusion-matrix:","a70e723a":"#### First layer\n\n- We explicitly express in the `input_shape` argument of the first layer what the input data is like: a tensor that indicates that we have 784 features of the model.\n\n- The tensor is being defined is (None, 784,).","26f657a5":"## 6.
