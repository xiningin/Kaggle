Ensemble learning is primarily used to improve the (classification, prediction, function approximation, etc.)\n\nhe motivation for using ensemble models is to reduce the generalization error of the prediction. As long as the base models are diverse and independent, the prediction error of the model decreases when the ensemble approach is used. The approach seeks the wisdom of crowds in making a prediction. Even though the ensemble model has multiple base models within the model, it acts and performs as a single model. Most of the practical data mining solutions utilize ensemble modeling techniques. \n\n![ens](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/0*sOtXk_8ZftGGU00_.png)"}}
