This does seem to indicate a significant between men and women, although compared to the total respondent it appears as though it could demonstrate some bias in the sample as 84.9% responded as men.\n\nThe age breakdown also showed that these earners tended to be a bit older than the general sample population with most being around 30-34 compared to 25-29.

As one of the survey questions was \"What programming language would you recommend an aspiring data scientist to learn first?\" we find that among this crowd of top earners the overwhelming recommendation is Python with 581 of 759 suggesting it with R followed up with 91 and SQL with 49. Python is overwhelmingly recommended despite a significantly smaller amount of these top users using Python most often, only 420 of 667 reported, with the spread redistributing around the other options.  One thing interesting to note here is that this isn't significantly different between genders either, men and women both seem to recommend and use Python with 75 of 102 top earning women recommending Python and 500 of 645 men recommending Python.\n\nCompared to the community as a whole, we see Python still having a commanding lead with similar results with 14181 (of 18788) of respondents saying that they recommend apsiring data scientists use Python followed by 2342 suggesting R, and 914 saying SQL. Within the total respondents 8180 (of 15222) use Python, followed by 2046 using R, and 1211 using SQL as the language they use most often. \n\n### While there is a significant portion of survey takers and top earners that use Python, it is overwhelmingly recommended that first time data scientists learn Python first.","1ac2dec5":"# Top Earning Data Scientists\n## Some Insight for Aspiring Data Scientists\n","8800ba58":"___","0dbebdb5":"## Second Insight \n\"How do you perceive the quality of online learning platforms and in-person bootcamps as compared to the quality of the education provided by traditional brick and mortar institutions? - Online learning platforms and MOOCs\"\n\nAmong these self-described data scientists who are earning 100k+ there is not clear consenus as to whether or not online learning platforms are better than traditional brick and mortar institutions. While only a small group (67 of 692) believe these alternative educations are much worse than traditional brick and mortar schools, a plurality of these top earners believed that they were neither bettor nor worse than traditional schooling with 171 of 692 feeling that way. This becomes even more interesting when 133 and 111 feel that these alternative teaching methods are either much better or at least slightly better respectively.

The top quartile of earners appears to be those making somewhere over 15-20,000 USD in India, so this analysis will focus on those self-described data scientists who are currently residing in India and reported earning over 20,000 USD.\n\nUsing the same methods, we can see some similarities with the top earners residing in India versus the global top earners.","6bca02ca":"As the whole community shows, there is a lot of love for Coursera courses with most people spending the most time on Coursera regardless of whether they are top earning data scientists or not, however, the top earnering self-described data scientists seem to not like Udemy as much while liking Udacity, DataCamp, and Online University Courses more.\n\n### Top Earners seem to have a preference to using Coursera, followed by Udacity, Udemy, and then Online University Courses.
