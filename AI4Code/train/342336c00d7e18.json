There are too many missing values for imputation. Based on the information available, it appears that this value is associated with the passenger's class and fare paid.","ed913341":"<a id=\"t3.1.\"><\/a>\n## 3.1.

Recursive feature elimination\n\nGiven an external estimator that assigns weights to features, recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a `coef_ attribute` or through a `feature_importances_` attribute. Then, the least important features are pruned from current set of features.That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached.\n\nReferences: <br>\nhttp:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/feature_selection.html <br>","3325f9bf":"<a id=\"t4.1.2.\"><\/a>\n### 4.1.2.

Because the number of passengers who boarded at Southhampton was highest, the confidence around the survival rate is the highest.
