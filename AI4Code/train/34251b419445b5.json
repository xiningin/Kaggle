I hate from quizzes :) so answer: In order to visualize data, values should be closer each other. As you can see values looks like closer. At least there is no incompatible values like mean of one feature is 0.1 and other is 1000. Also there are another reasons that I will mention next parts.","f554fb9f":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a> <br>\n### CROSS VALIDATION\nAs you know in KNN method we use train test split with random_state that split exactly same at each time. However, if we do not use random_state, data is split differently at each time and according to split accuracy will be different. Therefore, we can conclude that model performance is dependent on train_test_split. For example you split, fit and predict data 5 times and accuracies are 0.89, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. Which accuracy do you use? Do you know what accuracy will be at 6th times split, train and predict. The answer is I do not know but if I use cross validation I can find acceptable accuracy.\n<br> Cross Validation (CV)\n* K folds = K fold CV.\n* Look at this image it defines better than me :)\n* When K is increase, computationally cost is increase\n* cross_val_score(reg,x,y,cv=5): use reg(linear regression) with x and y that we define at above and K is 5.

Then our model predict 100% normal for all samples and accuracy is 95% but it classify all abnormal samples wrong. Therefore we need to use confusion matrix as a model measurement matris in imbalance data.\n<br> While using confusion matrix lets use Random forest classifier to diversify classification methods.\n* tp = true positive(20), fp = false positive(7), fn = false negative(8), tn = true negative(58) \n* tp = Prediction is positive(normal) and actual is positive(normal). \n* fp = Prediction is positive(normal) and actual is negative(abnormal).\n* fn = Prediction is negative(abnormal) and actual is positive(normal).\n* tn = Prediction is negative(abnormal) and actual is negative(abnormal)\n* precision = tp \/ (tp+fp)\n* recall = tp \/ (tp+fn)\n* f1 = 2 * precision * recall \/ ( precision + recall)\n\n","552d0715":"<a id=\"11\"><\/a> <br>\n### KMEANS\n* Lets try our first unsupervised method that is KMeans Cluster\n* KMeans Cluster: The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided.

For now just know K is hyperparameter and we need to choose it that gives best performace. \n* Literature says if k is small, model is complex model can lead to overfit. It means that model memorizes the train sets and cannot predict test set with good accuracy.\n* If k is big, model that is less complex model can lead to underfit. \n* At below, I range K value from 1 to 25(exclude) and find accuracy for each K value. As you can see in plot, when K is 1 it memozize train sets and cannot give good accuracy on test set (overfit). Also if K is 18, model is lead to underfit. Again accuracy is not enough. However look at when K is 18(best performance), accuracy has highest value almost 88%. \n\n","c7f75afc":"The new question is that we know how many class data includes, but what if number of class is unknow in data.
