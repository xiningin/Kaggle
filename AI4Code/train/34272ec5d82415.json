Following the Soviet Union\u2019s launch of Sputnik, the space race ensued, with countries developing satellites, rockets, and other technologies to further explore outer space. With this rapid growth of the new Space Industry comes the question of whether the privatization of outer space is fair and equitable for all nations. \n    \n<p style='text-align: justify;'>Prior to 2004 private space travel was considered as illegal. In 2004 Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act was introduce to ripped away the limitations of space travel and allowed private resources to enter into spcae exploration.
