Otherwise, the password should be up to the user\n<p>In this notebook, we've implemented the password checks recommended by the NIST Special Publication 800-63B.

The NIST Special Publication 800-63B\n<p>If you \u2013 50 years ago \u2013 needed to come up with a secret password you were probably part of a secret espionage organization or (more likely) you were pretending to be a spy when playing as a kid. Today, many of us are forced to come up with new passwords <em>all the time<\/em> when signing into sites and apps. As a password <em>inventeur<\/em> it is your responsibility to come up with good, hard-to-crack passwords. But it is also in the interest of sites and apps to make sure that you use good passwords. The problem is that it's really hard to define what makes a good password. However, <em>the National Institute of Standards and Technology<\/em> (NIST) knows what the second best thing is: To make sure you're at least not using a <em>bad<\/em> password. <\/p>\n<p>In this notebook, we will go through the rules in <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.nist.gov\/800-63-3\/sp800-63b.html\">NIST Special Publication 800-63B<\/a> which details what checks a <em>verifier<\/em> (what the NIST calls a second party responsible for storing and verifying passwords) should perform to make sure users don't pick bad passwords. We will go through the passwords of users from a fictional company and use Python to flag the users with bad passwords.
