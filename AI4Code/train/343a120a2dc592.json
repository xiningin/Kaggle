Jammu and Kashmir and Meghalaya have 6 types of pollutants present. Chhattisgarh has 5 and Jharkhand has 3. \n> **But does this mean that having less number of pollutants cater to less pollution? More visualization will throw light on this.**\n\n\n**SUB-OBJECTIVE 2: What is the impact of different pollutant particles state wise?**\n\nBoth the pictures shows how much influence the pollutant particle type had on the overall maximum pollution and overall average pollution\n\nShown below is a visualization which shows State wise pollutant particle distribution with respect to pollutant_avg average of a state and pollutant_max average of a state\n\n![v1.png](attachment:5a651666-4c53-4a14-b331-59d0faf47283.png)\n\n![v2.png](attachment:7f65f954-95d9-4d41-901b-f2accd0cccec.png)\n\n> **Based on both the images we can see the overall maximum pollution and overall average pollution is higher in case of pollutants - PM10, PM2.5, Ozone, and CO. The other pollutants NH3, NO2, and SO2 has lesser impact on the pollution. Which in turn mean that the top 4 pollutants might be the cause of higher pollution in the states. When we drill down more, we will find out what is the correlation between this pollutant type and pollution.**\n\n**SUB-OBJECTIVE 3: Does having less number of pollutants in a state cater to less pollution and vice-versa?**\n\nShown below is a bar graph Pollution average state wise in decending order.\n\n![v4.png](attachment:5ed7bfce-3b6d-4e84-90a8-b2e1e3285ccb.png)\n\n> We can see that Delhi has the highest pollution and Nagaland has the least with Tripura, Chhattisgarh, and West Bengal in the median pollution range.\n\nDrilling onto more on different states individually to see the pollutants distribution:\n\n**DELHI: It has all 7 types of pollutants present**\n\n![v5.png](attachment:942e8006-5527-47d9-a777-d13b82f6e262.png)\n\n> We can see that Delhi is highest because of the very high concentration of pollutant average PM10, PM2.5 which in turn again proves that these pollutant particles are dangerous to have.\n\n**JHARKHAND: It has only 3 pollutant present but its still in the 30%ile of the pollution range**\n\n![v6.png](attachment:a1a5a7c5-8f53-448e-ad25-11de183b9034.png)\n\n> The reason why its in the lower high side is because of the presence of PM10 and Ozone. Even though Jharkhand has less pollutants present but due to these two presence of harmful pollutants it has high pollution\n\n**NAGALAND: It has all the 7 pollutants but its the lowest of all in terms of pollution**\n\n![v7.png](attachment:1e3d04d6-a55a-4f4e-896d-45d6aac652df.png)\n\n> Here we can clearly see that all the higher harmfull pollutant particles have less impact so, the pollution has gone down.\n\n>**So, it proves that having higher number of pollutant is not a big factor but presence of these PM10, PM2.5, Ozone, and CO in a higher amount would surely affect the pollution**","bfb17c00":"**SUB-OBJECTIVE 5: Comparing the state wise pollution distribution across cluster to find out any existence of pattern**\n\nThis graph shows how many times a state is classified in cluster 0 or normal air quality and cluster 1 or Bad air quality\n\n# Cluster 0: Normal air quality\n# Cluster 1: Bad air quality\n\n![v8.png](attachment:fc36f90c-74dd-49cf-9efc-4c13f373b3b2.png)\n\n> **Uttar Pradesh is one among such states who has highest times classified in cluster 0, as well as highest in bad air quality followed by Delhi who is classified less in 0 than Uttar Pradesh and same as in case of cluster 1. A few of the other states on the other hand in cluster 0 are more or less same as Delhi but for cluster 1 its very less, which in turn makes Delhi the most polluted city.** \n\n> **Karnataka and Maharastra are one such state which is best among all because its a highly populated state yet, it has maintained very well the pollution margin, followed by West Bengal**\n\n> **But a small pattern could be seen that as we move on from City to Hilly regions we see that most of the states has no or very less cluster 1 classification. Which could be because of less traffic and less people movement. Although a bit of peak in cluster 1 can be seen in case of Jammu & Kashmir which we have no evidence to speak about the reason. A wild guess could be because of tourism.**","a2279392":"There seems to be a higher correlation between pollutant_max and pollutant_avg.
