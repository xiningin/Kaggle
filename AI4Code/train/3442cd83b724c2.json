It occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred. This affects proper functioning of lungs and infact breathing.\n\nExpectation from the competiton is to predict patient's severity of decline in the lung function based on data provided - CT scan of patient's lungs & allied details like gender, smoking status, FVC. We need to determine lung function based on the output from spirometer, which measures volume of air inhaled and exhaled. The challenge is to use machine learning techniques to make prediction.\n\nIf the prediction outcome is successful, it will benefit patients and their families to better understand any decline in lung function in advance and try for better cure or improved health condition.","3f75d5c3":"2.1 Metadata Information","1db08024":"# Exploration of Data will continue","b9eabdf1":"# What do we have in training dataset (metadata info excluding CT Scan)\n* we have 1549 data with no missing values.\n* 176 unique patient data is made available  along with data related to their age, gender, smoking status, FVC, weeks\n* Age of patients is between 49 and 88.
