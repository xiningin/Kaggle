Ammons*\n\nThis notebook is intended for those who are new to machine learning. I purposely avoid jumping into complicated models or joining together lots of data in order to show the basics of how to get started in machine learning! The notebook follows the standard flow of machine learning projects:\n\n1. Understand the problem and the data\n2. Data cleaning and formatting (mostly done for us)\n3. Exploratory Data Analysis\n4. Feature Engineering\n5. Baseline model\n6. Improved model\n7. Model interpretation (just a little)\n\nIn this notebook, we will take an initial look at the Home Credit default risk machine learning competition currently hosted on Kaggle. The objective of this competition is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. This is a standard supervised classification task:\n\n* __Supervised__: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features\n* __Classification__: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)\n\n\n# Data\n\nThe data is provided by [Home Credit](http:\/\/www.homecredit.net\/about-us.aspx), a service dedicated to provided lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population. Predicting whether or not a client will repay a loan or have difficulty is a critical business need, and Home Credit wants to see what sort of models the machine learning community can develop to help them in this task. \n\nThere are 7 different sources of data:\n\n* application_train\/application_test: the main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_CURR`. The training application data comes with the `TARGET` indicating 0: the loan was repaid or 1: the loan was not repaid. \n* bureau: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n* bureau_balance: monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length. \n* previous_application: previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_PREV`. \n* POS_CASH_BALANCE: monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n* credit_card_balance: monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n* installments_payment: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. \n\nThis diagram shows how all of the data is related:\n\n![image](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-media\/competitions\/home-credit\/home_credit.png)\n\nMoreover, we are provided with the definitions of all the columns (in `HomeCredit_columns_description.csv`) and an example of the expected submission file. \n\nIn this notebook, we will stick to using only the main application training and testing data. Although if we wanted to do a thorough job, we would need to use all the data. For now, we will stick to one file to keep things manageable, allowing us to set a baseline that we can then improve upon. With these projects, it's best to build up an understanding of the problem a little at a time rather than diving all the way in and getting completely lost! \n\n## Metric: ROC AUC\n\nOnce we have a grasp of the data (reading through the [column descriptions](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/home-credit-default-risk\/data) helps immensely), we need to understand the metric by which our submission is judged. In this case, it is a common classification metric known as the [Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC, also sometimes called AUROC)](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/132777\/what-does-auc-stand-for-and-what-is-it).\n\nThe ROC AUC may sound intimidating, but it is relatively straightforward once you can get your head around the two individual concepts. The [Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Receiver_operating_characteristic) graphs the true positive rate versus the false positive rate:\n\n![image](http:\/\/www.statisticshowto.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/ROC-curve.png)\n\nA single line on the graph indicates the curve for a single model, and movement along a line indicates changing the threshold used for classifying a positive instance. The threshold starts at 0 in the bottom-left and goes to 1 in the top right. A curve that is to the left and above another curve indicates a better model. For example, the blue model is better than the red model, which is better than the black diagonal line which indicates a naive random guessing model. \n\nThe [Area Under the Curve (AUC)](http:\/\/gim.unmc.edu\/dxtests\/roc3.htm) explains itself by its name! It is simply the area under the ROC curve. (This is the integral of the curve.) This metric is between 0 and 1 with a better model scoring higher. A model that simply guesses at random will have an ROC AUC of 0.5.\n\nWhen we measure a classifier according to the ROC AUC, we do not generation 0 or 1 predictions, but rather a probability between 0 and 1. This may be confusing because we usually like to think in terms of accuracy, but when we get into problems with inbalanced classes (we will see this is the case), accuracy is not the best metric. For example, if I wanted to build a model that could detect terrorists with 99.9999% accuracy, I would simply make a model that predicted every single person was not a terrorist. Clearly, this would not be effective (the recall would be zero) and we use more advanced metrics such as ROC AUC or the [F1 score](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/F1_score) to more accurately reflect the performance of a classifier. A model with a high ROC AUC will also have a high accuracy, but the [ROC AUC is a better representation of model performance.](https:\/\/datascience.stackexchange.com\/questions\/806\/advantages-of-auc-vs-standard-accuracy)\n\nNot that we know the background of the data we are using and the metric to maximize, let's get into exploring the data. In this notebook, as mentioned previously, we will stick to the main data sources and simple models which we can build upon in future work. ","8c3e657a":"### Aligning Training and Testing Data\n\nThere need to be the same features (columns) in both the training and testing data. One-hot encoding has created more columns in the training data because there were some categorical variables with categories not represented in the testing data. To remove the columns in the training data that are not in the testing data, we need to `align` the dataframes. First we extract the target column from the training data (because this is not in the testing data but we need to keep this information). When we do the align, we must make sure to set `axis = 1` to align the dataframes based on the columns and not on the rows!","749efd26":"## Model Interpretation: Feature Importances\n\nAs a simple method to see which variables are the most relevant, we can look at the feature importances of the random forest.

We may use these feature importances as a method of dimensionality reduction in future work.","3ddc47dc":"# Conclusions\n\nIn this notebook, we saw how to get started with a Kaggle machine learning projects. We first made sure to understand the data and our task. Then, we performed a fairly simple EDA to try and identify relationships, trends, or anomalies that may help our modeling. Along the way, we performed necessary preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and scaling features to a range. Then, we constructed new features out of the existing data to see if doing so could help our model. \n\nOnce the data exploration, data preparation, and feature engineering were complete, we implemented a baseline model upon which we hope to improve. Then we built a second slightly more complicated model to improve over our first. We also carried out an experiment to determine the effect of adding the engineering variables.\n\nWe followed the general outline of a [machine learning project](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/a-complete-machine-learning-walk-through-in-python-part-one-c62152f39420): \n\n1.

In this case, since all the anomalies have the exact same value, we want to fill them in with the same value in case all of these loans share something in common. The anomalous values seem to have some importance, so we want to tell the machine learning model if we did in fact fill in these values. As a solution, we will fill in the anomalous values with not a number (`np.nan`) and then create a new boolean column indicating whether or not the value was anomalous.\n\n","c446decf":"## Back to Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n### Anomalies\n\nOne problem we always want to be on the lookout for when doing EDA is anomalies within the data. These may be due to mis-typed numbers, errors in measuring equipment, or they could be valid but extreme measurements. One way to support anomalies quantitatively is by looking at the statistics of a column using the `describe` method. The numbers in the `DAYS_BIRTH` column are negative because they are recorded relative to the current loan application. To see these stats in years, we can mutliple by -1 and divide by the number of days in a year:\n\n","ee3ceb78":"## Pairs Plot\n\nAs a final exploratory plot, we can make a pairs plot of the `EXT_SOURCE` variables and the `DAYS_BIRTH` variable. The [Pairs Plot](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/visualizing-data-with-pair-plots-in-python-f228cf529166) is a great exploration tool because it lets us see relationships between multiple pairs of variables as well as distributions of single variables. Here we are using the seaborn visualization library and the PairGrid function to create a Pairs Plot with scatterplots on the upper triangle, histograms on the diagonal, and 2D kernel density plots and correlation coefficients on the lower triangle.\n\nIf you don't understand this code, that's all right! Plotting in Python can be overly complex, and for anything beyond the simplest graphs, I usually find an existing implementation and adapt the code (don't repeat yourself)! ","79589cec":"As expected, the most important features are those dealing with `EXT_SOURCE` and `DAYS_BIRTH`.

I'm not sure what this exactly means, but it may be a cumulative sort of credit rating made using numerous sources of data. \n\nLet's take a look at these variables.\n\nFirst, we can show the correlations of the `EXT_SOURCE` features with the target and with each other.","71c2f77e":"## Polynomial Features\n\nOne simple feature construction method is called [polynomial features](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html). In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` and `EXT_SOURCE_2^2` and also variables such as `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` x   `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called [interaction terms](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interaction_(statistics) because they  capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves  may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. [Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models](https:\/\/www.theanalysisfactor.com\/interpreting-interactions-in-regression\/) to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. \n\nJake VanderPlas writes about [polynomial features in his excellent book Python for Data Science](https:\/\/jakevdp.github.io\/PythonDataScienceHandbook\/05.04-feature-engineering.html) for those who want more information.\n\nIn the following code, we create polynomial features using the `EXT_SOURCE` variables and the `DAYS_BIRTH` variable. [Scikit-Learn has a useful class called `PolynomialFeatures`](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into [problems with overfitting](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/model_selection\/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py)).

The findings may be interesting in their own right, or they can be used to inform our modeling choices, such as by helping us decide which features to use.","99c8b3ca":"Let's take a look at some of more significant correlations: the `DAYS_BIRTH` is the most positive correlation. (except for `TARGET` because the correlation of a variable with itself is always 1!) Looking at the documentation, `DAYS_BIRTH` is the age in days of the client at the time of the loan in negative days (for whatever reason!). The correlation is positive, but the value of this feature is actually negative, meaning that as the client gets older, they are less likely to default on their loan (ie the target == 0).

This will let us visualize the effect of this variable on the target.","dc387bec":"## Imports\n\nWe are using a typical data science stack: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`. ","8c191852":"## Examine the Distribution of the Target Column\n\nThe target is what we are asked to predict: either a 0 for the loan was repaid on time, or a 1 indicating the client had payment difficulties. We can first examine the number of loans falling into each category.","82cee290":"## Encoding Categorical Variables\n\nBefore we go any further, we need to deal with pesky categorical variables.  A machine learning model unfortunately cannot deal with categorical variables (except for some models such as [LightGBM](http:\/\/lightgbm.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/Features.html)). Therefore, we have to find a way to encode (represent) these variables as numbers before handing them off to the model. There are two main ways to carry out this process:\n\n* Label encoding: assign each unique category in a categorical variable with an integer. No new columns are created. An example is shown below\n\n![image](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/WillKoehrsen\/Machine-Learning-Projects\/master\/label_encoding.png)\n\n* One-hot encoding: create a new column for each unique category in a categorical variable. Each observation recieves a 1 in the column for its corresponding category and a 0 in all other new columns. \n\n![image](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/WillKoehrsen\/Machine-Learning-Projects\/master\/one_hot_encoding.png)\n\nThe problem with label encoding is that it gives the categories an arbitrary ordering. The value assigned to each of the categories is random and does not reflect any inherent aspect of the category. In the example above, programmer recieves a 4 and data scientist a 1, but if we did the same process again, the labels could be reversed or completely different. The actual assignment of the integers is arbitrary. Therefore, when we perform label encoding, the model might use the relative value of the feature (for example programmer = 4 and data scientist = 1) to assign weights which is not what we want. If we only have two unique values for a categorical variable (such as Male\/Female), then label encoding is fine, but for more than 2 unique categories, one-hot encoding is the safe option.\n\nThere is some debate about the relative merits of these approaches, and some models can deal with label encoded categorical variables with no issues. [Here is a good Stack Overflow discussion](https:\/\/datascience.stackexchange.com\/questions\/9443\/when-to-use-one-hot-encoding-vs-labelencoder-vs-dictvectorizor). I think (and this is just a personal opinion) for categorical variables with many classes, one-hot encoding is the safest approach because it does not impose arbitrary values to categories. The only downside to one-hot encoding is that the number of features (dimensions of the data) can explode with categorical variables with many categories. To deal with this, we can perform one-hot encoding followed by [PCA](http:\/\/www.cs.otago.ac.nz\/cosc453\/student_tutorials\/principal_components.pdf) or other [dimensionality reduction methods](https:\/\/www.analyticsvidhya.com\/blog\/2015\/07\/dimension-reduction-methods\/) to reduce the number of dimensions (while still trying to preserve information). \n\nIn this notebook, we will use Label Encoding for any categorical variables with only 2 categories and One-Hot Encoding for any categorical variables with more than 2 categories. This process may need to change as we get further into the project, but for now, we will see where this gets us. (We will also not use any dimensionality reduction in this notebook but will explore in future iterations).","aa116c0c":"# Feature Engineering\n\nThe most fruitful models are those that start by extracting the most useful features from the data--feature engineering. Feature engineering has a greater return on investment than model building and hyperparameter tuning. [This is a great article on the subject)](https:\/\/www.featurelabs.com\/blog\/secret-to-data-science-success\/). As Andrew Ng is fond of saying: \"applied machine learning is basically feature engineering.\" \n\nWhile choosing the right model and optimal settings are important, the model can only learn from the data it is given. Making sure this data is as relevant to the task as possible is the job of the data scientist (and maybe some [automated tools](https:\/\/docs.featuretools.com\/getting_started\/install.html) to help us out).\n\nFeature engineering refers to a general process and can involve both feature construction--adding new features from the existing data--and feature selection--choosing only the most important features or other methods of dimensionality reduction. There are many techniques we can use to both create features and select features.\n\nWe will do a lot of feature engineering when we start using the other data sources, but in this notebook we will try only two simple feature construction methods: \n\n* Polynomial features\n* Domain knowledge features\n","51120b54":"Several of the new variables have a greater (in terms of absolute magnitude) correlation with the target than the original features. When we build machine learning models, we can try with and without these features to determine if they actually help the model learn. \n\nWe will add these features to a copy of the training and testing data and then evaluate models with and without the features. Many times in machine learning, the only way to know if an approach will work is to try it out!

","0646932e":"# Baseline\n\nFor a naive baseline, we could guess the same value for all examples on the testing set.  We are asked to predict the probability of not repaying the loan, so if we are entirely unsure, we would guess 0.5 for all observations on the test set. This  will get us a Reciever Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (AUC ROC) of 0.5 in the competition ([random guessing on a classification task will score a 0.5](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/266387\/can-auc-roc-be-between-0-0-5)).\n\nSince we already know what score we are going to get, we don't really need to make a naive baseline guess. Let's use a slightly more sophisticated model for our actual baseline: Logistic Regression.\n\n## Logistic Regression Implementation\n\nHere I will focus on implementing the model rather than explaining the details, but for those who want to learn more about the theory of machine learning algorithms, I recommend both [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http:\/\/www-bcf.usc.edu\/~gareth\/ISL\/) and [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http:\/\/shop.oreilly.com\/product\/0636920052289.do). Both of these books present the theory and also the code needed to make the models (in R and Python respectively). They both teach with the mindset that the best way to learn is by doing, and they are very effective! \n\nTo get a baseline, we will use all of the features after encoding the categorical variables. We will preprocess the data by filling in the missing values (imputation) and normalizing the range of the features (feature scaling). The following code performs both of these preprocessing steps.","00b3c57a":"## Improved Model: Random Forest\n\nTo try and beat the poor performance of our baseline, we can update the algorithm. Let's try using a Random Forest on the same training data to see how that affects performance. The Random Forest is a much more powerful model especially when we use hundreds of trees. We will use 100 trees in the random forest.","c3220d80":"As the client gets older, there is a negative linear relationship with the target meaning that as clients get older, they tend to repay their loans on time more often. \n\nLet's start looking at this variable.
