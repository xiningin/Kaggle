Since the goal of the competition is to predict whether these tubes are placed normally, abnormally, or borderline, we better know where these tubes are inserted in the body and where they are directed to.\n\n`ETT:` Endotracheal Tube - A flexible plastic tube that is **placed through the mouth into the trachea (windpipe)** to help a patient breathe. The endotracheal tube is then connected to a ventilator, which delivers oxygen to the lungs.\n\n`NGT:` Nasogastric Tube - A flexible tube of rubber or plastic that is **passed through the nose, down through the esophagus, and into the stomach**. It can be used to either remove substances from or add them to the stomach. \n\n`CVC:` Central Venous Catheter - A thin, flexible tube that is **inserted into a vein, usually below the right collarbone (shoulders), and guided (threaded) into a large vein above the right side of the heart** called the superior vena cava.\n\n`Swan Ganz Catheter`: A thin tube that is usually **inserted in the neck or groin and directed through the veins and into the right side of the heart**."}}
