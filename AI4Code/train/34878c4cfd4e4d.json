That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables. The adjective simple refers to the fact that the outcome variable is related to a single predictor.","1d02ca44":"### Training dataset ","1ae81c4c":"**Case study:** To predict the Salary of an employee of abc company based on the number of experience of an employee using simple linear regression in python.
