This means there's a time attribute to dataset.\n\nIn this case, it's historical sales data of bulldozers. Including things like, model type, size, sale date and more.\n\nThere are 3 datasets:\n\n    - Train.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples up to 2011 (close to 400,000 examples with 50+ different attributes, including SalePrice which is the target variable).\n    - Valid.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples from January 1 2012 to April 30 2012 (close to 12,000 examples with the same attributes as Train.csv).\n    - Test.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples from May 1 2012 to November 2012 (close to 12,000 examples but missing the SalePrice attribute, as this is what we'll be trying to predict).\n    \n## Evaluation\n\nFor this problem, Kaggle has set the evaluation metric to being root mean squared log error (RMSLE). As with many regression evaluations, the goal will be to get this value as low as possible.\n\nTo see how well our model is doing, we'll calculate the RMSLE and then compare our results to others on the Kaggle leaderboard.\n\n## Features\nFeatures are different parts of the data. During this step, you'll want to start finding out what you can about the data.\n\nOne of the most common ways to do this, is to create a data dictionary.\n\nFor this dataset, Kaggle provide a data dictionary which contains information about what each attribute of the dataset means. You can download this file directly from the Kaggle competition page (account required) or view it on Google Sheets.\n\nWith all of this being known, let's get started!\n\nFirst, we'll import the dataset and start exploring. Since we know the evaluation metric we're trying to minimise, our first goal will be building a baseline model and seeing how it stacks up against the competition.","8388bcb1":"There are values from the year of 1989 to 2012..., So we are training our model from the 1989 to 2011 and the validation set consists of all the attributes in the 2012 saleyear.","ab536d70":"**Note:** After the preproceesing of test data there is one column missing in that when compared to the training data.","6c1478e0":"### Training the model with the best params","f0232084":"### Adding date time parameters seperately for the saledate column\n\nWhy?\n\nSo we can enrich our dataset with as much information as possible.\n\nBecause we imported the data using read_csv() and we asked pandas to parse the dates using parase_dates=[\"saledate\"], we can now access the different datetime attributes of the saledate column.","b257acce":"### Training the model","fb9b44f9":"### Creating submission file for kaggle"}}
