Most of the studios did never produce a **G-rated** film, which may again be due to MPAA's reluctance to give away G-ratings so easily. \n- Contraditorily, **Universal Pictures** have also produced the most number of **R-rated** films meant for restricted audience, with films like *Schindler's List* and *The Deer Hunter*. **Pixar** and **Lionsgate Films** have no film with an R-rating in this list.

","855054a3":"## 3. Maturity Rating of a Film\nMaturity rating (or *Content Rating*) rates the suitability of TV broadcasts, movies, comic books, or video games to its audience. A content rating usually places a media source into one of a number of different categories, which tell what age group is suitable to view said media. The individual categories include the stated age groups within the category, along with all ages greater than the ages of that category.\n\n[Motion Picture Association of America](https:\/\/www.mpaa.org\/) categorizes Hollywood films mainly into 4 categories.\n- **G \u2013 General Audiences** : All ages admitted. Nothing that would offend parents for viewing by children.\n- **PG \u2013 Parental Guidance Suggested** : Some material may not be suitable for children. Parents urged to give \"parental guidance\". May contain some material parents might not like for their young children.\n- **PG-13 \u2013 Parents Strongly Cautioned** : Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. Parents are urged to be cautious. Some material may be inappropriate for pre-teenagers.\n- **R \u2013 Restricted** : Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Contains some adult material.

There are many films nowadays where the film crew and cast openly protest against the rating system, about being *unncessarily* tough, so a more regular stringency since the 1990s is not a surprise."}}
