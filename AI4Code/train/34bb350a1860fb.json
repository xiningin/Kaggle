It is derived from a straightforward division of total GDP by the population.\n\nSocial support: Social support means having friends and other people, including family, to turn to in times of need or crisis\n\nHealthy life expectancy at birth: The average equivalent number of years of full health that a newborn could expect to live\n\nFreedom to make life choices: Freedom of choice describes an individual's opportunity and autonomy to perform an action selected from at least two available options, unconstrained by external parties.\n\nGenerosity: the quality of kindness and generous.\n\nPerceptions of corruption: perceived levels of public sector corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys."}}
