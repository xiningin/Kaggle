As every dimension in generated graphs is adjusted by the library, it can be quite difficult to visualize data in a improper format. As a result, the figsize method is very useful to customize the dimensions as well as layouts of the graphs. \n\nWe can make the figure taller in size, broader by changing the size in inches.  As seen above we set the figure size to 3 * 3. Lets plot and see the actual size visually.","80a80be0":"As a basic thumb rule, import all Python libraries needed for visualization.\n\n# Import Library","17f0beaa":"So the first thing we have to do is import matplotlib, which we already did. We do this with the line, `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.\n\nWe then create a variable `fig`, and set it equal to, `plt.figure()`\n\nThis creates a figure object, which of course is initially empty, because we haven't populated it with anything.\n\nSo we have a figure object stored in the variable, fig, that is empty.\n\nTo show this empty figure object, we use the line, `plt.show()` or `fig.show()`.\n\nWe are using `%matplotlib inline` : This line allows the figure of a graph to be shown with jupyter notebooks.\n\nAfter running the following code above, we get the following empty figure with default size (The default width is 6, and The default height is 4). Indeed we could change the size, using `figsize`.\n\nIn Matplotlib all the diagrams are created at a default size of 6.4 x 4.8 inches (refer https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/stable\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.figure.html) . This size can be changed by using the Figsize method of the respective figure. This parameter is governed under the rcParams attribute of the figure. By using Figsize, you can change both of these values.\n\nOf course there is nothing in the figure, because we haven't written any code that populates the figure.\n\nBut we will do this soon, keep reading.\n\nAnd this is how to create an empty figure object with matplotlib with Python.","f95b735b":"Now `ax` is an array of AxesSubplot, so we can access each `ax` separetely and set a different title, for instance.","965ad662":"Lets change the figure size and set it to have a figure of 3*3 (3 inches wide and 3 inches high).\n\nRefer site http:\/\/www.auctionrepair.com\/pixels.html for convertion between pixels and inches.","22a3a161":"More arguments:\n\n* `figsize` set the total dimension of our figure\n* `sharex` and `sharey` are used to share one or both axes between the charts (needed data to work)","ec985272":"Thus, we can give two arguments to subplots functions: nrows and ncols. If given in that order, we don't need to type the arg names, just its values. \n\nIn our example we create a plot with 1 row and 2 columns, still no data passed.","a6da59fa":"Continue with it to have more subplots.. just to play around it.","d51c2857":"Today we will learn how to create plots and subplots using matplotlib and seaborn.\n\nInitially I faced a lot difficulty in understanding the basic plotting and subplotting concept, and just wanted to share my simplififed version of it, so that it will benefit we all. Please do add comments with other approaches as well, willing to learn from you, new ways to plot and subplot.","2505e8b9":"Lets skip the arugment name","f3a06307":"# Subplots\n\nSubplots is a way to create more than one plots at a time. You need to pass the values for the nrow and ncols parameters. The total number of plots generated will be nrow x ncols. However these are optional.\n\n`subplots()` method, without arguments returns a Figure and a single Axes, which is as below.","9635bf8e":"Please add your comments.\n\nHappy Learning.\nStay Safe; Stay Healthy; Stay Happy ","e632b607":"Here we will first learn the basic and create the frame(s) \/ figure (inshort used as fig). \n\nOn this figure, you can populate it with all different types of data, including axes, a graph plot, a geometric shape, etc.\n\nHowever, the first step really is to create a figure.\n\nSo how do we create an empty figure object with matplotlib? Lets see it.","24e9b6a9":"Once we are familiar with this there are other arguments or parameters which need to explore name a few\n* legends \n* color options\n* styles of the plots\n* stack the plots\n* and many more some will be specific to graph type and some will be common."}}
