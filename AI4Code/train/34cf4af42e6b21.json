just for the sake of it.","0cfd5a4b":"I dropped columns that I thought were unnecessary and renamed 'Content Rating' to 'CR,' trying to avoid having spaces in the names of the columns.\n\nThe name of the app might play a role in the rating, but I assume it was minimal, hence why I removed it. The same logic applies to when the app was last updated and min\/max versions required.","fa0621e3":"# Introduction\n\nOne of my friends suggested that I look into this dataset to see if we can predict the rating of an app with given data. In addition, I wanted to do a simple hypothesis testing to see if games perform better than other categories of apps. To try and predict the ratings, I decided to use simple regressions. Also, since the full version of the data has more data points, I ended up using it over the 32k data. \n\nIn the end, what I found was that the given data is not enough. General data such as the category or the number of reviews are not good predictors. I assume that better predictors would be data that evaluates user experience. For example, average number of times the user opens the app a day or a week, average number of minutes spent in the app per day, etc. When it comes to the hypothesis testing, I found that games do not really perform better than games. ","6c886ce3":"# Conclusion\n\nAs we can see, number of reviews, size, cost, and category of an app are not good predictors. After a certain point, most of the apps perform the same way. \n\nOne suggestion I would have to improve the model is to add more independent variables that would be helpful. I assume looking into user experience data, such as average number of times users open the app during the day\/the week, average amount of minutes spent on the app, etc., is going to be useful.","d7adaad7":"I got this code from [here](https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/exploring-correlation-in-python\/). As I predicted above, we can see that there is no correlation between Rating and other independent variables.","bc4ba555":"When looking at categories provided initially, I immediately noticed that categories were basically divided into Games and Non-Games. Thus, I decided to split the dataset into two.","a70cc0c4":"I did basic exploration of the values for Installs, Price, Reviews, and Rating. I found that with Installs that I probably should just convert it to an int value. In Price, I found couple of string that I got rid of; I also decided to treat the Price as 'Free' for 0 and 'Paid' for 1. With Reviews, I just converted the values to float. With Rating, I found that there were about 10-15 values that basically were words, so I only got values with numbers in them. ","3b92d7f6":"After doing some EDA for Games, I figured that I should do the same for other categories. I decided that I get top 17 categories here, since in games I only had 17 types. I went through the same process for EDA here, so I think there is not much of an explanation needed here.","d2023437":"# Regression","3525eacb":"## Games","8d37e0f5":"# EDA","b9054ecd":"By doing basic EDA and plotting simple graphs, the first thought that I had was that there is not much of a correlation between Rating and other independent variables. In the vase of Reviews vs Rating, we can see that, generally, number of reviews does not really affect the rating.\n\nSomething interesting that I noticed was that there are not a lot of Casino games, but they perform on average better than other categories. Also, it seems that not only puzzles are popular, but also people rate puzzles higher than other games.","7ef8698d":"Initial hypothesis testing before doing more exploration. As I mentioned above, I wanted to see which categories perform better than the others. It seems that games generally perform worse than other categories.","6d9462e7":"## Other Categories","42796cff":"# Initial data cleaning","de9b5ff7":"Same with polynomial degrees.
