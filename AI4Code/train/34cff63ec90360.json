ADA Boost**","73e73043":"Month to month contracts, absence of online security and tech support seem to be positively correlated with churn. While, tenure, two year contracts seem to be negatively correlated with churn. \n\nInterestingly, services such as Online security, streaming TV, online backup, tech support, etc. without internet connection seem to be negatively related to churn.\n\nWe will explore the patterns for the above correlations below before we delve into modelling and identifying the important variables.","a8e9acbe":"**Let us read the data file in the python notebook**","c3f50ea3":"Interestingly most of the monthly contracts last for 1-2 months, while the 2 year contracts tend to last for about 70 months. This shows that the customers taking a longer contract are more loyal to the company and tend to stay with it for a longer period of time. \n\nThis is also what we saw in the earlier chart on correlation with the churn rate. ","43633b91":"Interestingly with XG Boost I was able to increase the accuracy on test data to almost 83%. Clearly, XG Boost is a winner among all other techniques. XG Boost is a slow learning model and is based on the concept of Boosting","d3182337":"**2. Contracts:** To understand the above graph, lets first look at the # of customers by different contracts. ","46093b5c":"Churn is a one of the biggest problem in  the telecom industry. Research has shown that the average monthly churn rate among the top 4 wireless carriers in the US is 1.9% - 2%. ","5f11f25c":"In our data, 74% of the customers do not churn. Clearly the data is skewed as we would expect a large majority of the customers to not churn. This is important to keep in mind for our modelling as skeweness could lead to a lot of false negatives. We will see in the modelling section on how to avoid skewness in the data.","843a34f1":"**Observations:**\n\n* From random forest algorithm, monthly contract, tenure and total charges are the most important predictor variables to predict churn.\n* The results from random forest are very similar to that of the logistic regression and in line to what we had expected from our EDA","371aa448":"I also looked at any differences between the % of customers with\/without dependents and partners by gender. There is no difference in their distribution by gender.

This helped me improve the accuracy from 79.7% to 80.7%. Further, you will notice below that the importance of variables is also aligned with what we are seeing in Random Forest algorithm and the EDA we conducted above.","0672e793":"As we can see from this graph most of the customers are in the month to month contract. While there are equal number of customers in the 1 year and 2 year contracts.\n\n","74717fc8":"**Let's explore the data to see if there are any missing values.**","e0d3409f":"Wth SVM I was able to increase the accuracy to upto 82%. However, we need to take a deeper look at the true positive and true negative rates, including the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for a better prediction. I will explore this soon. Stay Tuned!","c1f9a332":"**Observations**\n\nWe can see that some variables have a negative relation to our predicted variable (Churn), while some have positive relation. Negative relation means that likeliness of churn decreases with that variable. Let us summarize some of the interesting features below:\n* As we saw in our EDA, having a 2 month contract reduces chances of churn. 2 month contract along with tenure have the most negative relation with Churn as predicted by logistic regressions\n* Having DSL internet service also reduces the proability of Churn\n* Lastly, total charges, monthly contracts, fibre optic internet services and seniority can lead to higher churn rates. This is interesting because although fibre optic services are faster, customers are  likely to churn because of it. I think we need to explore more to better understad why this is happening. \n\nAny hypothesis on the above would be really helpful! ","d8bb098a":"**i.) Churn vs Tenure**: As we can see form the below plot, the customers who do not churn, they tend to stay for a longer tenure with the telecom company. ","968ba4eb":"## Data Exploration\n\nLet us first start with exploring our data set, to better understand the patterns in the data and potentially form some hypothesis.

Tenure:**  After looking at the below histogram we can see that a lot of customers have been with the telecom company for just a month, while quite a many are there for about 72 months. This could be potentially because different customers have different contracts. Thus based on the contract they are into it could be more\/less easier for the customers to stay\/leave the telecom company.","d8988c2a":"2.
