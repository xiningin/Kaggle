In this competition, \"Instant Gratification\", the `test.csv` that we download does not contain the private test dataset. Can we still answer the question above? Yes.\n\nThe unique structure of the data has been explained [here][1]. (There are 512 partial datasets within the full dataset. And each partial dataset has a different set of approximately 40 important features as identified by different standard deviations.) We have observed that both the training dataset and public test dataset have this structure. Does the private dataset also have this structure? In this kernel, we probe the private dataset and confirm that it has the same structure.\n\nThe structure of the data encourages building 512 separate models. In this kernel we also show how to build a single model instead of 512. We will build a high scoring NN (LB 0.930) by using the wonderful starter code provided by Abhishek [here][2] (please upvote Abishek's kernel) and improved upon by Vladislav [here][3]. This is accomplished by removing the dataset's useless datablocks and converting the magic variable into categorical.\n\nWe will probe the Private LB and ask \"Does the private test dataset have the same special structure as training and public test?\". If the answer is \"yes\", this kernel will submit an ensemble of NN and SVC and score LB 0.950. If the answer is \"no\", this kernel will submit all zeros and score LB 0.500.

Therefore when we run our code locally or in kaggle kernels and load `test.csv`, we only have `256*512+1` rows. When we submit our kernel for scoring at Kaggle, our same code runs a second time. When our code runs this second time and loads `test.csv`, our code has the full test dataset of `512*512` rows. \n\nAfter our code finishes running this second time, the new `submission.csv` is scored and displayed as public LB. (Note that the `submission.csv` file from the first run isn't scored, only the second `submission.csv`). Since `submission.csv` is created after our code \"sees\" the full test dataset, we can probe the full test dataset and report our findings in our LB score by altering `submission.csv`.\n\nFurthermore we can separate the public and private test dataset. The id column of the dataset was decoded by Kaggle users Linear and Yirun [here][1]. Brilliant work Linear and Yirun! The ids are just the MD5 hash of the row_number as string concatenated with \"test\" or \"train\". Therefore we can put all the public test dataset ids into one index allowing us to identify the public\/private test dataset and then probe the private test dataset specifically. \n\n[1]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/instant-gratification\/discussion\/92634#534306","f684e38e":"# Conclusion\nAfter submitting this to Kaggle, we see that this kernel scored LB 0.950. That implies that when this kernel ran a second time in Kaggle's evaluation procedure, it gained access to the private test dataset and confirmed that the private test dataset has the same datablock structure of usefulness as the training data and public test dataset.\n\nAdditionally in this kernel we learned how to utilize the datablock structure to alter the entire dataset thus allowing us to make a single model instead of 512 models. We built a single high scoring NN model."}}
