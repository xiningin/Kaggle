It is an amazing publication about lots of AI-related topics, providing Hands-On project expertise, interesting framework and technology discussions and the theory behind hundreds of algorithms.\n\nI scraped the archive of TDS from 2018 until 2021 to collect the titles, taglines, urls and date of (almost) every article in that year). You can apply various techniques on this data, such as for instance topic modeling.\n\n**If needed, I can also continue labeling this dataset. Just drop me a note what you'd be interested in, and I'll add labels to this dataset.**\n\nAlso, if you are interested in how this data has been collected, check out my other notebook associated to this dataset. I've prepared a function there - but be aware that this script takes a very long time to run.\n\n## Getting Started\nThe data is available as a standard CSV file, therefore we can just load it into our DataFrame.","57599861":"Now it is also really easy to convert these timestamps into year, month and day (of course, this would also be easy with strings as above, but let's just stick with the datetime timestamps for now):","43e8cea7":"Let's do a really quick look at one example visualization together. How did the frequency of publications per month change over the years?","69a90cc0":"Our `date` column is available as a string, so we might want to transform it into a timestamp using `datetime.datetime.striptime`:","894c189b":"---\n## Your part\nI'm looking forward to the kind of solutions you come up with!"}}
