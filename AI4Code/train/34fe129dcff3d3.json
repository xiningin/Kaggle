Also, in **\"Fashion accessories\"**, most of the profits came from customers **without** membership and from **females** (not necessarily at the same time). **Male** customers, **with and without** membership, produced most of the profits from **\"Sports and travel\"** and **\"Food and beverages\"**.\n\n\n* In branch B, the product line with the most profits is **\"Sports and travel\"** and **\"Health and beauty\"**.
