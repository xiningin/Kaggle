Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?\n    - *status, Adult Mortality, percentage expenditure,HIV,GDP,schooling, Income composition of resources*\n2. Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?\n3. How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?\n    - *LE is is inversly propotional to Adult mortality*\n    - *LE do not have much relation with infant death*\n4. Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.\n    - *LE is high with high BMI, which shows costly eating habits*\n    - *LE is inversly related to thiness, which shows lower eating habits results in lower LE*\n    - *LE is high in developed countries, lifestyle is gererally higher in developed countries.*\n    - *No feature showing exercise*\n    - *LE is positiveley correlated to drinking alcohol*\n5. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?\n    - *Schooling improves lifespan of humans*\n6. Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?\n    - *drinking alcohol is positively correlated to LE*\n7. Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?\n    - *False, Densely Puplated countries have higher LE*\n8. What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?\n    - *considering Polio as immunization process, we can observe that with in increase in polio immunization we LE is inreasing in countries.*","edfe2bb7":"**Observation**\n- Developing countries are more in samples","d5b5c3a8":"#### Analyse rest of Catagorical Features","6b01ac83":"# Load Dataset & Basic check","2d8ec749":"**Overall Observaiton with respect to LE**\n- Feature with Highr relation-\n    - status, Adult Mortality, percentage expenditure,HIV,GDP,schooling, Income composition of resources\n- moderatly realtion - \n    - BMI, infant Death, under-five death\n- less or No relation - \n    - Polio,Total expenditure, Diptheria,Population, Measles ","bae34039":"### Analyse Catagorical Features","ebcc8e0e":"**Observation**\n- Country fature has too many unique values for catagorical feature, i.e it has High cardinality","20b05ee8":"### Importing required Libraries","9d5c047d":"### finding catagorical & numerical eatures","80d0f24b":"**Observation inter feature correlation**\n- Measels & infant death are correlated(0.5), Means mose infants died due to measels\n- BMI -> Alcohol(0.33), More alchol causes higher BMI.\n- under five & infant deaths (1), both are similer, one can be dropped\n- Polio-> HepatitisB (0.49)\n- Diptheria-> HepatitisB (0.61)\n- Diptheria-> Polio (0.67)\n- HIV -> Adult Mortality (0.52), many adults died due to HIV\n- GDP -> percentage Expenditure (0.9)\n- population -> infant deaths(0.56)\n- thinness -> infant deaths(0.47)\n- Both thiness have 1 correlation, one can be dropped\n- Income composition of resources-> schooling(0.8), ->GDP(0.46),->alochol(0.45), ->BMI(0.51), -> diptheria(0.4), thinness(-0.4)\n- Schooling->AdultM(-0.45), ->Alcohol(0.55), ->BMI(0.55), ->Polio(0.42), ->Diptheria(0.43), ->GDP(0.45), ->thiness(-.45)","56423d22":"**Observation**\n- Life Expectancy of developed is higher.\n- Year - from 2000 to 2015, there no much change in Life Expectancy, its same all years\n- Adult Mortality - \n    - 0-100 - LE is varying all over range\n    - above 100, LE is dropping down as adult mortality increases, i.e Negative corelation with LE\n- infant deaths-\n    - very less in Developed countries.\n    - Developed countries even with some infant mortality have high LE\n    - in some ranges, increase in value shows drop in LE\n- Alcohol-\n    - No significant impact on LE\n    - some areas high value shows high LE, which is less likely to happen\n    - developed countries are not impacted by high alcohol , LE still on higher side\n- percentage expenditure-\n    - high PE shows some increase in LE, reasonably looks true relation\n- Hepatitis B-\n    - LE is spread low to high over hepatits B, no Significant relation observable\n- Measeles-\n    - No Significant relation observable\n- BMI-\n    - Higher BMI shows better LE\n- under-five deaths-\n    - same as Infant Deaths\n- Polio-\n    - Higher Polio shows better LE\n- Total expenditure\n    - No Significant relation observable\n- Diphtheria-\n    - within range of 20 - 50 LE is low, after that no signinficant difference\n- HIV\/AIDS-\n    - Higher HIV shows lower LE, expected.\n- GDP - \n    - Higher GDP shows higher LE, as expexted\n- Population-\n    - higher Population shows Higher LE, Need to investigate more.\n- thinness-\n    - increase in thinnes shows lower LE\n- Income composition of resources-\n    - increaseing vlaue shows increase in LE\n- Schooling-\n    - increaseing vlaue shows increase in LE","ea429a5e":"**Observation**\n- 21 independent features\n- 2938 entries\/ samples\n- Alcohol,Hepatitis B, BMI, Polio, Total expenditure, Diphtheria,GDP,Population,thinness 1-19 years, thinness 5-9 years,  Income composition of resources, Schooling, has missing values\n- There are Catagorical & Numerical feature.","1ca0864b":"**Observation**\n- dependent feature is 'Life expectancy'\n- there is no id column in data","b4897d17":"### Analyse Numerical Features"}}
