It does make you think we might want to think about putting these into their own dataframes at some point. Right? ","3ce2309c":"One final cleanup you might be keen on is stemming. Stemming refers to the process of reducing each word to its root or base. There are many stemming algorithms, although a popular and long-standing method is the Porter Stemming algorithm. This method is available in NLTK via the PorterStemmer class.","cd204417":"Running this pipeline you will see that in addition to all of the other transforms, stop words like 'a' and 'to' have been removed.

And, painful ;)\n\nIt's kind of an EDA but kind of Not an EDA. NDA :)\nSometimes you have to just play around with data to see what surprises might popup. \n\nThis code is using NLTK to clean up data. People will call it data cleaning, feature engineering. The intent is to just break the excerpt data down to common NLP data cleanup. \n\nI'll do another with scikit-learn next and link here.","d5252f09":"# Pipeline!\n\nLet's put it all together.\n\n* Load the raw text.\n* Split into tokens.\n* Convert to lowercase.\n* Remove punctuation from each token.\n* Filter out remaining tokens that are not alphabetic.\n* Filter out tokens that are stop words.","710f923f":"So. Well. We have some work to do here. \n1. We have capital letters.\n2. We have punctuation (which we may want\/need to understand complexity).\n3. We have \\n for new line.\n4. And finally, we have sentences. \n\nMaybe a fun exercise will be to clean all of it up and test it in various ways! ","c07bc544":"And we can finally remove stop words. Again, these could be valuable at some point in determining whether words are more or less complex for reading skill levels. But for now let's remove and then we can build pipelines later.
