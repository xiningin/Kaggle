Pharmaceutical drug discovery aims to identify certain proteins that are associated with a specific disease, and then to develop molecules that can target those proteins. The MoA of a molecule encodes its biological activity. Our dataset describes the response of 100 different types of human cells to various drugs. Those response patterns will be used to classify the MoA reponse. Note, that drugs can have multiple MoA annotations.\n\nThis is a multi-label classification problem. The evaluation metric is the mean columnwise log loss.\n"}}
