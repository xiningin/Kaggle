More of the central section of South Australia shown to be safe as compared to V1 NRT version.","c4ef50ad":"Compared to Near Real Time (NRT) Imagery , the archive version of M6 satellite imagery tells us the following:\n1. New South Wales and Victoria are still unsafe and more prone to forest fires , given the data that we have.\n2. Forest Fires of October left a bigger destruction trail than the August one.\n3. Coastal areas of Queensland , whole of Tasmania , south west of Western Australia and north of Northern Australia still a risky place to live in.\n4.

Climate change in recent years contributing to rise in temperature contributing to this phenomenon.\n2. Lightnings or by accidental sperkings\n3. There are also instances of deliberate firegeneration by humans which also adds fuel to the fire.","9e9e2819":"Almost similar conclusions can be derived from the V1 archive similar to the M6 archive, except for one which wasn't added in the previous conclusion:\n1. Coastal region of Southern Australia was less impacted in both archive data of forest fire spread in Oct 2019","432e0861":"Following conclusions can be drawn from the near real time visualization of scatter plot :\n1. South Australia was the least affected with less than 50% of the area infected by forest fires.\n2. Island region of tasmania was also affected with the forest fire.\n3. Central region of South Australia is not nearly affected by this visualization.","868efdd4":"The trend in forest fires has been on the rise as seen by the archived data and the near real time data (Both of 2019)\nFew points to note:\n1. The area affected in forest\/bush fires in Australia is on the rise and in 2020 this has gone worse.\n2. This in turn affect the flora and fauna of the given country that is well known for kangaroos and koalas and different species of reptiles , insects and plant species.\n3. Government needs to step up action on controlling the deliberate action from human population in contributing to the forest fire scenario.\n4. Doing this might not reduce the case , however it can reduce the people from destroying the resource intensiveness that this country is known for.\n5. Wildlife can be relocated to safe areas , if the authorities are able to pinpoint the occurence of fires in the affected region.\n6. Dry lightnings pose a challenge to detect.\n7. Global warming is a threat that everyone across the world are trying to solve , which if not taken care of seriouslt will affect a country that is near to the equator , ie Australia."}}
