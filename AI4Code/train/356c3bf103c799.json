It is used to describe the extreme values in one versus the other tail. It is actually the measure of outliers present in the distribution.\n\n* High kurtosis\n\nin a data set is an indicator that data has heavy tails or outliers. If there is a high kurtosis, then, we need to investigate why do we have so many outliers. It indicates a lot of things, maybe wrong data entry or other things. Investigate!.\n\n* Low kurtosis\n\nin a data set is an indicator that data has light tails or lack of outliers. If we get low kurtosis(too good to be true), then also we need to investigate and trim the dataset of unwanted results.\n\n* Mesokurtic:\n\nThis distribution has kurtosis statistic similar to that of the normal distribution. It means that the extreme values of the distribution are similar to that of a normal distribution characteristic. This definition is used so that the standard normal distribution has a kurtosis of three.\n\n* Leptokurtic\n\n(Kurtosis > 3): Distribution is longer, tails are fatter. Peak is higher and sharper than Mesokurtic, which means that data are heavy-tailed or profusion of outliers. Outliers stretch the horizontal axis of the histogram graph, which makes the bulk of the data appear in a narrow (\u201cskinny\u201d) vertical range, thereby giving the \u201cskinniness\u201d of a leptokurtic distribution. \n\n* Platykurtic:\n\n(Kurtosis < 3): Distribution is shorter, tails are thinner than the normal distribution. The peak is lower and broader than Mesokurtic, which means that data are light-tailed or lack of outliers. The reason for this is because the extreme values are less than that of the normal distribution.","9da7bf65":"![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pXOeQKf.png)","95c964d9":"**Types of missed data **\n\n**1- missing completely at random(MCAR):**\n\nMissing value (y) neither depends on x nor y when data is missed due to random. that mean when there is no obvious cause for missing of the data.missed for unknown cause. \n\n**2- missing at random(MAR):**\n\nMissing value (y) depends on x, but not y when data missed due to a variable present in the data . ex: data is missed due to sex.ex: if the man is business man so their is higher probability that he will not enter salary.\n\n**3-missing not at random(MNAR):**\n\nThe probability of a missing value depends on the variable that is missing probability of missing occurs dependant on another missing value. ex: when the business man does't enter his income , so he will not classify his icome rate(high, medium , low)\n\n\n","6b05c046":"**leptokurtic** kurtosis is the type of kurtosis\n\n","1bb34f12":"LotFrontage : we can fill in missing values by the median LotFrontage of the neighborhood.\n\n","ba501886":"![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Trf5gsm.jpg)","2a89d462":"check for any ramaining messing values\n\n","92088b18":"![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QtHdbod.jpg)","50ea3896":"**Intro**\n\nDid you know that all data scientists spend 80% of there project time cleaning there data?

The rule of thumb seems to be:\n\n* If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical.\n\n* If the skewness is between -1 and \u2013 0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the data are moderately skewed.\n\n* If the skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, the data are highly skewed.","de794a71":"In my opinion, it is always better to keep data than to discard it.

In most of the cases a threshold of 3 or -3 is used i.e if the Z-score value is greater than or less than 3 or -3 respectively, that data point will be identified as outliers.\n\nHere, we normally define outliers as points whose modulus of z-score is greater than a threshold value.
