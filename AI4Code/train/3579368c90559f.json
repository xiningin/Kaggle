You will use chaii-1, a new question answering dataset with question-answer pairs. Predicting answers to questions is a common NLU task, but not for Hindi and Tamil. Current progress on multilingual modeling requires a concentrated effort to generate high-quality datasets and modelling improvements. Additionally, for languages that are typically underrepresented in public datasets, it can be difficult to build trustworthy evaluations.","0f903245":"### Table of content\n#### 1)dataset overview and cleaning \n#### 2)Univariate analysis"}}
