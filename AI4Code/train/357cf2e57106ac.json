There you are, doing the business of insurance, insuring, if you will. And in walks J.P. Morgan. J.P. says hi, and, since he's a busy guy, he gets right to the point. \n\nHis company, the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, recently had something of a setback, by which he means that the Titanic sank and a bunch of people died and now the survivors are suing his company for a lot of money. He's confident that he won't have to pay out very much, but just in case something like this happens again, he is interested in alternate arrangements that would enable passengers on his ships to purchase what would basically amount to dual life-travel insurance. He's especially interested in providing these insurance options to the passengers aboard Titanic's sister ships, the HMS Olympic and the HMS Britannic. "}}
