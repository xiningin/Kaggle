The charges was very much dependent on smoking and hence the pvalue for that region is 0.00.\n3. The pvalue for the children is also 0 hence we can confidently say that the charges vary with the number of children a person has. Same goes with age and BMI.\n4. Coming to the region column as the pvalue is large it can be again concluded that the variation in charges is not dependent on the region.\n5.
