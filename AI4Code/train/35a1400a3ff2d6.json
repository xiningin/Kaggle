Therefore changes in using such type of the systems is going to be indicative of the global impact of Covid-19 pandemics on both  the Pre-K12 school system and higher eduction in USA.\n\n# Pre-Requisites\n\nFirst of all, we are going to place some preparational (pre-requisite) code into our notebook. It will\n\n- install *pdpipe* (we will use this package for automating feature engineering\/data transformation pipelines down the road)\n- import neccessary Python packages\n- provide the code of the auxiliary functions used for data extraction and preparing the data for appropriate visulaizations","f56387d0":"We are going to read districsts data first.

Plotly Express's Geo Scatter plot will help us to see the historical changes in engagements with Digital Learning Platforms across 2020 in a comprehensive mapping interface.\n\nHowever, before we display the data on the geo scatter plot, we need to do a couple of tiny pre-processing steps on the aggregated engagement stat dataframe as follows\n\n- replace the US state names with their two-character codes\n- add a new attribute to be used to define the size of the scatter bulbe for every state and obseration date\n\n**Note:** this is required as appropriate inputs to draw the  Plotly Express's Geo  Scatter plots\n\nWe are going to implement such a pre-processing mini-pipeline using *pdpipe*.","d70b314a":"Finally, we embark on loading the engagement data.
