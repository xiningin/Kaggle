Figure 3 shows MNIST dataset which is a very popular dataset of handwritten digits, and it is a supervised problem in which you are given the images of the numbers and the correct label associated with them. You have to build a model that can identify which digit is it when provided only with the image.\n\nThis dataset can easily be converted to an unsupervised setting for basic visualization.","a866c48a":"MNIST is a supervised classification problem, and we converted it to an unsupervised problem only to check if it gives any kind of good results and it is apparent that we do get good results with decomposition with t-SNE. The results would be even better if we use classification algorithms. What are they and how to use them? Let\u2019s look at them in the next chapters.","943dfddf":"This step creates the t-SNE transformation of the data. We use only two components as we can visualize them well in a two-dimensional setting. The transformed_data, in this case, is an array of shape 3000x2 (3000 rows and 2 columns). A data like this can be converted to a pandas dataframe by calling pd.DataFrame on the array.\n\n","e43fca18":"## Library Import","02d06d33":"**Supervised Problem**\n![https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/abhishekkrthakur\/aaamlp_figures\/main\/1_1.png](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/abhishekkrthakur\/aaamlp_figures\/main\/1_1.png)","dba38d00":"**Unsupervised Problem**\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/abhishekkrthakur\/aaamlp_figures\/main\/1_2.png)"}}
