Of course, there are certainly other non quantifiable costs associated with injuries, such as emotional and distress costs to that player. There are also quantifiable costs, such as healthcare costs, and increased chances of reaggravating the injury.\n\n\n### Methodology\n\nWe start with our first finding of the change in missed games per play.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n$$\\:\\frac{Missed\\:Games\\:Artificial}{Play}\\:- \\:\\frac{Missed\\:Games\\:Grass}{Play}\\:=\\:\\frac{\\Delta Missed\\:Games}{Play}\\:$$\n<br>\n<br>\nWe can then use this $\\frac{\\Delta Missed Games}{Play}$ number to calcuate the effect over a season. As an example, we will look at the WR position group.\n<br>\n<br>\n$$\\:\\frac{\\Delta Missed\\:Games}{Play}*\\:\\frac{Plays}{WR}*\\:\\frac{WR}{Game}*\\:\\frac{\\\\$}{Game}*\\:\\frac{Games}{Season}\\:=\\:\\frac{Cost}{Season}\\:$$\n<br>\n<br>\nWe can reduce simplify this equation a bit by just finding the average number of WRs plays per game, instead of the number of WRs multiplied by average plays \n<br>\n<br>\n$$\\frac{Plays}{WR}*\\:\\frac{WR}{Game}=\\:\\frac{WR\\:Plays}{Game}\\:$$\n<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, we can just look at $\\frac{Dollar}{Season}$ salary, instead of at a per-game level, resulting in the following equation that calculates the associated injury-cost for the WR group that playing 16 games on artificial turf would as compared to grass\n<br>\n<br>\n$$\\:\\frac{\\Delta Missed\\:Games}{WR\\:Play}*\\:\\:\\frac{WR\\:Plays}{Game}\\:*\\:\\frac{\\$}{Season}\\:=\\:\\frac{\\$}{Season}\\:$$\n<br>\n<br>\nWe then want to convert this value to a per-season-team level. We can do this by summing the $\\frac{Dollar}{Season}$ cost $C$ for each position group\n<br>\n<br>\n$${C}_{LB}\\;+\\;{C}_{QB}\\;+{C}_{DL}\\;+\\;{C}_{OL}\\;+{C}_{SPEC}\\;+\\;{C}_{TE}\\;+\\:{C}_{WR}\\;+\\;{C}_{RB}\\;+\\;{C}_{DB}\\:=\\:{C}_{Team}$$\n<br>\n<br>\nFinally, we can convert the increased injury cost per season into a more meaningful stat, the injury cost for having 8 home games on artificial turf.\n<br>\n<br>\n$$\\:\\:\\frac{{\\$}_{\\:Team}}{Season}\\:*\\:\\frac{8\\:Home\\:Games}{16\\:Games}\\:=\\:\\frac{\\$_{\\:Team\\:Home}}{Season}\\:$$","3dd0fa31":"### Comparison in terms of games missed\n\nOur previous test shows that artifical term is associated with a higher risk of injury.

More accurately, we want a weighted average salary by position group snap count. Since higher paid players are more likely to play more snaps per game (and therefore more likely to get injured), we don't really want an average of all players in a position group, but rather we want to weight it towards players that are playing significant snap counts.\n\nTo further clarify, a team could have 3 quarterbacks, paid \\\\$20m, \\\\$1m, and \\\\$1m each, but playing 90\\%-9\\%-1\\% snaps.

This would be 100% if QBs didn't get injured or benched. Taking the average salary of the top 32 QBs would probably be appropriate -- or at least relatively close to the average position group salary.\n\nHowever, a team might have 4 WRs on the field at one time. So it wouldn't really make sense to take the average salary of the top 32 WRs -- that would likely be a top 20% salary for starting WRs. If indeed teams do play an average of 4 WRs, we could reasonably then take the average of the top 32 * 4 highest paid WRs.\n\nThis means we first have to calculate how many players are played at each position group. What we can do is look at the total snap counts on offense, defense, and special teams to see what percent each position group had. We can then look at what proportion of players on the field were in that position group, and multiply that by 11 to find how many players are typically on the field from that group at one time","c780c869":"### Run regression\n\nWe can now run a generalized linear model using a Poisson distribution.

Our assumption is that playing on artificial turf causes relatively more injuries than playing on grass. We would like to calculate how many more games players are expected to miss per season by playing on artificial turf as compared to grass, then translate that difference in games played into a dollar amount by using per game player salaries.\n\nOur conclusion is based on NFL teams playing 8 home games and 8 away games, meaning that a team's surface decision will impact their players for 8 games per year.\n\nOur analysis indicates that injuries are about 1.6 times more likely to occur on artifical turf as compared to grass. We find the total cost of having an artifical turf at home to be about $2.95m \/ season in missed game salaries more than having a grass field at home.
