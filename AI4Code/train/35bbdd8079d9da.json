It appears the majority of bookings were not_canceled.","e115a120":"The majority of bookings are transient. This is defined as a booking that is not a part of a group or contract. Booking online independtly is becoming increasingly consumer friendly which could explain this data.","9e8ee5d3":"The data shows us that travelers tend to book hotels in pairs and that those traveling with a baby prefer to book a resort hotel.","fb6c55c6":"Majority of bookings did not require a deposit, this could explain the high cancelation rate.","df975526":"Prices of the resort hotel are typically higher than the city hotel, with highest rates during busy months of travel in the summer, ie. August, June, and July.","cffeb6d3":"Booking rates were highest during the year of 2016. Additionally, the trend shows that bookings occurs at the highest rate around the middle of year, with August being the highest. Data shows that summer is a peak season for hotel booking.\nThere is a wave like structure to arrivals by day. My speculation is that these peaks depict hotel bookings on the weekends at a higher rate.","7bc090b4":"# Summary:\n1. City hotels account for 2\/3s of all bookings, Resort hotels account for 1\/3.\n2. About 50% of all bookings are cancelled.\n3. 2016 showed the highest rate of hotel bookings. (data from 2015-2017)\n4. Highest daily rates occurred in the summer (June, July, August)\n5. More bookings occured on weekdays vs weekends.\n6. Bookers with children or babies booked at resorts at a higher rate.\n7. UK, France, and Portugal booked the most hotel stays worldwide.\n8. Majority of hotel bookings did not require a deposit.\n9. Most bookings came from independent, transient customers.\n10. >90% of bookings were not return guests.\n\n# Discussion:\nAnalysis of this dataset highlights a few key take-aways. First, there is a disproportianate amount of cancellations on hotel bookings (~50%). Bookers are not required to send in a deposit in most bookings which could explain the high rate of cancellations. There are more bookings on weekdays, this data suggests that hotel business could be improved by targeting working travelers or improving daily rates for weekdays. Although resorts only account for 1\/3 of all bookings, they out-compete city hotels when there is a baby in the booking group. Resort hotels could target young families with this knowledge by appealing to customers looking for a safe, family atmosphere. Europe has a high amount of travelers that book both resort and city hotels. European business typically has more holiday vacation time for workers and aggressive marketing campaigns could be made in this region to corner this market. Resort hotels have a steep rise in price during busy summer seasons, knowing this information city hotels would potentially raise their daily rate (So long as they are not competing against each other). Lastly, most bookings came from independent travelers and there is a significantly low rate of return (<10%). Hotels should take efforts to improve relationships with customers or target past guests for return stays.\n","49370076":"From the pie chart above we can see that two thirds of bookers chose the city hotel option.","ff4e1edd":"We see a large number of cancelations from city hotels. Keep in mind most bookings were at city hotels.","261b4318":"Data shows a low number of repeated guests. In business, it is far more expensive to gain a new customer than to retain an exisiting one. Further business or marketing efforts could be drafted to improve rate of return.","50f140df":"In the plot above we se that city hotels had the most bookings consistently each year with the largest amount of bookings in 2016."}}
