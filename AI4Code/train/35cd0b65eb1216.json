They survived well. 3rd class primarily paid under $`50` but only a few survived. Thus, your class is a better indicator than age or fare.","fde7cfd2":"Well, men of early 20th centry have been quite chivalrous. Most women survived immaterial of their age.

First class has a mostly uniform distribution, while 2nd is centered around `30`. Further, kids (younger than 20) are most likely to be in second and third classes.\n\nIts clear that most of 3rd class did not survive, whereas most of first class did. Majority of children survived, they are in 2nd class.","e8d58aa5":"### Visualize missing data","c53ddba6":"#### What influence does gender play?\nLet us first, look at the distribution of `Age` across the genders.","a558768e":"## Impute for missing age\n","cea33559":"This is a detailed plot to unpack.\n * In first class, almost all women survived, but there are a lot of men who died.\n * In class 2, same way most women survived and little to no men survived\n * In class 3, a lot of men and women died. About half the women survived. Even kids died.","a1090f0d":"The distribution of male and female age looks similar, but there are more men in just about any age group.\nNext let us see how many men survived","424d374b":" * Does age show any correlation with Fare?
