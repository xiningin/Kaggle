For instance, similarities in walking could be detected using DTW, even if one person was walking faster than the other, or if there were accelerations and decelerations during the course of an observation. DTW has been applied to temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphics data \u2014 indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear sequence can be analyzed with DTW. A well known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. Other applications include speaker recognition and online signature recognition. It can also be used in partial shape matching application.","cbb7d9b9":"# **Thankyou for Reading and Do Upvote If you liked !!!**","63549aa3":"# Dynamic time warping","27555207":"# **References**\n","504d1864":"* https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dynamic_time_warping\n* https:\/\/dtaidistance.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/\n* https:\/\/github.com\/pierre-rouanet\/dtw\n* https:\/\/nbviewer.jupyter.org\/github\/markdregan\/K-Nearest-Neighbors-with-Dynamic-Time-Warping\/blob\/master\/K_Nearest_Neighbor_Dynamic_Time_Warping.ipynb"}}
