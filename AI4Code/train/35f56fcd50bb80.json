to address issues related to the COVID-19 virus and ensuing pandemic. The CORD-19 research dataset represents the most extensive machine-readable COVID-19 literature collection of over 59,000 scientific articles available for data mining to date. However, the rapid increase in the volume and type of COVID-19 literature makes it difficult for members of the medical community and policy makers to find what they need.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe focus of AI-007 was to create an artificial intelligence model that effectively searches the CORD-19 database and finds research papers answering the Task 9 questions: \u201c*What has been published about information sharing and inter-sectoral collaboration?*\u201d and \u201c*What has been published about information sharing and inter-sectoral collaboration? What has been published about data standards and nomenclature? What has been published about governmental public health? What do we know about risk communication? What has been published about communicating with high-risk populations? What has been published to clarify community measures? What has been published about equity considerations and problems of inequity?*\u201d\n<br>\n<br>\nThis AI-007 model built on relevant research articles provided by kaggle to help the medical and policy maker communities to find answers on topic related diagnostics and surveillance relating to COVID-19.\n<br>\n<br>\nBy providing the research and tools needed to empower policy makers to lead and control this pandemic more effectively, this AI-007 model contributes to the ongoing COVID-19 response efforts worldwide.\n<\/div>","096201c6":"# BM-25 to Select Relavent Articles","0ccc8fe0":"# Topic Modeling Coherence Score","388e3c08":"![TopicModelingScatterPlot.PNG](attachment:TopicModelingScatterPlot.PNG)","fa066df4":"#  Removal of Duplicates and extracting matching URL and Publish_Time from Metadata File","d85e9b7f":"# Download and Preprocess the dataset from Kaggle","750529bb":"## License Agreements\n\n#### PSF LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR PYTHON 3.8.2\n1.

This included consolidating data sources, keeping the most relevant columns of data, and then cleansing the data for easier analysis and input to the data models.<\/li>\n    <li>Next, we minimized the number of articles to analyze by eliminating those that were not relevant to the subtasks on which we were focused.<\/li>\n    <li>From there, we identified the dominant topics across the subtasks and used them to visualize the most relevant articles for each sub task.<\/li>\n    <li>Later, we used SciBERT pretrained model with the dataset provided by Kaggle to identify the relavent articles.<\/li>\n    <li>Lastly, we used 3 distance measures to identify the relavent articles.We displayed the responses to the subtasks follows,<\/li>\n        <ul>\n        <li><b>HTML Dropdown List<\/b><\/li>\n        <li><b>HTML File<\/b><\/li>\n        <li><b>Top 5 Articles<\/b><\/li>\n        <li><b>Distance Measure Plot<\/b><\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n    \n<font size=\"4\"><b>Prepare the Dataset for Processing<\/b><\/font>\n<br>\n<br>\nAn important technique that transforms the raw data into a format required for modeling, which results in retaining the critical keyword to improve the efficiency of the retrieval process, as well as the accuracy of the results. \n<br>\nActivities involved in this step were:<br>\n<ul>\n    <li>Remove duplicate papers using <b>title<\/b> data attribute<\/li>\n    <li>Remove punctuation, whitespace, stop words (library of words in English that are common words and not relevant to the article)<\/li>\n    <li>Make all words lowercase for exact matching of words<\/li>\n<li>Tokenize words so that each word can be used as an independent entity; each word is a token and additional preprocessing can be done.<\/li>\n    <li>Remove non English articles<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<font size=\"4\"><b>Train Model<\/b><\/font>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe use a Bag_of_Words retrieval function called Okapi BM25 to select the top 100 articles related to each task query. BM25, abbreviation of Best Matching25, is a probabilistic information retrieval ranking method. It ranks documents based on a relevance score which is the probability of a document being relevant to the input query.\n<br>\n<br>\n<font size=\"5\"><b>Pros and Cons of the Approach<\/b><\/font>\n<ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>We chose to start our approach by using the TF-ID word frequency model to create clusters of articles to find those related to our task 9 subtasks so we could then focus on that cluster of articles.<\/li>\n<li>We quickly saw that no clear clusters were formed. With 59,000 plus articles, there were not enough relationships among the keywords from the articles to form clear clusters.<\/li>\n<li>We quickly changed to Deep Learning algoritms like SciBERT, and  using different distance measure techniques to provide better results. We found, as a next generation SciBERT best-match model, it had more extensive capabilities to process high volumes of text to identify keywords and match them to relevant articles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>","bb545cab":"# **PIP Install of requried Libraries**# ","6ab85652":"![COVIDTask7-min.PNG](attachment:COVIDTask7-min.PNG)","c9879708":"# Visualize number of articles in our corpus related to TASK9","49c3afd4":"![TopicModelingcoherenceScore.PNG](attachment:TopicModelingcoherenceScore.PNG)","37d2fcb6":"**Ericsson, the world\u2019s leading telecommunications company, cares about doing good.
