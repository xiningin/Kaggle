No flood protection will be built. Costs are INR 10.000.000 every 10 years.\nHow does this compares to the first policy?","311fc678":"As we can see, the increse in cost is minimal. But how better is this option compared to keeping the status quo?","2f3fb9fe":"## Policy 1) Maximum protection\nSuppose you decide to take the following policy: I'll build and replace my flood protection every five years, for maximum safety.\n\nAnd suppose that the last flood have just taken place (before you had built your company), so you know it won't be coming again for the next 10 years. You decide to wait for about 9 years and then build your flood protection. Let's see how the cummulative spending on this policy looks like over 55 years.","98d69aae":"## Policy 3) Trade-off\n\nSince you know from previous data that floods accours only about every 10 years, you can try to use this in your advantage. Instead of replacing your protection every five years, you can instead do this only when near the occurance of the next flood.\n\nConsider year 0 as the current year (in which a flood has just occured). In this scenario, you know that a flood is probably going to happen by year 10. That way, you can build a protection by year 8 that'll last until year 13. Then you can wait till year 18 to build the next protection, and so on.","a6f4951a":"# Question\n\n\"If flood happens, it cost around INR 10.000.000 for a company to rebuild its plant after the devastation. In order to build protection for flood, it costs around INR 5.000.000 which can be used for 5 years after which it needs to be replaced. Even after putting the flood protection, if flood occurs, it still costs INR 100.000. In the last 10 years, flood has occurred once. \n\nBuilding flood protection or maintaining status-quo \u2013 which will be more cost effective for the company?\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/questions-and-answers\/106016","f3894b66":"This is a tricky question, since there's not much information on the probability of occurence of the floods. For the sake of my argument, I'll suppose all the data available indicates that a flood happens about every ten years or so. This will lead to a simplified (deterministic) discussion on the available options, but one that's maybe worth having as an initial intuition on the matter.","9528d108":"However, we mustn't forget to take into account the cost of the floods, each 10 years. \nLet's see the impact of a flood in this scenario, comparing side by side the costs of mantaining the flood protection __versus__ the costs of mantaining the protection plus the costs of the flood.","84fb9ada":"As shown above, by the end of the 55 years span there's no much difference from addopting the first or second policy. They only differ slightly during a 5 years window, but the difference soon closes and the costs stay the same for the following 5 years.\n\nHowever, these are not the only available options.","7d05454f":"# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, it's clear to see that the third policy is optimal. By the end of 55 years, your savings would ammount to INR 19.500.000 compared to the first policy and INR 24.500.000 compared to the second one.\n\nTo me, the take away is: when only two options are clrearly presented to you in a given situation, maybe it's worth trying to dig up a third one."}}
