And I'll limit my analysis to de_mirage which is my favourite map.\n<br>\nI borrowed some code from [billfreeman44's T side smokes on mirage kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/billfreeman44\/finding-classic-smokes-by-t-side-on-mirage) don't hesitate to give it a look it's pretty interesting espescially as smokes are a big part of mirage's gameplay !\n\n1. The data<br>\n2. CT Side defense analysis<br>\n  2.1. Positions regardless of weapons<br>\n  2.2. Specific case : AWP<br>\n3. T Side defense analysis<br>\n  3.1. Bombsite A<br>\n  3.2. Bombsite B<br>","afbb890e":"## 2. CT Side defense analysis\nTo understand CT Side positionning, first we'll filter actions from CT, before the bomb is planted<br>\nAlso we'll filter only when the CT side won as it's the only way we can measure efficiency (using points density) for a position by seeing if it is frequently used when the round is won.\n\n### 2.1. Regardless of weapon :","e72e734a":"We can see that the most efficient positions on A tend to be behind the boxes, upper stairs, window, jungle, short and truck. So positions that are a bit agressive.\n\n### 2.2. AWPs :","29f783a8":"## 1. The data\nThis dataset consists of more than 30k rounds where each line of data is a damage entry.<br>\nWe will focus on attacker position, and bomb state.<br>\nHere you can see how it looks :","27701465":"AWPs are playing more defensive positions to benefit from the range offered by the sniper, however playing AWP on B doesn't seem really efficient.\n\n## 3. T Side defense analysis\nFirst let's remind that from the dataset actions when the bomb is planted only represents 16% of all the actions registered in the dataset.<br>\nSo when the bomb is planted, terrorists should take an optimal positionning to defend the bomb. Unfortunately the dataset doesn't provide the bomb coordinates, only the site it is planted on. So we don't know if they have the bomb in sight for example.<br>\nErrors might come from the fact that Terrorists economy encourages to hunt remaining CTs when stomping a site.\n\n### 3.1. Bombsite A","6627013a":"Terrorists positionning seems a bit chaotic, but we can still see that palace\/under palace, CT, connector seem like good positions. However the further from bombsite the less effective the position is.<br>\nAlso the position called \"bitch\" in the right corner behind the boxes doesn't look really effective yet people play it a lot.\n\n### 3.2. Bombsite B","855d14d9":"Again the positionning on B is a bit chaotic, we can still see that market\/kitchen, truck, appartments, bench seem like good positions as they provide a lot of cover.\n\n## Conclusion\nFrom this analysis it seems that the most efficient tactic as a T is to play really deep into the site with a lot of cover, whereas for CTs it's to play semi-agressive positions near contact points or to hold long lines using an AWP.<br>\nAlso a lot of the defense is focused on mid & bombsite A. Which leads to CTs playing retake scenario on bombsite B.\n\n\nThanks for taking a look at my work, I highly recommend you to check [billfreeman44's T side smokes on mirage kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/billfreeman44\/finding-classic-smokes-by-t-side-on-mirage) which has done a pretty good work on covering T side smokes on mirage, his kernel will give you an understanding of why T side can really take advantage of a bombsite easily with some teamwork."}}
