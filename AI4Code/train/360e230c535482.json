For example, even though using the same seaborn, I was sometimes stunned to see that while I had only very simple line plots with it, the experts were using sunburst plots and clustermap to create elegant and accurate visualizations. Some people use Plotly to turn on\/off unnecessary graphs to make their analysis more compact, and others use Geoplotlib to draw easy-to-understand choropleth on maps. How experts learn and be familiar with such graph types? How can a non-expert kaggler step up to the next level? Since I was interested in such things, I wanted to clarify one way of doing so through this analysis.\n\nFor this analysis, I were particularly interested in whether the availability of BI tools would affect the number of visualization tools available to users. If we are familiar with BI tool, we can achieve a wide variety of good looking visualizations very fast. This means that users who are familiar with BI tools know many examples of ideal visualizations, and they should be working hard to reproduce or update them in their kaggle notebooks.\n\nAlso I feel that in the actual analysis field, we are required to use BI tools, not only just like the jupyter nootbook used in kaggle. For example, when a data analysis infrastructure is built, the user interface of the infrastructure is often a BI tool such as Tableau, and the analyst is required to be proficient in using the BI tool. Now we cannot use BI tools in kaggle, but since the above reason, I believe that kaggle as a platform for data analysts cannot ignore to incorporate the BI tool. Therefore, I will pay special attention to the impact of the BI tool in our analysis.","18bea1c2":"Unfortunately, the correlation is not high.","0e34c189":"I can also see that the average number of tools users can use is 0.6 higher if they can use the BI tool.","325ce9f1":"## What tools primarily use for analysis tool.\n\nIs there a difference in the number of tools they can use depending on the tools they use on a daily basis?.

We can see Plotly in fourth combination. We can see that the number of combinations is already much lower, indicating that most users are not using the interactive plot. In terms of geographic visualization tools, Geoplotlib comes in at 19th. It turns out that most users do not use geographic visualization tools.\n\nI guess that learning the tools needed for visualization first, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, is a higher priority than interactive or geographical visualization tools. This is confirmed by the data. Create a data frame from which various types of data are extracted.","5dbd2215":"# What measures can be implemented?\n\nThe analysis so far has shown that the number of visualization tools that can be used increases with the experience of using BI tools. Then, what measures can be implemented in kaggle? In order to answer this question, I want to analyze Q32. In this question, the respondents answered which BI tool they usually use. From the answers to these questions, I can find Major BI tools and select good tools to recommend to the kaggler.","a98b9423":"## What is the distribution of the number of tools available for a kaggle user?\n\nHow many visualization tools can be used per a kaggle user?","b98b82e7":"Q31-B\nWhich of the following business intelligence tools do you hope to become more familiar with in the\nnext 2 years?

Beginner level period.\n* medium: 3 - 4 years. Intermediate level period.\n* long: 5 - years. Advanced level period.\n\nIt depends on the person, but I think that after two full years of experience with machine learning, people will reach intermediate level. If they have more than five full years of experience, they are probably advanced.","b0fc9294":"## Future work - Check causal effect\n\nAs future work, I want to make sure that the availability of BI tools is the cause of the increase in the number of visualization tools available.\n\nThere are many different methods, but we can use [Lingam](https:\/\/github.com\/cdt15\/lingam) to know causal effect. For usage of Lingam to know causal effect, we can see [this reference](https:\/\/github.com\/cdt15\/lingam\/blob\/master\/examples\/CausalEffect.ipynb).","591a9d17":"From the above analysis, I found that even if I categorize users, those who can use BI tools have more tools available to who can not. BI tools make it possible to do various kinds of visualization (from simple line plots and scatter plots to geographical and interactive plots) very easily. So, I think users will be interested in learning about the various visualization methods and how they can be implemented in jupyter notebook.","36c14fbc":"For each tool(From now on, both tools and libraries will be collectively referred to as tools), I show the number of respondents who answered that they could use them in a pie chart.","9e5b8895":"--------------------","aba610ff":"Let's count it up.","dfc17101":"I define that kaggler \"don't want to be familiar with the BI tool\" means that Q31_B_Part_14 is selected.\nAlso I define that \"want to be familiar with\" means that all Q31_B options other than Q31_B_Part_14 are not null.","8e67a0f3":"It is a good idea to add content about BI tools to the Course. Currently, no such courses are available to the public.","51a78bae":"## <u>Goal of this notebook<\/u>\n\n* Find out how kaggle users are using the visualization tools.\n\n* Identify the characteristics of users who are familiar with many visualization tools.\n\n* Suggest measures that can be taken in kaggle to promote to use more variety of methods in kaggle notebook.","6ebc3cc7":"In Q14, each column contains the presence or absence of each tool used, so I change the column name to tool names.","458fb35a":"# Explore the factors that influence the number of tools used.\n\nUsing many tools does not necessarily improve the quality of notebooks, but since many of the tools in the Q14 choices have different uses as we saw above, it can be said that the more tools kaggle users can use, the more data analysis they can express.\n\nSo what is the difference between kagglers who can use a lot of tools and who can't? I would like to explore the characteristics of these from the data taken from the survey.","4b1bc5fb":"### In medium period\n\nNext, let's look at the distribution of the number of available tools among the population of users with medium ML experience, divided by whether they can use BI tools or not.","5840abee":"## Load libraries and dataset.","673f600a":"Tableau and Microsoft Power BI occupy the first and second place. Google Data Studio is in third place. I Think it would be good to devise a way to use Google Data Studio more often for kaggler.\n\n* Google Data Studio is free and everyone can use.\n* kaggle is supported by google.\n* Although it is in third place, some kagglers have been used Google Data Studio.","4be3ffd0":"Matplotlib is the most common, followed by Seaborn. Plotly and ggplot are next, but they are only half as common as the top two. For interactive plot, Plotly is the most major tool. The geographical visualization tools are minor. Many users are not able to visualize geographically.","9e9dbfba":"There was a difference in the average number of tools available between the group that wanted to be familiar with them and the group that did not, but the difference was small compared to the availability of BI tools.","77b8b57b":"To be sure, I will use a t-test to check if there is a significant difference in the means.","cef170f1":"It is also necessary to publish notebooks and discussions showing examples of use. Currently, some kagglers seem to be publishing notes related to Google Data Studio. However, there is still room to grow. If we compare the results of searching for Google Data Studio in the search box with the results of searching for pytorch, you will see that we can still make Google Data Studio more exciting in kaggle community.","b6648392":"The scatter plot looks like this.","81d0c7c5":"## What is the most common combination of tools?\n\nVisualize the combinations of tools that were answered that kagglers can use, in order of increasing frequency.","307271c4":"## ML exprience vs whether can or not use BI tools.
