The Doc is then processed in several different steps \u2013 this is also referred to as the processing pipeline. The pipeline used by the default models consists of a tagger, a parser and an entity recognizer. Each pipeline component returns the processed Doc, which is then passed on to the next component.\n\nThere are 4 step in spacy nlp pipeline\n1. Tokenizer (Fix)\n2. Tagger\n3. Parser\n4.

Which texts are similar to each other?\n\nspaCy is designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and \u201cunderstand\u201d large volumes of text.
