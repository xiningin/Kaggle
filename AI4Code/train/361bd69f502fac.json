In this section, a wordcloud of the most frequent words appearing in corpus of COVID-19 abstracts is built.

Other words such as *\"vaccine\"* and *\"proteine\"* have also been extensively discussed in literature.  ","eaccd235":"### ** TFIDF-based Automated Literature Review**\n\n***\n\nThis notebook applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other AI techniques to generate insights in the support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up. \n<br>\n<br>Language is unstructured data that has been produced by people to be understood by other people. Text data is not random, it is governed by linguistic properties that make it very understandable to other people and also processable by computers !!\n\n***\n\n**Methodology:** The authors extracted a number of abstracts that openly studied COVID-19 and its derivatives. Each abstract was first embedded in a static TFIDF model. Then, the cosine similarity of a **dynamic user query** was computed against each abtract of the static corpus. By sorting the most similar articles to a given query, we can rapidly and easily access the most relevant articles. **This allows the medical research community, governments, and decision-makers to rapidly consult the latest findings and discoveries in a given knowledge area**  through automated literature review. Links to the full-text research paper are also embedded and directly clickable in the output dataframe.\n\nFurthermore, the authors proposed additional text-mining approaches to generate insights from the corpus of abstracts, including 1) wordcloud of COVID-19 abstracts, 2) Word2Vec model to retrieve the most similar words to a specific word (e.g., retrieve the most similar words to *\"origin\"*, *\"transmission\"*), and 3) t-SNE visualization of semantic clusters from the corpus.\n***\n**Highlights:**\n1.  **TFIDF-based Automated Literature Review**\n2.  Wordcloud of COVID-19 Abstracts\n3.  Word2Vec Model and Textual Similarities\n4.  TSNE-Visualization of Semantic Clusters\n***\n\n**Pros:**\n* Automation of Literature Review \/ Efficient Abstract Browser\n* Easy and Rapid Access to the Latest Findings in a Given Domain\n* Insightful Data Visualization Tools\n\n**Cons:**\n* An abstract is only a partial summary of a research paper.\n* Reduced Scope: Analysis of 5,058 abstracts out of 47,000 research papers.\n\n***","712e2610":"This approach would enable the medical research community to review rapidly the latest findings and discoveries in a given domain. Several examples are presented below. Using a dynamic query as an input, the *automated_LR* function returns the most relevant abstracts to that queries. Three examples are shown below to automate the literature review about *\"What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?\"* (i.e., Task1). Other tasks can be adressed similarly by adjusting dynamic user queries.","37fa6037":"From the above TSNE visualization of Word2Vec embeddings, we can distinguish several clusters among which we can recognize semantic similarities including for instance, *medical treatment,  vaccine research, epidemiological research, covid-19 detection, transmission, causes and consequences of the disease*...

Among these articles, 26,408 articles, i.e., 56% of the corpus present abstracts that are believed to efficiently summarize the content of their respective articles. This notebook specifically focuses on the rapidly emerging literature that directly mention the terms *{\"Coronavirus\", \"Covid\", \"2019-nCov\", \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\"}* ; i.e., 5,058 abstracts that represent 19.1% of the total number of abstracts. We only considered the abstracts here, but the approach could be further applied to the text bodies.","e8678c66":"# **Part 6: T-SNE Visualization of Semantic Clusters**","129e9167":"# **Part 2: TFIDF-based Abstract Browser**","8f81c93d":"### ** <font color=green> What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?**","0ba92085":"**TFIDF** for **Term Frequency\u2013Inverse Document Frequency**, is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a corpus.\n\n\\begin{equation*}\ntfidf(t, d, D)  = tf(t,d) \\times idf(t,D)\n\\end{equation*}\nwith:\n\\begin{equation*}\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {tf} (t,d)=0.5+0.5\\cdot {\\frac {f_{t,d}}{\\max\\{f_{t',d}:t'\\in d\\}}}}\n\\end{equation*}\nand:\n\\begin{equation*}\n \\mathrm{idf}(t, D) =  \\log \\frac{N}{|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nwhere tf(t,d) represents the number of times that term t occurs in document d, idf(t, D) is is the logarithmically scaled inverse fraction of the documents that contain the word t, and N is the total number of documents d in the corpus.","adbf120e":"# **Part 4: Wordcloud of COVID-19 Abstracts**","ccaf21b2":"### ** <font color=green> What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability? **","2715c02f":"### ** <font color=green> What has been published about medical care?**","53096222":"The **T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)** dimensionality reduction technique was ultimately applied to project the 2D position of each word with its label. A machine learning **Kmean** algorithm was also implemented using *Scikit-learn* Python Library to partition n words into semantic clusters. To determine the optimal number of clusters K, the **elbow method** was used with below the plot of sum of squared distances for K in the range [1, 30]. If the plot looks like an arm, then the elbow on the arm is the optimal K. Here, **K =7**.","7de9a558":"A **Word2Vec** model (Word to Vector) was built using Gensim Python library to produce word embeddings. Using a large corpus of text as an input, a Word2vec model returns a vector (here, 100 dimensions) for each unique word in the corpus. The similarity between vectors is measured through the cosine similarity metric. Similar vectors represent words that are semantically related in the original corpus.","03d90d3a":"For instance, it is interesting to understand at a glance that the word ***\"origin\"*** is mainly linked to terms including the bigram ***\"interspecies_transmission\"***, and words such as ***\"pangolin\"***, ***\"evolution\"***, and ***\"zoonotic\"*** (FYI, A zoonosis is an infectious disease caused by a pathogen that has jumped from non-human animals to humans). <br><br>\n\nAlso, regarding what is known about transmission, it is worth having a look at ***\"transmission\"***'s most similar words, which include insightful words such as ***\"travel\"***, ***\"contact\"***, and ***\"fomite\"*** (FYI, A fomite is any inanimate object that, when contaminated with or exposed to infectious agents, can transfer disease to a new host).","990eb4e5":"# **Part 1: Data Extraction and Preparation**","6850bc7a":"# **Part 3: Automated Literature Review**","064dd1c2":"### ** <font color=green> What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?**","8be409b6":"### ** <font color=green> What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?**"}}
