Inverse document frequency is an inverse function of the number of documents in which that a given word occurs.\n\nThe product of these two terms gives tf-idf weight for a word in the corpus. The higher the frequency of occurrence of a word, lower is it's weight and vice-versa. This gives more weightage to rare terms in the corpus and penalizes more commonly occuring terms.\n\nOther widely used vectorizer is Count vectorizer which only considers the frequency of occurrence of a word across the corpus.","d1c69172":"**The notebook accomplishes these tasks -**\n* Text cleaning and preprocessing of fake_or_real_news dataset using NLTK and Regex library.\n* Creating and transforming clean text into tf-idf vectors.\n* Learning models like Passive Aggressive Classifier, XGBoost and LGBM to perform classification of fake and real news.

Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification outcome, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting.\n* Passive: If the prediction is correct, keep the model and do not make any changes. i.e., the data in the example is not enough to cause any changes in the model. \n* Aggressive: If the prediction is incorrect, make changes to the model. i.e., some change to the model may correct it.\n\nThese are typically used for large datasets where batch learning is not possible due to huge volumes of frequently incoming data.\n\n* Some important parameters -\n* C : This is the regularization parameter, and denotes the penalization the model will make on an incorrect prediction\n* max_iter : The maximum number of iterations the model makes over the training data.\n* tol : The stopping criterion.\n\nFor more details please refer to description source - https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/passive-aggressive-classifiers\/\n\nWe are using a simple implementation of this model here.","9626b615":"**Text cleaning and processing steps-**\n\n* Remove punctuations\n* Convert text to tokens\n* Remove tokens of length less than or equal to 3\n* Remove stopwords using NLTK corpus stopwords list to match\n* Apply lemmatization\n* Convert words to feature vectors","fe0449f8":"Logistic Regression could not outperform XGBoost and LGBM but its performance is considerably close to them and it is much less complex."}}
