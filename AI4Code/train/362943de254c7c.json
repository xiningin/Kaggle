This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.
