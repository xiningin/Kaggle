Because these values represent what are known as *vehicle controls*:\n> Vehicle controls refer to negative controls that should not cause significant changes in expression.\n\nFrom [Connectopedia](https:\/\/clue.io\/connectopedia\/glossary):\n> **Controls\u2014Vehicles (VC)**:   Various forms of \u201cinert\u201d experiments performed to determine, by contrast, effects that are specifically due to a perturbation as opposed to responses associated with handling cells or delivering a perturbagen; a type of negative control.\n\nI have found that setting these controls to 0 improved my score by **0.00012**. I know it is not much at the moment, but it may come in handy later...\n\nThanks are due to the Topic [\"Don't put drugs into Vehicle Control\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lish-moa\/discussion\/180165) by [Laevatein](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/laevatein), as well as the comment by the competition organizer [mrbhbs](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mrbhbs):\n> \"*Yes. The \"controls\" are samples with no compounds (and hence no MoAs). In real applications, they can be used as a baseline to assess the effect of a compound treatment. Here, the best you can do is to set the probability of MoA to 0.*\"\n\non the post [About \"Controlled Perturbations\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lish-moa\/discussion\/180304) by [Dorukhan Afacan](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/afajohn)."}}
