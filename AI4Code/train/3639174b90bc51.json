intangibles not found in the first metric. Are they positioned correctly on the field? Are they creating distance from their blocker to allow them to make a tackle? Overall are they getting close enough to the returner prior to the catch to pressure them into calling a fair catch.","1908f91b":"   The first metric I used was the average distance to the punt returner at the time of reception. The goal of a gunner is to get to the returner as quickly as possible so measuring the average distance the gunner is from a returner on all of their punt plays is a good measurement of this skill. Punts vary widely in distance, but ultimately the closer a gunner is to the returner at the time of a catch the more effective the gunner is.","417491c8":"**Top 10 Gunners by Tackle Percentage**","a134fce1":"Finally, this metric shows a coach how effective their gunners are at closing. A gunner could be fast enough to get close to the returner, but they may struggle with shedding their blocker or the actual act of tackling.","fe9398c8":"**Top 10 Overall Gunners**","371c17a5":"**Top 10 Gunners by Fair Catch Percentage**","b32343c1":"This metric was appealing to me because it adds in some of a player's intangible skills that can't be measured simply by their distance to the returner. Typically fair catches occur when the gunners are close to the returner; however, a gunner's ability to mentally pressure the returner and a gunner's reputation as an effective gunner may play a role in a returner's decision to call a fair catch.","964ccc6c":"# **Tackle Percentage**","25385a9a":"# **Ranking NFL Gunners on Punt Return Plays**","1d352cd8":"**3. Tackle Percentage**","3b1d0151":"Combining insights from all 3 of these metrics can allow NFL Special Teams staff to better coach and train their gunners for succesful punt outcomes.","6e325e13":"**1. Proximity to Punt Returner at Reception**","4806f74e":"# **Overall Rank**","42f05351":"# **Fair Catch Percentage**","f4709af8":"# **Conclusion**","70700d90":"**Top 10 Gunners by Average Distance to the Punt Returner**","38cd36d8":"# **Proximity to Punt Returner at Reception**","03320bbe":"# **Appendix of Code**","0df47911":"**2. Fair Catch Percentage**","2e9a701e":"Players struggling in this metric could use additional coaching and training in shedding Vises and effectively beating their blocker to get downfield.","6f72cd74":"   Using the NFL's player tracking data from the 2022 NFL Big Data Bowl, I analyzed the performance of 139 gunners from 2018-2020. To be considered, a player had to serve as the gunner on at least 10 punt plays during this duration.","9719b07b":"My final metric is the percentage of returned punts where a given gunner made the tackle. It's important for a gunner to be fast and reach the returner as quickly as possible, but ultimately the goal of a gunner is to stop the punt returner. The clearest way to measure this is the percentage of plays where they tackled the returner after a catch.","a3377ed4":"   Unlike quarterbacks or running backs, there are not obvious metrics for measuring a gunner's effectiveness. To better rank and evaluate NFL gunners, I've created 3 metrics that I believe showcase a given gunner's performance.\n","983468df":"All 3 of these metrics measure different skills important to being an effective gunner. I finally averaged each gunners ranking in these 3 metrics to identify the players that were succesful across all 3 areas. This should give us a list of the best overall gunners across the NFL.","27ae5ed8":"Gunners, not punters, are the players that often dictate the outcome of a punt. NFL teams typically field 2 gunners lined up near the sideline (similar to a wide receiver) whose goal is to reach the opposing punt returner as quickly as possible. One of the best gunners in NFL history, Steve Tasker, likened it to \"a running street fight at a sprint\". If a gunner can succesfully beat the Vise, the player from the opposing team attempting to prevent him from getting downfield, he can pressure the punt returner into a fair catch, tackle the returner, or even cause a fumble.","d98a3b3f":"The second metric I used was the percentage of punts that resulted in a fair catch while the gunner was playing. One of the goals of a gunner is to limit the return yards of a punt so fair catches are an ideal outcome resulting in 0 return yards from the point of catch.","85e12b81":"Gunners are some of the most important players in Special Teams so it's important to Special Teams coaches to evaluate gunner performance. These 3 metrics provide a framework for coaches to compare their gunner's across the league and identify areas of improvement.","37ee9e5f":"   Punts are some of the most crucial plays in swaying the success of an NFL team in a given game. While most fans are locked in on the punter, they may be missing the most important part of the play."}}
