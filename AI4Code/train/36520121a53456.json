It is not. Why is s_x changing while the ball flies? According to the laws of kinematis as long as the ball is in the air, the acceleration in the x-y plane should be zero, therefore the speeds along x and y should be constant.\nThe speed s from the trackind data seems to follow quite closely the speed calculated from the x displacement vs time. This indicates that the speed is not some three dimensional speed, but a speed in the x-y plane, as the one for the players.\n","4ed8bb2d":"Let's do the same analysis for the 56 yards punt that follows","9cca00d7":"In this notebook I am looking at one flying ball. I selected a play that is a deep kickback and I look at the speed and acceleration of the flying ball. \nNormally, after the kick, the acceleration of the ball should be constant and equal to the gravitational acceleration, if the acceleration from the tracking data is given by an accelerometer attached to the ball. The speed in the plane of the field should be constant. Weirdly, this is not what we see in the data.

Why did the acceleration suddenly increase?
