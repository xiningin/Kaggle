Sand Saves: 0.10\n\nAnd Par 4s and 5s dominate the game:\n\n1. Par 4: 0.46\n2. Par 5: 0.43\n3.

The overall average driving distance this year is around 295 (a yard less than last year).\n\nYes, the short game is important but you can't get to PGA Pro level without a good short game. As a result, the key differentiators are the more technical parts of the game: driving the ball far and accurately, and iron play. A good, long drive or a great iron shot to get to the green in regulation more often than your competitors is the key. Because once on the green there is not much to differentiate between the players.\n\n\"Drive for show, putt for dough\"? More like \"Get to the green in regulation for dough.\""}}
