This is an important factor in considering the choices of models to be used, especially SVM, since **SVMs rarely perform well on imbalanced data** (think about why that might be the case).\n\nLet's quickly look at missing values, if any.","ac0a1b1d":"You can see that the max value of the mean and maximum values of some features (pixels) is 139, 255 etc., whereas most features lie in much lower ranges  (look at description of pixel 0, pixel 1 etc. above).\n\nThus, it seems like a good idea to rescale the features.\n\n## Data Preparation for Model Building\n\nLet's now prepare the dataset for building the model. We'll only use a fraction of the data else training will take a long time.\n","b20680da":"From the plot above, we can observe that (from higher to lower gamma \/ left to right):\n- At very high gamma (0.01), the model is achieving 100% accuracy on the training data, though the test score is quite low (<75%). Thus, the model is overfitting.\n\n- At gamma=0.001, the training and test scores are comparable at around C=1, though the model starts to overfit at higher values of C\n\n- At gamma=0.0001, the model does not overfit till C=10 but starts showing signs at C=100. Also, the training and test scores are slightly lower than at gamma=0.001.\n\nThus, it seems that the best combination is gamma=0.001 and C=1 (the plot in the middle), which gives the highest test accuracy (~92%) while avoiding overfitting.\n\nLet's now build the final model and see the performance on test data.\n\n### Final Model\n\nLet's now build the final model with chosen hyperparameters.","09ac3997":"The accuracy achieved with a non-linear kernel is slightly higher than a linear one.
