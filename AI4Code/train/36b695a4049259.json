In addition you can see that only the microscopes have shifted the test group to darker image mean values and higher standard deviations. If more groups would have microscopes we would be better able to simulate this hidden test group in our training data.\n* Furthermore we can find some clusters that have only one close cluster whereas other cluster have multiple counterparts.

This means now that each cluster is responsible for each data point but with different strenghts. The cluster that holds the highest responsibility for one data point can then be hard assigned as well. \n\nIn the case of **mixture models it's assumed that there exist some hidden latent variables that generate the distribution of data you observe**. In our case we hope that these latent variables walk along with different cameras that have taken the images at different conditions. Some cameras might always produce dark, small images whereas other ones might take large, but bright images. Do you get the idea? We don't know which camera was used and we don't know how the conditions looked like. This information is hidden.  \n\n\nNow the gaussian mixture model descripes the following: **Each of our latent variable, each camera, causes one multivariate gaussian**, this is a normal distribution over more than one dimension. In our case we like to use the statistics per image like mean, standard deviation and skewness. Doing so our feature space is 3-dimensional and by looking at the 3d-scatterplot we can observe ellipsoids with different densities, locations and expansions. Then our distribution $p(x)$ of data we observe is said to be generated by these gaussian ellipsoids:\n\n$$ p(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot N(x|\\mu_{k}, \\Sigma_{k}) $$\n\n\nEach gaussian $k$ is somehow responsible that a single data spot is placed where it is. **One gaussian may be more responsible than the others but they are all working in a mixture to explain your data**. During learning all of these ellipsoid clusters are moving in space and varying their shape trying to match the distributed data $p(x)$ perfectly. **The learning procedure for models with latent variables is the expectation maximization**. This algorithm works in two consequtive steps that are repeated until all gaussians only have found their place and would only show slight changes in further steps. \n\n#### E-Step (expectation):  \n\nAt the start of the model are gaussians are placed and shaped randomly (or pretrained by k-means locations). Then for each gaussian, that represents one cluster, the model calculates how responsible the cluster $z_{k}$ is for one data spot $x_{n}$.\n\n$$\\gamma_{nk}  = \\frac {\\pi_{k} \\cdot N(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}, \\Sigma_{k})} {\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\pi_{j} \\cdot N(x_{n}|\\mu_{j}, \\Sigma_{j})}$$\n\nThese responsibilities sum up to 1 over all clusters for one data spot. Here we can read out the winner at the end of the learning procedure that is assigned as the predicted cluster for that data spot $x_{n}$.\n\n#### M-Step (maximization):\n\nDuring the maximization step, all parameters of the gaussians, the locations given by the cluster center and the shapes covered by the covariance matrices are updated:\n\n$$\\mu_{k} = \\frac{1}{N_{k}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\gamma_{nk} x_{n} $$\n\n$$\\Sigma_{k} =  \\frac{1}{N_{k}}  \\sum_{n=1}^{N}  \\gamma_{nk} (x_{n} - \\mu_{k}) (x_{n} - \\mu_{k})^{T}$$ \n\n\nYou can see that we obtain each cluster location $\\mu_{k}$ by looking and summing over all data spots. This is a big difference between K-Means and GMM as the further only calculates the cluster centers using cluster members. But in our case, as already told, each gaussian is responsibile for all data points. Hence the new location is calculated by using them all, but weighting with the responsibility. Thisway points that could be well explained by this cluster contribute much more to the new location (mean) than the other data points. The same holds for the cluster shapes aka covariances.  \n\n\nBut nontheless there is also one more similarity: We are taking a weighted mean and for this reason we also need to take about outliers. We need to preprocess our data by rescaling and trying to transform the features such that they look normally distributed to suppress their effect.
