(e.g., 2019-ncov and sars-cov) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence.\n\ndespite their relatively distant phylogenetic relationships, 2019-ncov and sars-cov are both known to be capable of infecting humans using the same cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) 5,6,9,10 , and their protein structures of receptor-binding protein spike (s) are found to be highly similar to each other 10,11 , suggesting their phenotypic convergence.\n\nour results reveal positive selection signals and evolutionary convergent amino acid sites of the spike protein in both 2019-ncov and sars-cov and their related coronaviruses, providing new insights into understanding the evolutionary origin of their phenotypic convergence., cite_spans [], ref_spans [], section introduction, text we used likelihood ratio tests based on the branch and branch-site models implemented in the codeml program of paml 17 to examine the possible darwinian selection of all 11 genes annotated in the 2019-ncov

mechanism following emerging coronavirus infection.\n    \n    Excerpts:\n    \nby utilizing calu3 cells, we have developed a robust human model platform to study innate immune regulatory control and epigenetics following emerging coronavirus and influenza virus infections as well as other highly pathogenic viruses.\n\n\nusing comparatively generated data from multiple levels of biological systems

fitness.\n    \n    Excerpts:\n    \nin the process of cell culture and clinical spread of pedv, several genomic sites show variation and recombination, which are closely related with pedv cell adaptation, pathogenicity, and evolution.\n\nthese observations indicated that the release of infectious pedv particles was more efficient without the assistance of trypsin activity, suggesting that strain 85-7 might employ a specific protease cleavage mechanism of the s protein for its infection process.,\n\nprevious reports showed that the pedv genome might display frequent variation in the process of clinical evolution and cell culture, and some of the variant sites are closely related to pedv pathogenicity and cell adaptation [5, 21] , which provides useful clues to explore the molecular functions of viral proteins, and further clarify pedvs infection mechanism.\n\nthe analysis of the variable regions of the five mutant strains show that the nucleotide sequences of the non-structural protein nsp8, nsp9, and nsp15 were not subject to any variations during the vero cell adaptation process of pedv strain 85-7. overall, we identified four major variable regions (v1-v4) that contained the most mutation sites ( figure 3e ).\n\n\n\n\n    3af802dbd78af066cc59bf0a894bb8ff128f06cc\n    \n    To assess the codon evolution in virus-host systems, avian coronavirus and its

We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity. The bacteriophage Cystoviridae species \\u03c66 used in this study is a good model for enveloped pathogens. The interaction between \\u03c66 and montmorillonite (MMT) clay (the primary component of bentonite) is explored by transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that MMT-\\u03c66 mixtures undergo heteroaggregation, forming structures in which virtually all the virions are either sequestered between MMT platelet layers or attached to platelet edges. The virions swell and undergo disassembly resulting in partial or total envelope loss. Edgeattached viral envelopes distort to increase contact area with the positively charged platelet edges indicating that the virion surface is negatively charged. The nucleocapsid (NCs) remaining after envelope removal also exhibit distortion, in contrast to detergent-produced NCs which exhibit no distortion. This visually discernible disassembly is a mechanism for loss of infectivity previously unreported by studies of nonenveloped viruses. The MMT-mediated sequestration and disassembly result in reduced infectivity, suggesting that clays may reduce infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses in soils and sediments.\",\n\n    ee5ee45366753b52ea76058be790ec3e611f8cbb\n    \n    This article discusses the role of hybrid nano-structures of multiwalled carbon nano-tubes in increasing the efficiency to air filters against microorganisms.\n\n    Excerpt:\n\"text\": \"Controlling airborne microorganisms has become increasingly important with increase in human indoor activities, epidemic disease outbreaks, and airborne pathogen transmission.

Similar to HTA Ti-V-O coatings, the titanium oxide produced through LSTO had photoactive antibacterial effects [17, 18] , and the vanadium oxide produced also exhibited antibacterial properties [19] . By combining titanium oxide and vanadium oxide, the presented results coincided with the study of Wren et al., indicating that the Ti-V-O thin film exhibited greater antibacterial properties [20] . By contrast, the 100 kHz of LSTO Ti-V-O coating demonstrated higher antibacterial properties because of its superhydrophobic surface (i.e., exhibiting a water contact angle of 140 \\u2022 ). In reference to Zhang et al. [11] , when the coating surface came into contact with bacteria cells, the superhydrophobic surface lowered the binding power between the bacteria cell and sample surface. This reduced bacterial cells' ability to attach to the sample surface, resulting in antibacterial effects. As a result of this, the 100 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coating seems to exhibit superior antibacterial properties compared with the 300 kHz and 500 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coatings. The present study verified that the Ti-V-O coating exhibited excellent antibacterial properties, and the vanadium compounds within the Ti-V-O coating induced inflammation in cells. Some researchers have indicated that oxidation states of vanadium could induce DNA damage [21, 22] in cells, and excessive amounts of vanadium compounds exert observable toxic effects on body tissues [23] . Although vanadium has been confirmed as a toxic transition metal, the application of it, in cancer treatment and as a novel medicine in special compounds against viral infections, such as Dengue fever, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) [24] , still shows great potential for the future. \",\n\n\n\n\n    1298387602fdda99007bbceac968cf8b2e974ad5\n    This article makes some observations on the presence of hydrobhobic proteins present in the coronavirus genome and its properties.\n\n    Excerpt:\n\n\"text\": \"The open reading frame potentially encoding a 78 amino acid, 9101 Da hydrophobic protein (HP) and, mapping at the 3' end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome, was shown to be expressed during virus replication.

It also has important references to literature about shedding and asymptomatic transmission among children.\n\n    Excerpts:\n\nAnalysis of these data indicated that over 6% of participants tested positive for shedding of respiratory virus. While participants who tested positive were more likely to report symptoms than those who did not, over half of participants who tested positive were asymptomatic.\"\n\n In general, among children, studies have found that 24.6% to 64% of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are asymptomatic (7) (8) (9) (10) . A number of studies have also documented the fraction of asymptomatic children who are shedding virus rather than the fraction of infected children who are asymptomatic. Calvo et al. documented an HRV shedding rate of 12.3% among healthy children (9) . Van Benten et al. found that 20% of asymptomatic infants \\u05452 years old tested positive for HRV (11) .

The use of disease models and statistical methods is prevalent in this article.\n\n    Excerpt:\n\nOur transmission dynamics model suggests that the proportion of symptomatic infections is about 9%, implying that there were about 344 asymptomatic infections along with the 32 observed symptomatic cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of asymptomatic infection in the epidemic process increases the estimate of R 0 but does not do so greatly provided that the proportion of symptomatic infections is constant over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.\"\n\nThese two facts suggest that transmission occurs from asymptomatic cases as well as from symptomatic cases.

WHO estimates that ~20% of reported MERS cases are asymptomatic (54), but this estimate is likely underestimated given surveillance focuses on severe cases requiring hospitalization (55) and evidence from serologic studies (32) . One study documented prolonged shedding of MERS-CoV in an asymptomatic health care worker (56) , which provides evidence that, if not properly isolated, asymptomatic cases in health care settings and in the community could lead to onward transmission. The experts included in this study believe that contact with asymptomatic cases is as important as that with infected dromedaries. Comprehensive testing of contacts of MERS-CoV patients, regardless of the presence of symptoms, is required to evaluate infection between known cases. The role of asymptomatic cases or carriers, if they are indeed infected, also needs careful consideration in the community setting. Not all reported primary cases can be traced back to contact with dromedaries, and it is likely, at least in some cases, that an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic case may be an intermediary between dromedary contact and a symptomatic human case.\",\n\n\n","eabee38e":"## Create a html document of the most relevant papers","0937fdcf":"## Select words from the subtask vocabulary to uncover relevant articles","518e7039":"# Task 1, Subtask 7\n**Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person\n\n## Vocabulary Used\n1. natural\n2. history\n3. shed\n4. shedding\n5. coronavirus\n\n\n## Notes on the vocabulary\n\nThere are no special modifications to the vocabulary, and the choice of words to search for is self explanatory, give the sub task.\n\n## Notes on the main cluster diagram\n\n![](https:\/\/github.com\/sagarkolte\/CORD-19\/blob\/master\/Task_1\/Sub_Task_7\/MainClusterMap_1_7.png?raw=true)\n\nThe cluster seems to indicate the presence of atricles with the words 'natural', 'history' and 'coronavirus' in them.

FCV was isolated from the oral fauces of 11% of healthy cats upon entry, and isolation rates were highest for kittens (33%). FHV shedding was very low (4%) at the time of entry and occurred mainly in juveniles. FECV shedding was also common among newly relinquished cats (33%), especially older kittens and juveniles (90%). The subsequent spread of all three viruses was rapid and efficient in the shelter environment. Fifteen percent of cats were shedding FCV, 52% FHV, and 60% FECV after 1 week. More detailed studies were done with FECV shedding, which could be accurately quantitated. The amounts of FECV shed by infected cats ranged from 10 2 to 10 16 particles\/swab of feces. FECV shedding was several logs higher in young kittens with primary infection than adult cats with primary infections. The mean levels of FECV shedding among adults were the same for primary and chronic infections. Although shelters were not the primary source of these viruses for many relinquished cats, factors intrinsic to the shelter environment were critical in amplifying shedding and spread to susceptible individuals. Extrinsic factors were especially important for the spread of FHV and FECV. FHV shedding rates increased from 4% to 50% in 1 week's time. The speed and magnitude of the increase in FHV shedding suggested that there was reactivation of latent infections as well as acquisition of new infections. FECV shedding increased 10 to 1,000,000 fold in 1 week among cats that were already infected at entry, and more than one-half of initially negative cats were shedding FECV a week later. Feline calicivirus infection was the least likely to spread in the shelter.

We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62e71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.

In addition, the inactivation of SARS-CoV in wastewater with sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide was also studied.

However, at 4 \u2022 C, the SARS-CoV could persist for 14 days in wastewater and at least 17 days in feces or urine. SARS-CoV is more susceptible to disinfectants than Escherichia coli and f 2 phage. Free chlorine was found to inactivate SARS-CoV better than chlorine dioxide.

We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable.\"\n\n    6fad80bbb0ee407dd16686c33a54f1b2a1b149c8\n    While we hoped that this article will shed light on convalescent transmission, it actually does not. However it has some interesting statements to make about delayed recovery and non-uniform transmission on the spread of diseases. \n    An Excerpt:\ntext: \"We investigate the effects of delaying the time to recovery (delayed recovery) and of nonuniform transmission on the propagation of diseases on structured populations. Through a mean-field approximation and large-scale numerical simulations, we find that postponing the transition from the infectious to the recovered states can largely reduce the epidemic threshold, therefore promoting the outbreak of epidemics. On the other hand, if we consider nonuniform transmission among individuals, the epidemic threshold increases, thus inhibiting the spreading process. When both mechanisms are at work, the latter might prevail, hence resulting in an increase of the epidemic threshold with respect to the standard case, in which both ingredients are absent. Our findings are of interest for a better understanding of how diseases propagate on structured populations and to a further design of efficient immunization strategies.\"\n\n    d2bf31d4a63b71e7b5bb16f4375134d4ef881d25\nThis article speaks of the infection neutralizing properties of convalescent sera from SARS patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n","7bef5416":"![](https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/-\/media\/images\/health\/1_-conditions\/infectious-diseases\/coronavirus-hero.ashx?h=500&la=en&mh=500&mw=1300&w=1297&hash=6464CC9E4F6364821A5973E670CFB3342C2D9AF4)\n# Task 1: What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?\n\n> We have power over the things we give a name.\n\nThe CORD-19 Challenge is a list of 10 tasks that need to performed upon a fairly large corpus of scientific literature relating to the discipline of Virology and other related fields. The tasks listed in this challenge can be classified into two primary categories:\n\n1. What do we know about...\n2. What has been published...\n\nWhile the two are, a priori, different questions, for the purposes of this challenge, we believe that we can treat them as interchangeable. We make this assumption because the authors of this notebook are not placed well so as to be able to tell the difference between what has been published and what is 'known' in the fields which this corpus concerns itself. Further, it is true to a fairly large degree that one cannot answer the first question without answering the second. Hence, for the rest of this notebook, we concern ourselves with the second question.\n\nAny answer to a question about what has been published does not serve its purpose unless it also describes the relationships between the several pieces of literature. This is because a survey is seldom about data, and often about relationships. Thus in this notebook, we have attempted to:\n\n1. Identify articles of particular interest and merit about the various subtasks listed.\n2. Make a map of the relationships between these articles.\n\nThe first task is achieved by stemming and tokenization, the second has been achieved by methods of agglomerative clustering and its [visualization](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.clustermap.html).\n\n## The Process\n\nThe following actions form the building blocks of this process:\n1. Choosing a vocabulary------------------------------------>(User Input)\n2. Generating Cluster Maps---------------------------------->(Using Lemmatization, Vectorization and Agglomerative Clustering)\n3. Inspecting Cluster Maps to identify promising articles--->(User Discretion)\n4. Inspecting Data Frames to read document contents--------->(User Discretion)\n\nThe flow of the process is described in this diagram:\n\n![](https:\/\/github.com\/sagarkolte\/CORD-19\/blob\/master\/KaggleSubmissionMaterial\/Screenshot%202020-04-04%20at%209.04.56%20PM.png?raw=true)\n\nIn order to search for information about the topics listed in the subtask, we paid special attention to the set of words that best described the subtask. Thus every search began with the choice of a vocabulary. We then associated to each document a vector by listing out the number of times each word in the vocabulary appeared in the absrtact of the article. We then used cluster maps to visualize what the set of all abstracts looked like as a set of vectors. This served two purposes:\n\n1. The cluster map gave us information about the availability of research on a certain topic.\n\n2. How much of this research was in the context of the other words in the vocabulary.\n\nFor example, if we included the word 'virus' in the vocabulary, the clustermap showed that there was coupious amounts of research on the subject. However, very little of that was in the context of the Coronavirus, which is the focus of this challenge. Thus we have avoided including the word 'virus' in our vocabulary as it clouds the more subtle details in the clustermap.\n\nOnce we have a view of the cluster map produced by the whole vocabulary, we restrict the vocabulary to fewer words and generate the cluster maps again. In this iteration, we see that the cluster maps aid us greatly in identifying promising articles rapidly.\n\nWe illustrate this process with an example:\n\n\nTask 1, Subtask 1: Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.\n\n\nVocabulary:\n\n1. incubation\n2. age\n3. convalescent\n4. transmission\n5. contagious\n6. carrier\n7. convalescence\n\n\nFrom the Main Cluster map, we conclude that:\n\n1. The relationship between age and transmission seems to be particularly well represented in the corpus.\n2. Incubation and transmission seem to have been discussed in a reasonable number of articles, it is however not as many as the first category.\n3. While 'convalescence' seems like a sparingly used word in the corpus, 'recovery' and 'transmission' appear together in a few documents, this gives us the hope that we might find information about convalescent transmitters in this overlap.\n4. We also seem fairly well placed in terms of finding information about 'transmission' during 'incubation'.\n5.

To parse the full text of a particular SHA, we use the function *get_sentences('sha','word_to_search')*\n\n## Notes about the algorithms used\n\nThe principal philosophy at work here is that:\n\n1. Given a set of words, we can associate to every document a vector of the count of words. **([Lemmatization](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lemmatisation), [tokenization](https:\/\/nlp.stanford.edu\/IR-book\/html\/htmledition\/tokenization-1.html))\n2. We then treat all documents as vectors and perform agglomerative clustering the set of vectors. **([Agglomerative Clustering](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hierarchical_clustering#Agglomerative_clustering_example))\n3. We represent the results of our clustering using cluster maps. **([Seaborn Cluster Maps](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.clustermap.html))\n4. We use sentence tokenization to search for sentences that contain the words of our interest. **([sent_tokenize](https:\/\/www.nltk.org\/api\/nltk.tokenize.html))\n\n\n\n## Drawbacks of the proposed approach\n\n1. The algorigithm currently is only vectorizing article abstracts. While getting it to parse the whole text is not a difficult code change, it consumes a significant amount of comuting power and time. We did not have this luxury given the deadlines. \n\n    Possible Resolution: We call upon the experts in parallel processing and threading to help us out with this issue.\n    \n2. We have not managed to make our cluster maps interactive, for instance, if we find a particular row of the map interesting, we should be able to hover over the row to be able to see the abstract and title of the associated article.\n\n    Possible Resolution: We call upon the members well versed with interactive visualization libraries in Python to collaborate with us on this topic.\n\n\n\n\n","4a8baae2":"# Task 1, Subtask 3\n**Seasonality of transmission.\n\n\n## Vocabulary Used\n1. transmission\n2. seasonality\n3. seasonal\n\n## Notes on the vocabulary\nHere we simply make sure that we do not miss out on the seasonality due to bad stemming.\n\n## Notes on the main cluster diagram\n![](https:\/\/github.com\/sagarkolte\/CORD-19\/blob\/master\/Task_1\/Sub_Task_3\/MainClusterMap_1_3.png?raw=true)\n\nThe main cluster diagram shows a significant amount of literature on seasonality of transmission.\n\n## Choice of pairs of words to uncover the subtopics\n\n![](https:\/\/github.com\/sagarkolte\/CORD-19\/blob\/master\/Task_1\/Sub_Task_3\/transmission_seasonal_1_3.png?raw=true)\n1. transmission, seasonal\n\n## Top 5 article SHAs\n### transmission, seasonal\n* 1218f278a4f8d83dac14b23c8f698062812ef9d5\n* 60f1a9fff7e34e6a528a2a06dedb23700c87e114\n* 4be572af41fbf94759bf8872ff257fa0f632dca0\n* 1dc4f757f425b080168840089f1f4d29bac75f51\n* c8ca3a5306db10a7842b853031404ecbc0a363ed\n\n## Articles of Note:\n\n    1218f278a4f8d83dac14b23c8f698062812ef9d5\n    This article explores the effect of seasonal changes in the transmissibility of the corona virus\n    \n    Excerpt:\n\"text\": \"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020\/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.\",\n\n    60f1a9fff7e34e6a528a2a06dedb23700c87e114\n    This articles explores the relationship between transmissibility of the infulenza virus and seasonal conditions.\n\n    Excerpt:\n\"text\": \"Influenza viruses display distinct seasonal patterns in temperate climates with peak infection rates occurring in the winter months and little to no influenza virus activity detected at other times of the year [1] . However, it is not completely understood why we have \\\"flu seasons\\\". The same seasonal trends do not necessarily apply to regions in tropic and subtropic climates where influenza virus activity can be detected year round. Social and health factors such as indoor crowding and seasonal fluctuations in host immunity have been offered as explanations for influenza seasonality, but the lack of direct evidence supporting these theories suggests that the environment may be the most relevant contributor and potential driving force of seasonality [1, 2] . Although seasonal influenza viruses display predictable infection patterns, the four most recent influenza virus pandemics began with newly emerged viruses appearing outside the usual influenza season (1918 Spanish Influenza A H1N1, 1957 -1958 Asian Influenza A H2N2, 1968 Hong Kong Influenza A H3N2, 2009 H1N1) [3, 4] . Emergence of the most recent pandemic virus was preceded by reports of sporadic infections of a swine-origin H1N1 virus in young individuals [4, 5] . During the summers of 2010-2014, reports have emerged in the Midwest region of the U.S. of H3N2 variant influenza virus infections in children with a recent history of exposure to swine [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . These events highlight the importance of closely monitoring emerging strains of influenza viruses throughout the year and the need for our improved understanding of the effects of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity on influenza virus transmission.\",\n\n    c8ca3a5306db10a7842b853031404ecbc0a363ed\n\n    Excerpt:\n\"text\": \"Acute respiratory infections caused by viruses such as HRSV, influenza A virus and human parainfluenza virus, amongst others are seasonally-distributed 15 . In temperate countries, a higher prevalence of HMPV has been reported during the months of winter and spring, with a lower seasonality than HRSV 2, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Climate also plays an important role in determining the seasonality of HMPV in tropical countries. Previous studies have described a direct correlation between the number of rainy days and the increase in the number of HMPV infections 6, 8 . In addition to the number of rainy days, the effects of other important factors in a tropical climate such as the relative humidity, temperature and amount of rainfall on the prevalence of HMPV need to be investigated in order to provide a better understanding of its seasonality.\",\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n","46844fd0":"# Task 1, Subtask 14\n**Role of the environment in transmission\n\n## Vocabulary Used\n\n1. environment\n2. transmission\n3. coronavirus\n\n## Notes on the vocabulary\n\nNo special observations\n\n## Notes on the main cluster diagram\n\n![](https:\/\/github.com\/sagarkolte\/CORD-19\/blob\/master\/Task_1\/Sub_Task_14\/MainClusterMap_1_14.png?raw=true)\n\nWhile there are articles that contain the word envronment and coronavirus, the articles containing all three words in the vocabulary are very rare.\n\n## Choice of pairs of words to uncover the sub topics\n\n![](https:\/\/github.com\/sagarkolte\/CORD-19\/blob\/master\/Task_1\/Sub_Task_14\/coronavirus_environment_1_14.png?raw=true)\n\n1. coronavirus, environment \n\n\n## Notes on findings\n\n## Articles of Note:\n\n    79284efbde971538024ccbe888fa90bcd515d45c\n    \n    This article makes inportant observation about the survival rates of the coronavirus in various environmental conditions.\n    \n    Excerpts:\n\ntext: \"The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22-25 \u2022 C and relative humidity of 40-50%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (>3 log 10 ) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38 \u2022 C, and relative humidity of >95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment did not have major community outbreaks of SARS.\"\n\n    d3070b290b020128e13189e64839240e22fcafa7\n    \n    The authors conducted a study aimed at sampling the environment in the King Abdul Aziz International (KAAI) Airport, Pilgrims City, Jeddah, during Hajj season to detect respiratory pathogens.    \n    Excerpts:\n    \ntext: \"Background: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are common during the Hajj season and are caused by a variety of organisms, which can be transmitted via the air or contaminated surfaces. We conducted a study aimed at sampling the environment in the King Abdul Aziz International (KAAI) Airport, Pilgrims City, Jeddah, during Hajj season to detect respiratory pathogens. Methods: Active air sampling was conducted using air biosamplers, and swabs were used to sample frequently touched surfaces. A respiratory multiplex array was used to detect bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens. Results: Of the 58 environmental samples, 8 were positive for at least 1 pathogen. One air sample (1 of 18 samples, 5.5%) tested positive for influenza B virus. Of the 40 surface samples, 7 (17.5%) were positive for pathogens. These were human adenovirus (3 out of 7, 42.8%), human coronavirus OC43\/HKU1 (3 out of 7, 42.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (1 out of 7, 14.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (1 out of 7, 14.2%). Chair handles were the most commonly contaminated surfaces. The handles of 1 chair were cocontaminated with coronavirus OC43\/HKU1 and H influenzae. Conclusion: Respiratory pathogens were detected in the air and on surfaces in the KAAI Airport in Pilgrims City. Larger-scale studies based on our study are warranted to determine the role of the environment in transmission of respiratory pathogens during mass gathering events (eg, Hajj) such that public health preventative measures might be better targeted.\"\n\n","88c009b8":"## Search for excerpts within the article text using the SHA"}}
