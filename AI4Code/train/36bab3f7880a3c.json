family.","eed2ba41":"## Person Insights\nPclass --- Interestingly, adult males only saw a significant decline in survival rate from first to second class, whereas both adult females and children only saw a significant decline between second and third. Surprisingly, adult males actually saw a slight uptick in survival rate from second to third. Key takeaway: It appears that the survival of adult females and children in first and second class was heavily prioritized over the survival of others (especially men in second and third class).\n\nEmbarked --- Cherbourg saw the highest survival rates and Queenstown saw the lowest across adults males, adult females, and children. It's not immediately clear why this could have been, let's investigate further.\n\nSibling\/Spouse and Parent\/Child --- There don't appear to be any meaningful trends in either variable. It seems part of the problem could be that we are trying to divide our population up into too many buckets to determine anything significant. Moving forward, let's consolidate the information in these two variables into one that simply designates whether a passenger was traveling alone or with family.\n\nFare --- adult men, adult women, children, and unknowns all exhibit similar positive correlations between fare and survival rate. This makes sense, assuming fare and class number are negatively correlated - let's confirm this.\n\nAge --- Interestingly, children have a negative correlation with age, while both adult males and adult females have small positive correlations. Note, however, that confidence bands for all three groups allow for no correlation, and removing the 80-year-old would result in even less of a positive correlation for adult males. Next, we should look at survival rates by age range (e.g. in 10 year buckets).","ddc3c657":"Awesome! Per the first graph, Cherbourg sees a higher share of passengers in first class than either Queenstown or Southampton, which helps explain the higher survival rate. Additionally, Queenstown is almost entirely third class (72 out of 77, 94%), which helps explain why it had the lowest survival rates across adult males, adult females, and children.\n\n#### A few additional observations:\nPer the second graph, a much lower portion of adult females were in third class than for any other cohort.\n\nPer the third graph, we see that a disproportionately high share of Queenstown passengers have unknown age.","d4c6ff3a":"# Key Takeaways\nFemales and children in first and second class had a much higher probability of survival than the remaining population.\n\nPclass: Probability of survival appeared to decrease with passenger class for most cohorts: overall, adult females, adult males, and children (note, we only saw a general downward trend for these last two groups).\n\nSex: Females had a significantly higher probability of survival than males. This trend held for adults, and to a lesser degree children. For adults, this trend held regardless of passenger class, embarked location, parent\/child count, or sibling\/spouse count.\n\nAge: We saw a general downward trend in probability of survival overall with increased age. This trend held for both children and males, but interestingly females saw a positive correlation between age and probability of survival.\n\nFamily (SibSp\/Parch): Overall, having family onboard increased probability of survival. Looking at each of the Parch and SibSp variables, it appeared that having one family member was definitely better than having none, but having beyond one did not increase probability of survival.\n\nFare: Probability of survival increases with fare in general. We see this trend hold across each of the following cohorts: alone, with family, adult males, adult females, children, and unknown age. We confirmed that fare declines as passenger class increases, which could explain the positive trend in survival.\n\nEmbarked: Overall, survival rate was highest for Cherbourg passengers and lowest for Queenstown passengers. This held for each of the adult male, adult female, and child cohorts.","d0c3ff57":"Confirmed. Interesting how similar second and third class fares are in comparison to first class.","1c6f15a8":"Next, let's import our titanic data set and get a summary of the data with the .info() and .describe() methods.","f0ef21d8":"Very cool -- while survival rates are roughly the same for 16-64 year olds, there is a clear positive correlation between survival and age for females and a clear negative correlation for males.","16b2b758":"### Single Variable Insights\nPclass --- Probability of survival clearly decreases as we move from first to third class. Note not only the decrease in observed rates (62% -> 47% -> 24%), but also the almost complete lack of overlap of the 95% confidence interval bars (ci bars); we can be pretty confident that survival rate drops from first to second class, and we can be even more confident it drops from second to third.\n\nSex --- Men clearly have a lower probability of survival than women. The difference in observed survival rates is stark (74% vs 19%), and the ci bars are worlds apart.\n\nEmbarked Location --- Given the size of the ci bar overlap, Cherbourg, France (55%) clearly has a higher survival probability than Southampton, USA (34%), and it seems somewhat likely to be higher than Queenstown, Australia (39%) as well. We need more data to be confident Queenstown has a higher survival probability than Southampton, although it's definitely trending that way. \n\nNumber of Siblings\/Spouse --- Survival probabiliy is clearly higher when a passenger has one sibling\/spouse (54%) vs none (34%). But as the number of siblings\/spouse increases beyond one, we begin to see a rapid decline in survival rate. Note, however, that fewer than 10% of passengers have more than 1 sibling\/spouse, so our confidence in actual survival probability here is low.\n\nNumber of Parents\/Children --- As with sibling\/spouse count, survival rate is clearly higher when a passenger has one parent\/child (55%) vs none (34%). However, it's hard to say whether survival probability changes when a passenger has more than one parent\/child - the observed survival rates are fairly meaningless given the large ci. Once again, only about 10% of passengers have more than one parent\/child onboard.\n\nFare --- There is a clear positive correlation between fare and probability of survival, given the strong positive slope throughout the ci band.\n\nAge --- There is a fairly clear, yet moderate, negative correlation between age and probability of survival. Note that the ci band does allow for an almost flat line, but given the upward pull of that debatable outlier at 80 yrs, we can feel fairly confident saying probability of survival moderately decreases with age overall.","9bbf815b":"# Sex\n\nGiven the significant and clear difference between Male and Female rates of survival, let's start with the Sex variable for further investigation.\n\nBefore we go farther, let's first see if the difference in survival rates between sexes holds for children (<17 yrs).","9c3e4129":"#### Confirm fares decline as passenger class increases","4ef7dad3":"# Remove Outliers\nIt looks like we have some pretty extreme outliers with Fare around $500. To better determine if we should drop these values, let's see how many there are, the boxplot, and their Z-scores:","02c69dca":"### Accompanied Status Insights\nSurvival rates were higher when traveling with family (50%) vs not (30%). Given the distinct separation in ci bars in the first chart, we can have confidence that family increased probability of survival. We see this trend holds across passenger class, adult men, adult women, children, Southampton & Cherbourg.\n\nInterestingly, we see a stronger positive correlation between survival rate and fare for passengers traveling alone than for passengers traveling with family.","dd54d4f4":"# Survival by Age Range\nLet's see how survival rate varies by age range.","7c21c2a1":"Let's try to figure out what factors most influenced survival by looking at the following variables:\n\n* Pclass (Passenger Class: first, second, or third)\n* Sex (Male\/Female)\n* Age (0.4-80 years)\n* SibSp (total number of siblings and spouses aboard)\n* Parch (total number of parents and children aboard)\n* Fare (0 - 512)\n* Embarked (location from which the passenger embarked: Southampton, Cherbourg, Queenstown)\n* Survived (passenger survived (1) or not (0))\n\nFirst, we'll visualize each of these variables separately to better understand our population demographics.","9611c1d2":"Given 177 of the 891 samples have null age, we'll treat this group separately in our newly-defined \"Person\" variable.\n\nInterestingly, while child survival rates are still lower for males than females, the difference is much less significant than in the adult population. It would appear a child's probability of survival is more equitable on the basis of sex than for adults.\n\nLet's think of children as their own separate group moving forward.\n\n# Person (Sex 2.0)\nLet's proceed with our investigation of how survival rates vary by sex by looking at adult males, adult females, and children separately.","185d3a7c":"# Initial Exploration of Survival Rates\n\nLet's begin by looking at survival rates by each variable individually.","4387ff68":"# Project Goal:\n## Identify which factors most influenced probability of survival of passengers aboard The Titanic.\n\nLet's get started by importing useful libraries:","25aebdd6":"These three passengers with $512 tickets have fares almost 10 standard deviations above the mean and exceed the third quartile by over 20 IQRs. We can have confidence these are outliers, let's go ahead and drop them.","9aa28fd3":"## Cherbourg & Queenstown\nGiven Cherbourg saw the highest survival rates and Queenstown the lowest across adult males, adult females, and children, let's investigate further if passenger class could have anything to do with it."}}
