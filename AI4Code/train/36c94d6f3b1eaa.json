People talk about deaths and new cases popping up everyday, yet we rarely see how countries are doing in terms of recovery from the virus. <br>\nIt's astonishing to see such a high recovery percentage in China. Be it the quarantine measures, country-wide lockdowns or unorthodox medical experiments, there is something going for China. They were the worst impacted, but numbers show that a majority of the population has also recovered. ","c339320d":"Trend similar to Italy follows for the rest of the countries shown in the next few plot. In the US specifically, one can attribute this growth of cases to a large immigrant population, frequent international travel by many people, carefree nature of citizens even after repeated instructions by government of self-containment. People still go to pubs, beaches and other crowded places and inevidently spread the virulent virus.","0c53df49":"In conjunction to the last graph, we can see how the rates of getting new confirmed cases have stagnated over the last month. The **yellow** curve from 22nd Jan 2020 to about 19th Feb 2020 shows a very steep increase in confirmed cases everyday. Yet, the rate drastically slows down over the next month. In parallel, recovery of patients also follows a fairly steep curve, showing how effective the preventive and quarantine measures were. This trend will seem to follow in the coming weeks.","21337732":"We can see that an outstanding amount of patients in China have already recovered. While China has a recovery rate of <b>89.13%<\/b>, Italy suffers in this area producing only about <b>11.87%<\/b> of recovery cases. This shows that China, even though was struck first by the now pandemic has taken incredible preventive steps to get the virus under control. \n\nOn the other hand, Italy's response to the coronavirus was slow. Due to lack of adequate emergency medical units and slow govevrnment plans, Italy is now shifting to become the <b>World Epicenter<\/b> of COVID-19.\n\nThis is very clear from the death percentages in the next graph. Even though China death rates were high in the beginning, they have stablized. China got the disease first, and by common logic should have suffered the highest number of casualities. Yet, Italy has exceeded the death count in far fewer days, and from the above trend curve we also see that Chinese cases have stagnated and very few have got infected and died over the recent few days.\n\n<b>Some Possible Explainations:<\/b><br>\n<b>It is important to note that China is a larger country. Therefore, even though it hosts the largest population in the world, the population density is not so uniformly packed. In that respect, India has a higher population density than China, and is at a greater risk.<\/b><br>\n<b>Also, it can also be possible that Italy has a larger population of old people. This can also be attributed to the ever increasing mortality rate.<\/b>","4c4267c9":"Here, we see China as the leader with the highest number of confirmed cases. That was to be expected as China was origin country for COVID-19,specifically Wuhan. Yet, what is surprising is the amount of European countries in the list. Countries like Italy, Spain and Germany are in the top 5 and there are 6 European countries in the top 10 list. <br>\nThis clearly shows how contagious the virus is, and how rapidly it has spread over the entire continent. <br>\nAdditionally, it also raises questions on healthcare infrastructure and government decisions in the European Union. <br>","e18445de":"Now, let's start our investigation with country-wise cases. We begin by finding the countries with the **largest** number of cases in all 3 categories - confirmed, deaths and recovered.

There is an exponential growth of confirmed cases starting from around 27th to 28th Feb 2020. Over the past few days, the death numbers are also starting to form an exponential curve. As things look now, the situation will worse if immediate action in not taken.","d01191e1":"From the above 5 graphs, it is very clear something is different with the Chinese graph. While the other curves tend to follow a exponential curve, the Chinese one is the other way round. It stabalizes as each day passes.","68e54ce2":"Here, we see Italy being the country with highest amount of deaths, followed by China. Interestingly enough, there are again 6 European countries in the top 10 list for deaths. This time, Germany is not in the list, instead there is Netherlands.
