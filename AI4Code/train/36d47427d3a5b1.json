Mar (10. Jun) 341,981 people a day will be vaccinated.

Given that the situation in Germany at the moment is dependent on various factors that we miss data on (like the introduction of the Johnson & Johnson vaccin, changes in the logistics surrounding the vaccination), and thus drastic changes are likely, I belive that these models will fullfill their purpose. \nI will use the Arima Model to forecast the next 100 days."}}
