The percentage of TPU users might be very low(~4%) according to the survey for this year but it will keep growing in the coming years and it is set to transform the field forever.","ca0131b9":"TPU hardware is relatively new and came to widespread usage approximately an year ago.When it comes to TPU specific users,the years of experience is usually around 1-2 years which means professionals and young graduates who are starting their career as a data scientist are adopting the hardware accelerator for their ML requirements.Data analytics is a rapidly changing field with lot of concepts,techniques discovered everyday.Therefore it is important to keep up with pace,adopt and practise new technology.Inline with this,it is no surprise that the highest percentage of response comes from people with 1-2 years of experience.","22762c5d":"<a href='#exec'>Go back to Executive summary<\/a>","f1ae530f":"<div class=h3>2.7 Coursera and Kaggle Learn are the preferred MOOC<\/div>\n<a id=\"11\"><\/a> ","3edfdc93":"<div class=h3>1.4 More than half of TPU users have either Bachelors or a Masters degree<\/div>\n<a id=\"4\"><\/a> ","c3ac43c1":"<a href='#exec'>Go back to Executive summary<\/a>","17bef24e":"<a href='#exec'>Go back to Executive summary<\/a>","6ab489f5":"<div class=h2>2.Insights<\/div>","4aaec359":"42 % of the data scientist frequently used GANs for computer vision followed by equal number of people using image segmentation and classification methods.GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as a supervised learning problem with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to generate new examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either real (from the domain) or fake (generated)[6].They have a wide application in image-to-image translation,text-to-image translation and wherever the data is less to train an adversarial model could be developed to synthesis new images for training.","f3f638ec":"<a href='#exec'>Go back to Executive summary<\/a>","1ffc49cd":"<a href='#exec'>Go back to Executive summary<\/a>","41f46b9a":"<div class=h3>2.3 Colab and Kaggle are the choice for TPU Compute<\/div>\n<a id=\"7\"><\/a> ","0ec9fa4d":"<div class=h3>2.1 TPU Users have also worked on problems with GPU compute<\/div>\n<a id=\"5\"><\/a> ","477f35d9":"<div class=h3>1.1 Young Professionals & Students are the main users of TPU<\/div>\n<a id=\"1\"><\/a>\n","8aa37891":"# Executive Summary\n<a id='exec'><\/a>","a806ea03":"* Irrespective of the education qualification , TPUs are used for solving the problems .Those with masters degree and above(~50 %) have shown an increasing adoption compared to other degrees.This might be because of inherent skewness in the survey which is tilted towards bachelors and masters degree.\n* This also shows that irrespective of the profession and education ,data scientists are not restricted to a specific technology and show interest to expand outside their formal education.","626852f5":"<a href='#exec'>Go back to Executive summary<\/a>","0c293231":"## References","af574792":"TPU is a Google-designed hardware acclerators and are available in all its cloud platforms like Colab,AI notebooks.Therefore it is no surprise to note that the top 4 platforms are from Google.In terms of percentage,Colab slightly has an edge over Kaggle followed by Google Cloud AI notebooks.Both Kaggle and Google colab offers eight TPU cores.Easy to use interface,free compute resources,less downtime might be few reasons for this preference.","eb2586f5":"# Profiling the TPU Users","beb27348":"On text based problems ,pre-BERT technique of word embeddings are widely used while a quarter of data scientists prefer BERT,GPT-3 as their first choice.\nIn our algorithmic analysis one this is clear -

when it comes to language of choice- Python and SQL are used by data scientist.\n* While the data used for deep learning tasks are typically big running to few GBs they could be stored either in enterprise\/cloud databases and one might require SQL to query and fetch them.That might be the reason for SQL being used by 50 % of TPU users.\n* Python bindings enable one to use C++ or a C code to run in Python if there are no built-in modules available in Python or to speed up this.This could be the reason why a data scientist using TPU might prefer C++ or C over R whereas when it is seen for overall data scientist,R is preferred over C++ and C.","55ecdb8f":"TPU Users are spread out across all age group and we have ~ 5 % of kagglers in age group above 55 years who have adopted TPU for their deep learning requirements.
