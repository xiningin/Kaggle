Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?\n\n> Most users are 20-40 years old.\n\n> Regarding the Start Hour, the curve is bimodal showing that the most common periods of the day when trips start are 7-9 am and 4-6 pm.\n\n> Most users are subscribers, males and didn't share the bike for all trip.\n\n> I used a Q-Q plot to remove the outliers in the duration column from the dataset. I also removed the null values, converted start and end time to datetime and removed the unrequired columns.","1ccc84de":"> From the two plots above, the outliers dominate the duration column from 5k to 84k seconds, so I remove this part from my dataset.","3f95d918":"> The curve has a very long right tail, so I'll use a logarithmic scale on the y-axis and set a limit to the x-axis to take a deeper look at the most frequent interval.","f9ecc448":"> The above barplot shows that most users are subscribers, nearly about 10 times the customers.","1df52faa":"> The above box plot shows that males have shorter trips than other genders.","2659a688":"> The above violin plot shows that sharing the bike is more likely to occur with young users in the twenties of age.","b6705eec":"> From the above 4 plots, we find the most stations that are associated with the longest duration as a start station are also associated with the longest duration as an end station and the same is true for the stations associated with the shortest duration.","f8c51e8b":"> From the above, we notice that the most common start stations are also the most common end stations.","eb8803f2":"> Bike Sharing has no effect on the relationship between the Age and the Duration.","e8c9f1f6":"> Now, I'll draw a Q-Q plot to determine the outliers in the duration_sec column and remove them from my dataset so that they don't skew my results and mislead me to wrong conclusions.","564d3cb5":"> When I looked at the statistical information of the dataset to find the minimum and maximum of the trip duration, I also found that there are wrong entries in the age column making the maximum age 141 years, so I'll remove any data above 95 years old as it's highly improbable.","bb53f54d":"> Now, I'll look at the distribution of the trip duration.","962260ca":"> I'll create a new column (start_end) that has in each cell the start and end stations of the trip to look at the start and end stations of both the longest and the shortest trips.","61722d80":"## Bivariate Exploration","5eab52c7":"## Univariate Exploration\n\n> In this section, I'm going to investigate distributions of individual variables, take a deeper look to clean things up and prepare  to look at relationships between variables.","2e0bf013":"> The above barplot is bimodal with 2 peaks at 8 am and 5 pm showing that the most common periods of the day when trips start are 7-9 am and 4-6 pm.","7da1e263":"#### Other Investigations:","2f478b32":"#### Now, I'll look at the relationship between the age and 2 variables ( User Type and  Bike Sharing).","30d4db0a":"> Bike sharing occurs only by subscribers which is intuitive.","eac35914":"> From the above histogram, we notice that most users are 20-40 years old.","3c6ceeef":"#### Now, I'll investigate the relationships between the duration and the other predictor variables.","199d5e70":"### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?\n\n> I failed to find any interactions in the multivariate analysis.\n\n### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?\n\n> Unfortunately, no.","454e4ca8":"> Bike Sharing is associated with younger age in all genders.","b2625944":" Now, we'll look at the top 20 of both start and end stations that has the longest and shortest mean duration of the trip. ","32060165":"> User type isn't related to neither the Age nor the Gender of the user.","eb927f08":"> Subscribers have shorter trips in all genders."}}
