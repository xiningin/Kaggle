This supports the next observation that, Asia is the most populated region.\n*  However, it shocking to find from analysis that some of the most populated countries(which happen to be developed\/developing countries too) have a low Infant Immortality rate.\n*  However, analysis shows a positive result that asserts that only 11% of the countries around the world have Death Rates greater than Birth Rates.\n*  During analysis of the 3 major sectors of revenue, we saw an anomaly in the data for San Marino. It is impossible for a high GDP country(found from analysis) like San Marino, to have no contribution from the major sectors of revenue. So we concluded that :\n    -  The data is missing.\n    -  These types of data cannot be estimated as they are precise observations or collections.\n    -  We cannot remove the data for San Marino as it provides other vital information on Literacy rate, GDP_per_capita, Mortality rates etc.\n    -  The data is kept as it is.\n*  WE SEE THAT FOR MOST COUNTRIES, THE MAJOR THRIVING SECTOR IS SERVICE FOLLOWED BY INDUSTRY. \n    -  Except for UAE, which has Industry as its major sector.\n*  SAN MARINO AS WE KNOW, HAS NO DATA FOR THESE SECTORS, BUT ITS PRESENCE SHOWS THAT IT IS A HIGH GDP COUNTRY\n*  MONACO HAS NO RECORDED DATA FOR ANY SECTOR OTHER THAN AGRICULTURE.
