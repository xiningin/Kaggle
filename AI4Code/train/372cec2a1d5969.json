Nope. \n\nLooking back at the web page, it's now obvious that the movie title and person who gets the award are flipped between actors\/actresses and the other awards categories.

In an ideal world, the naming conventions would let you retrieve the data from these pages systematically. In the case of the Oscars, the URLs appear to be consistently formatted: `https:\/\/www.oscars.org\/oscars\/ceremonies\/2019` suggests that we could change the 2019 to any other date going back to the start of the Oscars and get that year as well: `https:\/\/www.oscars.org\/oscars\/ceremonies\/2018` should get us the page for 2018, and so on. Let's demonstrate each of these strategies with the Oscars data: iterating from 2019 back to 1929 in the URL versus parsing the list of links from the header.\n\n### Iterating strategies for retrieving data\n\nThe fundamental assumption with this strategy is that the data are stored at URLs in a consistent way that we can access sequentially. In the case of the Oscars, we *should* be able to simply pass each year to the URL in requests. Here we want to practice responsible data scraping by including a sleep between each request so that we do not overwhelm the Oscars server with requests. We can use the `sleep` function within `time`.","b513e851":"Moment of truth!","4b566f58":"One strategy is to use Python's [`zip`](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3.7\/library\/functions.html#zip) library to combine elements from different lists together. But `zip` is a bit too slick and abstract for my tastes.","6a3ad40a":"This was just for Best Actors, now lets add another layer for all the different awards categories. We can see the movie name and awardee switch is important now since most of the categories are reversed.","4fa1c5ed":"The core part of the iterating strategy is simply using Python's [`range`](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3.7\/library\/functions.html#func-range) function to generate a sequence of values. Here, we can use `range` to print out a sequence of URLs that should correspond to awards pages from 2010 through 2019. We can also incorporate the `sleep` functionality and wait a second between each `print` statement\u2014it should now take 10 seconds for this code to finish printing. This simulates how we can use `sleep` to slow down and spread out requests so that we do not overwhelm the servers whose data we are trying to scrape.","665c3082":"We'll write a `for` loop to go through all the table rows in `xmas_bo_trs`, get the list of data from the row, and add it back to a list of all the rows.","8db41c14":"### `pandas`'s `read_html`\nThat was a good amount of work just to get this simple HTML table into Python. But it was important to cover how table elements moved from a string in `requests`, into a soup object from `BeautifulSoup`. into a list of data, and finally into `pandas`. \n\n`pandas` also has powerful functionality for reading tables directly from HTML. If we convert the soup of the first table (`xmas_bo_tables[1]`) back into a string, `pandas` can read it directly into a table. \n\nThere are a few ideosyncracies here, the result is a list of dataframes\u2014even if there's only a single table\/dataframe\u2014so we need to return the first (and only) element of this list. This is why there's a `[0]` at the end and the `.head()` is just to show the first five rows.","53bec09e":"The first three correspond to the \"Year in film\" navigation box on the side and are poorly-formatted by default.","204c2371":"### Checking the relevant fields\n\nThat seemed like a major digression away from the core task of writing a parser, but it is critical that we write a parser that parses *only* the data we want and nothing else. Now that we have our 24 awards groups in `oscars2018_true_groups`, let's break one open and extract all the yummy data waiting inside.\n\nThere are a few `<div>` sub-classes that are helpfully named that should make extracting this data a bit easier.\n\n* `<div class=\"view-grouping-header\">` - name of the category\n* `<span class=\"golden-text\">` - winner\n* `<div class=\"views-field views-field-field-actor-name\">` - name of actor\n* `<div class=\"views-field views-field-title\">` - title of movie","5083812e":"Combine each of the DataFrames in `all_years_nominees` into a giant DataFrame of all the nominees from 2010-2019.","5409fa3e":"## Project time\n\nLet's take a look at websites you're interested in scraping and see what kinds of challenges and opportunities exist for scraping their data.","71702ca6":"## Parsing HTML data into tabular data\n\nThe overall goal we have as researchers in scraping data from the web is converting data from one structured format (HTML's tree-like structures) into another structured format (probably a tabular structure with rows and columns). \nThis could involve simply reading tables out of a webpage all the way up to taking irregularly-structured HTML elements into a tabular format. \n\nWe are going to make some use of the [`pandas`](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/) library (\"**pan**el **da**ta\", not the cute animal), which is Python's implementation of a data frame concept. This is a very powerful and complex library that I typically spend more than 12 hours of lecture teaching in intermediate programming classes. I hope to convey some important elements as we work through material, but it is far beyond the scope of this class to be able to cover all the fundamentals and syntax. \n\nLet's begin by importing the libraries we'll need in this notebook: requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas","bdf5609e":"Rather than finding *all* the `<div class=\"view-grouping\">` present in the page, we only want the 23 *siblings* of this specific tag.

In this case, you'd need to keep track of the `<div class=\"view-grouping\">` corresponding to Best Actor and then combine it with its 23 siblings, rather than an approach that simply returns all 24 in a single list.","8165ba7a":"We can now use the `parse_nominees` function for these pages as well.","b0cd5399":"If we point it at Wikipedia's [2018 in film](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2018_in_film), it will pull all of the tables present on the page.","95a7556b":"Finally, you can point `read_html` at a URL without any `requests` or `BeautifulSoup` and get all the tables on the page as a list of DataFrames. `pandas` is simply doing the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` on the inside. Interestingly, I'm getting a [HTTP 403](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/HTTP_403) error indicating the server (The Numbers) is forbidding the client (us) from accessing their data using this strategy. We will discuss next week whether and how to handle situations where web servers refuse connections from non-human clients. In this case, you cannot use the off-the-shelf `read_html` approach and would need to revert to using the `requests`+`BeautifulSoup` approach above.","41b272f8":"Another alternative is to use the `.text` method to get the text content of all the cells in this row.","24842615":"### Writing the core parser functionality\n\nHow will we map the contents of the HTML to the \n\n* **Year**: All the awards are from the same year, also in the URL\n* **Category**: `<h2>`\n* **Nominee**: `<h4>` for actors, `<span>` for non-actors\n* **Movie**: `<span>` for actors, `<h4>` for non-actors\n* **Won**: `<h3>` for sibling, 0 for everyone else; alternatively just the top nominee","1ae66c1d":"Zoom into the `views-field-title`.","cdb4116b":"This puts us into something of a bind going forward: if the `.find_all` returns more groupings than we expected, then it's not sufficiently precise to identify *only* groupings of nominees.

We will cover some basics of [error-handling in Python](https:\/\/realpython.com\/python-exceptions\/) that could let us work around errors as they pop up, but this may result in an incomplete collection if the naming conventions are systematic. What we would want to do is to identify all the links ahead of time by parsing them from list and then work through that list to get the complete data collection.\n\nWhat this means in the context of our Oscars example is assuming that we cannot trust that the sequential numbering of the years is a realiable guide to get all the data. Instead, we should get a list of the URLs for each of the awards pages from the \"ceremonies-decade-scroller\" (from Inspect) at the top. This scroller *should* be consistent across all the pages, but start with the nominees for 2019 just to be safe:","feb850c5":"If we wanted to access the contents of this table row, we could use the `.contents` method to get a list of each of the `<td>` table cells, which (frustratingly) intersperses newline characters.","01de76e6":"So far so good, now we can use `find_all` on the soup for this `<div class=\"view-grouping\">` to search *within* this specific parent group and hopefully there should be the 24 awards groupings.

Above, we were able to isolate the 24 category groupings we wanted through finding an appropriate *parent* tag and then working *down*. But I also want to show how we could identify the same 24 category groups by finding an appropriate *child* tag and working back up.
