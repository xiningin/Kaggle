from online pet food customer orders\n\n\nTask\n\nMain task is to generate actionable insights from this pet food customer orders dataset.\nAs a focus area, try to address the following questions:\n\n    Which customers order and reorder the wet food, and when are they likely to try it?\n    Are there certain characteristics of the pets, customers or their orders that impact how likely they are to purchase the wet food, and keep ordering it?\n    Based on this data, what do you suggest we focus on to get more customers taking and continuing to enjoy our wet food?\n\nData Intro\n\nThe data set is a selection of customers and their orders, with\u2029some pet characteristics and details of what they got in each order.\n\nOrders are numbered in sequence for each pet and every order contains dry food, which is the core offering of all online pet food companies. Some customers also purchase wet food (the subject of this challenge) alongside their dry food and in this dataset you also have the wet food order sequence. So if a customer has 2 dry food only orders followed by an order containing dry and wet food, then they will have a row in this dataset with petordernumber = 3, and wetfoodorder_number = 1.\n\nThis customer order dataset is derived from a subscription business. If a pet has an active subscription, then the business will make and deliver an order every 31 days, which contains dry food and whatever other products a customer has on their subscription. A customer can remove wet food and treats from their orders and still keep an active subscription, the business will just continue to make and send them\u2029 their dry food.","7feb3493":"## Which customers order and reorder the wet food, and when are they likely to try it?","bc69a6a3":"\n1.
