To put exact numbers to it:","cf7a4e09":"This gives some great hindsight into what could be improved by the company. For instance, we see that Wifi, across all classes was poorly evaluated. We also see that the online boarding was more much less convenient for customers not in the business class. Let's now look at overall satisfaction, across classes. ","c60b35ec":"Thanks a lot for reading!","cbf78aaa":"We will only use 3 factors here, given the big dropoff in eigenvalue after the 3rd factor. Let's see what factors are created, and what variables they contain. A loading cutoff of 0.5 will be used here. ","610922a8":"We have 25 columns. The first two columns don't seem to contain any important information for our purpose. We can therefore remove them.","1609db32":"As expected, Business class was better rated. Eco class and Eco Plus practically got the same grade, which indicates that customers that paid for Eco Plus don't feel they got their money's worth. Let's now look at every variable and how they were rated, for each class. ","be5e5e71":"It prints an empty dataframe, which means that we have no duplicates in our dataset. We can now look more closely at the \"satisfaction\" variable, since it is in reality the one that really separates the observations. ","d454e78b":"The alphas are evaluated at 0.87, 0.79 and 0.76, which indicates that they are useful and coherent. We could use these new factors as variable for other analysis or for prediction. In this notebook, we will leave it at that. \n\n","33b31c58":"The \"Eco\" class customers accounted for about 45% of total customers, but for 79% of unhappy ones. Let's look again at the 14 surveyed variables, just for the Eco class. ","beb421dc":"# **2. FACTOR ANALYSIS**","fc3290e3":"# 1. **EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS**","7de783d8":"The describe function can also help in giving a proper overview of the data. ","750699c1":"We can now start asking real interesting questions. Let's first look at the average score for each class, on the 14 variables that were surveyed. ","d5855984":"We have no missing values, however, we do have 310 Nan in the \"Arrival Delay in Minutes\" column. Before we decide what to do about those, let's look at a correlation plot of all the variables. ","820b0df0":"The following notebook presents a variety of functions useful for exploratory data analysis, as well as a Factor Analysis, all using the \"Airline Passenger Satisfaction\" dataset. Only the train dataset will be used here. Let's begin with the exploratory data analysis (EDA).    ","6bcd6222":"Now, thats great, but how do we know if our factors are any good? Well, the Cronbach alpha can be used to measure whether or not the variables of a factor form a \"coherent\" factor. A value above 0.6 for the alpha is in practice deemed acceptable. Here is the code to get the Cronbach alpha using the pingouin package. ","86b3cf4f":"Some variables are quite highly correlated, especially the ones relating to what seems to be answers to a survey. However, what really stands out is the extremely high correlation (0.98) between the \"Departure Delay in Minutes\" and the \"Arrival Delay in Minutes\". That makes sense. If the plane leaves later than expected, it should arrive later as well. Considering this high correlation and the fact that we had 310 Nan in the \"Arrival Delay in Minutes\" column, I decided to just remove that column from the dataset. ","3661565f":"We see that our dataset contains 103,904 observations. Of the 23 columns we currently have, 14 seem to be representing responses, on a scale of 1 to 5, to a survey evaluating different aspects of the flights (Inflight wifi service, food and drink, online boarding, seat comfort, etc). These 14 columns will be very important for our upcoming factor analysis. Let's now look for missing values. ","c554d5bf":"The idea of factor analysis is to describe variability among correlated variables in fewer variables called factors. It is based on the idea that some \"latent\" variables exist, which cannot be described with a single variable. For instance, instead of having multiple variables to describe the price (price of ticket, price of extra baggage, price of food, etc.), we could work with one latent variable called price. \n\nSo can our 14 variables be described into fewer latent variables (factors)? Let's find out. To figure out how many factors we would need, we can look at eigenvalues, which is a measure of how much variance of the variables does a factor explain. A eigenvalue of more than one means that the factor explains more variance than a unique variable. ","496ee227":"A possible recommandation could be to simply improve the wifi quality, or make online booking easier to use for the \"Eco\" class customers.This kind of simple EDA helps give a good portrayal the situation.","c95d0fdf":"Here are the 3 factors, the variables they contain and their possible \"interpretability\":\n1. **Comfort**: Food and Drink, Seat comfort, Inflight entertainment, Cleanliness\n1. **Service**: Onboard service, Baggage Handling, Inflight Service\n1. **Convenience**: In flight Wifi, Departure\/Arrival time convenience, Online Booking, Gate Location. ","97d62b58":"We can now check for duplicates, i.e. rows that would be identical. It is important to do so to ensure that all our information is necessary and relevant. ","ec70f065":"We only have 2 classes (unique=2). Looking back at the head of the table, we see that we have satisfied customers, and neutral or dissatisfied ones. That second class is the dominant one, as shown above. I will transform the variable into a binary one, to facilite future analysis."}}
