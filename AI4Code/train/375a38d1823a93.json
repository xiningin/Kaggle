While infant-toddler centres and preschools reopened after lockdown on 1 September and remedial courses were activated, the official reopening of all schools was on 15 September.\n\nUpon reopening of all schools, the following physical distancing measures were adopted:\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Masks, Single desks (at least 1 m apart), Minimise crowding (entrances\/exits), No extra-curricular activities. Alternate with remote learning.<\/font>\n\nMandatory wearing of surgical masks for children at all times except when students are seated at their desk and are not speaking (except in preschools or elementary schools where wearing the mask is never mandatory); only single desks are used (rather than the traditional double desks), and desks must be at least 1\u202fm apart; crowding at separate school entrances and exits is minimised by creating temporal and spatial pathways for the different classes; mixing classes for curricular activities is minimised; all extra-curricular activities have been suspended.\n\nIn some schools, when the classrooms are not big enough to respect physical distancing, students are divided into two groups, which alternate attending school and remote learning.\n\nAll SARS-CoV-2-positive swabs are immediately reported to the Public Health Department of the Local Health Authority. \n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Identified Case: Classmates and Staff tested and retested 14 days after the last contact<\/font>\n\nWhen a case is identified among students and\/or school staff, all classmates and staff who had contact with the index case are immediately tested and retested 14 days after the last contact with the index case if the first test was performed more than 10 days after the contact; usually only one test was performed. \n\nDuring the investigation, the nature of the contact between the index case and their classmates determines isolation measures: (i) all students are isolated if the physical classroom itself makes maintaining distance impossible and\/or masks are not worn constantly and\/or if secondary cases occur; or (ii) only those in close contact or who have contact outside of school are isolated, provided that physical distancing with the other students has been respected.\nhttps:\/\/www.eurosurveillance.org\/content\/10.2807\/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.49.2001911","325d222f":"<a id=\"1.1\"><\/a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">Secondary Transmission of Coronavirus<\/h3>\n\nSecondary Transmission of Coronavirus Disease from Presymptomatic Persons, China\n\nAuthors: Weiwei Zhang, Weibin Cheng, Lei Luo, Yu Ma, Conghui Xu, Pengzhe Qin,Zhoubin Zhang\nEmerg Infect Dis. 2020 Aug; 26(8): 1924\u20131926. - doi: 10.3201\/eid2608.201142\n\nThe authors  explored the secondary attack rate in different types of contact with persons presymptomatic for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Close contacts who lived with or had frequent contact with an index case-patient had a higher risk for COVID-19. Their findings provide population-based evidence for transmission from persons with presymptomatic COVID-19 infections.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Infection Control Challenges: 30%\u201359% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic <\/font>\n\nSome case reports and modeling studies suggest asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in transmission . Studies have shown that 30%\u201359% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, which poses tremendous infection control challenges. To control asymptomatic infections, China implemented active case surveillance and enhanced social distancing measures, which include contact tracing, quarantine for key populations, medical observation, and curtailed social activities. However, additional information on the characteristics of presymptomatic transmission is needed to develop targeted control and prevention guidance.\n\nAsymptomatic COVID-19 cases were found mainly through close contact screening, clustered epidemic investigations, follow-up investigation of infection sources, and active surveillance of key populations with travel or residence history in areas with continuous transmission of COVID-19 in China and abroad.\n\nThe authors estimated secondary attack rate (SAR) and 95% CI based on the proportion of COVID-19 incidence among close contacts. They calculated the mean reproductive number (R0) from the number of secondary infections observed among close contacts of each index case. \nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7392433\/","5f061dc6":"In a total of 359 COVID-19 confirmed cases, 83 (23%) persons were asymptomatic at diagnosis; 71 (86%) of whom later developed symptoms. \n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Close contacts, Family Members and infections via Nucleic Acid Testing <\/font>\n\nAmong presymptomatic cases, 38 had >1 (range 1\u201390, median 4) close contact. Median age of close contacts was 35 years (range 0\u201393 years), 23.8% were family members of an index case, and 12 were confirmed to be infected via nucleic acid testing. Among them, 8 close contacts developed symptoms, and 4 were asymptomatic.\n\n\nThe probability of infection increased substantially among close contacts who shared living environments or had frequent contact with an index case-patient, which underlines the need for prompt contact-based surveillance and social distancing.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">2ry infections: Confined familial clusters,persons >60 years of age more vulnerable to being infected<\/font>\n\nTheir results also showed most secondary infections occurred in confined familial clusters and that persons >60 years of age appear to be more vulnerable to being infected.

Case investigations. Contact Tracing.<\/font>\n\nThe relationship among implementation of mitigation strategies, case investigations, and contact tracing and COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalization and mortality was examined during March\u2013June 2020. Incidence declined by 82%, hospitalization by 88%, and mortality by 100% from late April to June 2020, as the mask mandate and contact tracing were added to case investigations and the stay-at-home order.\n\nImplementation of mitigation measures, including mandated mask use coupled with public health interventions, was followed by reductions in COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalizations and mortality.

The CDC has clear recommendations on staying home when we are sick, including remaining at home for at least 24 hours after being free of fever in the case of influenza-like illnesses. \n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">SUBSTITUTION<\/font>\n\n\nFor vital dental procedures, elimination is not always an option. Instead, consider controlling the situation via substitution\u2014i.e., replacement with a safer alternative. \n\nSubstitution can be a forgotten rung on the ladder of controls to reduce potential exposure risks. Before attempting to treat a possibly contagious patient, it is always a good first step to ask if there is a better substitution for the procedure.  \n\nIf there is no option other than treatment for a patient who is possibly contagious, don a respirator and ensure that you, your team, and the environment are as protected as possible. \n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">ENGINEERING CONTROLS<\/font>\n\n\nThe third preferred approach to deal with hazards is engineering controls\u2014i.e., using mechanical tools or barriers to isolate the hazard from people. Most essential dental procedures will likely produce contaminated aerosols, spatters, or sprays, so controlling and containing these fluids before they reach practitioners or begin traveling through the air is crucial. \n\nEngineering controls are essential, as they help us perform the work we need to and promote safety.\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">ADMINSTRATIVE (work practice)CONTROLS<\/font>\n\n\nSimilar to having seat belts in a car but not clicking them into place before driving, administrative controls, also known as work practice controls, are employer-dictated measures\u2014i.e., policies and procedures that change the way the dental team works so as to lessen or avoid hazard exposure. For instance, if you have HVE available and the recommendation is that you utilize it during procedures with spatter or aerosol production, the work practice control would be that you actually use it. Having a sharps container but then tossing a needle into the garbage is another example of having engineering controls but not proper work practice controls. \n\nStandard operating procedures (SOPs) are useful to make sure work practice controls are implemented. SOPs can help employees quickly visualize and understand the processes for tasks, even in complicated procedures, thus eliminating repetitive questions.\n \n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">PPE - PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT<\/font>\n\n\nThe CDC\u2019s hierarchy of controls4 ranks categories of hazard controls from most to least effective, and PPE is its last-recommended line of defense. Although PPE is a critical protective mechanism (just ask any hospital worker now), we cannot expect it to be our sole defense, a foolproof mechanism, or work beyond its capacity. The FDA reminds us, \u201ca surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others.\u201d\n\n\nIt is vital to understand that not all PPE is created equally. Not all surgical masks undergo the same testing criteria. Surgical masks have different levels of bacterial filtration and fluid resistance. Wearing a surgical mask without knowing the level of fluid resistance for the procedure being performed is not recommended. \n\nShould patients contract diseases from our dental offices, these cases will be considered health-care-associated infections, and there are consequences for practices that do not take infection control seriously, including possible financial penalties. \nhttps:\/\/www.rdhmag.com\/infection-control\/article\/14185691\/thanks-to-covid19-we-are-discussing-the-hierarchy-of-hazard-controls-for-dentistry","aaf399c5":"<a id=\"1.1\"><\/a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">Thanks to Coronavirus I can discuss Dentistry in Kaggle!<\/h3>\n\nThanks to COVID-19, we are discussing the hierarchy of hazard controls for dentistry, by Michelle Strange - Oct 1st, 2020\n\nAs types of infections and risks evolve, so do the methods of containment and control. But one thing will stay the same\u2014the hierarchy of hazard controls. Michelle Strange, MSDH, RDH, explains how to implement these infection controls.\n\n### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">During the fight against TUBERCULOSIS, the Hierarchy of Hazard Controls has been updated<\/font><\/mark><\/b>\n\nSince its establishment during the 1990 fight against TUBERCULOSIS, the hierarchy of hazard controls has been updated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe hierarchy of controls has since seen the country through severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS), Ebola, and Zika outbreaks, proving its effectiveness. However, it only works if dental health-care settings understand and follow the recommendations and regulations. \n\nRegrettably, the dental profession has not been fully implementing these safety precautions. A 2017 systematic scoping review of the use of bioaerosols in dentistry and health care found that even in the absence of infectious disease outbreaks, dental environments put workers at higher risks of acquiring infectious diseases. To keep ourselves, our patients, and even our loved ones safe, here are some simple ways to put the hierarchy of hazard controls into practice.\n\nThe hierarchy of infection controls begins with the elimination or removal of risk and substitution, which swaps out potential risk factors for practices or processes less likely to cause infection. These are the most effective ways of controlling the environment. The next step is to engineer the removal of the hazard, followed by administration controls that attempt to protect when it is not possible to remove the risk. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is the last defense in the hierarchy, and it requires the previous steps to be in place to be most effective.\n\nAs the types of infections and risks evolve, so do the methods of containment and control. It is essential to stay up to date with changes in regulations and requirements to provide the best possible protection in your environment. \nhttps:\/\/www.rdhmag.com\/infection-control\/article\/14185691\/thanks-to-covid19-we-are-discussing-the-hierarchy-of-hazard-controls-for-dentistry","c0d074bb":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">The Risk Calculator<\/font>\n\nRisk was reduced in those who had pneumococcal polysaccharide or influenza vaccine or who were on melatonin, paroxetine, or carvedilol.

Despite being the gold\u2010standard for the treatment of selected individuals with severe obesity, there is scarce information on whether or not bariatric surgery modifies the prognosis of people living with obesity in the current COVID\u201019 pandemic.\n\nThe authors provide evidence of the importance of diabetes itself as a risk factor for severe COVID\u201019.\n\nThe study describes the prevalence of symptom\u2010based likelihood of COVID\u201019 (CL group) with a retrospective comparison of the characteristics at baseline and at 1 year post procedure in a survey\u2010based analysis of 738 patients who had bariatric surgery prior to the pandemic. Symptoms suggesting COVID\u201019 occurred in 62 (8.4%) patients while, at the time of the survey, a global estimation reported an estimated prevalence of COVID\u201019 cases of 9.9% ((3)).\n\nFour among the sixty\u2010two patients (6.4%) had severe COVID\u201019 requiring hospitalization, and one of them (1.6%) died, which means that even with a similar symptomatic infection rate, mortality was significantly below that observed in patients with obesity not treated with surgery ((4)). The mechanisms potentially underlying this effect are unknown but may be multifactorial.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">BMI (Body mass index). Diabetes. Glycemic Control. Functional malnutrition <\/font>\n\nOn the other hand, the CL (COVID\u201019\u2013likely) group presented a lower BMI at the time of lockdown, with a higher percentage of weight loss since surgery. Severe forms of COVID\u201019 requiring hospitalization were associated with persistent type 2 diabetes at the last follow\u2010up visit. This fact may add argument to the independent risk factor relevance of diabetes itself in association with COVID\u201019 severity.\n\nA second factor was the lower BMI observed in the CL (COVID\u201019\u2013likely) group, which seems counterintuitive. Although no experimental evidence has been gathered in this line, patients with functional malnutrition post surgery may be at higher risk for severe COVID\u201019. Functional malnutrition is most frequently observed in patients who are lost to follow\u2010up, thereby stressing the importance of long\u2010term care following bariatric surgery.\n\nThe improved glycemic control seem to protect people living with obesity from more severe COVID\u201019.\n\nhttps:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33021051\/","f6834464":"### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">Relevant Findings to the Model\u2019s performance.<\/font><\/mark><\/b>\n\nThe following list includes critical findings that ultimately were relevant to our model\u2019s performance.\n\nThe lower risk of being COVID positive in Asian individuals relative to white individuals in their cohort is intriguing, given the higher rates of spread and disease severity that were observed in the western hemisphere now when compared with China.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and flu vaccine Lower Risk.<\/font>\n\nThe lower risk observed with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and flu vaccine is also a unique finding. The mechanism could be biologic, related possibly to the documented sustained activation of Toll-Like Receptor 7 by the influenza vaccine27: Toll-Like Receptor 7 is critical for the binding of single-stranded RNA respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, and may thus explain some cross protection. Alternatively, this correlation may just reflect safer health practices in general of people who seek and obtain vaccination.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Poor socioeconomic status: Higher Risk<\/font>\n\nThe higher risk observed with poor socioeconomic status. Using the zip code, our team was able to infer estimated population per square kilometer and estimated median income from the 5-year American Community Survey dataset. The end year of the 5-year dataset was 2018. The critical role played by these variables in our final model emphasize the importance of social influencers of health and their influence on disparities in health care outcomes.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Melatonin, Carvedilol, and Paroxetine:Reduced Risk of testing Positive <\/font>\n\nMost potentially impactful is the reduced risk of testing positive in patients who were on melatonin, carvedilol, and paroxetine, which are drugs identified in drug-repurposing studies to have a potential benefit against COVID-19.\n\nMelatonin up-regulates angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, such that increased occupancy of ACE2 receptors competes with SARS-CoV2 viral attachment to the receptors and blocks entry. Carvedilol was found recently to inhibit ACE2-induced proliferation and contraction in hepatic stellate cells through the rhoa\/rho-kinase pathway. It is unclear whether it has similar effects on ACE2 in lung endothelium. With ACE2 being key in the pathophysiologic findings of infection with SARS-CoV-2, Their findings are intriguing.\nhttps:\/\/journal.chestnet.org\/article\/S0012-3692(20)31654-8\/fulltext","a1816c53":"Their conclusions are highly dependent on access to testing sites and doctors\u2019 orders rather than population-based predictors of positive results.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Interpretation<\/font>\n\nThe authors provided an online risk calculator that effectively can identify individualized risk of a positive COVID-19 test.

They focus on the likelihood of a positive nasal or oropharyngeal COVID-19 test. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression algorithm was constructed that removed variables that were not contributing to the model\u2019s cross-validated concordance index. After external validation in a temporally and geographically distinct cohort, the statistical prediction model was illustrated as a nomogram (nomograph) and deployed in an online risk calculator.\nhttps:\/\/journal.chestnet.org\/article\/S0012-3692(20)31654-8\/fulltext","312af0d6":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Several limitations influenced their estimation of the SAR. <\/font>\n\nThe number of close contacts was limited because theye only included those who had been reached, and asymptomatic infections might have been missed.\n\nThey excluded close contacts who were exposed to >2 confirmed COVID-19 case-patients.\n\nThe presymptomatic transmission period is not well defined.\n\nTheir analysis provides valuable information on secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in different types of contact with presymptomatic COVID-19 case-patients.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Communicable Period, volume\/duration of viral shedding from persons with Asymptomatic Infections <\/font>\n\nFurther evidence is needed to define the population characteristics, communicable period, and the volume and duration of viral shedding from persons with asymptomatic infections.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7392433\/","e9eeb903":"<font color=\"#F39C12\">Controlling exposures to occupational hazards is the fundamental method of protecting workers.
