provides more clarity. \nThe US Supreme Court decision barring workplace discrimination of gay or transgender employees is groundbreaking. By widening the definition of \"sex\" the court decided by a 6-3 majority that lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LBGT) people are also protected under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. That federal law bans discrimination in employment based on race, religion, national origin or sex.\"\n\n\"Up until now many places had no such rules to safeguard LGBT employees. For those places that did, the new ruling replaced a patchwork of local and state ordinances to make sure everyone regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity is protected on the job. Perhaps surprisingly, two conservative justices, sided with the four liberal justices.\"\n\n\"Back in 2002 only 3% of Fortune 500 companies had gender identity protections in their nondiscrimination policies. Today, 91% do, according to the Corporate Equality Index 2020 published by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation. Additionally, 65% now have transgender-inclusive health care coverage. That's a big increase from 0% in 2002.\"\n\n\"After the verdict was announced, Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is openly gay, wrote on Twitter, \"LGBTQ people deserve equal treatment in the workplace and throughout society, and today's decision further underlines that federal law protects their right to fairness.\" Nonetheless, leaders in business world who are openly LGBT are rare.\" June, 15, 2020.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/lgbt-job-protection-ruling-in-us-a-surprise-in-many-ways\/a-53853889","d5a3e678":"<center style=\"font-family:verdana;\"><h1 style=\"font-size:200%; padding: 20px; background: #9932CC;\"><i><b style=\"color:white;\">Record-High 70% in U.S. Support Same-Sex Marriage<\/b><\/i><\/h1><\/center>\n\nBY JUSTIN MCCARTHY, JUNE 8, 2021\n\n\"WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. support for legal same-sex marriage continues to trend upward, now at 70%  a new high in Gallup's trend since 1996. This latest figure marks an increase of 10 percentage points since 2015, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that all states must recognize same-sex marriages.\"\n\n\"Republicans, who have consistently been the party group least in favor of same-sex marriage, show majority support in 2021 for the first time (55%). The latest increase in support among all Americans is driven largely by changes in Republicans' views.\"\n\n\"Democrats have consistently been among the biggest supporters of legal same-sex marriage. The current 83% among Democrats is on par with the level of support Gallup has recorded over the past few years. This could suggest that support for gay marriage has reached a ceiling for this group, at least for now. Meanwhile, support among political independents, now at 73%, is slightly higher than the 68% to 71% range recorded from 2017 to 2020.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/350486\/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx","6ff557bd":"#Dataprep to clean Headers - Leave columns in a Pythonic way.","2a8b4a05":"<center style=\"font-family:verdana;\"><h1 style=\"font-size:200%; padding: 20px; background: #9932CC;\"><i><b style=\"color:white;\">Sexual Orientation Laws in the World<\/b><\/i><\/h1><\/center>\n\nCriminalization of same-sex sexual relationships decreasing\n\n07 OCTOBER 2019\n\n\"Fifty years after the Stonewall riots in New York, United States of America a major milestone in the modern struggle to recognize the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people more people are benefiting from the rights that the Stonewall protesters campaigned for. The number of people living in countries that criminalize consensual same-sex sexual relationships has steadily declined since 1969.\"\n\n\"In June 2019, Botswana became the latest country to decriminalize same-sex relationships, but Africa still accounts for about half of the world\u2019s population living in countries with anti-homosexuality laws. In 2018, the proportion of the world\u2019s population that lives in countries that criminalize same-sex sexual relations plummeted from about 40% to 23% following the Indian Supreme Court\u2019s decision that decriminalized all consensual sex among adults. This was the largest annual decline since China decriminalized same-sex sexual relationships in 1997.\"\n\n\"Prohibitive laws and policies against key populations increase their vulnerability to HIV. It is therefore vital to ensure the full respect of the human rights of all people, regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including through repealing laws that prohibit sex between consenting adults in private, enforcing laws to protect people from violence and discrimination and addressing homophobia and transphobia.\"\n\n\"Consensual same-sex sexual relations remain criminalized in at least 67 countries and territories worldwide.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.unaids.org\/en\/resources\/presscentre\/featurestories\/2019\/october\/20191007_criminalization-same-sex-sexual-relationships-decreasing","0c53411a":"![](https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/1400_opt_1\/6a71c758483911.5c46f7d142c3c.gif)https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/58483911\/Logo-System-for-ILGA","cdb08429":"![](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/ELcuGhwWwAAnUkG.png:large)twitter.com","b7d90b67":"### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">Countries that Never Criminalized Consensual Same-Sex Sexual Acts between Adults.<\/font><\/mark><\/b>","66275acf":"#Inverting Axes = Horizontal bars","15835486":"#Columns Description\n\nCSSSA LEGAL? - Criminalization of Consensual Same-Sex Sexual Acts between Adults\n\nBROAD PROT - Broad Protection\n\nEMPLOY. - Employment Protection\n\nBAN CONV.

Eight of these state laws or regulations were enacted under Republican governors. A growing number of municipalities have also enacted similar protections, including at least 70 cities and counties in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.\"\n\n\"According to a recent report by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, an estimated 20,000 LGBTQ minors in states without protections will be subjected to conversion therapy by a licensed healthcare professional if state officials fail to act. In April 2018, national organizations representing millions of licensed medical and mental health care professionals, educators, and child welfare advocates declared their support for legislative protections against conversion therapy.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.hrc.org\/resources\/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy","5366cc60":"<center style=\"font-family:verdana;\"><h1 style=\"font-size:200%; padding: 20px; background: #9932CC;\"><i><b style=\"color:white;\">Where is homosexuality still Outlawed?<\/b><\/i><\/h1><\/center>\n\n\nBy Reality Check team - BBC News - Published 12 May 2021\n\n\"There are 69 countries that have laws that criminalise homosexuality, and nearly half of these are in Africa.\"\n\n\"However, in some countries there have been moves to decriminalise same-sex unions.\"\n\n\"In February this year, Angola's President Joao Lourenco signed into law a revised penal code to allow same-sex relationships and bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\"\n\n\"In June last year, Gabon reversed a law that had criminalised homosexuality and made gay sex punishable with six months in prison and a large fine.\"\n\n\"Botswana's High Court also ruled in favour of decriminalising homosexuality in 2019.\"\n\n\"Mozambique and the Seychelles have also scrapped anti-homosexuality laws in recent years.\"\n\n\"In Trinidad and Tobago, a court in 2018 ruled that laws banning gay sex were unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"But there are countries where existing laws outlawing homosexuality have been tightened, including Nigeria and Uganda.\"\n\n\"And in others, efforts to get the laws removed have failed.\"\n\n\"A court in Singapore dismissed a bid to overturn a law that prohibits gay sex early last year.\"\n\n### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">Full list of countries where homosexuality is outlawed:<\/font><\/mark><\/b>\n\n\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Antigua & Barbuda, Bangladesh, Barbados, Bhutan, Brunei, Burundi, Cameroon,\n\nChad, Comoros, Cook Islands, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada,\n\nGuinea, Guyana, Iran, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Malaysia,\n\nMaldives, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Nigeria, Occupied Palestinian Territory\n\n(Gaza Strip), Oman, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint\n\nVincent and The Grenadines, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands,\n\nSomalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, \n\nTuvalu, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-43822234","edfaf761":"![](https:\/\/ilga.org\/sites\/default\/files\/eng_ilga_world_map_sexual_orientation_laws_dec2019_update_2x1.png)ilga.org"}}
