The distribution of daily internet usage of the people that clicked on the ad is astronomically far off from being a normal distribution! Because none of the distributions cannot be assumed to be normal, a non-parametric test would be more robust here.

All the pairplots also indicate clear clumping between the two groups. People that do not click on ads seem to follow clearer patterns. People that did not click on ads seem to be less tightly clumped. It would seemd that larger kurtosis values could be attributed to people that did not click on an ad, backing up the previous statment.

It did not take too much time to fit the model, which would allow for fast tuning of parameters.\nThe linear kernal SVC took a very long time to fit the data. It is faster at predicting than the random forest and k nearest neighbors classifiers. This time taken to fit the data is mittgated, as only one parameter is needed to be tuned.\nThe k Nearest Neighbors perfomed the worst in AUC and prediction time. This was not a good model for this data.\n\nIn the end the linear SVC should be used as it had a slightly higher AUC and faster prediction time when compared to the random forest. The end accuracy of this project is **95.4%**.","ea61c1de":"We only really care about the region and sub-region. Let us try to map each country to its respective region and sub-region.

All of these distributions are distributed differently to a very high significance level. The suspicion that age and area income weren't as clear cut seems to be true as well. They are many orders of magnitude less confident than daily internet usage and daily time spent on the site.
