Of course, some of the open price does not make sense.","f01b551c":"First, let's filter market data by previous 10 day market adjusted return over 300% for open and close price. There are huge values on the open side but not the close side. The closed price and return seem to be correct and there is something wrong with the open price and return.","32272f18":"We can look at a particular asset \"EXH.N\". Pay particular attention to the 21 days window around open price 0.01 and 999.99.\n\nFor 0.01 as and example,  'returnsOpenPrevRaw1' on next day and 'returnsOpenPrevRaw10' on the 10th day is very high. I am not sure how market adjusted returns are calculated, but it seems like there is a propagation of error lasting well into the futurn (there could be other assets with incorrect entries on those days and if the market return is a calculated field based on these entries, there could be error as well). Notice 'returnsOpenPrevMktres10' has the same value 'returnsOpenNextMktres10' 11 rows ahead."}}
