We can see that in most of the cases, less than 10% of kids drop out of school. The distribution is quite similar for the distribution of male and female students.

","37bae194":"Discretizing the numerical feature Total% of dropouts","b428b32d":"Here we can see that much of the kids residing in rural areas who dropped out of school were from the least developed countries. This could be attributed to the data that most of the population resides in rural areas in the least developed countries. ","875c5898":"In the following figure, we can see that in Sub Saharan Africa, there are 8 countries wherein both males and females drop out of schools in a high rate. In South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa there are a few countries where the males drop out of schools at a higher rate than females. In Europe. East Asia and the Middle East, the drop out rate is low for both boys and girls. ","2e01ef21":"### Dealing with the null values","4e01e220":"In this countplot, we can see that the total percentage of dropouts is lower than 5% for the more developed countries.

Unfortunately, we can see that access to education is most limited in areas which need it the most. Traditionally there is also a gap between boys' and girls' access to education in many parts of the world. That is what makes the analysis of school dropout rates essential to ensure equal access and equal opportunity to all. "}}
