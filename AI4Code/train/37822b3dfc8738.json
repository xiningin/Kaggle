Kaggle discussion about this starter notebook is [here][4]\n\n# PyTorch BigBird NER Baseline - CV 0.615\nI published a PyTorch starter notebook [here][3] that uses BigBird backbone. BigBird is another recent SOTA transformer that accomodates tokens as wide as 4096. Unfortunately there are not pretrained BigBird weights for TensorFlow-Keras. \n\nTensorFlow users can benefit from reading the PyTorch starter because the PyTorch encodes the targets differently. It uses the `predictionstring` column and `is_split_into_words=True` during tokenization. It also demonstrates how to use a dataloader which is needed if you want to experiment with data augmentation. Because each epoch, we must tokenize the text again after modifying the train text.\n\n[1]: https:\/\/huggingface.co\/docs\/transformers\/model_doc\/longformer\n[2]: https:\/\/huggingface.co\/allenai\/longformer-base-4096\n[3]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/pytorch-bigbird-ner-cv-0-615\n[4]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/feedback-prize-2021\/discussion\/295794","17dee456":"# Write Submission CSV","df60c404":"# Validate Model - Infer OOF\nWe will now make predictions on the validation texts. Our model makes label predictions for each token, we need to convert this into a list of word indices for each label. Note that the tokens and words are not the same. A single word may be broken into multiple tokens. Therefore we need to first create a map to change token indices to word indices.","1d7bb98c":"# Train or Load Model\nIf you provide a path in variable `LOAD_MODEL_FROM` above, then it will load your previously trained model. Otherwise it will train now. \n\nThe model which is loaded in versions 1 thru 4 of this notebook were trained offline using 5 epochs of batch size 32 and learning rate `1e4` for the first four and `1e5` for the last epoch. That model was trained using 4xV100 GPU. \n\nVersion 5 of this notebook loads a model that was trained in a Kaggle notebook by user @kaggleqrdl in his notebook version 20 [here][1]. Please upvote Qrdl's notebook :-) Qrdl has been running experiments and found a great learning rate to use when training with small batch size.\n\nWhen training on Kaggle's 1xP100 GPU, we need to reduce the batch size to 4. And we reduce the learning rates to `0.25e-4` and `0.25e-5`. I have updated the batch size and learning rate below so that it is ready to train in a Kaggle notebook! (Each training epoch on Kaggle takes 1 hour 8 minutes).\n\n[1]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaggleqrdl\/v4expmt-tensorflow-longformer-ner-cv-0-634?scriptVersionId=83341823","41290f1c":"# Load Libraries","a68e8af7":"# How To Submit TensorFlow Without Internet\nMany people ask me, how do I submit TensorFlow models without internet? With HuggingFace Transformer, it's easy. Just download the following 3 things (1) model weights, (2) tokenizer files, (3) config file, and upload them to a Kaggle dataset. Below shows code how to get the files from HuggingFace for AllenAI's model `longformer-base`. But this same code can download any transformer, like for example `roberta-base`.","09f06597":"![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/cdeotte\/Kaggle_Images\/main\/Dec-2021\/lengths4.png)\n\nFrom the histogram of train word counts above, we see that using a transformer width of 1024 is a good comprise of capturing most of the data's signal but not having too large a model. (Note that analyzing a histogram of train **token** counts would be better but we don't do that here). We could probably explore other widths between 512 and 1024 also. Or we could use widths of size 512 or smaller and use a stride which breaks a single text into multiple chunks (with possible overlap).","7b051540":"# Build Model\nWe will use LongFormer backbone and add our own NER head using one hidden layer of size 256 and one final layer with softmax. We use 15 classes because we have a `B` class and `I` class for each of 7 labels. And we have an additional class (called `O` class) for tokens that do not belong to one of the 14 classes.","4c9b5e06":"# Configuration\nThis notebook can either train a new model or load a previously trained model (made from previous notebook version). Furthermore, this notebook can either create new NER tokens or load existing tokens (made from previous notebook version). In this notebook version, we will load model and load NER tokens. \n\nAlso this notebook can load huggingface stuff (like tokenizers) from a Kaggle dataset, or download it from internet. (If it downloads from internet, you can then put it in a Kaggle dataset, so next time you can turn internet off).","daa7d773":"# Tokenize Train\nThe following code converts Kaggle's train dataset into a NER token array that we can use to train a NER transformer. I have made it very clear which targets belong to which class. This allows us to very easily convert this code to `Question Answer formulation` if we want. Just change the 14 NER arrays to be 14 arrays of `start position` and `end position` for each of the 7 classes. (You will need to think creatively what to do if a single text has multiple of one class).","6b497734":"# Infer Test Data\nWe will now infer the test data and create a submission. Our CV is 0.633, let's see what our LB is!"}}
