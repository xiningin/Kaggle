This needs some data manipulation to extract the date portion from the start_date and end_date columns.","3a66058c":"# Plotly\nPlotly is one of my favorite data visualization packages for Python. The wide variety of plots and the level of customization available give the users a high amount of control on how the chart looks. As I learn more about how to work with Plotly, I want to experiment with different chart types through kernels as a way for me to practice and also for the Kaggle community to know how to use them.\n\n## Notes about Plotly\nPlotly charts have two major components: data and layout.\n\nData - this represents the data that we are trying to plot. This informs the Plotly's plotting function of the type of plots that need to be drawn. It is basically a list of plots that should be part of the chart. Each plot within the chart is referred to as a 'trace'.\n\nLayout - this represents everything in the chart that is not data. This means the background, grids, axes, titles, fonts, etc. We can even add shapes on top of the chart and annotations to highlight certain points to the user.\n\nThe data and layout are then passed to a \"figure\" object, which is in turn passed to the plot function in Plotly.\n\n- Figure\n    - Data\n        - Traces\n    - Layout\n        - Layout options\n        \n## Line plots\nIn previous notebooks [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/meetnaren\/plotly-experiments-scatterplots) and [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/meetnaren\/plotly-experiments-bar-column-plots), I had explored how to use scatterplots to examine the relationship between two continuous variables, and bar plots to explore numerical variable across different categories. In this notebook, I will explore line plots.\n\nLine plots are generally useful to investigate the trend of a numerical variable over time. Any time series analysis is incomplete without a line chart. There are various flavors of line charts - with and without markers, area charts, stepped line charts, linear and smoothed lines, etc. Let us explore these in this notebook.\n\nIn Plotly, line charts are just a variation of scatterplots, only with a line connecting the dots. Thus, we will be using the scatter (or scattergl) function for plotting purposes.\n\n## Dataset\nI will be using the Bay Area Bike Share dataset for this notebook. The data has very interesting information on the bikes, stations and bike trips taken in the Bay Area. There are a lot of questions that we can explore through visualizations. Let us read in the dataset and import Plotly packages to start with.","ccbd39e7":"This chart looks cleaner and simpler, showing that ridership is lower on weekends with minimal color.\n\nLet us move on to area charts now.","ed0c923d":"Using a random function to choose 5 colors to use for this notebook...","5b92f903":"Now that we have the individual components of the date column split up, let us calculate the numbers required for plotting the line chart.","f9a06bdf":"The moving average curves clearly show how the ridership goes down during the winter months.\n\nLet us now zoom into a specific window of the timeframe and do some analysis.

In a subsequent notebook, I will explore other types of charts such as bubble charts, box plots, etc. Thanks for reading!","97a639be":"## Area charts\nArea charts differ from line charts in that the area under the line gets shaded, giving the viewer a sense of the magnitude of the number being plotted. For example, it may be more appropriate to plot stock price through a line chart, but market cap through an area chart. Area charts are also useful when used in a stacked model, showing the difference between two numerical quantities in a shaded area.\n\nLet us see the ridership count as an area chart to start with."}}
