ethics experts from around the world question the model of vaccine distribution against Covid-19 proposed by the World Health Organization ( WHO ).\n\nThe distribution plan indicated by the WHO foresees that countries receive proportional doses to the populations. It starts with each country receiving vaccines for 3% of the population and continues with proportional supply until each has vaccinated 20% of its citizens.\n\nThe study authors consider, however, that this strategy is flawed, since equally populous countries are facing dramatically different levels of death and economic impacts due to the pandemic. According to the researchers, the plan \"erroneously assumes that equality requires the identical treatment of countries located differently, instead of responding equally to their different needs\".\n\nFor researchers, the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine among countries must be based on three fundamental values: to benefit people and limit damage, prioritize the disadvantaged and give equal moral consideration to all individuals.\n\nThe authors explain that the proposed metrics as the basis for each phase are routinely used in global health, and using them to plan vaccine delivery \u201cwill encourage the collection and reporting of accurate data on changes in mortality and poverty related to Covid-19 https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/panoramafarmaceutico.com.br\/2020\/09\/04\/covid-19-cientistas-questionam-estrategia-de-distribuicao-de-vacina-proposta-pela-oms\/&prev=search&pto=aue","7658975b":"#Refusing Vaccination. No Herd Immunity.\n\nWhen the number of people who decline or refuse vaccinations increases, it becomes impossible to reach herd immunity. Then, infectious disease agents can lurk in the population, threatening not only those who have chosen not to vaccinate but also those who cannot receive vaccinations, e.g. newborns and the immune-compromised. Thus, when healthy people refuse vaccinations, they put not only themselves but also the most vulnerable members of society at risk.\n\n#The Main Ethical Vaccinations Dilemma\n\nIs it ethically permissible for the government to mandate vaccinations, even when parents or individuals refuse vaccinations? Do the benefits of vaccinations for public health justify overriding individual liberty and autonomy?\n\nWhen parents refuse vaccinations, they render not only their own children, but also other children and the immune-compromised susceptible to infectious diseases, and possibly death. https:\/\/med.nyu.edu\/highschoolbioethics\/sites\/default\/files\/highschoolbioethics\/EthicsofVaccinations_Module.pdf","78beba1f":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata   @mpwolke","eb9b7b7d":"#Ethics of Vaccinations -  BIOETHICS PROJECT\n\nThe invention of the vaccine is unarguably one of the greatest medical achievements in the past century. Since the invention of vaccinations, the wide use of immunizations has drastically lowered the incidence of - and in some cases completely eradicated - infectious diseases that once took the lives of millions. Vaccines protect children and adults against a number of infectious and dangerous diseases, including measles, small pox, mumps,TB, whooping cough, human papilloma virus (HPV), and the flu, among others. https:\/\/med.nyu.edu\/highschoolbioethics\/sites\/default\/files\/highschoolbioethics\/EthicsofVaccinations_Module.pdf","a38f2716":"#Herd Immunity. For most diseases, it's achieved when the proportion of the population vaccinated is at least 90 percent.\n\nTo provide the best protection from infectious diseases, most members of a community must be vaccinated. \u201cHerd immunity\u201d is the special term for when enough members of a community are vaccinated to protect even those who are not vaccinated, e.g. newborns and the immune-compromised. The idea is that enough people will be vaccinated, so the infectious virus will have nowhere to incubate. No one will spread the disease to the unvaccinated. Herd immunity means that the majority of the population (the herd) has acquired immunity to an antigen, therefore protecting those who are not immune, and thus drastically decreasing the risk of outbreak. For most diseases, herd immunity is achieved when the proportion of the population vaccinated is at least 90 percent. https:\/\/med.nyu.edu\/highschoolbioethics\/sites\/default\/files\/highschoolbioethics\/EthicsofVaccinations_Module.pdf","5721c674":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQb9XfpyCIWgSNTrVsZiyO1Elrqwnq3HdMSEA&usqp=CAU)rebloggy.com","929fd3a7":"#THE MODERN PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE\n\nAUTONOMY & LIBERTY\n\nPROMOTING PUBLIC HEALTH: UTILITARISM (Actions are right to the extent that they produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people.)\n\nTHE HARM PRINCIPLE: Protecting the Most Vulnerable\n\nIn John Stuart Mill\u2019s essay \u201cOn Liberty\u201d (Mill 1869), Mill defends what has come to be called the Harm Principle. The Harm Principle says that the only justification for interfering with the liberty of an individual, against her will, is to prevent harm to others.\n\nSome of the most vulnerable population are newborns, people who are immuno-compromised from diseases such as cancer, and the elderly are highly susceptible to diseases. When more parents choose not to vaccinate their healthy children, those most vulnerable have a much greater chance of becoming ill, since it creates more incubators where infectious disease can live. When all or most people in the same geographic area are vaccinated, infectious diseases have no bodies in which to grow. So, it is supposed, it is impossible to have an outbreak of disease. As the number of unvaccinated people rises due to vaccine refusal, it creates more places for disease to live (inside more bodies).\n\nPREVENTING HARM TO INDIVIDUALS https:\/\/med.nyu.edu\/highschoolbioethics\/sites\/default\/files\/highschoolbioethics\/EthicsofVaccinations_Module.pdf","9a2c94be":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR_L5cZ-8CPPTcmo4tbPg0HFHjelioubymPNg&usqp=CAU)nuffieldbioethics.org","812938ab":"#Vaccines or Medicines? The hope in Vaccination.\n\nThe hope in the vaccine against the new coronavirus is inspired by examples such as smallpox, polio or measles, diseases controlled thanks to the effectiveness of immunization. But such diseases are the exception. The most common response from medicine is treatment, through therapies discovered in decades-long research, such as AIDS or tuberculosis. Covid-19 is still badly surrounded by unknowns. Apart from vaccines, several drugs have been tested against it, with timid results. What will be more effective, vaccines or medicines? The greater hope in vaccines today is not supported by science. Only in faith."}}
