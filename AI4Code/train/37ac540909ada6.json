Data preparation","02477195":"# **What is crafting & recipes in Animal Crossing: New Horizons?**\n\nPlayer is starting out on a deserted island, there are very few resources to be had at the beginning of the game - besides raw materials such as sticks and stones.Therefore, the concept of crafting is introduced to allow players to make anything from tools (like the axe and shovel) to clothing to furniture - an expansive new element to the game.\n\nThe player gathers what are called \"DIY recipes\" - which can be acquired both from predictable sources such as Tom Nook, and randomised origins like bottles on the beach and floating balloon presents. Once in hand, players simply select the recipes in their inventories, \"learn\" them, and then choose them the next time they're at a workbench. Combined with the right materials, this allows everyone to craft to their heart's content.","3cc0ee0d":"Well.. Let's visualize it!\n\nActually, based on my understanding of Animal crossing recipes,there is no need to worry about missing values at all. \n\n* For each recipe, the types of raw materials are varied. For example, the first one :acorn pochette which only need 6 acorns, so column **material2 - material6 **are empty.\n* Not every item\/ recipe would be purchased by miles, it also explain why there are so many missing values in **Miles Price.**\n* **Source Notes** suggests that some recipes are seansonal limited. It's fair to be incomplete.\n\nMy key takeaway here is to ** have a fully understanding of your product\/object before dealing with data. ** \nIn this case, if I haven't played this game yet, I'd probably delete several columns or the row containng miss value as usual.\n\n","0e929fe2":"# Goal\nProblem to be solved: Given a set of items, what DIY recipes can you make or are close to make?\n\nIn the game, it's easy to figure out which recipes I could make given my raw materials, as game has already marked for us. However, as a player, I often confused by which recipe was close to make. Hoping by designing a function I could solve my problem and find some interesting insights from data exploration process.","e6511fb2":"# 2. Data visualization & insights\n\n\nThere are several interested fingings here!\n\n**Recipe Types:**\n* Housewares recipes are far more than any other types. Animal Crossing New Horizons features an extensive list of different furniture objects and other items that you can use to decorate your home and other parts of the island. However, in Animal Crossing World, players don't have rights to design their own furniture, all housewares are predesigned.Players have to gather recpes or exchange with friends to get more rare housewares to decorate their idland. BTW...The competition for the most incredible island was fierce, there are so many island tour videos on YouTube!\n\n* Amount of clothes,bags,shoes,bottom recipes are relative lower than others. The differents from housewares, players could deigin pattern for their outfit to make it unique. ACNH only provide basic type of clothes.The secret to getting the most creative, hilarious and downright bonkers Animal Crossing wallpapers, artworks and outfits in your game is in custom designs \u2014 and rather than have to sketch your own, you can scan those that helpful designers have already created straight into your game using QR codes, which made ACNH more social than any other games! Players also create their only community to share outfit ideas or island plannng examples.\n\n\n**Recipe could buy by Mile**\n\nInteresting! I played ACNH for months and never thought of there are only two types of recipe could purchase by mile point.\n\n**Source**\n* You could get 76 kinds of recipes by shooting down balloons with your slingshot! It's despair to know it untill now...\n* Don't be picky when you pick your villagers or reject it due to it's snooty or smug,it 'll give you recipes equally as other villagers with good characters. If you want to collect all reipes, please don't be prejudiced. Great job Nintendo!\n* There are also several seasonal limited rescources\uff0clike Easter egg bottle\/balloon.\n* Some recipes offered when you accomplish certan challenge,like shooting 300 ballons,fishing up all 3 trash items etc.\n\nHope this plot will give you reference where could get recipes!\n\n","3c1970fe":"![](http:\/\/https:\/\/www.nintendo.com\/content\/dam\/noa\/en_US\/games\/switch\/a\/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch\/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-hero.jpg)","5b745c77":"# 3. Build function\n\n\nBy changing input of **what_in_my_bag** and call function **close_to_make()\/ could_make()**, you'll get answer!\n\nThose functions are super easy, only contains several Loop functions. The key here is to convert reicpes into dictionary, then we could compare each number of material of what we have with what we expect.","fc26eff1":"### 1.2 Missing value\n\nI want to detect the count\/percentage of missing values in every column of the dataset.
