The codes to construct a time-series and colored tables are following. The main discussion part is at the end of the page.","85808438":"From the ranking tables I made, we can find that Canada is **#22** for the total number of cases and **#97** for the total vaccinations per number of people.\nMany COVID cases are observed in Canada. Canada's population is only about 38 million, 1\/10 of the United States. Therefore, it is fair to say the COVID situation in Canada is quite serious.\nDespite the serious situation, the vaccination does not spread enough. The ranking suggests that the total vaccinations per number of people # 97 in the world. It is estimated that Canada is behind the OEDC avarage because most of the developed countries is above Canada's position in the ranking.\n\nAccording to the dataset, the latest record of COVID-19 (new) cases in Canada is 3,415 on May 23th, 2021. According to Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) COVID-19 tracker, yesterday (May 26th, 2021) was 2,594. As you can recognize from the graphs which I made, now Canada seems to be at the end of the thrid wave of the infection.\n\nFrom the comparison with other countries, the vaccination progress seems limited. However, according to CBC \"The National,\" the fragship news program, is pointing out the vaccination policy by the federal government are going well because more than half Canadian are got vaccine shots at least one time. It can confirm from my analysis table, too. Also, the graph I made shows that the third wave is moderated after the vaccination spreads in the larger scale. British Columbia, a western province, decided to loose the resitriction policy this week, according to CBC. But also, some provinces such as Manitoba are under serious medical emergency. According to CBC, there is no ECU bed in Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, as for May 26th, 2021. From these data and news, we can guess that the national government is doing their best, and the positive effect are shown some parts of Canada. However, other parts of the country are still under the serious situation and the national government have to support such areas, continuously.\n","212a3f3a":"# Analyses\n\nFrom here, I will analyze the date that was loaded as an dataframe object.","e1eae5d4":"# Discussion (3. 4. 5.)","55da1a7a":"# Colored tables (2.)\nCreate colored tables","ea582e46":"# Improved visualization (1. of \"mission due next week\")\nFrom here, we will be using the modules iplot and plotly to make better visualizations.\n"}}
