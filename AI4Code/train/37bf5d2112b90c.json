When working on the answer this question and the several of the ones that follow, keep the following \"gotcha\" described in the [reference](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/indexing-selecting-assigning-reference) for this tutorial section:\n\n> `iloc` uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `df.iloc[0:1000]` will return 999 entries, while `df.loc[0:1000]` return 1000 of them! To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `df.iloc[0:1001]`.","c41b6fce":"# Set Up\nRun the following cell to load your data and some utility functions","7b7aca9b":"**Exercise 9**: Select wines whose `region_2` is not `NaN`.","e3048c43":"## Keep going\n\nMove on to the [**Summary functions and maps workbook**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/595524).","e01f5bc2":"# Checking Answers\n\nYou can check your answers in each of the exercises that follow using the  `check_qN` function provided in the code cell above (replacing `N` with the number of the exercise).
