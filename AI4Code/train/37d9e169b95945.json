Since the data set is highly imbalanced, it needs to be handled before model building.\n\n \n\n# Business problem overview\nFor many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.\n\n\nIt has been estimated by Nilson Report that by 2020, banking frauds would account for $30 billion worldwide. With the rise in digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is also increasing in new and different ways. \n\n \n\nIn the banking industry, credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not only a trend but a necessity for them to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning is helping these institutions to reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees as well as denials of legitimate transactions.\n\n \n\n# Understanding and defining fraud\nCredit card fraud is any dishonest act or behaviour to obtain information without proper authorisation from the account holder for financial gain. Among different ways of committing frauds, skimming is the most common one, which is a way of duplicating information that is located on the magnetic strip of the card. Apart from this, the other ways are as follows:\n\n- Manipulation\/alteration of genuine cards\n- Creation of counterfeit cards\n- Stealing\/loss of credit cards\n- Fraudulent telemarketing\n \n\n# Data dictionary\nThe data set can be downloaded using this link.\n\n \n\nThe data set includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. Out of a total of 2,84,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent. This data set is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of the total transactions. The data set has also been modified with principal component analysis (PCA) to maintain confidentiality. Apart from \u2018time\u2019 and \u2018amount\u2019, all the other features (V1, V2, V3, up to V28) are the principal components obtained using PCA. The feature 'time' contains the seconds elapsed between the first transaction in the data set and the subsequent transactions. The feature 'amount' is the transaction amount. The feature 'class' represents class labelling, and it takes the value of 1 in cases of fraud and 0 in others.\n\n \n\n# Project pipeline\nThe project pipeline can be briefly summarised in the following four steps:\n\n# Data Understanding: \n\nHere, we need to load the data and understand the features present in it. This would help us choose the features that we will need for our final model.\n\n- **Exploratory data analytics (EDA)**: Normally, in this step, we need to perform univariate and bivariate analyses of the data, followed by feature transformations, if necessary. For the current data set, because Gaussian variables are used, we do not need to perform Z-scaling. However, we  can check whether there is any skewness in the data and try to mitigate it, as it might cause problems during the model building phase.\n- **Train\/Test split**: Now, we are familiar with the train\/test split that we can perform to check the performance of our models with unseen data. Here, for validation, we can use the k-fold cross-validation method. We need to choose an appropriate k value so that the minority class is correctly represented in the test folds.\n- **Model building \/ hyperparameter tuning**: This is the final step at which we can try different models and fine-tune their hyperparameters until we get the desired level of performance on the given data set. We should try and check if we get a better model by various sampling techniques.\n- **Model evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that since the data is imbalanced, it is is more important to identify the fraudulent transactions accurately than the non-fraudulent ones. Choose an appropriate evaluation metric that reflects this business goal.","cd5ceaca":"We can see that there is no missing value present in the dataframe.","44bf863c":"#### Decision Tree with optimal hyperparameters","c6239340":"#### Prediction on the train set","af240ca5":"There are no features which there is high correlatation , corr > .75","4f26cd2f":"### Feature Scaling using  RobustScaler Scaler","fbf4267e":"### Handling Missing Values","ee3537cb":"## Model Building with imbalanced data\nWe are going to build models on below mentioned algorithms and we will compare for the best model.

Skipped models' process is computationally very expensive when we have very large data set. We do not have these resource available so we are skipping these models. Working with below models:\n    - Logistic Regression\n    - Decision Tree\n    - RandomForest\n    - XGBoost\n\n#### Metric selection on imbalance data\nWe are going to use ROC-AUC score as the evaluation metric for the model evaluation purpose. As the data is highly imbalanced and we have only 0.17% fraud cases in the whole data, accuracy will not be the right metric to evaluate the model.","ace6ad25":"**Observation**\n\nClearly low amount transactions are more likely to be fraudulent than high amount transaction.","ed87b526":"### Observe the distribution of our classes","8d5512af":"#### Plotting the distributions of all the features","376865dc":"# Decision Tree"}}
