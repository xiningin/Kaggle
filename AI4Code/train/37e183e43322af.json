such entries exist, the following steps should be followed:\n\n* Identifying the data items needed for prediction from among the datasets. \n  Indiscrimanate removal of rows owing to missing non-esential data reduces the data we have for model training and validation, thus reducing accuracy.\n\n* Using function **dropna()** to remove all rows with missing\/absent entries.","a19812ea":"**Calculating Result and identifying the model that is better suited.**\n\nThe two models being employed to make that prediction are:\n* DecisionTreeRegressor\n*

Data into Training and Testing Sets to test the validity of the model.**\n\nIf the entire data is used to train the model, there would be know way to test the accuracy of future real-world

It studies the relationship between parameters.\nThe co-relation magnitude ranges from [-1, 1]. A positive value indicates a positive impact on the parameter and vice-versa."}}
