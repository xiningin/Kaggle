The number of the changed bits doesn't nescessary equals to payload size, because sometimes you don't have to change the coefficient at all when you encoding the bit. But I'd expect it to be somewhat proportional\n\nSome key findings:\n1. The payloads can vary quite significantly in size\n2. JMiPOD pictures have generally mode bits altered\n3. Higher quality images have mode bits altered\n4. For some images there are no changes at all.","e7785ee4":"Do we have any modified files that are actually not modified at all?
