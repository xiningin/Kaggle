It focuses on work to understand\/learn the DICOM data format as it it is used in the Kaggle ISIC 2020 competition.  It also shows work to visualize the embedded images in a more *natural* (RGB) format vs. the embedded `YBR_FULL_422` format that if displayed as is produces images that in the author's opinion do not look natural.\n\nThe Kaggle contest (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/siim-isic-melanoma-classification\/discussion?sortBy=relevance&group=all&search=color&page=1&pageSize=20&category=all)has a very large image dataset. This notebook uses a small subset of the original dataset (a few images from the `test` directory)\n\nThis notebook does not include any modeling to predict melanoma.

Note that this function (as I understand things now) does not handle the display of the `YBR_FULL_422` images and when they are displayed, they will not look like you would expect a skim image to look like.

From what I see there, these images are not in the usual RGB format, but they are in `YBR_FULL_422`. As I understand things today if I use `fast.ai v2` medical images to display the images, the will not look like what you expect a picture of a skin lession to look like.
