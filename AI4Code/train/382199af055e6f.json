Seventeen of his novels were bestsellers, and more than 100 million copies of his books were sold.[1] His name was also used on movie scripts written by ghostwriters, nonfiction books on military subjects occasionally with co-authors, and video games. He was a part-owner of his hometown Major League Baseball team, the Baltimore Orioles of the American League and vice-chairman of their community activities and public affairs committees.\n\nClancy was an ordinary American citizen who was an insurance agent. His literary career began in 1984 when he sold his first military thriller novel The Hunt for Red October for $5,000 published by the small academic Naval Institute Press of Annapolis, Maryland.[1][2] His works The Hunt for Red October (1984), Patriot Games (1987), Clear and Present Danger (1989), and The Sum of All Fears (1991) have been turned into commercially successful films. Actors Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck, Chris Pine, and John Krasinski have played Clancy's most famous fictional character, Jack Ryan. Another well-known character of his, John Clark, has been portrayed by actors Willem Dafoe and Liev Schreiber. Tom Clancy's works also inspired games such as the Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, The Division, and Splinter Cell series. Since Clancy's death in 2013,[3] the Jack Ryan series has been continued by his family estate through a series of authors.\n\n\"\"\"","12bc1ed5":"summarizer(article, max_length=130, min_length=30, do_sample=False)","65813bf1":"### Hugging face in 4 lines of code\n\nTechnically 5 if you add installation","b3ac9e3f":"### Import","e5a22334":"### Installation","0c916533":"### Sample article","2ba3e7db":"### summary","36cd1aa7":"### Initialising summarisation pipeline"}}
