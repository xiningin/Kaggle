The top item in each list has been custom-made to help you with the exercises on that page.\n\nThe first step in most data analytics projects is reading the data file. In this section, you'll create `Series` and `DataFrame` objects, both by hand and by reading data files.\n\n# Relevant Resources\n* **[Creating, Reading and Writing Reference](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/creating-reading-and-writing-reference)**\n* [General Pandas Cheat Sheet](https:\/\/assets.datacamp.com\/blog_assets\/PandasPythonForDataScience.pdf)\n\n# Set Up\n\nRun the code cell below to load libraries you will need (including code to check your answers).","7c278935":"## 2.\n\nCreate a dataframe `fruit_sales` that matches the diagram below:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CHPn7ZF.png)","dd5e178e":"## 4.\n\nRead the following csv dataset of wine reviews into a DataFrame called `reviews`:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/74RCZtU.png)\n\nThe filepath to the csv file is `..\/input\/wine-reviews\/winemag-data_first150k.csv`.
