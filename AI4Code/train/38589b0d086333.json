For example 13 or 16 GB of RAM (depending on the account). The TPS-October data is more than 2 GB and is not easy to work with despite Google restrictions. In this article we will see how to make better use of the amount of dedicated RAM.\n\nDue to the high capabilities of pandas, most data scientists are accustomed to using pandas. This is a good choice but not when working with big data .\nAnother issue is not observing the data type.
