Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. \n\n\nWith thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the \"Sales\" column for the test set. \n\n<b>Note<\/b>: Some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.\n\nView and download the data here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/rossmann-store-sales\/data\n\n<b> Files<\/b><br>\ntrain.csv - historical data including Sales<br>\ntest.csv - historical data excluding Sales<br>\nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format<br>\nstore.csv - supplemental information about the stores<br>\n\n<b>Data fields<\/b>\nMost of the fields are self-explanatory.
