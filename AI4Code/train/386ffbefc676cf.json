However, (root-consonant), (root-vowel) and (consonant-vowel) are constructed in a peculiar way. For isntance, less popular consonants are mostly mixed with more popular vowels and the other way around. I am not sure if this have been done on purpose, but this is a good hint for any model to overfit on combinations given in the training set. \n\nFor instance, consonant_3 is exclusively paired to vowel_0, so it is likely to use vowel_0 presence as a feature for consonant_3. Apparently cutmix works well because it may \"construct\" combinations that are not present in the training set. \n\nA crossvalidation\/augumentation strategy must focus on preventing the model from overfitting on combinations given in the train set, becasue test set is likely to conatin significantly different combinations.
