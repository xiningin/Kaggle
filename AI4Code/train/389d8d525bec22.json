At the same time, there are emerging requests from both the medical research community and the broader society to find answers to various questions regarding COVID-19. A system that can provide reliable answers to the COVID-19 related questions from the latest academic resources is crucial, especially for the medical community in the current time-critical race to treat patients and to find a cure for the virus. \n \nTo address the aforementioned requests by the medical community, we propose a machine learning-based system that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing(NLP) question answering(QA) techniques combined with summarization for mining the available scientific literature. The system is an end-to-end neural network-based open-domain QA system that can answer COVID-19 related questions, such as those questions proposed in the COVID-19 Kaggle task. Through our system, users can get two versions of the outcome:\n1. A ranked list of relevant snippets from the literature given a query;\n1. A fluent summary of the relevant results. We provide the paragraph-level summaries, which takes the paragraphs where the top three relevant snippets are located as input, to enable a more efficient way of understanding of the content.\n \nOur system consists of three different modules: **1) Document Retriever, 2) Relevant Snippet Selector, and 3) Multi-Document Summarizer**. The first module pre-processes a user\u2019s query and retrieves the most relevant k number of academic publications. The second module outputs a list of the most relevant answer snippets from the retrieved documents. It also highlights the relevant keywords. The last module is for generating the second output, namely a concise summary of the top-ranked retrieved relevant paragraphs in the two previous modules.\n\nWe have launched our [CAiRE-Covid website](https:\/\/caire.ust.hk\/covid), which showcases our results for each user query in real-time, so people can further experiment with our system.\n","13468251":"For the question answering (QA) module, we have leveraged the BioBERT QA model which is finetuned on the SQuAD dataset and [our generalized QA model](http:\/\/https:\/\/github.com\/yana-xuyan\/caireCovid) for MRQA@EMNLP 2019 Shared Task[1]. Instead of fine-tuning the QA models on COVID-19 related datasets, we focus more on maintaining the generalization ability of our system so it can be easily applied to other similar tasks. For the MRQA model, we utilized six datasets, which vary from each other in terms of data source, context lengths, whether multi-hop reasoning is needed, strategies for data augmentation to reduce overfitting to the training data in order to enable generalization to out-of-domain data. Multi-task learning over six datasets is used to fine-tune large pre-trained language model XLNet[2] and it helped achieve promising results. To make the answers more readable, instead of providing small spans of answers, we provide the whole sentences and the surrounding context.  \n\nTo better evaluate the question answering results, we leverage the prediction probability of the QA models as the confidence score. The final answers of our system are re-ranked using this score as one of the factors, which will be talked about later in Section 2.2.\n \n\n[1]Su, Dan, et al. \"Generalizing Question Answering System with Pre-trained Language Model Fine-tuning.\" Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Machine Reading for Question Answering. 2019.\n[2]Yang, Zhilin, et al. \"Xlnet: Generalized autoregressive pretraining for language understanding.\" Advances in neural information processing systems. 2019.","d4d7c43a":"Let's write some code to print the results, which are top 10 articles matching a given query, along with the best matched paragraph.

Anserini is an information retrieval module wrapped around the open source search engine **Lucene**. Although Lucene has been used widely to build industry search engine applications, its complex indexing and lack of documentation for ad hoc experimentation and testing on standard test sets, has made it less popular in the information retrieval community. Anserini uses the Lucene indexing to create an easy-to-understand module. Standard ranking algorithms(e.g. bag of words, BM25) have been implemented in the module, which enables us to use Lucene for our application.

Since the disk is not large enough for saving the whole dataset with index and other models, we use his API to get the information retrieval results.","8aaac4e6":"Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Basically there are two main types of how to summarize text in NLP:\n* **Extraction-based summarization**, which involves pulling key phrases from the source document and combining them to make a summary, and;\n* **Abstraction-based summarization**, which creates new phrases and sentences that relay the most useful information from the original text \u2014 just like humans do. \nIn general, the abstractive method is a much harder task but performs better than an extractive method.\n\nIn our project, considering the requirements that people may still want to further read each paragraph containing the predicted QA answer spans, we summarize the top-k  (top-3) paragraphs that QA module passes, to generate a **paragraph-level abstractive summary**. \n\nOur model is based on two different abstractive summarization models: [Unilm](https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/unilm\/tree\/master\/s2s-ft) and [BART](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/fairseq\/tree\/master\/examples\/bart), both of which have obtained SOTA results on the summarization tasks ([CNN\/DM datasets](https:\/\/cs.nyu.edu\/~kcho\/DMQA\/), and [XSUM](https:\/\/github.com\/EdinburghNLP\/XSum\/tree\/master\/XSum-Dataset) data). UniLM model is a unified pre-trained model for language understanding and generation. BART is a sequence-to-sequence model trained with denoising as a pre-training objective for language generation, translation, and comprehension.\n\nWe fine-tuned the UniLM model using [SumOnGraph](https:\/\/github.com\/coshiang\/SumOnGraph) biology dataset which includes literature for 5 types of diseases including Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, Allergy, and Obesity. Original data is from PubMed which is a free resource supporting the search and retrieval of biomedical and life sciences literature with the aim of improving health\u2013both globally and personally. We used the BART model fine-tuned on CNN\/DailMail dataset. \n\nWe generate a summary for each answer-related paragraph from the QA module, then concatenate them directly to form our final **paragraph-level** answer summary.\n\n*(Actually we also implement **article-level summary**, even though in this Kaggle project, for the simplicity and legibility, we only display **the paragraph-level results** of the summarization models. It takes the whole article as input, and generate a summary for each sections (eg. Introductions section, Methodologies section)  of the articles, and then concatenate them together as a more fine-grained **article-level summary**, as complementary to the abstracts. You can refer to this [github repository](https:\/\/github.com\/Iamfinethanksu\/covidSumm) for more details.)*\n\nIf anyone is interested in our article-level results, please utilize ```summary = get_article_summary(query, abstractive_summary_model)``` to obtain the results from our system.

We leverage an ensemble of two neural-based QA models which are pre-trained on SQuAD style QA datasets. Here we consider the QA module as a supporting fact selector to provide relevant snippets from the retrieved documents.\n+ **Answer Re-ranking & Highlight Generation**:  We rerank the retrieved result by a word matching score based on part-of-speech tagging as well as the QA system confidence score. We also highlight the answer span in order to enable easier reading of the QA results.\n\n3) Multi-document Summarizer:\n+ **Abstractive Summarization**: Another output of our system is an abstractive summary that synthesizes the answer from multiple retrieved snippets. This step aims to generate short pieces of fluent summaries based on the top relevant results. Using the neural-based summarizer, we generate summaries to improve the legibility of the results and help the user to have an overview of the relevant snippets in a short time.","13090e0c":"# Let's try now","4019c3ca":"## 1.2 Search Engine","a99c7c54":"We can see some repititions in the results above. This can either be due to multiple paragraphs in the same article being matched with the query, or one article appearing more than once in the CORD-19 dataset, due to different sources. Let's now try printing out the actual paragraph that is being matched with each of the returned hits. First we print out contents of the indexing of the first hit for example:"}}
