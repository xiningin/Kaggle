It means that they are profitable and more volatile. In order to ensure constant availability, company needs to increase the safety stock.\n* ### There are Bookcases, Accessories and Trousers in AZ cell. It means that they are profitable but too volatile, it is not possible to build any sale forecast for them. An attempt to ensure the guaranteed availability for all goods of this group only at the expense of excess insurance stock will lead to the fact that the average stock of the company will increase significantly. Therefore, for the goods of this group, the ordering system should be revised:\n    * #### - transfer part of the goods to the ordering system with a constant amount (volume) of the order;\n    * #### - to ensure more frequent deliveries for goods;\n    * #### - choose suppliers located close to the warehouse, thereby reducing the amount of the insurance stock;\n* ### There are Shirts and Furnishings in BY cell. It means that they are less profitable than A category and quite volatile.With a high turnover, they have insufficient stability of consumption, and, as a result, in order to ensure constant availability, it is necessary to increase the safety stock.\n* ### There is T-shirt in BZ cell. It means that it is mediumly profitable and too volatile. It requires well thought out system of work with stocks like in AZ group.\n* ### There is Saree in **CX** cell: it means that it is not very profitable but stable. For goods of this group, company can use the ordering system with a constant frequency and reduce the safety stock.\n* ### There is Skirt in CY cell. It means that it is not profitable and volatile.For goods of this group, company can switch to a system with a constant amount (volume) of the order, but at the same time form a safety stock based on the financial capabilities of the company.\n* ### There are Chairs, Leggings and Kurti in CZ cell. It means these goods do not bring much profit and do not have stable demand.The CZ group of goods includes all new goods, goods of spontaneous demand, delivered on order, etc. Some of these goods can be painlessly removed from the assortment, and the other part needs to be regularly monitored, since it is from the goods of this group that illiquid or hard-to-sell stocks arise from which the company suffers losses.

This coefficient shows the deviation of consumption from the average value and is expressed as a percentage. The result of the XYZ analysis is a grouping of goods into three categories, based on the stability of their behavior:\n* #### Category X These are goods characterized by a stable consumption value and a high degree of forecasting.\n* #### Category Y These are products with seasonal fluctuations and average forecasting capabilities.\n* #### Category Z These are goods with irregular consumption and unpredictable fluctuations, therefore, it is impossible to predict their demand.\n#### Result is a matrix which shows products and their categories, for each of what company shapes strategy","3a52bdea":"# Contents\n1. ### ABC XYZ analysis description\n2. ### Data preparation\n3. ### Analysis\n4. ### Result","45b00662":"### Dropping empty rows from second dataset","94694510":"### Reading some second dataset descriptions","4890c417":"### Creating column with full all profits for a known period by sub-categories","f39f207f":"### Looking at dataset with order details","70c720da":"### Dropping non-profit sub-categories (information is above)","465b3c2b":"### Creating dataset with information about sales by sub-category.","84bf120b":"### Hey guy!
