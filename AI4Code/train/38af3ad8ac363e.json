In this case, a file was brought in from the Kaggle database. Kaggle's database is a great resource, with thousands of data sets ready to use. The only draw backs are that the data is not yours and there is not always a record of where the data came from. The data not being yours is usually not a problem, but can become a problem when the owner changes or deletes the dataset. That would obviously mess up your project. A way to get around that is downloading or saving the dataset locally on your computer. That way you own that dataset. The other problem is that we don't know where the data in the database comes from. There aren't always reliable records of the data's orgin. The data could be made up. This creates a weird situation where sometimes it is necessary to reseach your data before using it. Once you select your data set, the pd.read_csv() function with the file path in the parentheses will allow you to use the data in your code."}}
