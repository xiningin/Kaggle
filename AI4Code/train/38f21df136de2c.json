In each case, the original content of the article that most represents the processed aspect is shown.\n\nTo accomplish the goal, the selected approach was to perform text mining on input data, by applying the latest advances in natural language processing (NLP). This was realized by the following steps:\n\n    1. Obtain input data and pre-process it to facilitate analysis.\n    2. Extract the key terms from the task description.\n    3. Match key terms with text contents.\n    4. Group and quantify the findings.\n    5. Show the documents that answer the task questions.\n        \nThe advantage of using NLP to abord this problem is that it is based on language-specific models, saving time and resources for text analysis.\n\nThe key terms was extracted from the task description in the step 2, resulting in a set of rule-based patterns.\n\nThe matching of key terms (step 3) was applied through topic  classification with Spacy library. This work through large sets of the unstructured data to match the patterns obtained in step 2. It is a very fast and scalable process that preferably uses the GPU resource.\n\nThis approach presents the limitation of synonymy, where multiple words and phrases have the same or similar meaning. To counter this, great care was taken in selecting keywords to make up the vocabulary of terms (e.g. COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov, SARS Coronavirus 2, or 2019 Novel Coronavirus).\n\nIn other hand, since the [original input data](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge) it is stored in JSON single files, whose structure is likely too complex to directly perform the analysis, this notebook uses the pre-processed data from the dataset [CORD-19-CSV](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/huascarmendez1\/cord19csv), also of same authorship of this.\n\nThe preprocessing of the data further consisted of filtering the documents that specifically talk about the covid-19 disease and its other names, as well as that they dealt with related risk factors, among other general data review, counting and cleaning activities.\n\nFinally, as it is clear that the results presented here are not final, it is recommended to assume them as a starting point for a complete understanding of each of the aspects that it tries to address.","d08df34e":" # What is known about vaccines and therapeutics?\n \nThe answer to this question is distributed in each of the aspects listed at the beginning of this notebook.","fec38a38":"## Load Data","46e9eb99":"Quantify documents by key terms","a61f3cec":"## Pattern Matching\nObjective: classify all articles according to key terms.","cd99cd09":"Run the matcher"}}
