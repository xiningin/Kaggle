The dataset is updated anually (most recent udate in 2017). It contains information regarding the total number of crimes that were reported in the State of New York since 1970. The data was obtained from Law enforcement agenceis Criminal history database. More informatin can be foud in the \"Overview section\"\n\n**Content:**\nDataset contains 3055 obeservations and 13 variables as follows\"\n1. County : Name of the county where crime was reported\/recorded.\n2. Year: Year crime occured.\n3. Total: Total number of adult felony and misdemeanor arrests.\n4-8 : Felonies : Drug, Violent, DWI, Other\n9-13: Misdemeanor: Total, Drug, DWI,Propert, Other\n\n**Importing and reading Dataset**","3676ff7d":"To see line highlighted simply move\/hover mouse on specific line and analyze the result.\n\n**Data Analysis:***\nNew York, Kings, Queens and Bronx also recorded highest misdemeanor. Though drug misdemeanor was lower till the year 1980.It spiked up rapidly in New York till the year 1990. Then there was decline in drug misdemeanor for apprximately 3 year and for some reason it spiked up rapidly after the year 1993. After the year 2004, there appears to be decline in the crime rate.\n\n\n**Overall  Summary:**\n1. New York, Kings, Queens and Bronx recored highest crimes between 1980-1990's, then crime rates start to decline.\n2. We saw the power of Altair library.\n\n***What's Next ?***\nI will try to explore more power of Altair  and will also try to answer the question***Why was crime rate so high in New York between 1980's-1990's ?*** [ To my understanding some reasons can be high unemployment, high immigration of people in NY during that period ]- I will try to find the dataset related to that. In the mean time, if you find any dataset that can be helpful in my analysis, please feel free to share in the comment section below. \n\n**Note:**\n*This Kernel is influenced by the example mentioned on Altair's official page. It is possible that some of the code used in this Kernel might appear on offical page. *\n\nPart 2 can be found [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/apnanaam08\/crimes-in-ny-using-altair-library-p2).\n\nLove .

Now we have plot Total number of Adult felony on Y-axis and Year on X-axis. But how can we see name of the county ?\n\n**Answer:** Move\/Hover mouse on the line and see the magic of Altair library. In the above code, I have used \"tooltip\" function available in Altair library.\n\n**Data Analysis:**\nFrom above plot, one can see that New York, Kings, Bronx and Queens recorded highest number of Adult felonies especially between 1980's- 1990's. Let's see if we can find similar trend with other variables such as Drug Felonies and Misdemeanor's .\n\n**Plot 2:**\nLet's zoom in on specific year on the plot using \" brush\" function of Altair.","033ec050":"**Analysis:**\nDataset doesn't contians missing values.\n\n**What is Altair Library ?**\n\n\"Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega and Vega-Lite\".
