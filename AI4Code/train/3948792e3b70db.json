It's interesting to me that social support played such a big influence. According the website that hosts the World Happiness Report, social support is the national average of binary responses to the Gallup World Poll question, \"If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?\" Nonetheless, it seems like having good social support systems is imperative.\n\nAs for the GDP per capita also having a fairly big influence, it's interesting to note that in 2019 for the World Bank the US ranked #8 in comparison to Finland that ranked #16.","1e8dda09":"![south-sudan-flag-02.jpg](attachment:south-sudan-flag-02.jpg)","ec78f988":"## Import Modules","a08f25bc":"## Conclusion","bb9b8e57":"## The Lowest Ranked Country based on Happiness Score","8a0b7868":"## The Happiest Country in the World","208c570b":"![Be-Happy_Title-Slide.jpg](attachment:Be-Happy_Title-Slide.jpg)","e6d1bc09":"South Sudan ranked the lowest in its happiness score with a 2.853 out of a possible 10.\n\nRanked noticeably the lowest is the Freedom to make life choices factor.

Even in the US, social support prevailed as #1. Humans are innately social and it\u2019s important to have a good support system. Even after this analysis I don\u2019t think there is a secret formula, my personal opinion is that all of the factors are pretty important and if 1 were to be taken away such as freedom, happiness levels would definitely take a hit. This data is based on how each individual perceives the world and the reality that they live in, whether that be in persecution or complete freedom. \n\nMy main takeaway was the importance of a good social support system. I\u2019ll be working to foster that for myself. Stay positive and be happy!","6f96413b":" Based on the graph above I would have to say **GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy** have strong correlations to the happiness score. I have to say I am not as surprised, but I also thought freedom would be up there. I do wonder if the data from countries where freedom is a right and therefore possibly not as valued skewed the results.","9242fe00":"## Import Data"}}
