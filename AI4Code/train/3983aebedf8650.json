AutoViz starts by first analyzing your data to know if it is a Classification, Regression, Unsupervised or Time Series problem. It then chooses the best charts to maximize your insights...\n\nAutoViz can create charts from any flat file format: CSV, Excel or TXT. Just upload your data and AutoViz will send you the right charts that help you derive insights within minutes...

In data science, we generally use data visualization techniques to understand the dataset and find the relation between the data. Visualization can also help in finding the pattern in the dataset which is used for further analysis.There are different techniques\/libraries in python which are used for Data Visualization like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc. But while using all these libraries we need to define the type of graph we want to visualize and the arguments which we need to visualize.AutoViz performs automatic visualization of any dataset with just one line of code. AutoViz can find the most important features and plot impactful visualizations only using those automatically selected features. Also, AutoViz is incredibly fast so it creates visualization within seconds.","988ad152":"# Let\u2019s start exploring AutoViz with help of some dataset.
