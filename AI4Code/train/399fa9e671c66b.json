Create a variable `sorted_varieties` containing a copy of the dataframe from the previous question where varieties are sorted in descending order based on minimum price, then on maximum price (to break ties).","3b17723b":"## 3.\nWhat are the minimum and maximum prices for each `variety` of wine? Create a `DataFrame` whose index is the `variety` category from the dataset and whose values are the `min` and `max` values thereof.","0497a63b":"## 6.\nWhat combination of countries and varieties are most common? Create a `Series` whose index is a `MultiIndex`of `{country, variety}` pairs. For example, a pinot noir produced in the US should map to `{\"US\", \"Pinot Noir\"}`. Sort the values in the `Series` in descending order based on wine count.","4002e48d":"## 1.\nWho are the most common wine reviewers in the dataset? Create a `Series` whose index is the `taster_twitter_handle` category from the dataset, and whose values count how many reviews each person wrote.","ba576fc9":"## 2.\nWhat is the best wine I can buy for a given amount of money? Create a `Series` whose index is wine prices and whose values is the maximum number of points a wine costing that much was given in a review.
