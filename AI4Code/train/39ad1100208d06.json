However, the questions in Part 3, 4, 6, and 7 come in bundle. On the `question.csv`, the part numbers have the exact same characteristics. ","ff7f8861":"On TOEIC, Each part can be explained as follows.\n\n**Listening** - test takers have to listen to spoken English and answer questions\n\n- Part 1: Photographs - select a spoken sentence that best describes the given picture\n- Part 2: Question-Response - select the appropriate response to the spoken question\n- Part 3: Conversations - select the appropriate answers to questions related to a spoken conversation between 2~3 people\n- Part 4: Talks - select the appropriate answers to questions related to a spoken short talk\n\n**Reading**  - test takers have to read a sentence or a passage to answer questions\n\n- Part 5: Incomplete Sentences - select the correct word that fills the blank in a sentence so it becomes complete in syntax-wise or semantic-wise\n- Part 6: Text Completion - select the correct answer that fills the blank in a passage so it becomes complete in syntax-wise and semantic-wise\n- Part 7: Reading Comprehension - select the correct answers to questions related to a given passage\n\nI'm also assuming the numbers on `part` column correspond exactly one-on-one to the part numbers on TOEIC because they show same characteristics.

TOEIC is a well-known test in South Korea for assessing students' English proficiency. \n\nTOEIC is comprised of 7 parts, which is why there are 7 unique values in `part` column of questions.csv file.
