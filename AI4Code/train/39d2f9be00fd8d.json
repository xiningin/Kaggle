All of the kernels I have submitted so far for this competition have been a single model that predicts one of 10 categories for the digits. In this kernel, instead of creating one model for 10 digits, I created ten models, each predicting a single digit. For example, the first model would predict whether the digit was of category \"0\" or \"not 0,\" the second model would predict category \"1\" or \"not one,\" etc. \n\nHowever, I don't want to fully train 10 models. This is what brings me to the second part of my goal: [transfer learning](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/how-to-improve-performance-with-transfer-learning-for-deep-learning-neural-networks\/). In transfer learning, a model that has learned in one setting is used to improve generalization in another setting. For example, a model might be trained on the images in [ImageNet](http:\/\/www.image-net.org\/), and then used to perform another task, like identifying the subset of [dog breeds](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/dog-breed-identification). Here, I want to create a 10 Kannada digit model, and transfer the trained convolutional portion to my single digit models.\n\nThis kernel follows the following steps:\n1. Define commmonly used methods for reading and creating data structures\n1. Train the model I will use for transfer learning (aka, the 'backbone' model)\n1. Create a new model for single digit detection that incorporates the pretrained 'backbone' model\n1. Train the single digit models and retain their predictions\n1. Ensemble the results of all models to obtain the submission\n\nI've used fastai in this kernel, but my hope is that you can take the ideas presented here, and apply it to whatever framework you like best.","5a947818":"This functions trains all of the single digit models and records the output.The following process is repeated for each digit:\n1. New labels are created from the trainin_df. These labels are stored in the 'binary' column.\n1. A databunch is created with the 'binary' column as the label, and test time augmentation.\n1. The model 'head' is trained\n    - Note that I chose not to unfreeze the model and train the whole thing. I have pretrained my 'backbone' to decent accuracy, and I note that unfreezing causes a decrease in accuracy.\n1.

Therefore, I want to train all of the layers from the beginning. Since I told the learner which part of the model was my 'backbone' and which is my 'head,' the default behavior is to freeze (don't train) the backbone. To preven this, I will 'unfreeze' to train the entire model.","76b9ad28":"Then, my new architecture would be the 'backbone' of the first model, combined with the new two category 'head'.

This custom ImageList for pixels [was inspired by this very helpful kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/heye0507\/fastai-1-0-with-customized-itemlist). To open an image, the function is passed a 'filename' (fn), which is a string containing the index number with '..\/' in front. This code finds the correct row, and selects the needed colums of that row. The resulting array is reshaped into a 28x28 matrix, and returned as an image. \n\nPreviously, I used [this super interesting kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/joatom\/kannada-mnist-speed-up-fastai-image-processing), but I was getting random performance after ensembling.

This makes sense because now instead of having 10 equally sized categories, we have one positive category as 1 and the nine other categories combined to make up the 0 category. This creates an imbalanced data set. To account for the data imbalance, I will adjust the weights of the categories for the cross entropy loss.","ab828658":"This model has quite a different loss curve. However, 1e-2 still seems to be a good choice.\n\nNow the backbone model is already partially trained. Therefore, we will first train the 'head' on the training digits by using `freeze()` to not train the 'backbone' layers. Then, the entire model is 'unfrozen' and fine tuned for a few epochs. The number of frozen and unfrozen epochs is arbitrary chosen. Since I'm using this as my pretrained model, I'm not concerned about training for lots of epochs. 99% accuracy tells me that the model is good at recognizing the digits. ","b6e036f3":"In fastai, the data and dataloaders are stored as a `DataBunch`. This codde will get the images, create the training\/validation sets and add the labels.

The Fastai `conv_layer` function returns a sequence of convolutional, ReLU and batchnorm layers. \n\nNote that this model is divided into two sections. The first is the backbone, that contains the convolutional layers, and the second is the 'head', that contains the linear layers. Since I will use the backbone of this model as the pretrained portion of my single digit models, I am calling this the 'backbone model'.","bcee1eaa":"Here we can see that now the labels are either 1 or 0.","fde351b0":"## Brief background: Kannada MNIST\nThis Playground Code Competition is to detect Kannada digits.
