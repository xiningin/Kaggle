One of the advantages of a TPU is that we can run multiple files across the TPU at once, and this accounts for the speed advantages of using a TPU. To capitalize on that, we want to make sure that we're using data as soon as it streams in, rather than creating a data streaming bottleneck.","e1a667f8":"## Building our model\nIn order to ensure that our model is trained on the TPU, we build it using `with strategy.scope()`.    \n\nThis model was built using transfer learning, meaning that we have a _pre-trained model_ (ResNet50) as our base model and then the customizable model built using `tf.keras.Sequential`. If you're new to transfer learning I recommend setting `base_model.trainable` to **False**, but _do_ encourage you to change which base model you're using (more options are available in the **[`tf.keras.applications` Module](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/keras\/applications)** documentation) as well iterate on the custom model. \n\nNote that we're using `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` as our loss function, because we did _not_ one-hot encode our labels.","e96c8916":"# Detect TPU\nWhat we're doing with our code here is making sure that we'll be sending our data across a TPU.
