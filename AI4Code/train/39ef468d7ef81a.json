Apply a Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel size and valid padding, then another Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel but with same padding to keep the same dimensions\n2. Apply a BatchNormalization layer to avoid layers being too depended from one another and allowing each activation to have 0 mean\n3. A RELU activation and a MaxPooling2D layer with 2x2 kernel size and stride=2\n4.
