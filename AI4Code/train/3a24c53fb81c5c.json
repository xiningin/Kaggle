Note that setting n_grp=None will assign the folds without stratification.\n\nThe figure below shows the distributions in each folds without stratification strategy. Note that the distributions generally looks alike, but the fine structures at the peaks are quite different.","6ddc8d2b":"### Stratifying Continuous Target\n\nThe solution is to split the continous target distribution into N bins, and use these bins as classification targets in the standard StratifiedKFold cross-validator of scikit-learn. The binning can be easily done with the `pd.cut` in pandas. The python function to do the splitting is given below.","b2fb8063":"The train set has the following continuous target distribution:","2a190248":"The dataset contains 14 continuous features and a continuous target from 300000 samples.

The test results are as anticipated - the KS statistic values are low for all folds but probability values are not small enough to reject the null hypothesis that the all folds come from the same distribution."}}
