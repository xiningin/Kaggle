Hopefully this section has familiarized you with the idea!\n\n[Click here to proceed to the last section of the tutorial: time-series plotting](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/time-series-plotting-optional).","4dcd50e3":"# Introduction\n\n`plotnine` is a data visualization library which implements the **grammar of graphics**. The grammar of graphics is an approach to data visualization API design which diverges in the extreme from that followed by the libraries we have seen so far.\n\nThe data visualization design process starts with creating\n\n1. Creating a figure\n1. Adjusting the geometry of that figure , \n1. then Adjusting the aesthetic of that figure. \n\nAs we saw in the section on styling your plots, this makes things harder than they need to be (when can I use a parameter? When do I need a method?), and creates a well-known user pain point.\n\nThe grammar of graphics solves this thorny issue. In grammar of graphics -based libraries (like `plotnine`), *every* operation is expressed the same way: using a function. In `plotnine` we create graphs by \"adding up\" our elements:","7ee9b0d9":"Notice how the plot breaks down smoothly into three separate operations. First we initialize the plot with `ggplot`, passing in our input data (`df`) as a parameter (the **data**). Then we add the variables of interest in `aes` (the **aesthetic**). Finally we specify the plot type (the **layer**): `geom_point`.\n\nTo keep changing the plot, just keep adding things. You can add a regression line with a `stat_smooth` layer:","dca0ca49":"# Exercises\n\nFor the following exercises, try forking and running this notebook, and then reproducing the charts that follows.","a7077a70":"## The grammar of graphics\n\nOur starting point is a simple scatter plot:","ad77e2cb":"And so on.\n\nFor a list of functions provided by `plotnine`, see the library's well-stocked [API Reference](https:\/\/plotnine.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/api.html).","e532ce09":"Notice how every mutation of the plot requires adding one more thing, and how that one thing goes to the same place every time (we just add it on). With a little bit of knowledge about what the valid functions in `plotnine` are, every change we need to make is *obvious*. And this sense of \"obviousness\" is what the library is all about!\n\nFaceting is a really good example of this in action. Using `plotnine`, once we realize we need faceting we can add it in right away&mdash;just append a `facet_wrap` to the end. Using `seaborn`, we would have to change our whole approach: we need to compute a properly parameterized `FacetGrid`, insert that *before* our plotting code, and (potentially) rewrite our plotting function so that it \"fits\" inside of `FacetGrid`.\n\nMoverover, modifying your output is as simple as adding one more method to the chain. Since each modification we make is independent, we can make those changes anywhere.\n\nFor example, in all of the plots thus far we have had the chart aesthetic (`aes`) appear as a separate functional element; however, `aes` can also appear as a *layer* parameter:","95e1febb":"To apply faceting, use `facet_wrap`."}}
