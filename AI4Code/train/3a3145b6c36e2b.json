Many higher priced phones have more than 2M active pixels as compared to the other categories which would mean that they either have a large screen size or a better resolution.\n2. In the low cost category there are a few phones with less battery life and very high talktime. These could be the older mobile phones with keypad.\n3. As intuition suggests a few the higher priced phones have it all, more pixels, large battery size, a longer talktime and of course a higher price.","eaeaa513":"Training the model on the whole training set."}}
