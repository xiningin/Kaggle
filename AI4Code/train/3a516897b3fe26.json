It looks like for bankrupt companies, liability can predict profitability better than for surviving companies (R-squared is 35.1% versus 6.9%). \n\nThis raises several interesting hypothesis regarding the nature of bankrupt companies. My first thought is how company's interest baring debt may play a role in the company state's of survival. (i.e: Bankrupt companies may have liability with higher interest than surviving companies, which hurts their profitability). Another hypothesis is where company spend their revenue (i.e: Bankrupt companies may spend all their revenue paying back debt instead of investments to increase profitability). These hypothesis need to be validated using business knowledge, not just statistical models, so I'll end the notebook here and leave the question open for anyone interested. ","d07dcdcb":"We can see from above that we need roughly 50 components to explain 95% of the data variance. However, the first 3 components already explain nearly 25% of the variances. \n\nOff the back of this notebook, I've tried visualise the dataset with 8 components and 3 components. I noticed that if only using 3 components, I can intereprete the data quite well using my business knowledge already, though the total variance is not as high as 8. The 3 components extracted do not share any dominant features, while it also have strong internal consistency and is closely related to existing business\/ finance concepts. \n\nI'll demonstrate how the data can be visualised with 3 components and write some brief business interpretation of each components below.
