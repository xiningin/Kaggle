The growth starts exponentially, but must slow down after some point called the **inflection point**. The inflection point is essentially the midpoint of the spread. We will model the number of confirmed cases using a logistic curve. Let's look at the equation for such a curve, the differential equation for which this curve is a solution, and the graph of the curve.\n\n###Logistic Curve Graph\n\n![Log Curve Graph by 3Blue1Brown](https:\/\/resus.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2C034D87-1EDF-4EC9-9BDE-F3D7475950B0-1024x572.png)\n\n###Logistic Function\n\nA **logistic function** or **logistic curve** is an equation of the form: ![LogisticFunction](https:\/\/andymath.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Logistic-Function.jpg)\nWhere\n\n* x_0 = the inflection point,\n* N = the curve's maximum value, and\n* k = growth rate or steepness of the curve.\n\nFor reference: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Logistic_function.\nActually, the logistic function is just a solution for the following first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation called the Logistic Differential Equation\n![General form of the logistic equiaton in the general form](https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/56ea9da1d67a28910d8550db9f54255e70b75714)\n\nFrom the differential equation, stability of solutions and equilibria can be explored. However, this may not be directly helpful in predicting confirmed cases, so let's keep things simple for now and just look at the growth metrics.","df3c7866":"Please watch the following 9-minute video on exponential growth and the spread of disease...https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg\n\nThe versions before Version 16 explored Savitzky\u2013Golay filter (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Lissage_sg3_anim.gif) for smoothing data however it seems that that filter is too good at retaining the original trends in data. So here we change to a different smoothing technique.\n\n**Disclaimer**: This notebook demonstrates a very simple mathematical model, a differential equation called the logistic equation which is a special case of the Bernoulli equation. The purpose of this notebook was to illustrate mathematical modeling with simple ordinary differential equations to my introductory mathematical modeling class. I am not a health expert, this notebook should not be taken too seriously.","1d52eae3":"<h2>Setting up<\/h2>","5d8b9931":"<h2>Covid-19 Growth Factor by Country<\/h2>","56b3aaa6":"## Explanation of the maths\n\nNow that we have seen the math, let's explore the following growth metrics for the confirmed cases for each country:\n* Growth Factor\n* Growth Ratio\n* Growth Rate\n* 2nd Derivative\n\nThe **growth factor** on day N is the number of confirmed cases on day N minus confirmed cases on day N-1 divided by the number of confirmed cases on day N-1 minus confirmed cases on day N-2.\n\nThe **growth ratio** on day N is the number of confirmed cases on day N divided by the number of confirmed cases on day N-1.\n\nThe **growth rate** is simply the first derivative.\n\nWe will use these growth metrics to gain insight into which countries may have already hit their inflection points. For example, if a country's growth factor has stabilized around 1.0 then this can be a sign that that country has reached it's inflection point. We will then use curve fitting to fit a logistic curve (similar to the one above) to the number of confirmed cases for each country. This may help us predict if a country has hit their inflection point, and therefore when they will reach a possible maximum number of confirmed cases.\n\n**The growth factor tells us the curvature of the data.** If we take our data and take the 2nd derivative, basically all it is telling us is whether the cases are growing at an accelerating or decelerating rate. From calculus you may remember we use the 2nd derivative test to test for concavity and find saddle points. The inflection point is where the curve changes concavity. We can look at these growth metrics\n\nThe bigger picture will be to correlate this with preventative efforts such as quarentines, closing of schools, etc. It will also be interesting to see growth factor as a feature in a ML model.\n\n\u2014\n\nWork in process, initially forked from [dferhadi](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dferhadi\/covid-19-predictions-growth-factor-and-calculus)","a84aa84f":"<h2>Defintions<\/h2>","e00a44d7":"Defining Classes and functions","008ca348":"# Descriptive and predictive analysis on COVID-19 using Growth Factor","18e16b09":"<h2>Viz<\/h2>","b13875e5":"# The Analysis"}}
