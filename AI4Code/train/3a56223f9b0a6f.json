from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's \n        Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.\n\n        The Haberman\u2019s survival data set contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at University of\n        Chicago\u2019s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.\n\n\nAttribute Information--\n\n        Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)\n        Patient\u2019s year of operation (year\u200a\u2014\u200a1900, numerical)\n        Number of positive auxillary nodes detected (numerical)\n        Survival status (class attribute) 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer 2 = the patient died within 5 years\n\n        Setting the objective is the key in EDA which will structure your thoughts in the entire analysis.\n        Here the objective is to predict whether the patient will survive after 5 years or not based upon the patient\u2019s age,\n        year of treatment and the number of positive lymph nodes.\n\n\nDescription of Dataset--\n\n        Number of data points - 306\n        Number of variable - 4 (including the class label)\n\nVariables--\n    \n        age - Age of the patient at the time of operation\n        year - Year of the operation\n        nodes - Number of positive auxillary nodes\n        status - Survival Status of the patient\n\nReference--\n        Kaggle.com\n        1.https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Axillary_lymph_nodes \n
