However, while the actual label of 9 customers were 1, the classifier predicted those as 0, which is not very good. We can consider it as error of the model for first row.\n\nWhat about the customers with churn value 0? Lets look at the second row.\nIt looks like  there were 25 customers whom their churn value were 0. \n\nThe classifier correctly predicted 24 of them as 0, and one of them wrongly as 1. So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. A good thing about confusion matrix is that shows the model\u2019s ability to correctly predict or separate the classes.

In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.) artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks. However, when it comes to small-to-medium structured\/tabular data, decision tree based algorithms are considered best-in-class right now. Please see the chart below for the evolution of tree-based algorithms over the years.\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/875\/1*QJZ6W-Pck_W7RlIDwUIN9Q.jpeg\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\n## Why does XGBoost perform so well?\nXGBoost and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are both ensemble tree methods that apply the principle of boosting weak learners (CARTs generally) using the gradient descent architecture. However, XGBoost improves upon the base GBM framework through systems optimization and algorithmic enhancements.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/875\/1*FLshv-wVDfu-i54OqvZdHg.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">","34730227":"Based on the count of each section, we can calculate precision and recall of each label:\n\n-   **Precision** is a measure of the accuracy provided that a class label has been predicted. It is defined by: precision = TP\u00a0\/\u00a0(TP\u00a0+\u00a0FP)\n\n-   **Recall** is true positive rate. It is defined as: Recall = \u00a0TP\u00a0\/\u00a0(TP\u00a0+\u00a0FN)\n\nSo, we can calculate precision and recall of each class.\n\n**F1 score:**\nNow we are in the position to calculate the F1 scores for each label based on the precision and recall of that label. \n\nThe F1 score is the harmonic average of the\u00a0precision and recall, where an F1\u00a0score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0. It is a good way to show that a classifer has a good value for both recall and precision.\n\nAnd finally, we can tell the average accuracy for this classifier is the average of the F1-score for both labels, which is 0.77 in our case.\n\nFrom this we can see that XGBoost has improved our coutcome by 5% as compared to logistic regression.\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anmol4210\/customerchurnpredictionusinglogisticregression\"> Logistic Regression Notebook<\/a>","6751fc04":"## Train\/Test dataset"}}
