We mainly faced two types of issues doing that:\n\n1. The 'names' of restaurants repeated many time. For example, Mcdonalds, McDonald's and McDonalds were all same variables under the restaurant 'names' variable. It occured for many other restaurants, and i found it exhausting to run a loop in python to change the names. Instead, you can change it through the excel function of Find and Replace. \n\n2. After using GeoPandas for visualisation, as the plot suggest, some of the points are somewhere in Europe, Central America, or Asia. The Map for Burger King has a longer frame, because one of the lat and lon point is probably in Australia. One way to solve that is by limiting the ability of the code to output lattitudes or longitudes outside the points of mainland US.  \n\n\nDo leave a comment for questions, suggestions and feedback.
