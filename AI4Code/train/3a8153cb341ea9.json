RC and Brick are distant second\/ third place but occur quite frequently. Interestingly the association between ground type and damage grade differs quite significantly dependent on materials used for the ground. Materials Other and Timber are spread quite evenly across the grades, while brick\/ stone and mud are more often associated with the higher grades 4 and 5, RC is most commonly associated with the lower grades. These patterns indicate that this variable might have some predictive power.","a51e8ef7":"While the plot is very busy, there are certain clusters of 'vdcmun_id' which are associated with different grades.

There is also an option called not applicable, indicating that some buildings only have a ground floor, which might be worth creating a feature to extract. Beyond this the chart below shows that the timber based materials share a similar relationship with damage grade, it might be useful to group these up. RCC has a bigger association with the lower grades and N\/A provides a slight mix with grade 5 and 1 appearing the most often.

The test set will account for 20% of the observations, choosen at random but stratified around the target variable to ensure that the proportions are the same in the training and testing data. \n\nThe table below shows that this has been achieved and we cann see that the training and test dataframes have very similar proportions of observations for each damage grade.","d6dc5a94":"The plot below looks at the number of rooms a building had before and after the earthquake. \n\nFocusing on the left plot (before earthquake) it shows the distribution of rooms that building had. Across all grades the vast majority of buildings had between 1 and 4 rooms, there are however a number of outliers per grade in which there were as many as 9 rooms across all grades. We can see a bit of a pattern emerging, moving from grades 1 - 5, the core distribution of rooms appears to grow. Essentially building with more rooms pre earthquake tend to have a worse outcome assessment. This might be based on area, in proximity to the earthquakes epicentre or another reason entirely. \n\nFocussing on the right plot(after earthquake) we can see a pattern that higher damage grades equate to lower distribution of rooms than before. Lower damage grades tend to have a very similar distribution. In the following sections, a new feature could be interesting in which we extract the difference between these two variables.","ec1ff8d3":"<a id=\"section-five-subsection-two\"><\/a>\n### Data Processing Pipelines\n\nThis subsection is foccused on preparing the data to give the models the best opportunity of identifying the signal in the data.

The task is a multi-class supervised learning problem to predict the damage classification of buildings as a result of the Gorkha earthquake in April 2015. The earthquake in question was 7.8 in magnitude and occured near the Gorkha district of Gandaki Pradesh, Nepal. Almost 9,000 lives were lost, millions of people were instantly made homeless, and $10 billion in damages about half of Nepal's nominal GDP was incurred.\n\nThis analysis is applied to one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics. The target variable has 5 classes, labelled 'Grade 1':'Grade 5' which each represent the different scale of damage sustained to the building.\n\nThis notebook will explore the data and continue on to developing a predictive model, the general strucutre of work is as follows:\n\n* [Prepare Environment](#section-one)\n* [Data Reference](#section-two)\n* [Exploratory Analysis](#section-three)\n* [Feature Engineering](#section-four)\n* [Model Building](#section-five)\n    - [Split Data](#section-five-subsection-one)\n    - [Data Processing](#section-five-subsection-two)        \n    - [Cross Validation](#section-five-subsection-four)\n    - [Model Building & Comparison](#section-five-subsection-five)        \n* [Model Evaluation](#section-six)\n* [Conclusion](#section-seven)  ","51190ce5":"The spread of building between roof type and grade is quite similar for the types with Bamboo and timber.

The most common foundation is mortar, it is then a big jump down to bamboo as the next most popular option. The chart shows quite a change in the distribution of foundation types vs damage grade. Bambo and cement foundations tend to see an inverse relationship with grade, grade 1 is the most popular and this decreases as the grade classification increments. Mud mortar foundations have a very different relationship with damage grade in which it follows the proportions of the overal grade variable. Other and RC show a less consistent pattern with damage grade, which could be driven by the smaller sample size (especially for other). Visually this variable appears to have some degree of predictive power.","41024dc7":"With regards to the position of the building, there can be an attachment between 1 and 3 sides or no attachment at all. As with other features which have been explored, there is a dominate attribute amongst buildings or lack of in this case. 'Not attached' position accounts for almost 80% of buildings in the dataset. The association between position and damage grade of buildings differ less when compared with No attachment and buildings with an attachment on one-side. Buildings with 2 and 3 side attachments appear to have different patterns to the rest.","1488acb6":"The plot below shows the distribution of building heights before and after the earthquate by damage grade.

In all cases the frequency of grade is correlated with the label of the grade.","5b573274":"The output below shows that there are 110 vdcmun and 945 unique ward_id's in the dataset.

There is a radar plot for each grade with the height of the bar indicating which attributes were present the most frequently across all buildings. Buildings 4 & 5 (those which sustained the most damage), are almost all associated with the super structure mud, mortar and store. This super structure is present in grades 1 - 3 but to a much lower concentration. Grade 1, is the most spread with regards to super strucutres, aligning with timber and brick in fair amounts.","3d81db2a":"The output below shows the descriptive statistics about the numerical variables in our dataset. First thing to notice is that all the variables which have the 'has' prefix are binary variables. For the variables which aren't binary we can see that the mean and median values of the columns tend to be in a reasonable range indicating an absense of extreme values. Building age has a 8 year gap between the mean and median and we can see from the maximum value that the age is recorded as 999 years old. This is possible but potentially an outlier which might need to be addressed in later sections.","292ac399":"The two print outs below show that the number of variables by type and the type of the variables in the dataset.
