They have been maintaining a database of \"motor vehicle theft\" (sometimes referred to as grand theft auto) since last few years. This is the act of stealing, or attempting to steal, a car.\n\nDue to increasing crimes, they want to make use of data to strategize better to maintain peace and order in their State. As a part of their Analyst team, you have been posed with some questions given below. Use your gained Data Analysis skills to answer these questions and help of the Police Department!\nData Columns details:\n1. ID: a unique identifier for each observation.\n\n2. Date: the date the crime occurred.\nLocationDescription: the location where the crime occurred.\n\n3. Arrest: whether or not an arrest was made for the crime (TRUE if an arrest was made, and FALSE if an arrest was not made).\n\n4.

The community areas were devised in an attempt to create socially homogeneous regions.\n\n8. Year: the year in which the crime occurred.\nLatitude: the latitude of the location at which the crime occurred.","707b8317":"The general conclusion is from above graph is:\nfrom 2001 to 2012 , look like crime decreases\nIn between 2009 to 2011 , crime graph increase suddenly increases.","1e30ff04":"Top 5 location for motor vehicle thefts"}}
