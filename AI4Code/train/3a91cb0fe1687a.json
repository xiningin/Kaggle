If you enable URL auto tagging in Google AdWords, Google will append a unique ?gclid parameter on your destination URLs at run-time. Because it is a redirect, you won't see any gclid parameters on your ad words text ad destination url's, but it will show up in your Web server log files. Auto tagging was introduced in 2004 and is on by default in any Google AdWords accounts. \nThe gclid parameter enables data sharing between Google Analytics and Google AdWords. For example, the \"Traffic Sources\" feature in Google Analytics to segment your campaigns based on ad text and other PPC-related campaign metrics and dimensions, relies on gclid.\n\n* isVideoAd: If the Ad is a video (boolean)\n\n* page\t\n* slot","8de70c26":"There are 8 possible campaigns for paid searches:","7fcecfe1":"<h3> Organic<\/h3>\n\nOrganic refers to searchs performed in search mechanisms like Google and Baidu.
