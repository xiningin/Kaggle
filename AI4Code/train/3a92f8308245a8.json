It allows creators and artists to earn a monthly income by providing exclusive rewards and perks to their subscribers, or \"patrons\".\n\nPatreon is used by YouTube videographers, webcomic artists, writers, podcasters, musicians, adult content creators, and other categories of creators who post regularly online. It allows artists to receive funding directly from their fans, or patrons, on a recurring basis or per work of art. The company, started by musician Jack Conte and developer Sam Yam in 2013, is based in San Francisco.\n\nPatreon charges a commission of 5 to 12 percent of creators' monthly income, in addition to payment processing fees. Memberships are billed on the first of each month."}}
