I am aware of a lot of improvements that can me done to increase quality of the model, but right now I move on and revisit this project after I gain more knowledge in data science field. \n\n**This is the list of things that can be improved:**\n* I spent really little time on the improving the model. There are various methods I am aware of that can help with increasing quality of model's predictions. When I return to this project my goal will be to significantly extend this part of the project.\n\n* The salary shouldn't be represented in flat dollar value of the contract, but rather a percentage of the salary cap of the time  the specific contract takes. This makes predictions more right when the salary cap changes. Right now model undervalues more recent contracts, because the cap is increasing(at least until 2020\/2021 season)\n\n* Player stats should be represented with per game values rather than as totals. If the player was injured during the season before the contract was sign his predicted salary will be too low.\n\n* Stats could be taken from the last 3 seasons average instead of only  from the last season.\n\n* The data set is limited, doesn't include all players from last 10 seasons.","6ef90f3b":"The biggest impact on player salary have points and suprising free throws made and attempted. The least important are offensive rebound, three pointers made and personal fauls.","7b1a8118":"# Testing The Model","ec1463e2":"**Average Player Salary, By Age:**"}}
