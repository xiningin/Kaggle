","6c37337c":"#### The parametric method, also known as the variance-covariance method, is a risk management technique for calculating the VaR of a portfolio of assets.\n\nIt first identifies the mean, or expected value, and standard deviation of an investment portfolio. The parametric method looks at the price movements of investments over a look-back period and uses probability theory to compute a portfolio's maximum loss. The variance-covariance method for the value at risk calculates the standard deviation of price movements of an investment or security. Assuming stock price returns and volatility follow a normal distribution, the maximum loss within the specified confidence level is calculated.","4a8cb458":"Considering an investment of $100 in the portfolios A, B, C above for a year we will find the VaR:","5c5cd1c9":"# Sharpe Ratio\nThe ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. Volatility is a measure of the price fluctuations of an asset or portfolio.\nThe Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe and is used to help investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk.\nGenerally, the greater the value of the Sharpe ratio, the more attractive the risk-adjusted return.\n\nThe Formula for Share Ratio is given by:\n\n$$ \\textrm{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_p}$$ $\\textrm{where} R_p \\textrm{ is the return of the portfolio, } R_f \\textrm{ is the risk free rate of interest, and } \\sigma_p \\textrm{ is the volatility of the portfolio, } $","3ba67317":"One of the problems with Volatility being treated as a measure of risk is it is affected by movements in any direction.
