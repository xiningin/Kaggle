Observe that the QLattice has already done automatic feature selection because it is ignoring all the rest of the features. Let's evaluate it","5c5d81dc":"Not bad but it's overfitting a bit. Let's look at the mathematical formula","5521e957":"The auto run function is the quickest and most common way to interact with the QLattice. It will return the 10 best most diverse models for the dataset.","e0d15a99":"Next things to try:\n* Correlation analysis, maybe there's some redundancy in some of the features\n* It's overfitting a little bit so maybe reduce the complexity.\n* Have a closer look into why gender is important. Are males or females more likelt to suffer from a heart attack?","99a0373b":"# Feyn and a QLattice\n\nThe QLattice is a quantum simulator designed to find simple mathematical expressions to datasets. Feyn is the python library that interacts with it.\n\nHere we will use it to predict heart attack possibility.\n\nFirst install feyn","c511f83a":"# Community QLattice\n\nHere we will use a free community QLattice that is available for non-commercial use."}}
