Shows that the spending score is much more dependent on the age group and less on the income. A person in his\/her 20s and 30s has lesser responsibilities and dependencies and hence is able to spend more! So our marketing strategies should not try to categorise clients based on their income but rather their age group! Lets dig deeper and verify our results using ML!","a4b1bbc1":"As age increases, their spending score decreases! We need our marketing strategies to intice the younger groups as they try to spend more. But wait, isn't it so that as one ages, their income increases and so maybe they would be more inclined to buy more stuff!? Lets see that too! First lets check if their is some distinction in spending patterns among genders.","b53fdb7f":"Shows that age group 20-40 are much higher spenders as compared to older age groups.","615f445f":"Hardly any distinction among genders, which should be true as well!

Sounds interesting. Lets dig in and verify."}}
