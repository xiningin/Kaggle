Mini-batches are subsets of the input data, randomly sampled in each training iteration. These mini-batches drastically reduce the amount of computation required to converge to a local solution. In contrast to other algorithms that reduce the convergence time of k-means, mini-batch k-means produces results that are generally only slightly worse than the standard algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm iterates between two major steps, similar to vanilla k-means. In the first step,  samples are drawn randomly from the dataset, to form a mini-batch. These are then assigned to the nearest centroid. In the second step, the centroids are updated. In contrast to k-means, this is done on a per-sample basis. For each sample in the mini-batch, the assigned centroid is updated by taking the streaming average of the sample and all previous samples assigned to that centroid. This has the effect of decreasing the rate of change for a centroid over time. These steps are performed until convergence or a predetermined number of iterations is reached.\n\nfonte: scikit-learn.org","bb3c98f7":"This example plots the ellipsoids obtained from a toy dataset (mixture of three Gaussians) fitted by the BayesianGaussianMixture class models with a Dirichlet distribution prior (weight_concentration_prior_type='dirichlet_distribution') and a Dirichlet process prior (weight_concentration_prior_type='dirichlet_process'). On each figure, we plot the results for three different values of the weight concentration prior.\n\nThe BayesianGaussianMixture class can adapt its number of mixture components automatically. The parameter weight_concentration_prior has a direct link with the resulting number of components with non-zero weights. Specifying a low value for the concentration prior will make the model put most of the weight on few components set the remaining components weights very close to zero. High values of the concentration prior will allow a larger number of components to be active in the mixture.\n\nfonte:scikit-learn.org","3a75847b":"The AgglomerativeClustering object performs a hierarchical clustering using a bottom up approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and clusters are successively merged together.

The key difference between DBSCAN and OPTICS is that the OPTICS algorithm builds a reachability graph, which assigns each sample both a reachability_ distance, and a spot within the cluster ordering_ attribute; these two attributes are assigned when the model is fitted, and are used to determine cluster membership. If OPTICS is run with the default value of inf set for max_eps, then DBSCAN style cluster extraction can be performed repeatedly in linear time for any given eps value using the cluster_optics_dbscan method. Setting max_eps to a lower value will result in shorter run times, and can be thought of as the maximum neighborhood radius from each point to find other potential reachable points.\n\nfonte: scikit-learn.org","58e55e3f":"MeanShift clustering aims to discover blobs in a smooth density of samples.

The data is essentially lossy compressed to a set of Clustering Feature nodes (CF Nodes). The CF Nodes have a number of subclusters called Clustering Feature subclusters (CF Subclusters) and these CF Subclusters located in the non-terminal CF Nodes can have CF Nodes as children.\n\nThe CF Subclusters hold the necessary information for clustering which prevents the need to hold the entire input data in memory. This information includes:\n\nNumber of samples in a subcluster.\n\nLinear Sum - A n-dimensional vector holding the sum of all samples\n\nSquared Sum - Sum of the squared L2 norm of all samples.\n\nCentroids - To avoid recalculation linear sum \/ n_samples.\n\nSquared norm of the centroids.\n\nThe Birch algorithm has two parameters, the threshold and the branching factor. The branching factor limits the number of subclusters in a node and the threshold limits the distance between the entering sample and the existing subclusters.\n\nThis algorithm can be viewed as an instance or data reduction method, since it reduces the input data to a set of subclusters which are obtained directly from the leaves of the CFT. This reduced data can be further processed by feeding it into a global clusterer. This global clusterer can be set by n_clusters. If n_clusters is set to None, the subclusters from the leaves are directly read off, otherwise a global clustering step labels these subclusters into global clusters (labels) and the samples are mapped to the global label of the nearest subcluster.\n\nfonte: scikit-learn.org","4f6ba20c":"The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares (see below).

Due to this rather generic view, clusters found by DBSCAN can be any shape, as opposed to k-means which assumes that clusters are convex shaped. The central component to the DBSCAN is the concept of core samples, which are samples that are in areas of high density. A cluster is therefore a set of core samples, each close to each other (measured by some distance measure) and a set of non-core samples that are close to a core sample (but are not themselves core samples). There are two parameters to the algorithm, min_samples and eps, which define formally what we mean when we say dense. Higher min_samples or lower eps indicate higher density necessary to form a cluster.\n\nMore formally, we define a core sample as being a sample in the dataset such that there exist min_samples other samples within a distance of eps, which are defined as neighbors of the core sample. This tells us that the core sample is in a dense area of the vector space. A cluster is a set of core samples that can be built by recursively taking a core sample, finding all of its neighbors that are core samples, finding all of their neighbors that are core samples, and so on. A cluster also has a set of non-core samples, which are samples that are neighbors of a core sample in the cluster but are not themselves core samples. Intuitively, these samples are on the fringes of a cluster.\n\nAny core sample is part of a cluster, by definition. Any sample that is not a core sample, and is at least eps in distance from any core sample, is considered an outlier by the algorithm.\n\nWhile the parameter min_samples primarily controls how tolerant the algorithm is towards noise (on noisy and large data sets it may be desirable to increase this parameter), the parameter eps is crucial to choose appropriately for the data set and distance function and usually cannot be left at the default value. It controls the local neighborhood of the points. When chosen too small, most data will not be clustered at all (and labeled as -1 for \u201cnoise\u201d). When chosen too large, it causes close clusters to be merged into one cluster, and eventually the entire data set to be returned as a single cluster. Some heuristics for choosing this parameter have been discussed in the literature, for example based on a knee in the nearest neighbor distances plot.\n\nfonte:scikit-learn.org"}}
