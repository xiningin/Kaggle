It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector\/raster\/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.\n\nThe library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys. folium supports both Image, Video, GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays.\n\nThis information from https:\/\/python-visualization.github.io\/folium\/","5fe5a39e":"I hope will present the time series changing of the number of passenger for each stations using animation."}}
