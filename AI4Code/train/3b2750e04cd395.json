Before diving deeper into any dataset, it is crucial to understand it from a sanity perspective. In this case, the primary data is being publicly shared by the Government of India: https:\/\/www.mohfw.gov.in\/ and is being maintained voluntarily by some amazing Kagglers [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sudalairajkumar\/covid19-in-india).\n\nWhile we must trust that the numbers shared by the government are their best efforts of providing correct data, can we at least perform some basic checks to see if the data is valid as per expectations. Is the data being updated regularly or daily? Are there some lags in publishing the data since even the government would be scrambling to compile this dataset from multiple sources across the country? Is the data clean enough to analyze trends and create features for deeper study?\n","5c630270":"## April-24: Beds\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HuPNgod.jpg)\n\nProximity to hospitals and health centres are one dimension to look at in terms of access to resources in case someone experiences Covid-19 symptoms.

These look fairly distributed, right?   \nAt least at a state macro-level it doesn't seem to be particularly causing any effect on the spread of Covid-19. Not sure if that is a positive or negative.\n\nIt might be worth exploring the same at a more granular geography like city since some of the recent outbreaks in India have come from populated and dense cities like Delhi, Mumbai.
