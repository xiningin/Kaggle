We observe that somebody who studies to become a Physician Assistant earns the highest mean starting salary, at 74,000 USD, while somebody studying Spanish earns the lowest mean starting salary, at 34,000 USD.\n\nNow lets look into mid-career salaries for each major and create another visualization:","8e46e11c":"First, we will import some libraries:","881ea512":"Next, we will import the data and preview it to see what's inside:","f2b3ddda":"In summation, it is important to notice that while some majors may have high starting salaries, they may not grow a whole lot as time goes on. On the flip side, some majors have relatively low starting salaries, but end up experiencing high earnings growth rates and, in some cases, surpass earnings of other majors when measured mid-career.\n\nThese observations are important to take into consideration when deciding on a major worth pursuing. Some people may prefer to earn more money earlier on, but experience less growth, while others may be willing to take a lower starting salary, if it means huge salary growth potential over the span of their careers.","9ca91253":"Looking at the chart above, we are now able to see the differences between various majors' mean starting and mid-career salaries. It is evident that while some majors started out with high mean salaries, they maye have later been overtaken by other majors when compared at the mid-career point.\n\nLet's make another chart to visualize percent salary growth from starting to mid-career for each major:","4c66f038":"Looking at the mean mid-career salaries earned by each major was useful, but the dataset also included mid-career salaries for various percentiles. Let's make a scatter plot to understand this distribution.\n\nLike before, the main DataFrame is not quite in a format suitable for plotting multiple data series on one chart, so we will need to make a new subset DataFrame for our usage. This new subset DataFrame will contain major, salary, and a classifier column indicating what percentile each salary figure belongs to.","052b7cba":"# College Major and Salary Outcome Analysis - Kaggle","b71122e6":"Looking at the chart above, we now have a better understanding of what each major makes for a mid-career salary. We observe that somebody who studies Chemical Engineering earns the highest mean mid-career salary at 107,000 USD, while somebody who studies either Education or Religion earns the lowest mean mid-career salary, at 52,000 USD.\n\nAfter oberving and comparing the charts for starting and mid-career salaries, we notice that the rankings have changed. Some majors have moved up or down in the rankings for their respective salaries. Let's plot both the starting and mid-career salaries on the same chart to better visualize the differences. As such, this will require creating a grouped-bar plot.","710f605d":"Looking at the chart above, we can see the distribution of mid-career salaries for each major. Some majors tend to have relatively wide distributions, with top performers earning well into the six-figures, while others have narrower distributions that are concentrated in the five-figure salary range.","1c46589f":"Here are some insights we can draw:\n\n    a. The mean starting salary for all graduates regardless of major is 44,310 USD.\n    \n    b.
