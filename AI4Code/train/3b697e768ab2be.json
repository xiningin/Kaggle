We'll need to deal with visualization, load up a language model, and of course, examine\/set-up our data source.\n\n### Show and Tell\nOur prototype will lean heavily on a popular natural langauge processing (NLP) library known as spaCy, which also has a wonderful set of classes and methods defined to help visualize parts of the NLP pipeline. Up top, where we've imported modules, you'll have noticed that we're pulling 'EntityRenderer' from spaCy's displacy module, as we'll be repurposing some of this code for our... um... purposes. In general, this is a good exercise if you ever want to get your hands dirty and really learn how certain classes work in your friendly neighborhood open-source projects. Nothing should ever be off-limits or a black box; always dissect and play with your code before you eat it.  \n\nWander on over to spaCy's [website](https:\/\/spacy.io\/), and you'll quickly discover that they've put in some serious thought into making the user interface absolutely gorgeous. (While Matthew undeniably had some input on this, I'm going to make an intelligent assumption that the design ideas are probably Ines' [contribution](https:\/\/explosion.ai\/about)). \n\n<em><strong>&lt;rant&gt;<\/strong> Why spend so much time discussing visualization? Well, one of my biggest pet peeves is this: even if you can create a product, if you don't put in the time to make it look beautiful, or delightful to use, then you don't care about packaging your ideas for export to an audience. And that makes me sad. Once you get something working, make it pretty. <strong>&lt;\/rant&gt;<\/strong><\/em>","75778283":"Let's say our goal was to create a natural language system that effectively allowed someone to converse with an academic paper. This task could be step one of many towards the development of an automated scientific discovery tool. Society can thank us later. \n\nBut where do we begin? Well, a part of the solution has to deal with [knowledge extraction](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knowledge_extraction). In order to create a conversational engine that understands scientific papers, we'll first need to develop an entity recognition module, and this, lucky for us, is the topic of our notebook! \n\n\"What's an entity?\" you ask? Excellent question. Take a look at the following sentence:","4fc63b7d":"For our conversational academic paper program, we won't be satisfied with simply capturing named entities, because we need to understand the relationships between general concepts as well as actual things, places, etc. Unfortunately, while most out-of-the-box text processing libraries have a moderately useful <strong>named entity recognizer<\/strong>, they have little to no support for a generalized <strong>entity recognizer<\/strong>. \n\nThis is because of a subtle, yet important constraint. \n\nEntities, as we've discussed, correspond to a superset of named entities, which <strong><em>should<\/em><\/strong> make them easier to extract. Indeed, blindly pulling all entities from a text source is in fact simple, but it's sadly not all that useful. In order to justify this exercise, we'd need to develop an entity extraction approach that is restricted to, or is cognizant of, some particular domain, for example, neuroscience, psychology, computer science, economics, etc. This paradoxical complexity makes it nontrivial to create a generic, but useful, entity recognizer. Hence the lack of support in most open-source libraries that deal with natural language processing. \n\nTo largely simplify our task then, we must generate a set of entities from a scientific paper, that is <strong><em>larger<\/em><\/strong> than a simple list of named entities, but <strong><em>smaller<\/em><\/strong> than the giant list of all entities, restricted to the domain of a particular paper in question. \n\nYikes. Are you sweating a little? Because I am. \n\nInstead of reaching for some Ibuprofen and deep learning pills, let's make a prototype using a little ingenuity, simple open-source code, and a lot of heuristics. Hopefully, through this process, we'll also learn a bit about the text processing pipeline that brings understanding natural language into the realm of the possible.

In addition to this granular processing, we'll also want to remove words that are frequent in the English language, as a heuristic to naturally drop stop words and uncover the domain of each academic source. \n\nWhy is this?\n\nWell, in NLP, as in search engine optimization (SEO), the most common words in a given corpus are known as [stop words](https:\/\/nlp.stanford.edu\/IR-book\/html\/htmledition\/dropping-common-terms-stop-words-1.html). These unfortunate candidates are hunted down with extreme prejudice and removed from the population to improve search results, enhance semantic analysis, and in our case, help restrict the domain. This is because removing stop words automatically limits the vocabulary of a corpus to the words that are less frequent and therefore, more likely to exist in that abstract than anywhere else. \n\nYou can, of course, argue that the most common words in a scientific paper might in fact be the most important concepts, but stop words are usually overwhelmingingly overrepresented in any corpus. This intuition however, is exactly why we aren't going to simply take the most common words in one specific abstract and remove them. Instead, we'll be targetting the most frequent words based on a large, general domain sample of the English language. \n\nThe \"freq_words.csv\" file you might have noticed earlier in our data environment, is actually a list generated from a corpus with 10 billion words gathered by the good people at [Word Frequencey Data](https:\/\/www.wordfrequency.info\/).\n\nLet's take a look at the list and then remove these words from our set of entities. ","4c7c451f":"### Analysis","3795bc3e":"A quick glance at some of the abstracts shows that while we are able to extract numeric entities, not much else comes through. Not great. But then again, this is exactly why simply extracting named entities is not enough. On the plus side, our intuition about built-in models and scientific text was spot on! The spaCy named entity recognizer just wasn't exposed to this category of corpora and was instead trained on [blogs, news, and comments](https:\/\/spacy.io\/models\/en#en_core_web_lg). Academic papers don't use the most common English words, so it isn't unreasonable to expect a generally trained model to fail when confronted with text in such a restricted domain.   \n\nLook at a few more abstracts by changing the index parameter in our \"render_entities\" function to convince yourself of the following notion:\n\nWe need to widen our search. ","a5fcf5f5":"These words and\/or phrases are categorized as \"entities\" because they represent salient ideas, nouns, and noun phrases in the real world. A subset of entities can be \"named\", in that they correspond to <strong><em>specific<\/em><\/strong> places, people, organizations, and so on. A [named entity](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Named_entity) is to a regular entity, what \"Dr. Abraham\" is to a \"physician\". The good doctor is a real person and an instance of the \"physician\" class, and is therefore considered \"named\". Examples of named entities include \"Google\", \"Neil DeGrasse Tyson\", and \"Tokyo\", while regular, garden-variety entities can include the list just mentioned, as well as things like \"dog\", \"newspaper\", \"task\", etc.\n\nLet's see if we can get a computer to run this kind of analysis to pull important concepts from sentences. ","2482e5ed":"### Back to School","d3540193":"Just gorgeous. Following our pipeline, let's use this dependency tree to tease out the noun phrases in our dummy sentence. We'll have to create a few functions to do the heavy lifting first (we can reuse these guys for our full dataset later), and then use a simple procedure to visualize our example.","885cc579":"### Analysis","c134cf31":"Keep in mind that this exercise wasn't to create the world's best entity extractor. It was to get a fast baseline for what we can do with limited knowledge about the domain, and limited use of deep learning superpowers. We've now ended up with a prototype that shows we can get relatively far using out-of-the-box methods, with minor scripting for customization. And the best part? Our approach didn't require any extensive compute or proprietary software! \n\nGoing forward, we'd want to test our approach on larger data sets (perhaps full scientific papers), and create an easy-to-use API for visualization, as well as individual and batch processing of text sources. Improving the actual entity extraction itself might involve a <strong>language model trained on academic papers<\/strong> or the addition of <strong>other intelligent heuristics<\/strong>. At some point, we'd also want to link each entity to an external database with further information, so that our conversational academic paper program would be able to orient these concepts within a larger knowledge graph. \n\nAt the end of all of this, we've built a fast entity extraction prototype that confidently moves us towards creating an engine to communicate with academic papers, which will (hopefully) set the foundation for an automated scientific discovery tool.\n\nGreat work!

The <strong>noun phrase<\/strong> or <strong>chunk<\/strong> is an abstraction which consists of two or more words, and is the by-product of dependency parsing, POS tagging, and tokenization. spaCy's POS tagger is essentially a statistical model which learns to predict the tag (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for a given word using examples of tagged-sentences. \n\nThis supervised machine learning approach relies on tokens generated from splitting text into somewhat atomic units using a rule-based tokenizer (although there are some interesting [unsupervised models](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/sentencepiece) out there as well). Dependency parsing then uncovers relationships between these tagged tokens, allowing us to finally extract noun chunks or phrases of relevance. \n\nThe full pipeline goes something like this: \n\n<strong>raw text<\/strong> &rarr; <strong>tokenization &rarr; <\/strong> <strong>POS tagging<\/strong> &rarr; <strong>dependency parsing<\/strong> &rarr; <strong>noun chunk extraction<\/strong>\n\nTheoretically, one could swap out noun chunk extraction for named entity recognition, but that's the part of the pipeline we are attempting to modify for our own purposes, because we want n-length entities. Barring our custom intrusion, however, this is exactly how spaCy's built-in model works! If you don't believe me (which you shouldn't, since you're a scientist), scroll up to the very top of this notebook to convince yourself. ","a73d5536":"In this step, we're just combining the named entities extracted using spaCy's built-in model with nouns identified by the part-of-speech or POS tagger. We're dropping any numeric entities for now because they are harder to deal with and don't really represent new concepts. You'll notice (if you look closely enough), that we are also ignoring any hyphenated entities. In spaCy's tokenizer, it is possible to prevent hyphenated words form being split apart, but we'll reserve this, along with other types of advanced fine-tuning or low-level editing to if and when we move beyond the prototype phase. \n\nSo far, in the past few steps, we've deal with one-word entities. However, it's also entirely permissible for combinations of two or more words to represent a single concept. This means that in order for our prototype to successfully capture the most relevant concepts, we'll need to pull n-length phrases from our academic abstracts in addition to single word entities. ","ac121507":"That's a good looking list of concepts wouldn't you say? By removing stop words and fine-tuning our set, we were able to capture only the most important entities in this first abstract!
