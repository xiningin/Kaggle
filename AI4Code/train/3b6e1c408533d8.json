Still showing a steady increase in reported cases up to the 23rd of February when the numbers of new infections stopped increasing in huge numbers daily.\nThis is most likely due to the possibility that although a CoV-2 infection can lead to fatal complications, people can be unawear of a CoV-2 infection, spreading the virus unknowingly.

This notebook is not meant to give any medical advice, predict the further spread of the Coronavirus or evaluate any measures taken by the local governements. It is a work in progress (**WIP**).\n\nBackground Knowledge:\n\nThe current outbreak from 2019\/2020 is caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (**SARS-CoV-2**). [Link to Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2)\n\nThe virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus from the family of Coronaviridae. The name comes from the ,,envelope\" structure formed by the SEM proteins looking under a microscope like a crown (corona). \nIn November 2019 supposedly the virus migrated from an animal and infected a human in Wuhan, China where the animal was sold on a food marked. Up to now it is not clear what kind of animal was the carrier of the virus. During the following month the virus spread from China to more than 80 countries around the globe. \nFew facts are known about the transmission, the symptoms and the sevierity of the infection. But the american CDC states that it is transmitted by water droplets spread by the infected patients while sneezing an coughing and therefore is not airborne. In human it infects mostly the upper resperatory systems but can as well lead do severe cases up to the death of the patient. \n","7e1022e3":"# SARS-CoV-2 infection numbers for Germany","ef0fb0d3":"Over time the fatality ration for Germany is increasing. This is expected, because more infections are reported und the fatalities after a COVID19 infection increase simultaniously. This graph above can **NOT** really tell how deadly the SARS-CoV-2 virus is. The total numbers can be calculated after the first wave of the outbreak or a total immunisation of the human population. In general experts talked about a fatality rate between 1 and 3% initially. But even experts say every day, that they learn something new about this Virus and the illness coming with it. "}}
