As such, finding mistakes made by the organizers are rewarded more than building a solution that generalizes to other data. We therefore provide a solution in this notebook that should be deemed as a lot \"better\" than our current solution to the organizers. It is competely useless, will not work on any types of other data, but hey, it scores better on the private LB! And isn't that all that matters?\n\n**This notebook, that uses Chris his cleaned data, would get you a second place on the leaderboard!**"}}
