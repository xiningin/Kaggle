A vector is a 1-dimensional tensor, a matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor, an array with three indices is a 3-dimensional tensor (RGB color images for example). The fundamental data structure for neural networks are tensors and PyTorch (as well as pretty much every other deep learning framework) is built around tensors.\n\n![Tensor](https:\/\/github.com\/udacity\/deep-learning-v2-pytorch\/raw\/master\/intro-to-pytorch\/assets\/tensor_examples.svg)\n\nWith the basics covered, it's time to explore how we can use PyTorch to build a simple neural network.","c49e6567":"You can do the multiplication and sum in the same operation using a matrix multiplication. In general, you'll want to use matrix multiplications since they are more efficient and accelerated using modern libraries and high-performance computing on GPUs.\n\nHere, we want to do a matrix multiplication of the features and the weights. For this we can use [`torch.mm()`](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/torch.html#torch.mm) or [`torch.matmul()`](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/torch.html#torch.matmul) which is somewhat more complicated and supports broadcasting. If we try to do it with `features` and `weights` as they are, we'll get an error\n\n```python\n>> torch.mm(features, weights)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-13-15d592eb5279> in <module>()\n----> 1 torch.mm(features, weights)\n\nRuntimeError: size mismatch, m1: [1 x 5], m2: [1 x 5] at \/Users\/soumith\/minicondabuild3\/conda-bld\/pytorch_1524590658547\/work\/aten\/src\/TH\/generic\/THTensorMath.c:2033\n```\n\nAs you're building neural networks in any framework, you'll see this often. Really often. What's happening here is our tensors aren't the correct shapes to perform a matrix multiplication. Remember that for matrix multiplications, the number of columns in the first tensor must equal to the number of rows in the second column. Both `features` and `weights` have the same shape, `(1, 5)`. This means we need to change the shape of `weights` to get the matrix multiplication to work.\n\n**Note:** To see the shape of a tensor called `tensor`, use `tensor.shape`. If you're building neural networks, you'll be using this method often.\n\nThere are a few options here: [`weights.reshape()`](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.reshape), [`weights.resize_()`](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.resize_), and [`weights.view()`](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.view).\n\n* `weights.reshape(a, b)` will return a new tensor with the same data as `weights` with size `(a, b)` sometimes, and sometimes a clone, as in it copies the data to another part of memory.\n* `weights.resize_(a, b)` returns the same tensor with a different shape. However, if the new shape results in fewer elements than the original tensor, some elements will be removed from the tensor (but not from memory). If the new shape results in more elements than the original tensor, new elements will be uninitialized in memory. Here I should note that the underscore at the end of the method denotes that this method is performed **in-place**. Here is a great forum thread to [read more about in-place operations](https:\/\/discuss.pytorch.org\/t\/what-is-in-place-operation\/16244) in PyTorch.\n* `weights.view(a, b)` will return a new tensor with the same data as `weights` with size `(a, b)`.\n\nI usually use `.view()`, but any of the three methods will work for this. So, now we can reshape `weights` to have five rows and one column with something like `weights.view(5, 1)`.\n\n> ### **Exercise**: Calculate the output of our little network using matrix multiplication.","aafc456e":"### Stack them up!\n\nThat's how you can calculate the output for a single neuron. The real power of this algorithm happens when you start stacking these individual units into layers and stacks of layers, into a network of neurons. The output of one layer of neurons becomes the input for the next layer. With multiple input units and output units, we now need to express the weights as a matrix.\n\n![Multi-Layer](https:\/\/github.com\/udacity\/deep-learning-v2-pytorch\/raw\/master\/intro-to-pytorch\/assets\/multilayer_diagram_weights.png)\n\nThe first layer shown on the bottom here are the inputs, understandably called the **input layer**. The middle layer is called the **hidden layer**, and the final layer (on the right) is the **output layer**. We can express this network mathematically with matrices again and use matrix multiplication to get linear combinations for each unit in one operation. For example, the hidden layer ($h_1$ and $h_2$ here) can be calculated \n\n$$\n\\vec{h} = [h_1 \\, h_2] = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\, x_2 \\cdots \\, x_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\cdot \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n           w_{11} & w_{12} \\\\\n           w_{21} &w_{22} \\\\\n           \\vdots &\\vdots \\\\\n           w_{n1} &w_{n2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe output for this small network is found by treating the hidden layer as inputs for the output unit. The network output is expressed simply\n\n$$\ny =  f_2 \\! \\left(\\, f_1 \\! \\left(\\vec{x} \\, \\mathbf{W_1}\\right) \\mathbf{W_2} \\right)\n$$","b61d0956":"> Great!

This is all just random for now, going forward we'll start using normal data.

In general, you'll use PyTorch tensors pretty much the same way you'd use Numpy arrays. They come with some nice benefits though such as GPU acceleration which we'll get to later.

PyTorch in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you love from Numpy. These Numpy arrays, after all, are just tensors. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. It also provides a module that automatically calculates gradients (for backpropagation!) and another module specifically for building neural networks. All together, PyTorch ends up being more coherent with Python and the Numpy\/Scipy stack compared to TensorFlow and other frameworks.\n\n"}}
