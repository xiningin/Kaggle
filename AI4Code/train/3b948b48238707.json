Pakistan meets two-thirds of its energy requirement from fuel oil and natural gas. The share of renewables in Pakistan's energy mix is around 5% only. \nIn November 2019 the Government of Pakistan unveiled its new Renewable Energy Development Policy. The policy aims to increase the share of renewables in Pakistan's energy mix by 30%. Around 8,000MW cheap renewable clean and green energy will be added to the system by 2025 while it will be increased to 20,000MW by 2030.\nIn order to meet the goals stated in this policy, Pakistan will have to invest heavily in Solar and Wind energy plants. This will not be possible without Utility-Scale Soalr Projects. In this study we will try to determin the best places in Pakistan for setting up a solar Independent Power Plant (Solar IPP) which will provide better electricity output at optimized CAPEX.\n","ede7c6da":"Lets find the optimum K Value for the model by the elbow method","c3c5a3ba":"1.

Lets compare it with the IESCO grid station but bear in mind that this time the venue radius is 15 kms instead of 5 kms. ","eefeb1f7":"Excellent! The results give us the number of venues surrounding the grid location, and the distance of each venue from it\n6. Now lets do this for all Grid Nodes","008216f2":"UhOh! we dont have mean distances for Grid stations from 111 to 116 because they do not have any venues around them. So we are going to assign those nodes the highest mean distance value","64057c52":"We can observe that \n1. Cluster 0 has better mean PVOUT, low number of venues but lowest mean distance from venues.\n2. Cluster 1 has lowest mean PVOUT highest number of venues but median mean distances.\n3. Cluster 2 has highest mean PVOUT, lowest number of venues surrounding the grid stations and hgihest mean distances from the venues.","e7b41125":"All we have to do is get PVOUT values from df_s and assign them to the PVOUT column in df_f","74e0de86":"#### Problem:\nLike with all major utility scale projects, transmission cost and transmission losses are a major bottleneck in a project's feasibility. Pakistan's regions which receive very high Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) of above 6 kWh\/m2\/day are very distant from the national power grid. Which means developing a solar IPP in one of those regions will have huge transmission costs.\nIn order to overcome this problem I have decided to chose sites which are nearest to existing power stations.\nAnother major factor in developing a Solar IPP is the cost of Land. The nearer the IPP site is to a city or a major population center the higher will be the cost of land and there will also be difficulties in acquiring a single plot of land for the IPP.\n\n\n","895c32e7":"Now lets calculate the mean distance from venues for a single Grid Station say Rohri","dfd2b6ec":"Lets drop the categorical variables from the dataframe","b4feb187":"Now let's normalize the dataset. We use StandardScaler() to normalize our dataset.","3747bf47":"8. Now lets add the no of venues and mean distance from venues to our main dataframe PTN.\\\nAs we can see that the df_g which shows number of venues per grid station has only 107 rows. Which means the other 13 Grid station do not have any venues in 15 km radius. We will assign 0 to the remaining GS. Also no venues mean no mean distance from venues. For the sake of analysis, we will assign those nodes the max mean distance from the distance dataframe","30b044aa":"Now lets analyze the PVOUT values by plotting them against Latitude and Longitude to see how solar radiation varies accross the geography of the country","a739cfac":"As we can observe that the values of k after 3 has minimal impact on the distortion value, we will keep 3 numbers of clusters for the model.","dfb7fdc8":"5. Now lets view the Grid Locations on a map using Folium","26cc390c":"10. Now lets use K-means clustering to group these sites into cluster and observe the resulting clusters ","128463fe":"Also if we plot the Number of Venues against the Longitude, we can see that the number of locations and venues are more concentrated along the eastern half of Pakistan","c56a14a9":"#### Data: \nThe World Bank Group has worked extensively on Pakistan's electricity transmission grid data. A GEOJSON file listing all nodes in the national grid is available at their website https:\/\/energydata.info\/dataset\/pakistan-electricity-transmission-network-2017 I have used that data in this study. There are a lot of un-named entries in the data set which I cleaned to get the locations of the grid stations.\nThen I by using the Foursuare API I explored venues nearby the grid stations. The purpose was to explore how many venues are there within a range of 15 kms of the Grid Station and how what was the mean distance of those venues from the Grid locations. Greater the number of venues near a grid and smaller mean distance of those venues from the Grid Location would mean that the Grid station is in an urban area and land development costs would be much higher.\nFinally I use the Global Solar Atlas website https:\/\/globalsolaratlas.info\/map?c=30.637912,68.994141,5&r=PAK to get the Specific photovoltaic power output (PVOUT) values of the grid locations. This results in a dataframe with coordinates of all grid locations, their nearby venues count, mean distances from the venues and the Specific photovoltaic power output (PVOUT) values for each location. Now we can run the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster the grid nodes and label them to find out the most appropriate grid nodes for the development of a Solar IPP.","461b7ad1":"Now lets plot the custers on a map to see their locations","3e5d2de3":"Now we are going to assign the number 0 to all entries that are False","fc7b1e60":"4. Lets analyze the 'Node types'","7195edc6":"We can see from the map that the Grid Stations located in the densely populated cities of Pakistan have the greates venue clusters around them. Look at the dense red clusters around Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad!","b6c57697":"But locations aong the western boundry of Pakistan have higher PVOUT values. Meaning they receive more sunlight!","92b76ceb":"9. Now in the next step we would add the Specific Photovoltaic Power Output for these grid stations. Unfortunately there is no dataset available for these values so I had no choice but to make one by entering the coordinates of the grid stations one by one into Global Solar Atlas and getting their PVOUT values. You can also check out data related to solar radiation such as PVOUT, DNI and GHI values for your hometown by searching it.
