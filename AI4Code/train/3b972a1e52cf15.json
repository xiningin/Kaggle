Researchers in Mexico have created the VIGIA project, which aims to build a system for autonomous surveillance of protected areas. A first step in such an effort is the ability to recognize the vegetation inside the protected areas. In this competition, you are tasked with creation of an algorithm that can identify a specific type of cactus in aerial imagery.\n\nIn this kernel we will be trying to solve this challenge using CNN through **fast.ai library**\n\n![Fastailogo](https:\/\/images.ctfassets.net\/orgovvkppcys\/5EShj6ZsQFERrNd\/af53baa732ce18025c51c9268ffd037b\/image.png?w=648&q=100)","1a059202":"**Getting the Data. **\n[reference](https:\/\/docs.fast.ai\/vision.data.html)","f80baf5f":"**Analysing the given data**","b7dd0364":"**References**\n* https:\/\/docs.fast.ai\/\n* https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kenseitrg\/simple-fastai-exercise\n* https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/shahules\/getting-started-with-cnn-and-vgg16\n","4be150e8":"**Now training the data based on suitable learning rate**","f5915abc":"**Plotting the Learning Rate**","0c38a4e7":"**Loading necessary libraries**","bba8c0a1":"**Finding the suitable learning rate**","f2b68fd2":"**Training the data using appropriate model.
