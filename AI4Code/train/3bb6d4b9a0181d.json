Japan\n\nWe observe how Russian Federation and United States are present in every single\ncategory in one of the top three spot, swapping position only with Japan, another country to be\npresent in every single category at the top 3 apart from the 5-14 category where is\nin the lowest position. \nMexico and Brazil, appearing respectively twice and three times seems to cover the younger\nspectrum of the age category (15-24 \/ 5-14 for Mexico, 5-14 \/ 15-24 \/ 25-34 for Brazil) \nwith France and Germany, appearing both twice, covering the older spectrum. \nUkraine is the other European country appearing three times, covering 25-34 \/ 35-54 \/ 55-74 years of age.\n\n- Grouping by gender:\n\nAs mentioned before, the gender gap seems to be constant around 3 times more \nmale cases than female.\n\n- Grouping by generation:\n\nThe generation more affected by high suicide rate seems to be the Boomers, followed by\nthe Silent generation, the Generation X, Millenials and G.I. Generation\n\n- Grouping by country:\n\nAfter covering the 15 countries with the highest and lowest number of cases,\nwe observe how Russian Federation and United States cover the top 2 spots with \na quite big gap between them and the third spot (Japan).\nThe gender analysis seems to show the same result, with pretty much the same ratio.\nConsidering the years from 1990 to 1999, where we observe a steady growth in cases, I wanted to highlight the top 5 countries per suicides number. \nWe observe how Russian Federation is always at the first spot, followed by USA and Japan in almost every year.\nOnly the year 1998 and 1999 show Japan taking over USA. Ukraine and Germany complete the list appearing every year with very close numbers. We see France at the bottom of the list only in the year 1990 and 1991.\nSuch result about Russian Federation and United States is predictable because of the size of the two nations. \nBefore excluding this factor from our next analysis, I think was useful to highlight the relationship between population's growth and suicide number in the top 5 countries.\nAfter calculating the suicide number per 100k population ratio, we observe a completely different scenario, with Brazil and the United Kingdom at the first two position albeit with a huge gap.\n","37072a34":"# Data Analysis:","f2f8c474":"Grouping the main dataframe by year and sex:","a142f3bf":"After grouping by age and country and calculation the corresponding suicides number, we can focus on plotting per each age category, the top 5 countries:","13a084bf":"<a id='by_age'><\/a>","7296d5f3":"We proceed on grouping by 'country' and 'year', calculation the toal amount af suicides and population per each year.","da12bac2":"We proceed with calculationg the suicides\/100k population ratio and plotting the result on the 10 countries with the highest value:","59a32b2c":"Year with the maximum amount of suicides:","b6f9d647":"<a id='by_country'><\/a>"}}
