We will also look at the event_count ","ace0ce57":"In the game_session (title= 'Mushroom Sorter (Assessment)') displayed in the previous cell, we see that the player seems to take some time to understand what he\/she needs to do and fumbles around a little bit leading to a larger number of events. This explains why some assessments might end up having an unusually large event_count. \n\nIt is perhaps of some interest to note that the player first gave an incorrect answer and upon getting a system feedback tried to attempt again but then exited the session in the middle of their attempt or else this is an incomplete record of events in this game_session. ","24a4ac65":"We see that there are 3 game sessions associated to the installation_id '0006a69f' where they took the same assessment.  This actually gives us and idea: We can check how the scores of a particular installation_id improve as they take the same assessment again and again. For this we will need the time_stamp of each game session. ","4a00a8da":"By looking at the event codes of the above two cases and also for those with event_counts=5, 7 respectively, we find that event_code 3010 is associated with the start of a system-initiated instruction and event_code 3110 is associated with the end of that system-initiated instruction.

Since, as we saw earlier in the EDA for train_labels.csv, the same installation_id at times takes the same assessment in multiple game sessions, we will also use 'game_session' for merging TrainData and TrainLabels.
