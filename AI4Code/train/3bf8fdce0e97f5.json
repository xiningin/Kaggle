Since data science is fueled by data, it was essential to collect and digitize hundreds of notes of images of genuine and forged banknotes. Wavelets, a mathematical tool were used to extract information from many different kinds of data, including images. Wavelets were used to extract features from our images. Using K\u00acmeans clustering, we can organize the data into two clusters; one which contains the wavelets of the real bank notes and one that contains wavelets of fake bank notes, using this analysis we could determine an algorithm to detect fake notes based on wavelet data.\n","e156ec4d":"# References\nFoundations of Data Science : KMeans Clustering www.coursera.org\n","b94918a6":"The red one belongs to the Fake Notes while the green belongs to Genuine notes. The purple dots are the cluster centers.","22cc3d05":"\nThis example aims to detect fraudulent notes accurately. For that, a set of images taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens is created. Features such as wavelet variance, wavelet skewness, wavelet kurtosis, and image entropy are extracted from the images. The data file banknote_authentication.csv is the source of information for the classification problem. The number of instances (rows) in the data set is 1372, and the number of variables (columns) is 2.\n","5545771d":"# Fake or Genuine\nHence we can have 2 groups.\n"}}
