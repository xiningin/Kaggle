It is the error rate between the oberved labels and the predicted ones. We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the \"categorical_crossentropy\".\n\nThe most important function is the optimizer. This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss. \n\nI choosed RMSprop (with default values), it is a very effective optimizer. The RMSProp update adjusts the Adagrad method in a very simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.\nWe could also have used Stochastic Gradient Descent ('sgd') optimizer, but it is slower than RMSprop.\n\nThe metric function \"accuracy\" is used is to evaluate the performance our model.\nThis metric function is similar to the loss function, except that the results from the metric evaluation are not used when training the model (only for evaluation).","a910eb79":"## 3.3 Data augmentation ","8f555393":"Labels are 10 digits numbers from 0 to 9.

For RGB images, there is 3 channels, we would have reshaped 784px vectors to 28x28x3 3D matrices. ","69ff134e":"Confusion matrix can be very helpfull to see your model drawbacks.\n\nI plot the confusion matrix of the validation results.","81de4fb5":"I used the Keras Sequential API, where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\nThe first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important. \n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\nDropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting. \n\n'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network. \n\nThe Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional\/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end i used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier. In the last layer(Dense(10,activation=\"softmax\")) the net outputs distribution of probability of each class.","0735ba46":"The code below is for plotting loss and accuracy curves for training and validation.

We can make your existing dataset even larger. The idea is to alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations occuring when someone is writing a digit.\n\nFor example, the number is not centered \nThe scale is not the same (some who write with big\/small numbers)\nThe image is rotated...\n\nApproaches that alter the training data in ways that change the array representation while keeping the label the same are known as data augmentation techniques. Some popular augmentations people use are grayscales, horizontal flips, vertical flips, random crops, color jitters, translations, rotations, and much more. \n\nBy applying just a couple of these transformations to our training data, we can easily double or triple the number of training examples and create a very robust model."}}
