In this process a incident particle (photoelectron) collides with a target proton. The kinetic energy of the incident particle is not conserved after the collision. During inelastic scattering a proton can break up into its constituent quarks which then form a hadronic jet. The angles of the deflection gives information about the nature of the process.","7e20b931":"# Preprocessing\n## Removing null values","abeebc1e":"# Data Visualization","a17d9c93":"## SGDClassifier","11232716":"## AdaBoostClassifier","d56155c3":"# A brief introduction to particle physics \nThis dataset from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/naharrison\/particle-identification-from-detector-responses\/home is a simulation of electron-proton inelastic scattering measured by a particle detector system. \nIn order to analyse these data is necessary to recall some concepts.\n## The Standard Model\nThe building blocks of matter are elementary particles. These particles are divided in two major types: quarks and leptons. The Standard Model also studies the interaction of these particles through fundamental forces (strong, weak and electromagnetic).\nFor every type of particle there also exists a corresponding antiparticle.\n### Quarks\nQuarks are fundamental constituents of matter because they combine to form hadrons. There are six quarks paired in three groups: \"up\/down\", \"charm\/strange\" and \"top\/bottom\". They are held together through strong forces.\n#### Hadrons \nThey divide in Baryons and Mesons. Baryons are made of three quarks. For example **protons** are made of (uud) quarks and  neutrons are made of (udd) quarks.\nMesons contain one quark and one antiquark. An example of a meson is a **pion** which is made of an up quark and a down antiquark. Another example of a meson is **kaon**, it is formed by a up or down quark and a anti-strange quark.\n### Leptons\nLeptons have a 1\/2 spin and do not undergo strong interactions. There are six leptons, three of wich have an electrical charge. These are: electron, muon and tau. The three remaining are neutrinos. A **positron** is the antiparticle counterpart of an electron. It possess the same mass and spin but positive charge.\n\n "}}
