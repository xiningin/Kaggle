Unit of x-axis is 10$ as before. Just know that y-axis maximum is different for each graph.\n\nIn almost case of the first class, survival rate is higher. But, from 0$ to 29$, the death rate is higher. This result make me doubt that they were the same first classes. Definitely, they were the first class. I wonder what happened to them at that time.\n\nIn case of second class, it's pretty similar. The death rate from under 19$, the survival from rate over 20$ is higher.\n\nThe third class is tragedy. Almost passengers were dead. They were paid a similar fare as second class but it shows us the opposite result.\n\nJudging from that fact, if you had higher class and then paid higher fare, survival probability will be getting higher.

So, I grouped `Age` field by 3 age groups. `kid` (younger than 16), `adult` (between 16, 55), and `elder` (older than 55). I think standard of adult was younger than now so classify over 15 as `adult`. And other one is grouped as divide into ten.\n\nUnder below is grahs that show the survival rate that each grouped age group.\n\nObviously, kids were much more survived than adults while about 45% twenties were dead.\n\n---\n\n\ub098\uc774\ub294 0\uc138\ubd80\ud130 80\uc138\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 \ub098\uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc624\uc9c1 \ub450\uac00\uc9c0, \uc0b4\uac70\ub098 \uc8fd\uac70\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uadf8\ub7f0 \uc7ac\uc559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \ub204\uad6c\ub97c \uc0b4\ub9b4\uc9c0 \uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 1, 2\ub144\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc558\uc744\uac81\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c \uc0dd\uac01\uc5d0\ub294 \uc9c0\uae08 \ub098\uc774\ub97c \uc788\ub294 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294\uac74 \ubcc4\ub85c \uc88b\uc740 \uc0dd\uac01\uc740 \uc544\ub2cc \uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c, `Age` \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c 3\uac1c\uc758 \uc5f0\ub839\ub300 \ub098\ub220\ubd24\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. `kid` (16 \uc544\ub798), `adult` (16\uacfc 55 \uc0ac\uc774), and `elder` (55\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc74c). \uadf8\ub54c\ub294 \uc9c0\uae08\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5b4\ub978\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub9b4 \uac83\uc774\ub77c \uc0dd\uac01\ud574\uc11c 15\uc138 \uc704\ub85c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub978\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud558\ub098\ub294 10\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub220\uc11c \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc544\ub798\ub294 \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654\ud55c \ub098\uc774\ub300\uc758 \uc0dd\uc874\ub960\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ud655\uc2e4\ud788, \uc544\uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b4\ub978\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0dd\uc874\ud588\uace0 \ubc18\ub300\ub85c 20\ub300\ub4e4 \uc911 \uc57d 45%\ub294 \uc0ac\ub9dd\ud588\ub124\uc694.","561f5104":"Define a sigmoid function to use as activation function\n\n---\n\n\ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 sidmoid function \uc744 \uc120\uc5b8\ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.","bd599019":"There are 891 passengers and 12 features.\n\n---\n\n891\uba85\uc758 \uc2b9\uac1d\uacfc 12\uac1c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.","0eb98a60":"`SibSp` is number of siblings and spouse aboard the titanic and `Parch` is number of parents or children aboard the titanic.
