Type `client.` and then hit the tab key. Don't forget the period before hitting tab.","2ac40eed":"# Introduction\n\n[Stack Overflow](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/) is a widely beloved question and answer site for technical questions. You'll probably use it yourself as you keep using SQL (or any programming language). \n\nTheir data is publicly available. What cool things do you think it would be useful for?\n\nHere's one idea:\nYou could set up a service that identifies the Stack Overflow users who have demonstrated expertise with a specific technology by answering related questions about it, so someone could hire those experts for in-depth help.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll write the SQL queries that might serve as the foundation for this type of service.\n\nAs usual, run the following cell to set up our feedback system before moving on.","fc2af793":"### 3) Selecting the right questions\n\nA lot of this data is text. \n\nWe'll explore one last technique in this course which you can apply to this text.\n\nA **WHERE** clause can limit your results to rows with certain text using the **LIKE** feature. For example, to select just the third row of the `pets` table from the tutorial, we could use the query in the picture below.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/RccsXBr.png) \n\nYou can also use `%` as a \"wildcard\" for any number of characters. So you can also get the third row with:\n\n```\nquery = \"\"\"\n        SELECT * \n        FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets` \n        WHERE Name LIKE '%ipl%'\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nTry this yourself. Write a query that selects the `id`, `title` and `owner_user_id` columns from the `posts_questions` table. \n- Restrict the results to rows that contain the word \"bigquery\" in the `tags` column. \n- Include rows where there is other text in addition to the word \"bigquery\" (e.g., if a row has a tag \"bigquery-sql\", your results should include that too).","7eb5e8a1":"For a hint or the solution, uncomment the appropriate line below.","aa75b531":"### 2) Review relevant tables\n\nIf you are interested in people who answer questions on a given topic, the `posts_answers` table is a natural place to look.

But you want a list of users who have answered many questions... which requires more work beyond your previous result.\n\nWrite a new query that has a single row for each user who answered at least one question with a tag that includes the string \"bigquery\". Your results should have two columns:\n- `user_id` - contains the `owner_user_id` column from the `posts_answers` table\n- `number_of_answers` - contains the number of answers the user has written to \"bigquery\"-related questions","8630e87e":"Are there any fields that identify what topic or technology each question is about?
