Casting Types\n\nWe played around with printing and adding different python types together. Now we are going to focus on changing the types of variables i.e. \"casting\" a string to be an int and vice versa. \n\nTo change or \"cast\" the type of a variable or value in python we will be using the `str()` , `int()` , or `float()` functions.\n\nLet's try an example!
