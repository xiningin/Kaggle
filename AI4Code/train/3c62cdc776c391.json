Here, we prepare the test data by defining the category to which the customers belong.

Then, the classifier can be tested by comparing its predictions with these categories. In order to define the category to which the clients belong, I recall the instance of the `kmeans` method used in section 4. The` predict` method of this instance calculates the distance of the consumers from the centroids of the 11 client classes and the smallest distance will define the belonging to the different categories:","66650229":"and I output the result as wordclouds:","47c50822":"___\n## 4.

Conclusion\n\nThe work described in this notebook is based on a database providing details on purchases made on an E-commerce platform over a period of one year. Each entry in the dataset describes the purchase of a product, by a particular customer and at a given date. In total, approximately $\\sim$4000 clients appear in the database. Given the available information, I decided to develop a classifier that allows to anticipate the type of purchase that a customer will make, as well as the number of visits that he will make during a year, and this from its first visit to the E-commerce site.\n\nThe first stage of this work consisted in describing the different products sold by the site, which was the subject of a first classification. There, I grouped the different products into 5 main categories of goods. In a second step, I performed a classification of the customers by analyzing their consumption habits over a period of 10 months. I have classified clients into 11 major categories based on the type of products they usually buy, the number of visits they make and the amount they spent during the 10 months. Once these categories established, I finally trained several classifiers whose objective is to be able to classify consumers in one of these 11 categories and this from their first purchase. For this, the classifier is based on 5 variables which are:\n- ** mean **: amount of the basket of the current purchase\n- ** categ_N ** with $N \\in [0: 4]$: percentage spent in product category with index $N$\n\nFinally, the quality of the predictions of the different classifiers was tested over the last two months of the dataset. The data were then processed in two steps: first, all the data was considered (ober the 2 months) to define the category to which each client belongs, and then, the classifier predictions were compared with this category assignment. I then found that 75% of clients are awarded the right classes.\nThe performance of the classifier therefore seems correct given the potential shortcomings of the current model. In particular, a bias that has not been dealt with concerns the seasonality of purchases and the fact that purchasing habits will potentially depend on the time of year (for example, Christmas ). In practice, this seasonal effect may cause the categories defined over a 10-month period to be quite different from those extrapolated from the last two months. In order to correct such bias, it would be beneficial to have data that would cover a longer period of time.\n\n","ac2d9ff4":"We see that the quantity canceled is greater than the sum of the previous purchases.\n___\n#### 2.2.2 StockCode\n\nAbove, it has been seen that some values of the ** StockCode ** variable indicate a particular transaction (i.e. D for _Discount_).

In the case of matrices with binary encoding, the most suitable metric for the calculation of distances is the [Hamming's metric](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Distance_de_Hamming). Note that the **kmeans** method of sklearn uses a Euclidean distance that can be used, but it is not to the best choice in the case of categorical variables. However, in order to use the Hamming's metric, we need to use the [kmodes](https:\/\/pypi.python.org\/pypi\/kmodes\/) package which is not available on the current plateform.

Hence the model does not underfit the data.\n\n___\n### 5.2 Logistic Regression\n\nI now consider the logistic regression classifier.
