For stem cell bioprocessing, this includes the scale-up of stem cells to a differentiated end product of sufficient quality and quantity for clinical and commercial goals. The considerable cost with respect to consumables, labour and time as well as the inherent variability in manual processes not only make this an unattractive option but also render it commercially unviable. Automation and the use of an efficient bioprocess paradigm are imperative for the creation of successful clinical products.\n\nBioprocessing and commercialization of stem cell\/tissue-engineered products in regenerative medicine can translate breakthroughs from the research bench to the bedside of the patient. Though many of these tasks cannot be readily addressed and may require long-term commitment, some of the current challenges must remain the primary focus of our research and development. Process characterization and optimization is the key for any bioprocess start-up operation.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2659585\/","7d6dc569":"![](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2659585\/bin\/rsif20080442f01.jpg)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2659585\/"}}
