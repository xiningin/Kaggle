For example, we may transform the `points` column from its existing `int64` data type into a `float64` data type:","c107b4c7":"Or we could fill each missing value with the first non-null value that appears sometime after the given record in the database.

This section draws from the [Intro to data structures](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/dsintro.html) and [Working with missing data](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/missing_data.html) sections of the comprehensive official tutorial.","eb517108":"Replacing missing values is a common operation.  `pandas` provides a really handy method for this problem: `fillna`. `fillna` provides a few different strategies for mitigating such data. For example, we can simply replace each `NaN` with an `\"Unknown\"`:","288a9868":"`pandas` also supports more exotic data types: categorical data and timeseries data.

For technical reasons these `NaN` values are always of the `float64` dtype.\n\n`pandas` provides some methods specific to missing data. To select `NaN` entreis you can use `pd.isnull` (or its companion `pd.notnull`). This is meant to be used thusly:","0f324d2b":"`fillna` supports a few strategies for imputing missing values. For more on that read [the official function documentation](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html).\n\nAlternatively, we may have a non-null value that we would like to replace. For example, suppose that since this dataset was published, reviewer Kerin O'Keefe has changed her Twitter handle from `@kerinokeefe` to `@kerino`.
