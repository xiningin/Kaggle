We learned a little but more about this dataset through EDA and reinforced what we saw descriptively with some visualizations. \n\nFor example, we read that the mean IBU score was **42.7**, but when we look at the distribution of IBU, it looks like a bi-modal distribution. \n\nWe also learned that the most common beer style in this dataset is **American IPA**\n\nI hope to continue learning more ways to do data analysis in both R and python.

While I love R and the R programming language communiuty, it never hurts to learn something new! \n\nSo let's start by reading in some of the modules I will use:"}}
