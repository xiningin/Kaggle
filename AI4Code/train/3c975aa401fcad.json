01 August 2020\n\nTanzania took a controversial and relaxed approach to tackling the coronavirus pandemic and started reopening the country two months ago.\n\nPresident refusal to impose measures of confinement or social detachment and the decision to stop publishing the infection data, merited harsh criticism in the region and worried neighboring countries and the World Health Organization.\n\nAt the end of April, when the country recorded 480 cases and 16 deaths from Covid-19, Tanzania suspended the release of the data \"to prevent panic\", continued to function fully and encouraged the population to resort to traditional medicine and to pray . \n\nTanzania was declared free from coronavirus in June (by the President), thanking God and the citizens' prayers for the defeat of the disease.\n\nThe diplomatic discussion between Kenya and Tanzania broke out shortly after the start of the pandemic outbreak in East Africa, when Kenya blocked Tanzanian truck drivers from entering the country, fearing the spread of the disease.

This makes Tanzania being among the 7 TB high burden countries which are on track to achieve the End TB 2020 Incidence milestones there has been a 19% reduction in TB mortality from 58\/100,000 in 2014 to 40\/100,000 in 2018.\n\nIn year 2018, a total of 75,845 cases of all forms were notified, which is an increase of 6,205 cases or 9% compared to the year 2017. New and relapse TB cases notified were 74,692 among them, 48% were bacteriological confirmed TB cases, 79% were pulmonary TB cases and children among the new and relapse cases were 14%. \n\n#Tuberculosis Notifications By Region\n\nDar es Salaam city has remained a major contributor of TB cases notification in Tanzania. Its contribution makes 20% of all cases notified in the country, a 1% decline as compared to year 2017. There was considerable regional variation as in the previous years with 50% of cases being contributed by 7 regions - Dar-es-Salaam, Mwanza, Arusha, Geita, Dodoma, Manyara and Mbeya.\n\n#Tuberculosis Notification Rate\n\nThe country TB notification rate has been increasing for the last four years: 2015 to 2018, but there is still variation among the regions.
