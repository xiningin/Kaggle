We can only do so at this stage for features which do not have any empty values. It also makes sense doing so only for features which are categorical (Sex), ordinal (Pclass) or discrete (SibSp, Parch) type.\n- Pclass We observe significant correlation (>0.5) among Pclass=1 and Survived (classifying #3). We decide to include this feature in our model.\n- Sex We confirm the observation during problem definition that Sex=female had very high survival rate at 74% (classifying #1).\n- SibSp and Parch These features have zero correlation for certain values. It may be best to derive a feature or a set of features from these individual features (creating #1).","e2d73b7e":"The most important settings are the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators) and the number of features considered for splitting at each leaf node (max_features). We could go read the research papers on the random forest and try to theorize the best hyperparameters, but a more efficient use of our time is just to try out a wide range of values and see what works! We will try adjusting the following set of hyperparameters:\n- n_estimators = number of trees in the foreset\n- max_features = max number of features considered for splitting a node\n- max_depth = max number of levels in each decision tree\n- min_samples_split = min number of data points placed in a node before the node is split\n- min_samples_leaf = min number of data points allowed in a leaf node\n- bootstrap = method for sampling data points (with or without replacement)","f3b3b577":"### Correlating categorical features\u00b6\nNow we can correlate categorical features with our solution goal.\n\n#### Observations.\n- Female passengers had much better survival rate than males. Confirms classifying (#1).\n- Exception in Embarked=C where males had higher survival rate. This could be a correlation between Pclass and Embarked and in turn Pclass and Survived, not necessarily direct correlation between Embarked and Survived.\n- Males had better survival rate in Pclass=3 when compared with Pclass=2 for C and Q ports.

We will first do this for the Age feature.\n\nWe can consider three methods to complete a numerical continuous feature.\n\n1. A simple way is to generate random numbers between mean and standard deviation.\n\n2. More accurate way of guessing missing values is to use other correlated features. In our case we note correlation among Age, Gender, and Pclass. Guess Age values using median values for Age across sets of Pclass and Gender feature combinations. So, median Age for Pclass=1 and Gender=0, Pclass=1 and Gender=1, and so on...\n\n3. Combine methods 1 and 2. So instead of guessing age values based on median, use random numbers between mean and standard deviation, based on sets of Pclass and Gender combinations.\n\nMethod 1 and 3 will introduce random noise into our models. The results from multiple executions might vary. We will prefer method 2.","b8f7031b":"### Quick completing and converting a numeric feature\nWe can now complete the Fare feature for single missing value in test dataset using mode to get the value that occurs most frequently for this feature.
