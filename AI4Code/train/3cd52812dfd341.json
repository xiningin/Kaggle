trends while also tried to extract if any of the variables have a correlation. From the visualization, we can confidently say that Adventure movies generate the highest revenue while documentaries generate lowest, but it is interesting that documentaries have the highest average ratings. If we see the highest budgeted genres then that is adventure genres. We have also compared budget and revenue and visualized and saw that movies with more budget are likely to generate more revenue.\n\nWe have alos checked the correlation between multiple columns. We compared popularity and budget and we cannot say that they are even correlated and same goes for budget and vote_average.\n\n## Limitations\nIn this analysis we have seen more missing values for budget and revenue values. To accommodate those missing values we have used the mean of the existing values, which can affect the findings as those missing values may vary from the existing values but to extract the best findings possible, we need to replace the missing values with the mean.","b617b416":"> we don't see any strong correlation between popularity and budget.","f5f206b6":"We noticed that the minimum value of budget and revenue is zero, which indicated that those missing are replaced with zero in these two columns.
