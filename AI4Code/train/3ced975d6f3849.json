Discovering relationships between variables\n\nThe aim is simply to indentify things that should be cleaned, inferred or otherwise used for a predictive model.","aadccb45":"The number of male and female passengers in each age bracket is similar, though higher for males. While survival rate is higher for females at all age brackets, the swarm plot shows there is only a small number of data points for infants (<2 years), young children (2 - 5 years), and children (5-16 years), therefore this comparison may not be meaningful for these age brackets. There is a clear age bias at older age brackets however, with elderly females being highly likely to survive, while elderly males were highly unlikely to survive.","af6cc4fa":"There are 572 duplicate ticket numbers. Duplicates often have the same Fare and Cabin numbers. Many of the duplicates are clearly part of a family group (e.g. Mr Engelhart Ostby & Miss Helene Ostby), however this is not always the case and sometimes there is no clear association by name. However, duplicate tickets seem to be 1st class passengers - perhaps wealthy patrons travelling with an entourage?\n\nThis seems an oddity, but probably not significant. Let's move on to looking at values in individual columns. For categorical data let's look at the types of values to make sure nothing is obviously out of place.","700d04cb":"#### Survival by age bracket and sex","ec6a8788":"Only two values missing here.

The bar plot shows us that in all clases males were less likely to survive than females, and that lower class passengers were less likely to survive than higher class passengers. We examine this in more detail next.\nThere is also a large increase in the number of low and mid-class passengers around 15-21 years old.","04740fb8":"# Data Exploration Summary\n\nWhat have we learned from our data analysis? These are the key observations:\n- The data is very clean. No suspect labels or outliers were observed\n- There are many missing values for Age and Cabin. Fare and Embarked contained 1-2 missing data points only, the rest of the data is complete\n- Many passengers have the same ticket number, suggesting they are travelling together as a group. The significance of this is difficult to determine but it may serve as a useful proxy for filling missing cabin data\n- Age values are skewed to the left, with most passengers (male and female) between around 16-25 years of age\n- Fare values seem to follow an exponential decay. Extremely high fare values do not appear to be outliers but may represent the ticket cost for a group of 1st class passengers\n- Most adult passengers (male and female) were not accompanied by children \n\nAs for correlations:\n- Age, Pclass, Sex are strongly correlated with survival. Missing age values should be inferred to maximise this correlation\n- Fare is also correlated, but as it is also related to Pclass this may be of secondary importance\n- Parch may only be meaningfully associated with survival for young passengers. Somewhat suprisingly, adult passengers travelling with children do not appear to be more likely to survive than adult passengers without children\n- Logically, cabin may be a very useful predictor of survival, though it needs cleaning work before it can be used. Pclass may actually be serving as a proxy for cabin location","d7be17a6":"The histograms show us that the vast majority of passengers were adults unaccompanied by children - especially true for males. Interestingly there were a small number of Child passengers (ages 5-16) travelling without accompanying adults. They tended to be mid-low class and had relatively high survival compared to other children in a similar age group.","9d4870a0":"The most highly correlated values with survival are (in order):\n- Gender (males were less likely to survive)\n- Pclass (lower class were less likely to survive)\n- Fare (passengers paying higher fares were more likely to survive)\n- Parch (higher numbers of parents and children were more likely to survive)\n- Age (younger passengers were more likely to survive)\n- SibSp (passengers with more siblings or spouses were slightly less likely to survive)\n    \nNotable cross-correlations\n- Pclass is inversely associated with fare, which makes sense as higher paying passengers will generally have a higher class\n- Pclass is also inversely associated with associated with age - higher class passengers were likely to be older\n- Parch and SibSp are correlated which also makes sense as families will travel together\n\nFinally, we visualise some of these relationships in more detail."}}
