Translated 32% survival rate.\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\n- 1912\ub144 4\uc6d4 15\uc77c \uccab \ud56d\ud574 \uc911\uc5d0 \ud0c0\uc774\ud0c0\ub2c9 \ud638\uac00 \ube59\uc0b0\uacfc \ucda9\ub3cc\ud558\uc5ec \uce68\ubab0\ud558\uc5ec 2224 \uba85\uc758 \uc2b9\uac1d\uacfc \uc2b9\ubb34\uc6d0 \uc911 1502 \uba85\uc774 \uc0ac\ub9dd\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc874\uc728 32%.\n- \ub09c\ud30c\uc120\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc778\uba85 \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc2b9\uac1d\uacfc \uc2b9\ubb34\uc6d0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uba85\uc815\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n- \uac00\ub77c\uc549\ub294 \uc0dd\uc874\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubd80 \ud589\uc6b4\uc758 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc77c\ubd80 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5ec\uc131, \uc5b4\ub9b0\uc774 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ub958\uce35\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uadf8\ub8f9\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0dd\uc874 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n## Workflow goals\n\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\n\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n\n> \ubd84\ub958 : \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubd84\ub958 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \ub610\ub294 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc744 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https:\/\/en.wikiversity.org\/wiki\/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n\n> \uad00\ub828 : \uad50\uc721 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\uae4c? \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9d0\ud558\uba74 \uae30\ub2a5 \ubc0f \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 [\uc0c1\uad00] (https:\/\/en.wikiversity.org\/wiki\/ \uc0c1\uad00)\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\uae4c? \uae30\ub2a5 \uac12\uc774 \ubcc0\uacbd\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub3c4 \ubcc0\uacbd\ub429\ub2c8\uae4c? \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uce58 \ubc0f \ubc94\uc8fc \uae30\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud6c4\uc18d \ubaa9\ud45c \ubc0f \uc6cc\ud06c \ud50c\ub85c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc874 \uc774\uc678\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud560 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\uc815 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad00 \uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc791\uc131, \uc644\ub8cc \ub610\ub294 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n \n> \uc804\ud658 : \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc900\ube44\ud574\uc57c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc22b\uc790\ub85c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uac12\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubc94\uc8fc \uac12\uc744 \uc22b\uc790 \uac12\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n\n> \uc644\ub8cc : \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc900\ube44\uc5d0\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0 \uce21\uac12\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uce21\uac12\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801 \uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\n\n> \uc218\uc815 : \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ub610\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc815\ud655 \ud55c \uac12\uc774 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uac12\uc744 \uc77c\uce58 \uc2dc\ud0a4\uac70\ub098 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud558\ub824\uace0 \uc2dc\ub3c4 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ub610\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc774\uce58\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \uc65c\uace1\ub420 \uc218\uc788\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ubc84\ub9b4 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\n\n> \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 : \uae30\uc874 \uae30\ub2a5 \ub610\ub294 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4, \ubcc0\ud658, \uc644\uc804\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub530\ub97c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\n\n> \ucc44\ud305 : \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uacfc \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654 \ub3c4\ud45c\uc640 \ucc28\ud2b8\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95.","9cace8af":"### Correlating categorical and numerical features\n\n> \ubc94\uc8fc \ubc0f \uc22b\uc790 \uc18d\uc131 \uc0c1\uad00\n\nWe may also want to correlate categorical features (with non-numeric values) and numeric features.

So, median Age for Pclass=1 and Gender=0, Pclass=1 and Gender=1, and so on...\n\n> 2. \uacb0\uce21\uac12\uc744 \ucd94\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0c1\uad00 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Age, Gender \ubc0f Pclass \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
