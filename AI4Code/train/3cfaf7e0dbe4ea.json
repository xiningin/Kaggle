The right-hand plot appears to indicate that there is also a relationship between proximity to Boston employment centers and median home value, with home values generally increasing as one gets further away from the employment centers.","4bc5fb67":"From the numerical summary, one thing that stands out is that the tracts which average at least eight rooms per dwelling have low crime rates, low concentrations of nitric oxides, low proportions of Black residents (high values of `B`), and low proportions of lower status residents compared to the overall data set.","d45f24aa":"We have the following mean and standard deviation for each quantitative predictor:\n\n- `mpg`: mean = 23.45, standard deviation = 7.81\n- `cylinders`: mean = 5.47, standard deviation = 1.71\n- `displacement`: mean = 194.41, standard deviation = 104.64\n- `horsepower`: mean = 104.47, standard deviation = 38.49\n- `weight`: mean = 2977.58, standard deviation = 849.40\n- `acceleration`: mean = 15.54, standard deviation = 2.76\n- `year`: mean = 75.98, standard deviation = 3.68","25ea7149":"Looking at the above box plot, we can also see that there is a relationship between a car's country of origin and fuel efficiency, where on average Japanese cars are the most efficient, followed by European cars and then by American cars. Looking at the numerical summary below also confirms this and provides some additional insight. As we might have noticed in the scatter plots relating mpg to various other factors, Japanese cars tend to have engines with lower displacement that produce less power. The numerical summary below indicates that the average displacement and average horsepower for Japanese cars are quite close to the corresponding values for European cars. Moreover, Japanese cars are on average about 200 pounds lighter than European cars, and about 1150 pounds lighter than American cars. Especially when combined with the effects engine displacement, horsepower, and car weight appear to have on fuel efficiency, as noted above, it seems that the fact that the Japanese cars in this data set are lightweight cars with small and low-powered engines is the reason why those cars are generally more fuel efficient than American and European ones.","846f8c8b":"## Part 2 \n**Look at the first few rows data using the `head()` function.

We can see generally negative relationships between the two variables for both elite and non-elite schools. In other words, as the ratio increases, graduation rates tend to decrease.

There is a pretty clear positive relationship between the two for elite schools, and while the relationship is weaker for non-elite ones, there still appears to be one. Also, there seems to be a sharper increase in graduation rates per additional faculty member with a PhD for private schools when compared to public schools.","f63fc051":"These two scatter plots in this next group explore factors that might relate to the concentration of nitric oxides. While there isn't a strong relationship, it appears that tracts with higher median home value also weakly tend to have lower concentrations of nitric oxides. There is a much clearer relationship with the percentage of non-retail business acres -- tracts with a higher proportion of non-retail business acres tend to have higher concentrations of nitric oxides. The next two plots look at some more factors which might be related to the median home value of a tract. ","8d3cea8d":"Based on the above box plots, it looks like that, aside from some outlier schools with very high costs, there isn't a wide gap for the median non-tution costs between private schools and public schools.

Also, it appears as if tracts that border the Charles river are a high a slightly higher median home value on average.","002f8505":"Based on the histograms and the numerical summary, there do appear to be tracts within Boston which have particularly high crime rates, tax rates, or pupil-teacher ratios. The minimum crime rate is 0.00632, while the maximum is 88.97620, with a median of 0.25651. The minimum tax rate is \\\\$187 per \\\\$10000, while the maximum is \\\\$711, with a median of \\\\$330. The minimum pupil-teacher ratio is 12.60 pupils per teacher, while the maximum is 22, with a median of 19.05.

For both elite and non-elite schools, there is a clear positive relationship between instructional expenditure per student and graduation rate, though the effect does flatten out after a certain point. The slope seems to be steeper for non-elite public schools compared to non-elite private schools. Also, there is a clear outlier and high leverage point: a non-elite private school with a very low graduation rate compared to its instructional expenditure per student.","26988db5":"Based on the scatter plots I made in part 5 which relate miles per gallon to the predictors engine displacement, horsepower, car weight, and model year, it seems as if the first three factors would be most helpful in predicting `mpg`, with model year still potentially being helpful but less so.

These tracts have no land zoned for residential lots of 25000 sq. ft., though this is in line with at least half of the tracts in the overall set given the median for `ZN` is 0. The two tracts do have a relatively high proportion of non-retail business acres, with values of 18.1 being right at the third quartile. Similarly, the tracts also have concentrations of nitric oxides in the upper quartile of the overall set with a value of 0.693 parts per ten million.
