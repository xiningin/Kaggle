By Jovita Aranha\n\n\"Born Kadambini Bose in Bhagalpur, she was raised in Changi, Barisal (now in Bangladesh).\"\n\n\"Her childhood was strongly influenced by the Bengal Renaissance and her father, Braja Kishore Basu, was a renowned champion of the Brahmo Samaj. As a headmaster, he was dedicated to female emancipation and co-founded Bhagalpur Mahila Samiti in 1863, the first of its kind women\u2019s organisation in India.\"\n\n\"Her success encouraged Bethune College to introduce FA (First Arts) and Graduation courses in 1883. Kadambini was one of the first two graduates, along with Chandramukhi Basu, in the entire British Raj.\"\n\n\"When most thought she would put an end to her education after graduating, her husband Dwarkanath encouraged her to study medicine. Her decision to do so as a woman received severe backlash in the Bhadralok (upper caste Bengali) community.\"\n\n\"But the road to becoming a doctor was a difficult one. Calcutta Medical College refused to admit Kadambini as a candidate despite her merit because there was no history of Indian women studying there.\"\n\n\"1886 marked her record as one the first Indian women physician eligible to practice western medicine alongside Anandi Gopal Joshi.
