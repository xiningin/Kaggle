When it comes to the other attributes we can see that the avg episode lasts 22.3 minutes and an avg episoded is rated with 8.45 stars out of 10 with 3352.28 votes.

Given that 2350 is the maximum amount of stars for the whole TV Show and that 235 is per season (divided evenly) we can say that Season 6 managed to collect 212.4\/235, quite a good collection. Well, on the other hand the season that collected the least amount of Stars is the last one (nr 10) with a score of 156.2\/235 (keep in mind that season 10 haw 18 episodes and the actual maximum is 180, though I decided to divide the full amount of stars evenly). \n\nWell the next question that pops up my mind and many may disagree with the answer is which episode is the best (according to the voteers of course)?","e38cb26c":"We can see that all the episodes apart from the last two, have a title starting with \"**The One**\". Now let us try and create a list of the words that come after that, what was just reported.","d991d7b0":"And finally, what we have here.... Those names are the ones that apart fromn David Crane, Marta Kauffman and Kevin S. Bright, that we all see in the end of every episode, directed and created this great TV Show called FRIENDS.\nWell, this has come to an end. I hope that you found out something new through this EDA. One further research that needs to be conducted about this TV Series is whether, Ross Geller and Rachel Green were on a break or not but unfortunately the data provided are insufficient!\nNamely the Friends are:\n    \n* \ud83d\udc23\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udf55\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc8b\u200d\ud83d\udc68 Joey Tribbiani\n* \ud83d\udc5b\ud83d\udc31\ud83c\udfa4\ud83c\udfb8 Phoebe Buffay\n* \ud83d\udc60\ud83d\udc84\ud83d\udc85\ud83d\udc57 Rachel Green\n* \ud83d\udc8d\ud83d\udc5e\ud83d\ude4a\ud83d\udcda Ross Geller\n* \ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udc53\ud83c\udfbe Chandler Bing\n* \ud83c\udf82\ud83e\uddfd\ud83d\udc5c\ud83d\udc59 Monica Geller\n\nHope you've enjoyed my work, stick around for more!","614c9544":"We can see that the two last episodes have the exact same title (*The Last One*).

Well the two best episodes according to IMDB's votes are Season 5 with episode title \"The One Where Everybody Finds Out\" and Season 10 with episode title \"The Last One (ii)\". Now apart from the top episode (since public opinion is divided), I believe there is an immense need to find out the Top-10 episodes of FRIENDS. So here we go...","4eab4a1e":"We can now see the words that come after the usual title phrase \"*The One*\".","54f21a4c":"## Welcome everyone, in this noetbook I will proceed to a simple EDA about the TV Show called FRIENDS.\n\n**First of all, as usual, I am going to import all the libraries that I am going to need for my analysis.** "}}
