The problem statement is:\n\n> How do you measure justice? And how do you solve the problem of racism in policing? We look for factors that drive racial disparities in policing by analysing census and police department deployment data. The ultimate goal is to inform police agencies where they can make improvements by identifying deployment areas where racial disparities exist and are not explainable by crime rates and poverty levels. <br><br>\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/center-for-policing-equity\/data-science-for-good\/home\n\nI try to answer below.  \n\nQ1. How do you measure justice?    \n\nA. I expressed my attitude to justice in section 3.2.2.  From my analysis, It is clear that there is a disparity among races in police activity. Over all areas, over-policing to Black people is observed. In a part of areas, over-policing to Hispanic people is also observed. From the point of the view of \"Justice\", these should be improved.\n\nQ2. How do you solve the problem of racism in policing?   \n\nA. This problem is still open. I think we might be able to use the field interviewer data to answer this question. Within the range of my analysis, I can tell some police districts should be improved from the view of racism. In each district of C11, D4, D14, and E13, too many Black people are interviewed, therefore these districts should be improved first. \n\nQ3. Can you identify factors that drive racial disparities in policing by analysing census and police department deployment data?  \n\nA. At least police district would be a factor to drive racial disparities in policing. In some districts such as A7, E5, the rate of interviewed Black people is relatively low although there are racial disparities to Black people in all districts. Therefore,  if we could, we should make other districts follow the way of policing in districts A7 and E5.\n\nQ4. The ultimate goal is to inform police agencies where they can make improvements by identifying deployment areas where racial disparities exist and are not explainable by crime rates and poverty levels. What is your approach to this goal?  \n\nA.  \n- In the district A1, A7, D4, D14, E13, it must be reasonable that high crime rate is due to ineffective policing. In these areas, in spite of the small rate of population of Black people who suffer over-policing, crime rate is relatively high. I recommend to police that they should increase and improve their deployment in these areas and policing should not be based on racial prejudice. \n- Back to problem in this project, we have to search for the place where is not explainable by crime rates and poverty levels. By the way, as for poverty rates, A1 and D4 are not reliable because poverty rates in cities in A1 or D4 are much different. Thus, A1 and D4 are excluded. Next, as for A7, this district is not policing based on strong racism because difference of the rate of interviewed Black people and the rate of population of Black people is relatively small. Thus, A7 is excluded. Finally, as for D14 and E13, these districts are doing strong over-policing to Black people and it is thought that police in these districts are policing based on strong racism. All in all, `I recommend to police that they should reinforce deployment and improve policing with strong racism in D14(Allston, Brighton) and E13(Jamaica Plain).`\n\n- I guess police already know the fact; in district B2, crime rate is very high , policing is very weak, and poverty rate is very high, therefore they should take measures on this area as soon as possible. If they could, they should increase deployment in this area and make this area safer.

Sandel. According to his book on justice, there are three attitude to justice: maximization of utility and welfare, respect of freedom to choose, and cultivation of virtue and logical thinking of common good. The first one is called utilitarianism, second one is called libertarianism or liberalism, and the last one is called communitarianism. (If your are familiar with political philosophy, your might want to add nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and feminism to these three ones)\n\nHere, I would like to advocate his standing point.\n\n>The utilitarian approach has two defects: First, it makes justice and rights a matter of calculation, not\nprinciple. Second, by trying to translate all human goods into a single, uniform measure of value, it\nflattens them, and takes no account of the qualitative differences among them.\n\n>The freedom-based theories solve the first problem but not the second. They take rights seriously and\ninsist that justice is more than mere calculation. Although they disagree among themselves about which\nrights should outweigh utilitarian considerations, they agree that certain rights are fundamental and must\nbe respected. But beyond singling out certain rights as worthy of respect, they accept people\u2019s\npreferences as they are. They don\u2019t require us to question or challenge the preferences and desires we\nbring to public life. According to these theories, the moral worth of the ends we pursue, the meaning and\nsignificance of the lives we lead, and the quality and character of the common life we share all lie\nbeyond the domain of justice.\n\n>This seems to me mistaken. A just society can\u2019t be achieved simply by maximizing utility or by\nsecuring freedom of choice. To achieve a just society we have to reason together about the meaning of\nthe good life, and to create a public culture hospitable to the disagreements that will inevitably arise.\n\n>Michael J. Sandel. (2010). Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?\n\nI think he is a kind of idealist from this opinion and do not totally agree with his idea; however, I would like to accept his opinion because I think we should not go deeper here.\n\nLet's go back to our problem.
