From the top 180 most authors have only written 1 or 2 Articles which made it to the top 100.

Surprisingly post_tag_3 had a higher score than most other tags will have to look into that.","5e08d9bf":"Description of the data: \n\nThis files shows the top 180 recommended datasets on medium for each of the following searches:Data Science,Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence,AI as of 05-06-21.\n\npost_time:Describes the date at which the article was uploaded.\n\npost_name:Name of the Article.\n\npost_author:This shows the name of author or Anonymous if not Given,\n\npost_publication:This shows the publication of the article if any independent if not.\n\npost_claps:This gives the claps that the article recieved in Thousands.\n\npost_responses = The number of comments that the article got.\n\npost_tag 1-4 : The 4 tags used on the article \"did'nt use\" if no tag was used\"\n\nranking:Its position on the search list.\n\nSearched: This shows the Query that was Searched.","b8230182":"next we'll check to see which search queries had the highest number of claps.
