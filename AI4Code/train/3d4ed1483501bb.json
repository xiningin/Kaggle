It measures gender inequalities in three important aspects of human development\u2014reproductive health, measured by maternal mortality ratio and adolescent birth rates; empowerment, measured by proportion of parliamentary seats occupied by females and proportion of adult females and males aged 25 years and older with at least some secondary education; and economic status, expressed as labour market participation and measured by labour force participation rate of female and male populations aged 15 years and older. The GII is built on the same framework as the IHDI\u2014to better expose differences in the distribution of achievements between women and men. It measures the human development costs of gender inequality. Thus the higher the GII value the more disparities between females and males and the more loss to human development.\n\nThe GII sheds new light on the position of women in 160 countries; it yields insights in gender gaps in major areas of human development. The component indicators highlight areas in need of critical policy intervention and it stimulates proactive thinking and public policy to overcome systematic disadvantages of women.\n\n\n![GII](http:\/\/hdr.undp.org\/sites\/default\/files\/gii.png \"GII\")\nRef: http:\/\/hdr.undp.org\/en\/content\/gender-inequality-index-gii\n\n# GII - India\n\nViolence against women in India is actually more present than it may appear at first glance, as many expressions of violence are not considered crimes, or may otherwise go unreported or undocumented due to certain Indian cultural values and beliefs.

It was termed as India's Arab Spring.  The \u2018Nirbhaya\u2019 case was marked by unprecedented public outrage on social media as well as on the ground .People in huge numbers came out to show their support, to demand for justice and asked for an earnest call to the Government to put measures in place to stop these crimes.\n\nAnd though it may seem that the cases after 2012 were more, if you would have noticed, throughout the notebook I have used the word 'Registered'. The numbers increased only because people, women especially started reporting the crimes against them. \nThey were no longer silent.\n\nIt is also why I quoted the text in the begining of this kernel from Wiki -\n\n''' Violence against women in India is actually more present than it may appear at first glance, as many expressions of violence are not considered crimes, or may otherwise go unreported or undocumented due to certain Indian cultural values and beliefs. '''\n\nThe section in Wiki also states - '''Although rapes are becoming more frequently reported, many go unreported or have the complaint files withdrawn due to the perception of family honour being compromised. Women frequently do not receive justice for their rapes, because police often do not give a fair hearing, and\/or medical evidence is often unrecorded which makes it easy for offenders to get away with their crimes under the current laws.\n\nIncreased attention in the media and awareness among both Indians and the outside world is both bringing attention to the issue of rape in India and helping empower women to report the crime. After international news reported the gang rape of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus that occurred in Delhi, in December 2012, Delhi experienced a significant increase in reported rapes. The number of reported rapes nearly doubled from 143 reported in January\u2013March 2012 to 359 during the three months after the rape. After the Delhi rape case, Indian media has committed to report each and every rape case'''\n\nRef:\nhttp:\/\/world.time.com\/2013\/11\/08\/why-rape-seems-worse-in-india-than-everywhere-else-but-actually-isnt\/\n\n\nOn 1 February 2013 approved for bringing an ordinance, for giving effect to the changes in law as suggested by the Verma Committee Report \n\nRef: \nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Criminal_Law_(Amendment)_Act,_2013\n\nhttps:\/\/pib.gov.in\/newsite\/erelease.aspx?relid=91979\n\nhttps:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/india\/north\/story\/president-signs-ordinance-to-effect-changes-in-laws-against-sexual-crimes-153156-2013-02-03\n\nIf India wants to improve its GII, we need to work on this issue.
