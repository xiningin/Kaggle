The goal is to produce a model that represents the 'best fit' to some observed data, according to an evaluation criterion.Here we use The Keras library to create the above stated model.\n* We are going to make a Neural Network with 1 input layer and 2 hidden layers which could be altered easily.\n* The End goal is to make an efficient Neural Network that is not overfitted and generalised for new sets of future data. \n"}}
