United States Medicare is funded by a payroll tax, premiums and surtaxes from beneficiaries, and general revenue. It provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax. It also provides health insurance to younger people with some disability status as determined by the Social Security Administration, as well as people with end stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nIn 2015, Medicare provided health insurance for over **55 million** (46 million people age 65 and older and 9 million younger people). On average, Medicare covers about half of the health care charges for those enrolled. The enrollees must then cover their remaining costs either with supplemental insurance, separate insurance, or out-of-pocket. Out-of-pocket costs can vary depending on the amount of health care a Medicare enrollee needs. \n\n## About CMS\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), previously known as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and health insurance portability standards. In addition to these programs, CMS has other responsibilities, including the administrative simplification standards from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), quality standards in long-term care facilities (more commonly referred to as nursing homes) through its survey and certification process, clinical laboratory quality standards under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, and oversight of HealthCare.gov.\n\n## About the Data-Set\n\nThis [public dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cms\/cms-medicare) was created by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The data summarizes the utilization and payments for procedures, services, and prescription drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries by specific inpatient and outpatient hospitals, physicians, and other suppliers. The dataset includes the following data: Common inpatient and outpatient services, All physician and other supplier procedures and services, All Part D prescriptions. Providers determine what they will charge for items, services, and procedures provided to patients and these charges are the amount that providers bill for an item, service, or procedure.\n\nIn this notebook, I have explored the complete dataset using BigQuery, performed clustering on nursing facilities data to identify groups of nursing facilities having similar characteristics\n\n## Contents\n\n1.

This will help to identify the Nursing Facilities having similar behaviours \/ characteristics. Before Running Clustering I have applied data Preprocessing which includes Removing textual columns and dropping the missing Values\n\nReference - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/K-means_clustering","a38e9e49":"**Inference**  \n> Texas and California are the only states of US having more than 1000 Nursing Facilities   \n> Purto Rico and Alaska are the states having exteremly low Nursing facilities with 5 and 7 respectively  \n> About 40% of the total states have less than 200 nursing facilities \n\n\n\n## 2. Which State (and Nursing Facilities) have poor HCC risk adjustment scores \n\nThe Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk adjustment model to calculate risk scores. The HCC model ranks diagnoses into categories that represent conditions with similar cost patterns. Higher categories represent higher predicted healthcare costs, resulting in higher risk scores. CMS uses HCCs to reimburse Medicare Advantage plans based on the health of their members. It pays accurately for the predicted cost expenditures of patients by adjusting those payments based on demographic information and patient health status. The risk assessment data used is based on the diagnosis information pulled from claims and medical records which are collected by physician offices, hospital inpatient visits and in outpatient settings.\n\nCMS states that higher HCC scores means there is higher risk of chronic diseases while lower hcc indicates healthy population. It will be interesting to see what is the average hcc score for different states and facilities. \n\n\n### 2.1 Max and Min HCCs for different states\n","95e04b06":"## 1.
