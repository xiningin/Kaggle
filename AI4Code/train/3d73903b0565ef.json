After the initial outbreak, most countries have prepared their healthcare systems to face the pandemic. Although highly desirable, global and shared preparedness planning has faced political, institutional, social, environmental, and technological challenges [3, 4]. A recent International survey reported substantial heterogeneity in the diagnostic approach to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia within and among countries and continents**\n**Introduction: for the management of patients referred to respiratory triage during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, either chest radiograph (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) were used as first-line diagnostic tools. The aim of this study was to compare the impact on triage, diagnosis and prognosis of patients with suspected COVID-19 when clinical decisions are derived from reconstructed CXR or from CT.**\n"}}
