Other libraries we\u2019ll use will be built on top of matplotlib.\n* numpy: The numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in Python.\n* seaborn: A statistical visualization tool built on top of matplotlib.\n* statsmodels: A library with many advanced statistical functions.\n* scipy: Advanced scientific computing, including functions for optimization, linear algebra, image processing and much more.\n* scikit-learn: The most popular machine learning library for Python (not deep learning)","006ad7b0":"![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/633\/1*Y2v3PrF1rUQRUHwOcXJznA.png)"}}
