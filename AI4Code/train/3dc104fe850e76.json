If the economy is booming, an overvalued exchange rate can help reduce inflationary pressure, but in a recession, an overvalued exchange rate can cause further deflationary pressures.\n\nCountries with a negative value have an **undervalued currency**, wich means a currency with an exchange rate lower than it ought to be. A currency may be undervalued, for example, when its purchasing power, supply and demand are all strong, but its price is still comparatively low. \n\nHaving a weaker currency relative to the rest of the world can help boost exports, shrink trade deficits and reduce the cost of interest payments on its outstanding government debts. There are, however, some negative effects of devaluations. They create uncertainty in global markets that can cause asset markets to fall or spur recessions.
