We want to increase the relative frequency of rare data by increased sampling of under-represented regions of the latent space. We can approximate $\\mathcal{Q}(z|X)$ using the frequency distributions of each of the learned latent variables, and then define the probability distribution of selecting a given datapoint $x$ based on this approximation. These probability distributions will be used during training to re-sample the data.\n\nYou'll write a function to execute this update of the sampling probabilities, and then call this function within the DB-VAE training loop to actually debias the model. ","7a0400ea":"Now, we will put this decoder together with the standard CNN classifier as our encoder to define the DB-VAE. Note that at this point, there is nothing special about how we put the model together that makes it a \"debiasing\" model -- that will come when we define the training operation. Here, we will define the core VAE architecture by sublassing the `Model` class; defining encoding, reparameterization, and decoding operations; and calling the network end-to-end.","c03dbb38":"## 2.4 Variational autoencoder (VAE) for learning latent structure\n\nAs you saw, the accuracy of the CNN varies across the four demographics we looked at. To think about why this may be, consider the dataset the model was trained on, CelebA. If certain features, such as dark skin or hats, are *rare* in CelebA, the model may end up biased against these as a result of training with a biased dataset. That is to say, its classification accuracy will be worse on faces that have under-represented features, such as dark-skinned faces or faces with hats, relevative to faces with features well-represented in the training data! This is a problem. \n\nOur goal is to train a *debiased* version of this classifier -- one that accounts for potential disparities in feature representation within the training data. Specifically, to build a debiased facial classifier, we'll train a model that **learns a representation of the underlying latent space** to the face training data. The model then uses this information to mitigate unwanted biases by sampling faces with rare features, like dark skin or hats, *more frequently* during training. The key design requirement for our model is that it can learn an *encoding* of the latent features in the face data in an entirely *unsupervised* way. To achieve this, we'll turn to variational autoencoders (VAEs).\n\n![The concept of a VAE](http:\/\/kvfrans.com\/content\/images\/2016\/08\/vae.jpg)\n\nAs shown in the schematic above and in Lecture 4, VAEs rely on an encoder-decoder structure to learn a latent representation of the input data. In the context of computer vision, the encoder network takes in input images, encodes them into a series of variables defined by a mean and standard deviation, and then draws from the distributions defined by these parameters to generate a set of sampled latent variables. The decoder network then \"decodes\" these variables to generate a reconstruction of the original image, which is used during training to help the model identify which latent variables are important to learn. \n\nLet's formalize two key aspects of the VAE model and define relevant functions for each.\n","d66a8b0b":"### Understanding VAEs: loss function\n\nIn practice, how can we train a VAE? In learning the latent space, we constrain the means and standard deviations to approximately follow a unit Gaussian. Recall that these are learned parameters, and therefore must factor into the loss computation, and that the decoder portion of the VAE is using these parameters to output a reconstruction that should closely match the input image, which also must factor into the loss. What this means is that we'll have two terms in our VAE loss function:\n\n1.  **Latent loss ($L_{KL}$)**: measures how closely the learned latent variables match a unit Gaussian and is defined by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.\n2.   **Reconstruction loss ($L_{x}{(x,\\hat{x})}$)**: measures how accurately the reconstructed outputs match the input and is given by the $L^1$ norm of the input image and its reconstructed output.  \n\nThe equations for both of these losses are provided below:\n\n$$ L_{KL}(\\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{k-1}\\small{(\\sigma_j + \\mu_j^2 - 1 - \\log{\\sigma_j})} $$\n\n$$ L_{x}{(x,\\hat{x})} = ||x-\\hat{x}||_1 $$ \n\nThus for the VAE loss we have: \n\n$$ L_{VAE} = c\\cdot L_{KL} + L_{x}{(x,\\hat{x})} $$\n\nwhere $c$ is a weighting coefficient used for regularization. \n\nNow we're ready to define our VAE loss function:","4bf714e0":"### Understanding VAEs: reparameterization \n\nAs you may recall from lecture, VAEs use a \"reparameterization  trick\" for sampling learned latent variables. Instead of the VAE encoder generating a single vector of real numbers for each latent variable, it generates a vector of means and a vector of standard deviations that are constrained to roughly follow Gaussian distributions. We then sample from the standard deviations and add back the mean to output this as our sampled latent vector. Formalizing this for a latent variable $z$ where we sample $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,(I))$ we have: \n\n$$ z = \\mathbb{\\mu} + e^{\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\log{\\Sigma}\\right)}\\circ \\epsilon $$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix. This is useful because it will let us neatly define the loss function for the VAE, generate randomly sampled latent variables, achieve improved network generalization, **and** make our complete VAE network differentiable so that it can be trained via backpropagation.

For example, the majority of faces in CelebA (our training set) are those of light-skinned females. As a result, a classifier trained on CelebA will be better suited at recognizing and classifying faces with features similar to these, and will thus be biased.\n\nHow could we overcome this? A naive solution -- and on that is being adopted by many companies and organizations -- would be to annotate different subclasses (i.e., light-skinned females, males with hats, etc.) within the training data, and then manually even out the data with respect to these groups.\n\nBut this approach has two major disadvantages. First, it requires annotating massive amounts of data, which is not scalable. Second, it requires that we know what potential biases (e.g., race, gender, pose, occlusion, hats, glasses, etc.) to look for in the data. As a result, manual annotation may not capture all the different features that are imbalanced within the training data.\n\nInstead, let's actually **learn** these features in an unbiased, unsupervised manner, without the need for any annotation, and then train a classifier fairly with respect to these features. In the rest of this lab, we'll do exactly that.","00efcde4":"### DB-VAE architecture\n\nNow we're ready to define the DB-VAE architecture.

Consider the task of facial detection: given an image, is it an image of a face?  This seemingly simple, but extremely important, task is subject to significant amounts of algorithmic bias among select demographics. \n\nIn this lab, we'll investigate [one recently published approach](http:\/\/introtodeeplearning.com\/AAAI_MitigatingAlgorithmicBias.pdf) to addressing algorithmic bias.

In order to train our facial detection models, we'll need a dataset of positive examples (i.e., of faces) and a dataset of negative examples (i.e., of things that are not faces). We'll use these data to train our models to classify images as either faces or not faces. Finally, we'll need a test dataset of face images. Since we're concerned about the potential *bias* of our learned models against certain demographics, it's important that the test dataset we use has equal representation across the demographics or features of interest. In this lab, we'll consider skin tone and gender. \n\n1.   **Positive training data**: [CelebA Dataset](http:\/\/mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk\/projects\/CelebA.html).

Our goal is to build a model that trains on CelebA *and* achieves high classification accuracy on the the test dataset across all demographics, and to thus show that this model does not suffer from any hidden bias. \n\nWhat exactly do we mean when we say a classifier is biased? In order to formalize this, we'll need to think about [*latent variables*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latent_variable), variables that define a dataset but are not strictly observed. As defined in the generative modeling lecture, we'll use the term *latent space* to refer to the probability distributions of the aforementioned latent variables. Putting these ideas together, we consider a classifier *biased* if its classification decision changes after it sees some additional latent features. This notion of bias may be helpful to keep in mind throughout the rest of the lab.

We'll train our DB-VAE model on the facial detection task, run the debiasing operation during training, evaluate on the PPB dataset, and compare its accuracy to our original, biased CNN model.    \n\n### The DB-VAE model\n\nThe key idea behind this debiasing approach is to use the latent variables learned via a VAE to adaptively re-sample the CelebA data during training. Specifically, we will alter the probability that a given image is used during training based on how often its latent features appear in the dataset. So, faces with rarer features (like dark skin, sunglasses, or hats) should become more likely to be sampled during training, while the sampling probability for faces with features that are over-represented in the training dataset should decrease (relative to uniform random sampling across the training data). \n\nA general schematic of the DB-VAE approach is shown here:\n\n![DB-VAE](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/aamini\/introtodeeplearning\/2019\/lab2\/img\/DB-VAE.png)","627e040f":"Now that we've defined the resampling update, we can train our DB-VAE model on the CelebA\/ImageNet training data, and run the above operation to re-weight the importance of particular data points as we train the model.

Usually, VAEs are not trained to output any supervised variables (such as a class prediction)! This is another key distinction between the DB-VAE and a traditional VAE. \n\nKeep in mind that we only want to learn the latent representation of *faces*, as that's what we're ultimately debiasing against, even though we are training a model on a binary classification problem. We'll need to ensure that, **for faces**, our DB-VAE model both learns a representation of the unsupervised latent variables, captured by the distribution $q_\\phi(z|x)$, **and** outputs a supervised class prediction $z_o$, but that, **for negative examples**, it only outputs a class prediction $z_o$.","d8198706":"## 2.2 CNN for facial detection \n\nFirst, we'll define and train a CNN on the facial classification task, and evaluate its accuracy.
