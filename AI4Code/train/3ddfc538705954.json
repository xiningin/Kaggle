This is why we love football, because such unexplicable things happen. I am not telling is total luck, but it played its' role here.\n\nAnother interesting thing is Manchester City of 2018 - they are super stable! They scored just one goal more than expected, missed 2 less and got 7 additional points, while Liverpool fought really well, had little bit more luck on their side, but couldn't win despite being 13 points ahead of their expected.\n\nPep is finishing building the machine of destruction. Man City creates and converts their moments based on skill and do not rely on luck - it makes them very dangerous in the next season.","774d4147":"In the next visualization we will check how many teams from each league were in top 4 during last 5 years.

I think by checking this chart and numbers we can understand that Juve doesn't have strong enough competiton inside the country and gets lots of \"lucky\" points, which again derives from multiple factors and we can see that Napoli outperformed Juventus by xPTS twice, but it is a real life and in, for example 2017, Juve was crazy and scored additional 26 goals (or created goals from nowhere), while Napoli missed 3 more than expected (due to error of goalkeeper or maybe excelence of some team in 1 or 2 particular matches). As with the situation in La Liga when Real Madrid became a champion I am sure we can find 1 or 2 games that was key that year.\n\nDetails matter in football.

Here Paris Saint Germain dominates totally. Only in 2016 we get an outlier in the face of Monaco that scored 30 goals more than expected!!! and got almost 17 points more than expected! Luck? Quite a good piece of it. PSG was good that year, but Monaco was extraordinary. Again, we cannot claim it's pure luck or pure skill, but a perfect combination of both in right place and time.","c3232c79":"As we can see from these bar charts, there are teams that in last 5 years were in top 4 only once, which means it is not something common, which means if we dig deeper, we can find that there is a factor of luck that might have played in favour to these teams.

It considers several factors including the type of pass, pass end-point and length of the pass.\n\nExpected Points (xPTS) - measures the likelihood of a certaing game to bring points to the team.\n\nThese metrics let us look much deeper into football statistics and understand performance of players and teams in general and realize the role of luck and skill in it.
