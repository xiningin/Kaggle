If we can reject the null-hypothesis of the presence of a unit-root process, then we get a process which is mean-reverting.","8577d5c8":"We cannot reject the test-statistic at 5% level. Hence, the series in not mean reverting. Another way of checking if a time-series is mean reverting is to use the Hurst-Exponent which will be discussed later.","d509b4f8":"# Mean Reversion\nMean reversion is a theory that suggests that asset prices and historical returns eventually will revert to the long-run mean or average level of the entire dataset. \nMathematically, such a (continuous) time series is referred to as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This is in contrast to a random walk (Brownian motion), which has no \"memory\" of where it has been at each particular instance of time. The mean-reverting property of a time series can be exploited in order to produce profitable trading strategies.\nThis average level is usually determined by physical or economical forces such as long term supply and demand. Prices might deviate from that long term mean due to sentimental or short-term disturbances on the market but eventually will revert back to its intrinsic value.\nA continuous mean-reverting time series can be represented by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation:\n$$ dx_t=\\theta(\\mu-x_t)dt+\\sigma dW_t $$ \n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the rate of reversion to the mean,$\\mu$ is the mean value of the process,$\\sigma$  is the variance of the process and $W_t$ is a Wiener Process or Brownian Motion.\nIn a discrete setting the equation states that the change of the price series in the next time period is proportional to the difference between the mean price and the current price, with the addition of Gaussian noise."}}
