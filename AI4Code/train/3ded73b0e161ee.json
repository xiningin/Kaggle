Instead of BAC we have Alphabet. \n","9561944b":"# What is the 'Moving Average Convergence Divergence - MACD'\n\nMoving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the \"signal line\", is then plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy and sell signals.\n\nRead more: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/macd.asp#ixzz5SmuJbrAH\n\nAs shown in the charts above, when the MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal, which indicates that it may be time to sell. Conversely, when the MACD rises above the signal line, the indicator gives a bullish signal, which suggests that the price of the asset is likely to experience upward momentum. Many traders wait for a confirmed cross above the signal line before entering into a position to avoid getting \"faked out\" or entering into a position too early, as shown by the first arrow.\n","6d860e5d":"# What happened to NFLX on 11 Nov 2016\nSo Netflix announced launch of service to 130 more countries.

Nvidia, one the large cap stocks that has grown maximum in the last five years has been having a bull run ever since it started powering the GPUs being utilized by massive computations required by AI amd ML projects! Result is continuous and unpredented growth in Earning per Share as well as revenue and hence the stock price. How could we uncover such interesting details given S&P data for last five years? Also can we get a feel of algo trading as well as event based trading? In this kernel we will try to explore if certains events do influence stock price fluctuations. If we did have an NLP engine crunching all news items and figuring out if the news would be a positive influence or a negative influence on the related stock, would it actually yield any benefits? Also what is this algo trading and associated technical indicators? Can they actually help us trade with increased probability of making money? Is that how Warren Buffet does it? That is not so easy to figure out of course but never the less this kernel will shed some light on some of these questions. So lets get started!

What we have is daily volume of each stock. Now it would be interesting to see if certain stocks had an abnormally high volume as compared their average volume in a certain period. We could then do a little market research to see if there was any news that triggered such a spurt. Let us first do this activity fo the entire duration that we have this data that is almost 5 years. We will then compare the findings with varying periods like 50 days or 200 days or even on an yearly basis. So let us list down the steps that we need to perform:\n## Steps to find top stocks that had a maximum deviation in volume from their five year average\n1. Group by stock name and get mean volume\n2. Add a new columns in dataset for mean volume, diff from mean volume\n3. Sort by diff from mean volume\n4. Get top stocks from sorted data\n5. Display these  stocks\n## Charts to see the movement in volume\n1. Plot a box plot for each of these stocks\n2. Plot a histogram\n3. Plot a line chart\n## See if there was any news for these stocks on the days of max deviation \nWe want to see if we can locate the news item that triggered this market behaviour that is huge increment in volume\nOk so let us get started.","beb1bbdb":"We can see if we had taken actions on crossover points, we would have made money.\nNow this for sure looks to be super exciting!

They reported a breakout quarter -- record revenue, record margins and record earnings were driven by strength across all product lines. They reported, \"Our Pascal GPUs are fully ramped and enjoying great success in gaming, [virtual reality], self-driving cars and datacenter AI computing.\" So that makes complete sense, great quarter, stock should have a great ride. And yeah, the stock continues to be great! And they seem to be cashing on the GPUs that we are currently using to progrm our ML algorithms.

Was this stock a good candidate for algorithmic trading? Probably yes.. A careful analysis of the intraday movement and sentiment on the day would help us understand this better.\n## MAA on 1 Dec 2016\nAnother interesting stock is MAA. While volume was abnormally high, we can also see a decent slide in price. It turns out it is again related to merger of Mid America Aprtments with Post Properties.
