The proportion of students whose average is greater than 80 has certain sense of order to it.

Maximum proportion of students didn't opt for test prepaation course. But, proportion of students in top 20-50 are dominated by students who opted for test preparation course. This indicates that opting for this course will improve your marks\/performance.\n2. Also, Parent's with higher qualification (Master's degree ) didn't tend to send their students for test preparation course. Reason could be themselves teaching them or solving doubts in case of difficulties.","8ece03c7":"## 3.
