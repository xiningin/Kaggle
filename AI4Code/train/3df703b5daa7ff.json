Ground water resources in Chennai are replenished by rain water and the city's average rainfall is 1,276 mm[1](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Water_management_in_Chennai). \n\nFollowing are the major sources of water supply for Chennai city.\n1. Four major reservoirs in Red Hills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam\n2. Cauvery water from Veeranam lake\n3. Desalination plants at Nemelli and Minjur\n4. Aquifers in Neyveli, Minjur and Panchetty\n5. Tamaraipakkam, Poondi and Minjur Agriculture wells \n6. CMWSSB Boreweels\n7. Retteri lake\n\nThe above one is also roughly the descending order in which the contribution is made to overall fresh water requirements of the city. In addition to this, people make use of borewells and private tankers for their water needs. \n\nCurrently, Chennai is facing an acute water shortage due to shortage of rainfall for the past three years (and we had one of the worst floods in history the year before that!). As a result, the water in these resources are depleting along with the groundwater level. This [video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/iaG7kRcSxwA) will give an idea about the current state.  \n\nIn this notebook, let us explore the data of different water resources available","e360203d":"\nChennai also known as Madras, is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal.

But it\u2019s well worth poking around its museums and temples, savouring deliciously authentic South Indian delicacies or taking a sunset saunter along Marina Beach \u2013 the world's second-longest urban beach.\n\nAmong Chennai\u2019s greatest assets are its people, infectiously enthusiastic about their home town; they won\u2019t hit you with a lot of hustle and hassle. Recent years have thrown in a new layer of cosmopolitan glamour: luxe hotels, sparkling boutiques, quirky cafes, and smart contemporary restaurants \u2013 but the best of Chennai remains its old so","804edde3":"Finally, we have data at daily level and each column represents the water level in the given reservoir at the given date\n\n## Four Major Reservoirs Water Levels ","791a5767":"**Inferences: 03**\n\n* Due to South-West Monsoon the cheenai city wetted of 4 months from June to August  \n* But,the highest rainfall occurs during October and November of every year due to North-East  monsoon.\n* Intrestingly,rainfall records more in North-East Monsoon  than the South-West.\n* But,in the end of the few-years the Mansoon measures are similar (reduction in rains from north-east monsoon).\n* Personally, I feel only if the city gets some rainfall due to south-west monsoon in the next few days\nit will be able to meet its water needs and get back to normally.\n","94b919f4":"This clearly indicates that there is not enough water in the reservoirs at the beginning of summer 2019 to cope up with the needs of the city. Infact this is the second worst level after 2004 (Also it is important to note that city has grown a lot bigger from 2004 to 2019). \n\nThe city has just had 1000 mcft of water at the beginning of the summer which is much worser than the 2017 levels of 1500 mcft. So just by looking at the very low water level, the water scarcity could have been forecasted without even computing the consumption level per day. \n\n## Current Sources of Water for the City\n\nWith the major source of water for the city fully dry, the water needs is being *partially* met by other sources mentioned above. Of the estimated need of 830 MLD (Million Liters per Day) of water, 500 MLD is being met by following resources.\n\n![Current Water Sources](https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/cities\/chennai\/szuw7e\/article28023480.ece\/ALTERNATES\/FREE_460\/TH18-city-reservoirscol)\n","ddaa3fc3":"Intially, we look data about the water availability in four major reservoirs that supply water to Chennai.

There is no water in any of the major reservoirs\n2. Reservoirs depend on rain for their replenishment. \n\nNext we can look at the rainfall data in these reservoir regions to analyze the rainfall months. Let us take the total monthly rainfall in these reservoir regions and plot the same.\n"}}
