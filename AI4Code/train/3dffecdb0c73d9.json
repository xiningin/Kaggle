They show the spread of the data and any outliers. With `box` from **plotly.express**, we can easily make one. As with most **plotly** visualizations hovering the mouse over the\nplot gives useful information. In this case, it is the min, q1, median, q3, lower fence, upper fence, and the values \nof any outliers.","73191b04":"The above plot is very busy, so we will reduce the number of pokemon in the plot by querying down to only first generation pokemon. This easily down with `query` from the **pandas** library. We use the conditional expression `Generation == 1` to filter out observations or pokemon that do not have True values for the expression. Then we use the same code as above, but with **gen1** instead of **pokemon**.","d102bf10":"With `.describe()` from **numpy**, we can get summary statistics of each numeric variable. The statistics provided are count, mean, standard deviation(std), minimum, 25th percentile, 50th percentile or median, 75th percentile, and maximum.","dd676c4d":"### 3D Scatterplot\n\n3D scatterplots are a cool way to visualize three variables. We use `scatter_3d` to make this plot. This function takes an **x**, **y**, and **z** variable. We also set `color = \"Legendary\"` to visualize the difference between ordinary and legendary pokemon. ","515dac4d":"Using **plotly.graph_objects**, we can make more additions to the plot. We start by assigning **Attack** to be **x**, and **defense** to be **y** for convenience. We set **fig** to be `go.Figure()`. Then we use `add_trace()` to add \na trace to the figure. This will allow us to overlay more layers later on. Then we use `Histogram2dContour()` to add\nthe the density contours. We set the colorscale to be Purples. `reversescale = True` gives darker colors for less areas and lighter shades for more dense areas.","80415688":"##### Loess\n\nWe do not have to stick to a fitted line, but can use a lowess smoother instead. This is done by setting `trendline = \"lowess\"`","8975da12":"Here we add the `facet_col =` parameter to make histograms faceted by what generation the pokemon are from. We keep the color parameter to see where the legendary pokemon fit within each generation's attack value distribution. ","9b879de3":"Here we will add two traces to the figure. We start with the contour histogram as with above, but use the green colorscale. We add a second trace with `add_trace()`. This time we use `Scatter()` from **plotly.graph_objects**. The function parameters are similar here as with the contour histogram, but we set `mode = 'markers'`, and use `marker =` to format the scatterplot points.","428f9c30":"### Scatterplot Matrix","d483198f":"## Overview and Outline\n\nIn this notebook we will cover exploratory data analysis with python. We will focus on the **plotly** library for all of the visualizations. This library makes some of the most aesthetic plots, while providing a wide variety of options. For more extensive information and examples see [plotly](https:\/\/plotly.com\/python\/).\n\n\n### Objectives\n\n- Create univariate plots such as boxplot and histogram\n- Facet plots by categorical variables\n- Create multivariate plots\n- Create interactive visualizations\n\n\n### Libraries Used\n\n- numpy: To compute summary statistics of the data\n- pandas: To read and query the data\n- plotly: To make visually aesthetic and interactive data visualizations","c8e80091":"With the `color =` parameter, we can see where the legendary pokemon fit within the attack value distribution.","3cab9777":"A scatterplot matrix is useful to examine the relationships between multiple sets of variables. The diagonal plots are not useful, as they show a variable vs itself. We use `scatter_matrix` to make the plot. `dimension =` is where we \nspecify the variables we want to examine. We use `color = 'Legendary'` as with the earlier scatterplots to see the differences between ordinary and legendary pokemon with the data.","e309dfa6":"### Bivariate Histograms and Density Visualizations\n\nWith `density_contour` from **plotly**, we can make a density contour plot. We add the univariate histograms to the \nx and y axis","28f337cd":"By adding the `y = ` parameter, we can makes faceted boxplots. From the plot, we can see that generation 1 and 2 have the biggest outliers in HP(Health) values.","72863a64":"### Parallel Categories Diagram\n\nThe parallel categories diagram is similar to the parallel coordinates plot, but it is for categorical variables. We will use **Type 1** and **Type 2** for this plot. We use `parellel_categories` to make the plot, and it follows a \nsimilar format to `parallel_coordinates`","36bf53c3":"## Multivariate Visualizations\n\n\n### Scatterplot\n\nWith scatterplots, we can see linear  and nonlinear relationships between two variables. To make one with **plotly**, we use `scatter` and set `x= 'Defense'`, and `y = 'Sp. Def'`.","80513746":"### Parallel Coordinates Plot\n\nThe parallel coordinates plot is useful to examine relationships between multiple variables at once. To make one, we use `parallel_coordinates`. We use this on all six variables that compose a pokemon's stats. We set `color = 'Generation'`.","a268fd58":"#### Adding a regression line\n\n##### Linear\n\nTo add a regression line to the scatterplot, we set `trendline = \"ols`. OLS stands for ordinary least squares, which corresponds to a fitted line in the case of simple bivariate regression. Hovering the mouse over the trend line gives\nus the R-Squared value, slope, and intercept.","269bcdbe":"### Bubbleplot\n\nFor the bubble plot, we use `scatter`, and add the `size =` parameter. This gives use bubbles with size corresponding to **HP** in our case.","9e87146c":"## Univariate visualizations\n\nUnivariate distributions are good for an initial exploration of the data. With histograms and density plots, we can examine the distribution of the data. This is good for detecting skew, and assessing normality of the data. \n\n\n### Histogram\n\nWith `histogram` we can make a histogram of a variable by entering the data frame **pokemon**, and setting `x = \"Attack\"`. This allows us to see the distribution of Attack stats for all pokemon within the data set.","aeb2e674":"We can do something similar to the facets, by adding the `color =` parameter. This makes our facets different colors, and more visually aesthetic.","f69b0029":"## Getting Started\n\n### Getting the data\n\nThe data for this tutorial is available on kaggle at: [pokemon data](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abcsds\/pokemon)\n\n### Overview of the data\n\nThe dataset contains pokemon ability values. These include HP(Health), Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk(Special Attack), Sp. Def(Special Defense), and Speed. Other information includes the primary type and secondary type. These types include fire, water, psychic, dark, dragon, and many more. The generation is also included, which are numbers from 1 to 6. This tells us which generation or set of games that the pokemon are from. Lastly, there is a boolean variable that tells us whether a pokemon is legendary or not.\n\n### Reading the data\n\nWe use `read_csv` from the **pandas** library to read the data.","c53b0eec":"We can separate the data on whether or not the pokemon is legendary, by setting `color = Legendary`. This will give us two regression lines, one for ordinary pokemon, and the other for legendary pokemon. "}}
