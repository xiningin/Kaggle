The answer is **No**, because we can't determine which all instances will the classifier will use to train itself. As the training and testing data changes, the accuracy will also change. It may increase or decrease. This is known as **model variance**.\n\nTo overcome this and get a generalized model,we use **Cross Validation**.\n\n\n# Cross Validation\n\nMany a times, the data is imbalanced, i.e there may be a high number of class1 instances but less number of other class instances. Thus we should train and test our algorithm on each and every instance of the dataset. Then we can take an average of all the noted accuracies over the dataset. \n\n1)The K-Fold Cross Validation works by first dividing the dataset into k-subsets.\n\n2)Let's say we divide the dataset into (k=5) parts. We reserve 1 part for testing and train the algorithm over the 4 parts.\n\n3)We continue the process by changing the testing part in each iteration and training the algorithm over the other parts. The accuracies and errors are then averaged to get a average accuracy of the algorithm.\n\nThis is called K-Fold Cross Validation.\n\n4)An algorithm may underfit over a dataset for some training data and sometimes also overfit the data for other training set.
