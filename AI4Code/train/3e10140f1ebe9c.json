It is highly likely that these perfect scores are achieved through use of publicly available data listing the names of all those who survived and perished.  This makes a mockery of the leaderboard, and frustrates those keen to assess their performance against others who have participated honestly.  \n\nTo provide some insight into the performance of those adhering to the competition rules, this notebook calculates score percentiles, whilst excluding all participants with an accuracy of 1.  \n\n## Data\n\nThe public leaderboard was downloaded and saved as an Excel file.  This download covered all submissions made since the competition was introduced in 2013.  The file was then imported using Pandas.","48bf4c34":"## Calculate Percentiles\n\nNext, the score percentiles were calculated.","4bbdc644":"From the above, it appears that a score above 0.784680 places a participant in the top 20%.  Meanwhile, a score above 0.832530 in the leading 1%.  Participants adhering to competition rules can therefore be reassured that a good score is likely significantly lower than the public leaderboard might suggest.   \n\nTo complete this post, the percentiles were visualised using Plotly."}}
