The judgement of the model will be based on the training data.\n\nNote that with the simplicity of the data along with the conclusions drawn from it, a neural network may be overkill, but understand this is just to first get introduced to working with data for deep learning, and later, we'll be making use of more advanced data sets.\n\nThe block of code below shows how to generate this dummy data.","cfaa6448":"<font color='blue'>Creating A Validation Set<\/font>","edca40ac":"<font color='orange'>What Is A Validation Set?<\/font>\n\nRecall that we previously built a training set on which we trained our model.

During each epoch, we will see not only the loss and accuracy results for the training set, but also for the validation set.\n\nThis allows us to see how well the model is generalizing on data it wasn\u2019t trained on because, recall, the validation data should not be part of the training data.\n\nThis also helps us see whether or not the model is overfitting.

This type of layer is our standard fully-connected or densely-connected neural network layer. The first required parameter that the Dense layer expects is the number of neurons or units the layer has, and we\u2019re arbitrarily setting this to 16.\n\nAdditionally, the model needs to know the shape of the input data. For this reason, we specify the shape of the input data in the first hidden layer in the model (and only this layer). The parameter called input_shape is how we specify this.\n\nAs discussed, we\u2019ll be training our network on the data that we generated and processed in the previous episode, and recall, this data is one-dimensional. The input_shape parameter expects a tuple of integers that matches the shape of the input data, so we correspondingly specify (1,) as the input_shape of our one-dimensional data.\n\nYou can think of the way we specify the input_shape here as acting as an implicit input layer. The input layer of a neural network is the underlying raw data itself, therefore we don't create an explicit input layer. This first Dense layer that we're working with now is actually the first hidden layer.\n\nLastly, an optional parameter that we\u2019ll set for the Dense layer is the activation function to use after this layer. We\u2019ll use the popular choice of relu.","d41bb0f1":"To this function, we pass in the test samples x, specify a batch_size, and specify which level of verbosity we want from log messages during prediction generation. The output from the predictions won't be relevant for us, so we're setting verbose=0 for no output.\n\nNote that, unlike with training and validation sets, we do not pass the labels of the test set to the model during the inference stage.\n\n","1785508a":"> We reshape the data as a technical requirement just since the fit_transform() function doesn\u2019t accept 1D data by default.","643c7b60":"we specify verbose=2. This just specifies how much output to the console we want to see during each epoch of training. The verbosity levels range from 0 to 2, so we\u2019re getting the most verbose output.\n\nWhen we call fit() on the model, the model trains, and we get this output."}}
