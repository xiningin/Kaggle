A PDP plot takes the average of each sample, while an ICE plot shows the impact on each sample.

Model agnostic interpretability techniques can be used on any model.\n\n### Partial Dependency Plots\n\nPartial Dependency Plots show the impact of changing a single feature on the predicted value \n\n\nTo start I am going to look at the partial dependency plot for the random forest on the feature `cont2` (since it appeared to be the important feature) "}}
