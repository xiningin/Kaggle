Feature engineering and tuning will help performance.\n\n### As it turns out, it is very tough to make a RF algorithm properly extrapolate. Given the decision tree structure, conditional statements which recursively split the intpu space. There are ways to get random forests to predict values that fall outside the range of values of the targets in the training set, however I haven't become privy to these techniques. Take a look at the following: https:\/\/www.statworx.com\/de\/blog\/time-series-forecasting-with-random-forest\/\n\nNevertheless, I will leave this notebook posted as an illustration, and we can consider week 1's submission as a bit of an experiment :-)","1654b30d":"## Import Data","1f0ffbab":"### Train Confirmed Cases Tree","e4dd373f":"### Train Deaths Tree","e008adc8":"### Prepare for Submission","db6591f4":"### Prepare Training","bca8e2bd":"# Data Cleaning"}}
