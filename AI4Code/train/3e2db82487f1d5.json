It indicates the count.\n<br\/>\n\nBut if we want to see the density rather than count, all we have to do is set the 'norm_hist' parameter to True. It will turn the yticks in the range of 0 to 1 and will indicate density.","3ddf2cd8":"<br\/>\n\n## Rotate to vertical\n\nIf situations come up like it would be conveninet to see the distplot vertically, we can also do this by setting the 'vertical' to True.","679a9e89":"<br\/>\n\n## Fit another type of distribution over the existing one\n\nscipy provives us a lot of distributions.
