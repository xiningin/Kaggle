In your research, you discover that these birds typically spend the summer breeding season in the eastern United States, and then migrate to South America for the winter.  But since this bird is under threat of endangerment, you'd like to take a closer look at the locations that these birds are more likely to visit.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qQcS0KM.png\" width=\"1000\"><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nThere are several [protected areas](https:\/\/www.iucn.org\/theme\/protected-areas\/about) in South America, which operate under special regulations to ensure that species that migrate (or live) there have the best opportunity to thrive.  You'd like to know if purple martins tend to visit these areas.  To answer this question, you'll use some recently collected data that tracks the year-round location of eleven different birds.\n\nBefore you get started, run the code cell below to set everything up.","8a122b06":"# Keep going\n\nCreate stunning **[interactive maps](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/interactive-maps)** with your geospatial data.","19f0fa04":"Use the next code cell to create a single plot that shows both: (1) the country boundaries in the `americas` GeoDataFrame, and (2) all of the points in the `birds_gdf` GeoDataFrame.  \n\nDon't worry about any special styling here; just create a preliminary plot, as a quick sanity check that all of the data was loaded properly.  In particular, you don't have to worry about color-coding the points to differentiate between birds, and you don't have to differentiate starting points from ending points.  We'll do that in the next part of the exercise.","1a27dba5":"### 5) Where are the protected areas in South America? (Part 1)\n\nIt looks like all of the birds end up somewhere in South America.  But are they going to protected areas?\n\nIn the next code cell, you'll create a GeoDataFrame `protected_areas` containing the locations of all of the protected areas in South America.  The corresponding shapefile is located at filepath `protected_filepath`.","ac17f80a":"Calculate the total area of South America by following these steps:\n- Calculate the area of each country using the `area` attribute of each polygon (with EPSG 3035 as the CRS), and add up the results.  The calculated area will be in units of square meters.\n- Convert your answer to have units of square kilometeters.","c240dc14":"### 7) What percentage of South America is protected?\n\nYou're interested in determining what percentage of South America is protected, so that you know how much of South America is suitable for the birds.  \n\nAs a first step, you calculate the total area of all protected lands in South America (not including marine area).  To do this, you use the \"REP_AREA\" and \"REP_M_AREA\" columns, which contain the total area and total marine area, respectively, in square kilometers.\n\nRun the code cell below without changes.","54e7c9b5":"Then, to finish the calculation, you'll use the `south_america` GeoDataFrame.  ","37724de1":"### 2) Plot the data.\n\nNext, we load in the `'naturalearth_lowres'` dataset from GeoPandas, and set `americas` to a GeoDataFrame containing the boundaries of all countries in the Americas (both North and South America).  Run the next code cell without changes.","ea3d3221":"Use the next code cell to create a GeoDataFrame `end_gdf` containing the final location of each bird.  \n- The format should be identical to that of `start_gdf`, with two columns (\"tag-local-identifier\" and \"geometry\"), where the \"geometry\" column contains Point objects.\n- Set the CRS of `end_gdf` to `{'init': 'epsg:4326'}`.","fb02ff33":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

(Part 2)\n\nUse the GeoDataFrames from the question above (`path_gdf`, `start_gdf`, and `end_gdf`) to visualize the paths of all birds on a single map.  You may also want to use the `americas` GeoDataFrame.","35810067":"Run the code cell below to calculate the percentage of South America that is protected.","46b221ed":"### 8) Where are the birds in South America?\n\nSo, are the birds in protected areas?  \n\nCreate a plot that shows for all birds, all of the locations where they were discovered in South America.  Also plot the locations of all protected areas in South America.\n\nTo exclude protected areas that are purely marine areas (with no land component), you can use the \"MARINE\" column (and plot only the rows in `protected_areas[protected_areas['MARINE']!='2']`, instead of every row in the `protected_areas` GeoDataFrame).","e491868c":"**This notebook is an exercise in the [Geospatial Analysis](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/geospatial-analysis) course.

Each bird has several measurements, collected at different times of the year.\n\nUse the next code cell to create a GeoDataFrame `birds`.  \n- `birds` should have all of the columns from `birds_df`, along with a \"geometry\" column that contains Point objects with (longitude, latitude) locations.  \n- Set the CRS of `birds` to `{'init': 'epsg:4326'}`.","910d73a9":"### 6) Where are the protected areas in South America?

It uses the `LineString()` method to create a LineString object from a list of Point objects.\n- `start_gdf` contains the starting points for each bird."}}
