Create cells freely to explore your data. One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations in an initial notebook. These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report.\n\n> **Tip**: Make sure that you keep your reader informed on the steps that you are taking in your investigation. Follow every code cell, or every set of related code cells, with a markdown cell to describe to the reader what was found in the preceding cell(s). Try to make it so that the reader can then understand what they will be seeing in the following cell(s).\n\n### Data Cleaning :\n\n#### We will make Data cleaning for each question","78da69cc":"<a id='wrangling'><\/a>\n## Data Wrangling\n\n> **Tip**: In this section of the report, you will load in the data, check for cleanliness, and then trim and clean your dataset for analysis.

You will find tips in quoted sections like this to help organize your approach to your investigation. Before submitting your project, it will be a good idea to go back through your report and remove these sections to make the presentation of your work as tidy as possible. First things first, you might want to double-click this Markdown cell and change the title so that it reflects your dataset and investigation.\n\n# Project: Investigate TMDB dataset\n\n## Table of Contents\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#intro\">Introduction<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wrangling\">Data Wrangling<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#eda\">Exploratory Data Analysis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusions\">Conclusions<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>","3e81f820":"## Here We will Ask two questions:\n<ol>\n<li>How many of the movies Succeded or Failed ?!<\/li>\n<li>What are the net earnings of top ten directors ?!<\/li>\n<\/ol>","9f053621":"From df.info() , we have no null values , However a revenue or budget with 0 is considered a null value so I will drop them"}}
