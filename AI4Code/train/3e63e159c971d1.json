We can suppose that these enters are like missing values so, in order to convert the column into float, I'm going to substitute this value with 0.0","af3e6e3a":"In this notebook I will exlpore the phenomenon of fatal police shootings in the U.S. with data provided by the Washington Post : https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/graphics\/investigations\/police-shootings-database\/ (updated to June 1st) and other sources. The analysis is purely exploratory and the considerations are personal and based on the data sources. I will start by firstly analize some social variables and then combining this with the data of the Washington Post I'll try to extract other useful information. Please consider that I'm a beginner data science student and this is one of my first project. Feel free to comment with any piece of advice you have to help me improve. If you are a beginner as well I hope you'll find something usefull in this notebook. ","f22cc68b":"Here we can see cases for single cities. Here too California seems to have the majority of cases, in particular in the metropolitan area of Los Angeles. We have 90 cases in Dublin, NC. In the state if Whashington there are two cities with high values: Tacoma and Spokane. In particular, in May 2021, in the city of TAcoma 2 officers have been charged for the murder of Manuel Ellis (https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2021\/may\/27\/manuel-ellis-tacoma-three-officers-charged-death); Spokane has the 3rd most deadly police force in America (https:\/\/www.scarspokane.org\/police-brutality). Let's check if south states have more cases even in relative terms. ","6ee6ee51":"This plot is ordered by the share of white population - as it is the most common race in the US - for a better visualization.  ","ce11ed47":"Here we can see that some of sud states (California, Arizona, Texas and Florida) have registred a high number of cases, as well as Whashington and Colorado. Let's see how's the situation city-wise.","ea3dcc29":"# Conclusions","8e286905":"By iteration, I discovered that in this dataframe we have also some 'semi-numeric' values (2,500- and 250,000) to express very high and very love incomes. I have to remove this values for the purpose of the analysis despite the loss of some date (in particular the very high incomes). Again for the plot, I will aggregate the average level by State.","3644f5a7":"Most of the victims were actually armes.\n\nAccording to most of statistics on crimial rate, male tend to commint more crime than women ( https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/424145\/prevalence-rate-of-violent-crime-in-the-us-by-gender\/). Let's see the gender composition of our data.","706fce18":"First I'll convert the date column into datetime objects and then I'll add the colum Year and Month to the dataframe and finally I'll aggregate the data to plot them","19ac456e":"Here we can just see the US states ordered by poverty rate in decreasing order. Right now is not very helpful but we will use it's going to be handy for future considerations. \nNow let's see how the poverty rate is distributed.","0211367c":"We can see that the number of deaths due to fatal shothings has been stable during years. Off course the value is lower for 2021 because we don't have all data available yet. Now we can visualize the month distribution. ","2239e52c":"This plot is wrong. In fact it doesn't take into account the race share of population. Off course most of the victims are white because, as we have seen previously, whites are the largest share of US population. To plot a more truthful visualization let's create a series of the race shares in the USA with data from:  https:\/\/data.census.gov\/cedsci\/table?q=Hispanic%20or%20Latino&tid=ACSDP1Y2019.DP05&hidePreview=false (updated to 2019).","c3f8074f":"# Combined Analysis","0e98d6cf":"Taking into account the population, we can see that Colorado and Maryland&Wisconsin are the state with most cases.","f8e0a66a":"From this plots we can see that, as we already knew, the majority of population is white. The second most represented group are african american and only in a few state we have a large share of hispanics. We can see that the States in which we have a large share of native americans, are to ones with Indian Reservations (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Indian_reservations_in_the_United_States) except for Alaska. We can see this in the distribution plot too. In fact some ethnic groups are higly concentred in few States (like native americans and asians), whereas others are more homogeneously across the nation whit occasional peaks (like white and african american).\n\nNow let's move on with the fatal police shooting analysis.","2e63146e":"On the first row we can see that cities with higher poverty rates don't register more cases. As we have seen before, the percentage of people ho completed HS is homogeneous across USA and infact most cases are registred around 80%. Finally we have most cases between \\\\$ 25,000 and \\\\$ 50,000 dollars.\n\nOn the second row we can see that we register a lot of cases for a high percentage of white population. This is normal because as we have seen before white is the largest ethinc group of US. We can also see thath we don't have more cases when we have a larger share of african american or hispanic population, even though we have some interesting points. \n\nLet's visualize some data on maps.\n","79f658ce":"This plot isn't tellign anything interesting, in fact  as we can see the High School graduated rate is almost the same in all the states. However I expect to see a positive correlation between this data and the median income, let's check if it is true.","7b7995d1":"Most of the victims were men. Now let's move with the last part of the analysis.","2693f1e1":"Each marker represents a month in the year. We don't have seasonality - as we would expect - nonetheless we can see some peaks during time: July 2015, March 2018, December 2019 and May 2020 (when the homicide of George Floyd occurred as well.)\n\nNow let's see to which ethnicity belong the victims.","96d3c525":"So, in proportion, most of the victims are african american, followed by native american despite the fact they represent only 0.9% of total US population.\n\nNow we will visualize a distribution of the age of the victims.","098e488e":"We don't have null values but every column has an object data type. We have to convert them in order to perform some calculations. Let's check if these columns are formatted as object beacuse not all values in them are numbers. ","2163c14b":"We can see that the most common range is between \\\\$ 40,000 and \\\\$ 50,000 where we also have the median. If we look at tha bar plots we can see that New Jersey is the state with the highest median income and the lowest poverty rate. It is logical to think that this two variables are positively correlated. We can check this correlation in a plot.

So we could say that the US poverty rate in not very high, however we have to consider that the poverty rate is not an accurate index as it suffers from sampling bias (https:\/\/blogs.worldbank.org\/developmenttalk\/why-measuring-poverty-impacts-more-difficult-simply-using-score-cards).\n\nLet's move on with the analysis of th median income.","4bdbe2ff":"In this dataset we a have a lot of interesting variables that can provide a good analysis, however we will combine some of these variables with the data sets used in the social analsys.First of all, let's see these variables.","845091c3":"* Since 2015 there's been no reduction in fatal shothing cases.\n* Despite the fact afro americans represent only 12.4% of the population, they are the most involved ethnicity in fatal shoothing cases.\n* Afro american victims are also younger. \n* Most of the victims are men \n* 87.5% of the vistims were armed.\n* We have significantly less cases while officers were wearing body cameras.\n* Colorado is the most dangerous state, having a high rate of cases compared to its population.\n","9fbf004f":"* Only in 20% of the cases victims showed signs of mental illnes\n* Most of the fatal shoothings occured when police was not wearing body cameras\n* The threat level was high in most of the cases\n* The manner of death actually is not very useful\n\nNow let's see if thee victims were armed.","c324cb50":"Most of the victims are quite young since the most common age range is 20 - 40; nevertheless we also have some cases for older age.
