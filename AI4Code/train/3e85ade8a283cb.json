Dropping, renaming, and creating columns in pandas dataframe\n    2. Counting elements' frequency in specific column\n    3. Using various plotting functions in seaborn for visualizing    \nAfter following notebook codes, you will be able to perform basic operations to prepare to do 'something' with given data, or getting an insight from data by visualizing it.
