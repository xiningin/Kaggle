Country ISO Code - ISO code for the country;\n- Date - date for the data entry; for some of the dates we have only the daily vaccinations, for others, only the (cumulative) total;\n- Total number of vaccinations - this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country;\n- Total number of people vaccinated - a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people;\n- Total number of people fully vaccinated - this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme;\n- Daily vaccinations (raw) - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date\/country;\n- Daily vaccinations - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date\/country;\n- Total vaccinations per hundred - ratio (in percent) between vaccination number and total population up to the date in the country\n- Total number of people vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population immunized and total population up to the date in the country;\n- Total number of people fully vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population fully immunized and total population up to the date in the country;\n- Number of vaccinations per day - number of daily vaccination for that day and country;\n- Daily vaccinations per million - ratio (in ppm) between vaccination number and total population for the current date in the country;\n- Vaccines used in the country - total number of vaccines used in the country (up to date);\n- Source name - source of the information (national authority, international organization, local organization etc.);\n- Source website - website
