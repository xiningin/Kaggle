A trained neural network performs differently each time you train it since the weights are randomly initialized. Therefore, to assess a neural network's performance, we must train it many times and take an average of accuracy. The ensemble in this notebook was trained and evaluated 100 times!! (on the original MNIST dataset with 60k\/10k split using the code template [here][1] on GitHub.) Below is a histogram of its accuracy.  \n  \nThe maximum accuracy of an individual CNN was 99.81% with average accuracy 99.641% and standard deviation 0.047. The maximum accuracy of an ensemble of fifteen CNNs was 99.79% with average accuracy 99.745% and standard deviation 0.020.  \n  \n![hist](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/histBoth5.png)\n\n## Data augmentation hyper-parameters\nTo determine the best hyper-parameters for data augmentation, grid search was used. Below is the accuracy of an ensemble (of 15 CNNs) with various data augmentation settings. The columns are `rotation` and `zoom`. The rows are `w_shift` and `h_shift`. For example: row 2, column 4 is `r = 15, z = 0.15, w = 0.1, h = 0.1`. Each cell is the average of 6 trials:  \n  \n            0      5     10      15     20     25     30  \n    0     99.70  99.70  99.70  99.70  99.69  99.65  99.62\n    0.1   99.73  99.73  99.75  99.75  99.72  99.67  99.64 \n    0.2                 99.72  99.72\n\nBelow is the accuracy of a single CNN with various data augmentation settings. Each cell is the average of 30 trials.  \n  \n            0      5     10      15     20     25     30  \n    0     99.57  99.58  99.62  99.62  99.62  99.57  99.52\n    0.1   99.62  99.63  99.65  99.65  99.63  99.58  99.52  \n    0.2                 99.62  99.62\n  \nLastly, I calculated the variance of the MNIST training images. The average center in pixels = (14.9, 15.2). The standard deviation of centers in pixels = (0.99, 1.34). That means that a setting of `w_shift = 0.07` together with `h_shift = 0.09` contains 95% of the centers. Similar analysis shows that a setting of `rotation_range = 13` together with `zoom_range = 0.13` contains 95% of the images.   \n  \nBased on this analysis, the settings of `rotation_range = 10, zoom_range = 0.10, w_shift = 0.1, and h_shift = 0.1` were chosen.\n\n[1]:https:\/\/github.com\/cdeotte\/MNIST-CNN-99.75","fccce7ca":"# Kaggle Result\n![result](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/MNIST-result-DA4a.png)\nWow, its amazing that convolution neural networks can classify handwritten digits so accurately; 99.75% is as good as a human can classify!!
