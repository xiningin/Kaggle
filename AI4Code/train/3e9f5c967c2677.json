For example:","8b1534e4":"## Sorting\n\nGrouping returns data in index order, not in value order. That is to say, when outputting the result of a `groupby`, the order of the rows is dependent on the values in the index, not the data.\n\nBut you can sort the data with the `sort_values` method.","d8c94b80":"**[Pandas Micro-Course Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/pandas)**\n\n---\n","4e84f762":"Another `groupby` method worth mentioning is `agg`, which lets you run a bunch of different functions on your `DataFrame` simultaneously. For example, we can generate a simple statistical summary of the dataset as follows:","85a65687":"Multi-indices have several methods for dealing with their tiered structure which are absent for single-level indices. They also require two levels of labels to retrieve a value, an operation that looks something like this. Dealing with multi-index output is a common \"gotcha\" for users new to `pandas`.\n\nThe use cases for a `MultiIndex` are detailed alongside detailed instructions on using them in the [MultiIndex \/ Advanced Selection](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/advanced.html) section of the `pandas` documentation.\n\nBut the `MultiIndex` method you will use most often is the one for converting back to a regular index, the `reset_index` method:","f6b5450b":"`sort_values` defaults to an ascending sort, where the lowest values go first. Most of the time we want a descending sort however, where the higher numbers go first. That goes thusly:","f3322121":"Effective use of `groupby` will allow you to do lots of really powerful things with your dataset.","35656313":"You can think of each group we generate as being a slice of our `DataFrame` containing only data with values that match. This `DataFrame` is accessible to us directly using the `apply` method, and we can then manipulate the data in any way we see fit. For example, here's one way of selecting the name of the first wine reviewed from each winery in the dataset:","fc487e7f":"To sort by index values, use the companion method `sort_index`. This method has the same arguments and default order:","b55840b8":"## Grouping\n\nGrouping can be used for many purposes, but it may help to start with a single example to see what it does. You've already used the `value_counts` function. We can replicate what `value_counts` does using `groupby` by doing the following:","10091c05":"---\n**[Pandas Micro-Course Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/pandas)**\n\n","a3ddb0ce":"**`groupby` created groups of reviews with the same point values. Then, for each group, it counted the size of the group.**\n\n**In this case, `count` was the \"aggregation\" for each group**. But there are others. For example, to get the cheapest wine in each point value category, we can do the following:","0a670dba":"For even more fine-grained control, you can also group by more than one column. For an example, here's how we would pick out the best wine by country _and_ province:","33174411":"You'll probably be shocked how useful `groupby` is as you work with data in practical applications. This lesson will show you how to use it with examples from the wine review dataset.","821e1faa":"Finally, know that you can sort by more than one column at a time:"}}
