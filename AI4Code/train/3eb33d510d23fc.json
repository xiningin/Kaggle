The 'airTemperature' was deemed to be suitable to find the hottest region.","57f77075":"**Limitations**\n\nFrom the Building Data Genome Project 2, the team noted that the open data provided did not have enough information for our scope of research of the buildings' utilities and functions. This affected the accuracy of results found and the team had to create certain reasonable assumptions for further analysis. From this lack of information, the team was also unable to deduce the size of each building's rooftop where the green roofs will be implemented. Certain buildings may have different utilities whereby the area stated in the data set is not the actual measurement of the rooftop space. This variable affects the size of green roofs to be implemented, resulting in a different savings amount of chilled water consumption.\n\nAdditionally, the year selected for the hottest temperature in the regions was 2016. However, updated research found that the hottest temperature recorded was in fact 2020. The team utilised 2016 for research as 2020's data was not available in the open data set, and 2016 was the second hottest year to be recorded historically. \n\n**Future Work**\n\nThe next step from our research onwards can include the simulation of green roofs to find out the actual visualisation of these buildings and a further in-depth breakdown of the potential energy savings. The models and methods available consist of white box and black box testing.\n\nWhite Box testing can be used to focus on the code structures, branches, paths, and various conditions. This method checks the internal functioning of the system and software to simulate respective variables of the business idea. Algorithm testing can be utilised here with the inclusion of automation as well. In this case, further programming can be enhanced to see the changes in different paths or conditions set. A wide and deep knowledge of programming is required here for accurate implementation of green roof simulation.\n\nAs for Black Box testing, it is of a higher-level testing as compared to White Box testing. This method of testing focuses on the behaviour of the software from an external or end-user perspective. It can be applied to virtually every level of software testing: unit, integration, system, and acceptance. Additionally, it is not as time-consuming as White Box testing, and the methodology is data-driven with functional testing. External expectations of this model should be laid out for the green roof simulation, along with the requirement specifications. Raw data from the open data set can be used for this method of testing and its regression can also be determined from these.\n\nOur AI department may extend further research to determine the viability and feasibility of the implementation of green roofs on their buildings. They may weigh the initial costs to potential long-term savings from chilled water consumption, contributing to the overall energy consumption of the building. Potential researchers may also delve into other aspects of building energy from the intervention of these green roofs.","14cf3ad3":"From ASU's website (https:\/\/students.asu.edu\/registrar-semester-calendar) we have found out the timetables of when students need to attend classes.  \n\nSemester were split via seasons namely spring, summer and fall and there are no lessons during the winter. Within each semester they were further split into 3 terms (A, B and C.) For our investigation we took the start date of A and the end date of C for all 3 semester since lessons were ongoing in all 3 terms.\n\n*need to add in the source of where ur got the dates from, and probably also explain which sessions u took the dates from.*","8874dc8f":"By sorting the values, we have identified Fox_utility_Marian to be the building that consumes the highest energy for chilled water. \nSorting values will give us the buildings that have the highest consumption in descending order. However, it is necessary to note that identifying the target building by its consumption is not enough.\nTo successfully implement a greenroof, we also need to know how much roof space is available for use, as it might already be filled with other utilities. This makes the sqm measurement less useful as that is not an indicator of the available roof space. \n\nIn addition, the primary space usage of the building is another factor to be considered. As Fox_utility_Marian is a central plant, we are making assumption that the large energy taken by this building was for the purpose of supplying chilled water to the buildings in its vicinity. While it is still viable to propose a greenroof for a central plant building, it would make more sense to propose the greenroof on a user building. Hence, **Fox_lodging_Wallace** was chosen as our main target building as it is next in line on chilled water consumption.","d4ab91da":"**Air Temperature**\n\n2020 was one of the hottest years in recorded history, according to data released by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). By NASA\u2019s reckoning, it tied with 2016 for the hottest year in the books, while NOAA placed it second.\n\nIn 2016, the contiguous United States (CONUS) average temperature was 54.9\u00b0F (12.7\u00b0C).\n\nThe year started with one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1os on record ushering in Pacific moisture and much needed drought relief to parts of the West, in the form of high elevation snowpack and valley rains. Abnormal warmth in the late winter\/early spring period prematurely melted some of the early season snowpack gains across the Sierra. Therefore, exceptional drought conditions remained throughout the year much of the West, and California in particular (National Centers for Environmental Information, 2017).\n\nNational Centers for Environmental Information.

Meanwhile weekends may have much higher usage as students stay in their lodging. \n\nHowever, we think that energy usage will even out due to the fact students do not have lessons everyday and students may still want to stay in their lodging on weekends. The code below is to investigate whether the day being a weekday or weekend is a confounder and to prove to our clients that the green roof will be a worthwhile investment. ","f9ef8460":"Now we want to find out if seasons are a confounder in energy usage in the building","cbf9d6dd":"**Literature Review:**\n\nGreen roofs have several environmental benefits, such as improving building energy efficiency. The simulations on conventional and green roofs in a temperate French climate suggest that green roofs are thermally beneficial for hot, temperate, and cold European climates (Jaffal et al., 2012). In the study, the impact of the green roofs on indoor air temperature and cooling and heating demand was analyzed. With a green roof, the summer indoor air temperature was decreased by 2 \u00b0C, and the annual energy demand was reduced by 6%.\n\nGreen roofs help improve storm water management, as well as reduce air pollution, and noise. They also increase vegetal and animal biodiversity in cities, and reduce a city\u2019s carbon footprint by converting carbon dioxide to oxygen through photosynthesis. They are able to improve building energy efficiency by enhancing the heat transfer through the roofs. At the city level, green roofs contribute to the mitigation of the urban heat island effect. The reduction of the summer temperature around green roofs improves the efficiency of HVAC systems by providing a local free cooling effect to the fluid before it returns to the chiller (Jaffal et al., 2012). A passive cooling effect was observed in the summer, and the daily heat losses through the roof were increased by nearly a factor of three with a green roof. This cooling makes green roofs an effective solution for the enhancement of thermal comfort and the reduction of cooling demand.\n\nThe enhancement of thermal comfort and reduction of cooling demand are more effective when the climate is hot. However, a significant reduction of the heating demand can be observed in cold climates. For hot climates, green roofs can increase the heating demand, but this increase is still minor when compared with the cooling demand reduction. The total energy demand decreases with green roofs in hot, temperate and cold climates. This general improvement makes them an energy-efficient solution for a wide range of European climates.\n\nGHG impacts are dominated by the material production and use phases. Energy impacts are dominated by the use phase, with urban heat island (UHI) impacts being an order of magnitude higher than direct building impacts. The quantification of private and social costs and benefits should help guide green roof policy (Blackhurst et al., 2010).\n\nJaffal, I., Ouldboukhitine, S. E., & Belarbi, R. (2012).
