Narrowing things down even further to a Ford midsize sedan in 'excellent' condition we see a clear change in price. Price means are slightly more skewed due to the smaller amount of data being processed, but its clear that the \\$15,000 average price for the hypothetical 55,000 mile car from earlier is not accurate. If said car is a midsize sedan built by Ford in 'excellent' condition, a fair price would be around \\$11,000.","99d257ee":"Lets start with something simple. This category compares mean price by odometer for every vehicle in the dataset. Lets analyze a hypothetical car with 55,000 miles (falling within the 46,000 and 69,400 miles category). A fantastic price would be around \\$3,250 (mean of cars within 0 and 10th percentile of price). An average price would be around \\$15,000, while a poor price would be anything above $20,000\n\nAlso, quick explanation as to why the first row of low odometers is far cheaper than it should be. I've spent lots of time pouring over craigslist cars+trucks over the past months due to this project and several others, and it's pretty common for used car dealerships and even individuals to list the odometer as 0 even though the car is clearly used. Unfortunately it's pretty hard to clean that data as there are plenty of new cars on craigslist as well.","a4525202":"Say we want to find a reasonable price to pay for a used car. One way to do this is compare prices by other numeric factors, in this case either mileage accumulated or year of manufacturing. A reasonable approach would be to compare these two variables using percentiles in order to see what the going rate for a car in the 20th-30th percentile of miles accumulated is on average. The program above takes this one step further by not only calculating a single mean for each category, but instead displaying another 10 price percentiles per categorical percentile. This sounds somewhat complicated but visually it makes far more sense.","b477f324":"For a final refinement step, we can focus exclusively on cars manufactured in or after 2015. There is a slight increase in price for our lovely 55,000 mile sedan but it's not a huge jump given that mileage is obviously static and difference in wear between a 2010 and a 2015 sedan both driven 55,000 miles presumably  won't surmount to much. The size of the data we're dealing with has also shrunk quite a bit, down to ~10,000 which is certainly more refined than ~1,700,000.\n\nOverall this is a helpful tool to determine what a fair selling (or buying) price is when hunting for used cars. Feel free to explore the dataset using other refinement combinations!","c2aff958":"The previous table is fine, but comparing prices\/odometers of every car out of 1.7 million is pretty generic. In order to find results specific to one's desired car, refinement is necessary. Here's a table showing only Fords."}}
