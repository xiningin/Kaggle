that a player is in FIFA21, while potential, when you already know age and overall, seems to be quite weak. However, this model have a false positve rate of 60% and false negative rate of 10%, so there's a lot of variables that this model doesn't consider and should be viewed with some scepticism\n\nFinally, I want to look at some statistics related to the nationality of the players in FIFA21. First, I want to count how many players of each nationality there is in the dataset and present the countries with the most and least players","4e338fe3":"As there's likely a high degree of correlation between overall and potential among all but the youngest players, it makes sense that potential also seems to predict the probability that a player is removed from FIFA19. A worse predictor than overall or a 2nd degree polynomial fitted to age, but still good predictor.\n\nIn order to see how well these 3 factors (age, overall and potential) predict whether a player is in FIFA 21, one can build a model that predicts whether or not a player is in FIFA21, based on their statistics in FIFA19. A simple model is do a logistic regression, which is regression on the form $\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1*x_1*...}}$. The result of this regression is presented below","45ad67f4":"Now, I want to count how many countries have x amount of players","6da82f55":"Looking at this, it seems like most players that were removed is either young players that didn't break through or old players that retired.

Finally, I will look at how potential predicts removal of players","a7b4849f":"I am wondering if there's something that predicts players being dropped. My first idea is to look at age, as I am thinking that most of the players removed are retired from football","87296e90":"We can then show all players dropped for FIFA21 and new players in FIFA19 in tabel","57ab987b":"As this table shows, the distribution is very left skewed, with there being more countries with 5 players than countries with more than 950 players.\n\nFinally, I will create a histogram of how many countries have how many players in FIFA 21"}}
