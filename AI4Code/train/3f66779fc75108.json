For instance, the text of the description for Senior Systems Analyst states the requirement of \u201cTwo years of full-time paid experience in a class at the level of Systems Analyst.\u201d In this case, the lower job class of Systems Analyst is explicitly mentioned in the description for Senior Systems Analyst. The ability to promote between these job classes is thus stated explicitly.\nNote that you will not be evaluated on the extraction of implicit promotional pathways, which are promotions that are allowed by the job bulletins\u2019 qualitative descriptions of duties in one class that happen to satisfy the requirements of another class. For instance, the job class of Senior Administrative Clerk has a requirement of \u201cOne year of full-time paid office clerical experience.\u201d Based on the job bulletin for the class of Administrative Clerk, we can infer that an employee who has worked for one year as an Administrative Clerk is eligible for a promotion to Senior Administrative Clerk; however, this inference relies on our semantic understanding of \u201cclerical experience,\u201d as well as our knowledge that employees in the class of Administrative Clerk perform clerical work. In this case, the lower class (Administrative Clerk) is not mentioned explicitly in the section titled \u201cPREVIOUS REQUIREMENT(S)\/MINIMUM QUALIFICATION(S)\u201d of the bulletin for the higher class (Senior Administrative Clerk); the promotion must be inferred using textual analysis. Although you will not be evaluated on the identification of implicit promotional pathways, competitors are nonetheless invited to explore and report on methods for completing this task.\nFrom the combination of explicit pathways, you can ultimately construct a directed graph that represents all the promotional pathways that an employee can traverse from a given job class, where each node in the graph represents a job class, and each directed edge represents a promotion from one job class to another. For example, the database would encode the fact that an employee can promote from the job class of Systems Analyst to the job class of Senior Systems Analyst (see the diagram below).\n\nAll such promotions could thus be represented in a single directed graph, representing all the City\u2019s job classes and the allowable promotions between them. You are invited to explore ways to visualize this directed graph.\n\nYour kernel should structure all explicit pathways. The structured data that you derive should also allow you to programmatically identify specific employees who are eligible for specific promotions, assuming that you\u2019d have access to a database that contains each employee\u2019s current job class and their duration of employment. For example, given the knowledge that Jackie has been a Systems Analyst for 2.4 years, your system should be able to alert Jackie to the fact that she is now eligible for a promotion to Senior Systems Analyst. If a given promotion requires more than just a number of years of employment in a specific class \u2014 e.g., if an advanced degree is also required \u2014 then your system should be able to alert Jackie not only that she\u2019s met the years-of-experience requirement but also that the advanced degree is also required for the promotion. If an employee is eligible to promote to multiple job classes, this fact should be identified as well.","39b3b905":"## Comments\n\nFrom the problem description above this looks like a really fun problem with lots of room for creativity. I think its well thought out, I am not sure why the forums are offline, though it looks like there are several angry people there. Please don't purposely put forums offline, with negative comments, it is not good practice. \n\nThe key part is. \n\n> All such promotions could thus be represented in a single directed graph, representing all the City\u2019s job classes and the allowable promotions between them.

This looks like a difficult problem. I am going to aim for a general toy solution first, which other people can build off of by adding details. "}}
