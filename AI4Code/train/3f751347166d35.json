We have a total of 03 files in our project. \n1. *train.csv* -- This file contains data we have to use for training of the model. \n2. *test.csv* --  This file contains test data that we have to use tomake predictions for test data using our model\n3. submission_sample.csv -- After we have predicted labels (0,1,2,3 etc) for test data using our model, we need to submit our results on Kaggle. This file provides format according to which, the submission has to be done\n4.
