Once the seeds are sown, he works days and nights to make sure that he cultivates a good harvest at the end of season. A good harvest is ensured by several factors such as availability of water, soil fertility, protecting crops from rodents, timely use of pesticides & other useful chemicals and nature. While a lot of these factors are difficult to control for, the amount and frequency of pesticides is something the farmer can control.\n\nPesticides are also special, because while they protect the crop with the right dosage. But, if you add more than required, they may spoil the entire harvest. A high level of pesticide can deem the crop dead \/ unsuitable for consumption among many outcomes. This data is based on crops harvested by various farmers at the end of harvest season. To simplify the problem, you can assume that all other factors like variations in farming techniques have been controlled for.\n\n- You need to daetermine the outcome of the harvest season, i.e. whether the crop would be healthy (alive), damaged by pesticides or damaged by other reasons.","a9ad4e9b":"<center><img src='https:\/\/germistoncitynews.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2017\/01\/st0290.png' height=300 width=500\/><\/center>","7ba443ae":"## Hint 3 : \n\n__Public and Private split__\n\n- The public leaderboard is based on __30% of test data__, while final rank would be decided on remaining __70% of test data__ (which is private leaderboard).\n\n- So There is a high chance of getting stuck in to a ```overfitting trap```. \n\nHow to avoid this- \n\nCheck [This notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/vin1234\/starter-janatahack-demand-forecasting) in the very end a explained a good technique to deal with overfitting.\n\n","774dd5d5":"## Let's Begin\n> In this notebook i provide you some hints if you implement them in your notebook,Surely gonna get better results.(because i already implemented and bla.. bla... ....).\n> \n> So keep your eye on given hints.","4018bf2f":"## Model creation","af6a49f0":"## Hint:\n\nInstead of using ```auto``` sampling strategy make you own strategy to balance the data.","d8c3b4c8":"# Join the trian and test data together ","0fd9c66c":"one hot encoding Junction","53186bcc":"## Make final prediction using LGBM","a28273db":"- Can see a high data imbalance in the target variable.\n\n## Hint1: \n\n- This suggest accuracy is not a better model evaluation metric. \n\nI recommend looking at the following performance measures that can give more insight into the accuracy of the model than traditional classification accuracy:\n\n- ```Confusion Matrix```: A breakdown of predictions into a table showing correct predictions (the diagonal) and the types of incorrect predictions made (what classes incorrect predictions were assigned).\n- ```Precision```: A measure of a classifiers exactness.\n- ```Recall```: A measure of a classifiers completeness\n- ```F1 Score (or F-score)```: A weighted average of precision and recall.\n\n\n## Hint2:\n\n- To deal with the Imbalance \n\n    - I prefer SMOTE.\n    - For other techniques check [this blog](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/tactics-to-combat-imbalanced-classes-in-your-machine-learning-dataset\/)","7e540f48":"Don't hesitate to leave me a comment or upvote if you found it useful.
