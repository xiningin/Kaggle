I just implement it to show you how easy to implement such a function instead of dealing with algebraic equations to get the derivative of a function. It may be less efficient however, it is much clear than the algebraic ones.\n\n### Feedforward Algorithm\n\nNaturally, there are one or more inputs to a neuron and one or more outputs from a neuron. Then, **how does a neuron deal with so many inputs?** The answer is the neuron sums up all the inputs. Then, it gives the sum to the activation function and the result is called as the output. From this perspective, the operations are so simple. Let me throw some little complexity in that. **How can we connect neurons?** We connect neurons with **weights**. They are simple lines that have some numbers or coefficients in them. Most of the time weights are indicated by letter $w_{2,3}$. This means that the weights between node 2 in a layer and node 3 in the next layer. When an output of a neuron passes through a weight, it is multiplied with the **weight** and becomes an input for the next neuron. This is the crucial part of a neural network. Because learning in neural networks happen in weights. The little nudges in weights are actually called the learning process. But before moving onto the learning, let's do some examples.\n\nConsider the following neuron.\n![Simple Neuron](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/4TLFbxB\/Untitled-Diagram.png)\nBy using the previous information, calculate the output $y$.","d5b048d5":"We can define a line that splits these two bugs from each other. The process is almost exactly same with the previous example.

Let's make a just enough classifier by targeting $y = 1.1$ instead of $y = 1$. Let's recalculate our error according to this.","de28969b":"This gives us 50.0. Actually this is not a bad result. But we need to quantify how bad or good this result is. How far is our estimation from the real one? This is called the **error**.\n$$error = truth - calculated$$\nIn our example,\n$$error = 62.137 - 50 = 12.137$$\nThis result tells us we are wrong by 12.137. Let's convert this formula to a function for later use.","d4de0208":"## Neurons\nNeurons don't permit the signals pass through directly, but they wait the signals to grow or pass a **threshold** value.\n\n>A function that takes the input signal and generates an output signal, but takes into account some kind of threshold is called an **activation function**.\n>\n> -- *Tariq Rashid*\n\nThere are many activation functions. Maybe the simplest one is the **step function** (or Heaviside function). The following Python code shows a step function in action.","def8056a":"The above example might be the simplest ever computation machine. However, it proves the point that the algorithm used to generate the output is fixed. It will never change whatever the input is. The following image represents this type of machines.\n\n![A black-box model](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/vB4SqQ5\/black-box.png)\n\nOur next example will a little bit more complicated than the previous one. It is a machine that converts kilometers to miles (1). The relationship between kilometers and miles is **linear**. Linear means the change on value for either of them directly affects the value of other one. For example, if you double the number in miles, the same distance in kilometers is also doubled.\n\nThis relationship is very similar to a line's equation in a 2-dimensional space. Equation of a line in a 2-dimensional space is defined as the following equation.\n$$y = m*x + b$$\nNow, let's write the equation for the conversion.\n$$miles = kilometers * c$$\nIf you take the $b = 0$ for this example (the line will always pass through the origin), both equations are basically the same. In conversion equation, miles depends on kilometers times a constant $c$. But we don't know the constant at this time. Although we don't know the constant, we know some true km-miles pairs. Let's say we know the following ones.\n\n| Kilometers | Miles |\n| -------------- | ------- |\n| 0 | 0 |\n| 100 | 62.137 |\n\nTable 1: Known samples for kilometers to miles.\n\nThis means that we have a baseline to compare our machine's performance. Then, what are we waiting for? Let's give a random value to $c$ and compare the output with the known ones. Here, I will also choose the same value as of the book. Let's evaluate the machine with $c = 0.5$ and see what happens.","133848ac":"We may overshoot the correct answer, right? It may be good to increase $c$ not by 0.1 but 0.01.","372d595b":"You can see that a neuron fires only if the input signal can pass the threshold value (of 1). By definition the step function is differentiable. The derivative of step function is the Dirac Delta function.

So, how do we remember each of the training samples? Actually, the solution is easy. We give weights to each of the samples. The weight of effect of each sample is called **learning rate** in statistical learning (machine learning). We will refer *learning rate* as $L$ in our future examples. Let's update our previous update formula with the addition of *learning rate*.\n$$\\Delta A = L\\left(\\frac{E}{x}\\right)$$\n\nLet's recalculate all of our previous examples with a *learning rate* $L = 0.5$ and $A = 0.25$ and in a semi-automated manner.","008a3fcc":"The result is same as the above.

Prof. Murat Karakaya** for his great efforts in the preparation of this tutorial. I also want to thank other researchers who help and contribute to preparation of this work. You can find the Kaggle profiles each of them at the end of the tutorial.\n\nThis tutorial is heavily based on **Tariq Rashid**'s excellent book [Make Your Own Neural Network 1st Edition](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network\/dp\/1530826608\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1548348196&sr=8-1&keywords=tariq+rashid).

The computation step is almost always a predefined algorithm. Actually, this is the limiting part of every computation machine. Let's make an example for such a simple machine.","84469634":"The error is much better than the previous one. We are now much more close to the solution. Maybe you can live with this error and say that the constant c is 0.6. But we are perfectionist people. Let's increase $c$ a little bit more to reduce the error. See what happens when we take $c = 0.7$.","98f8275b":"We can generalize the idea with the following equation.\n$$t = (A + \\Delta A)x$$\n$t$ is our target value, $\\Delta A$ is a small change in $A$. Let's plug these equations to our previous error equation and call error as $E$.\n$$E = target - actual = Ax + (\\Delta A)x - Ax$$\nhence,\n$$E = (\\Delta A)x$$\nThis part is very important since we make a connection between error and a small change in $A$. You can extract the $\\Delta A$ from the equation in terms of $E$.\n$$\\Delta A = \\frac{E}{x}$$\nSome people here may end up with a conclusion as the change in $A$ is proportional to the change in error as $x$ changes and they are indeed right. Let me give a hint for the future. This definition is very similar to the definition of the derivative. But, of course, there are slight but fundamental differences.\n\nYou can think of $\\Delta A$ is an adjuster for the slope of the line. OK, the error was $0.35$ and $x$ was $3.0$. Hence, $\\Delta A = \\frac{0.35}{3.0} = 0.1167$. This means that the new value of $A$ must be $0.25 + 0.1167$ since the previous value of $A$ was $0.25$ as you can see from the previous plot. Let's draw the previous plot with this new slope and see the difference.","3499bbd5":"That's it. We made it. This is actually all the steps necessary to **feedforward** a neural network. The next step is a little bit harder than that. So, sit tight.\n\n### Learning Weights - Backpropagation\nRemind our first example with simple linear classifier. We calculated the error simply by looking the difference between our value and what the value should be and adjust the slope of the line according to the error. OK, **how can we calculate an error while there is more than one contribuer to the same error?** The solution is repeating exactly the same steps with our previous *feedforward* algorithm. That means a node affects an error proportional with its weight. This idea actually opens the doors of *linear algebra* again. Because it is the same operation that we have performed as in the *feedforward* algorithm. There is a little detail that is worth to mention though. There are more than one weight that affects a single error. At this times, we get the proportion of the weight. For example, if there is two weights that affect a single error - let's say $w_{11}$ and $w_{21}$ - the proportion should be:\n\n$$\n\\frac{w_{11}}{w_{11} + w_{21}}\n$$\n\nThis gives us only one layer back. But it highly possible that there are more than one layers. So, **how can we go even more further?** We just repeat the exactly same steps with the previous one. We will distribute the newly found errors with proportional to the weights that affect them. So, let's permit *linear algebra* to talk for us here.\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E_h}=\\boldsymbol{W_h}^T \\cdot \\boldsymbol{E_o}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E_h}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nw_{11} & w_{12} \\\\\nw_{21} & w_{22}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ne_1 \\\\\ne_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThis final touch gives us the ability to calculate the errors from end to the start. But, we don't yet learn the ability to calculate the weights.\n\n### Updating the Weights\n","be8908a5":"You can clearly see that this is not a good classifier. The line cannot separate those two cute bugs. It is clear that when we rotate the line a little bit up, the classifier will work just fine. However, we want to find an algorithm to do that for us. But before move on let's make some error calculations.","61fe8c23":"**What if you have thousands of weights and hundreds of inputs?** Are you still calculating by hand? Of course not. We need to automate the input calculation step. Here the *linear algebra* comes to the rescue. Let's rewrite the previous example. But, this time with vectors and matrices. I will use capital letters to denote matrices.","63a9096a":"These numbers are the inputs to the neurons of the next layer. Notice that I didn't put them into the sigmoid function before multiplying with the weights. The reason is that these numbers come from the input layer. So, I can assume that they have been already activated with an activation function. Now, we can calculate the output of the middle layer by just put $X_h$ into the activation function.","0aaf56d3":"The solution to this problem, using a similar, non-linear and differentiable function. Luckily, we have one and it is called **sigmoid**.  The equation of sigmoid is shown below.\n$$\ny=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\n$$\nYou can see the both shape of the sigmoid itself and its derivative."}}
