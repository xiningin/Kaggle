Numericalized is just a fancy way of saying they have been converted from a sequence of readable tokens to a sequence of corresponding indexes, using the vocabulary. \n\nWe also need to define a `torch.device`.

This will be done on German to English translations, but the models can be applied to any problem that involves going from one sequence to another, such as summarization.\n\nIn this first notebook, we'll start simple to understand the general concepts by implementing the model from the [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1409.3215) paper. \n\n## Introduction\n\nThe most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are *encoder-decoder* models, which (commonly) use a *recurrent neural network* (RNN) to *encode* the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a *context vector*. You can think of the context vector as being an abstract representation of the entire input sentence. This vector is then *decoded* by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating it one word at a time.\n\n![](assets\/seq2seq1.png)\n\nThe above image shows an example translation. The input\/source sentence, \"guten morgen\", is input into the encoder (green) one word at a time. We also append a *start of sequence* (`<sos>`) and *end of sequence* (`<eos>`) token to the start and end of sentence, respectively. At each time-step, the input to the encoder RNN is both the current word, $x_t$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $h_{t-1}$, and the encoder RNN outputs a new hidden state $h_t$. You can think of the hidden state as a vector representation of the sentence so far. The RNN can be represented as a function of both of $x_t$ and $h_{t-1}$:\n\n$$h_t = \\text{EncoderRNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n\nWe're using the term RNN generally here, it could be any recurrent architecture, such as an *LSTM* (Long Short-Term Memory) or a *GRU* (Gated Recurrent Unit). \n\nHere, we have $X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\\}$, where $x_1 = \\text{<sos>}, x_2 = \\text{guten}$, etc. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is usually either initialized to zeros or a learned parameter.\n\nOnce the final word, $x_T$, has been passed into the RNN, we use the final hidden state, $h_T$, as the context vector, i.e. $h_T = z$. This is a vector representation of the entire source sentence.\n\nNow we have our context vector, $z$, we can start decoding it to get the target sentence, \"good morning\". Again, we append start and end of sequence tokens to the target sentence. At each time-step, the input to the decoder RNN (blue) is the current word, $y_t$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $s_{t-1}$, where the initial decoder hidden state, $s_0$, is the context vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$, i.e. the initial decoder hidden state is the final encoder hidden state. Thus, similar to the encoder, we can represent the decoder as:\n\n$$s_t = \\text{DecoderRNN}(y_t, s_{t-1})$$\n\nIn the decoder, we need to go from the hidden state to an actual word, therefore at each time-step we use $s_t$ to predict (by passing it through a `Linear` layer, shown in purple) what we think is the next word in the sequence, $\\hat{y}_t$. \n\n$$\\hat{y}_t = f(s_t)$$\n\nThe words in the decoder are always generated one after another, with one per time-step. We always use `<sos>` for the first input to the decoder, $y_1$, but for subsequent inputs, $y_{t>1}$, we will sometimes use the actual, ground truth next word in the sequence, $y_t$ and sometimes use the word predicted by our decoder, $\\hat{y}_{t-1}$. This is called *teacher forcing*, and you can read about it more [here](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/teacher-forcing-for-recurrent-neural-networks\/). \n\nWhen training\/testing our model, we always know how many words are in our target sentence, so we stop generating words once we hit that many. During inference (i.e. real world usage) it is common to keep generating words until the model outputs an `<eos>` token or after a certain amount of words have been generated.\n\nOnce we have our predicted target sentence, $\\hat{Y} = \\{ \\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, ..., \\hat{y}_T \\}$, we compare it against our actual target sentence, $Y = \\{ y_1, y_2, ..., y_T \\}$, to calculate our loss. We then use this loss to update all of the parameters in our model.\n\n## Preparing Data\n\nWe'll be coding up the models in PyTorch and using TorchText to help us do all of the pre-processing required. We'll also be using spaCy to assist in the tokenization of the data.","2111144b":"### Decoder\n\nNext, we'll build our decoder, which will also be a 2-layer (4 in the paper) LSTM.\n\n![](assets\/seq2seq3.png)\n\nThe `Decoder` class does a single step of decoding, that is a single token per time-step. The first layer will receive a hidden and cell state from the previous time-step, $(s_{t-1}^1, c_{t-1}^1)$, and feed it through the LSTM with the current token, $y_t$, to produce a new hidden and cell state, $(s_t^1, c_t^1)$. The subsequent layers will use the hidden state from the layer below, $s_t^{l-1}$, and the previous hidden and cell states from their layer, $(s_{t-1}^l, c_{t-1}^l)$. This provides equations very similar to those in the encoder.\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n(s_t^1, c_t^1) = \\text{DecoderLSTM}^1(y_t, (s_{t-1}^1, c_{t-1}^1))\\\\\n(s_t^2, c_t^2) = \\text{DecoderLSTM}^2(s_t^1, (s_{t-1}^2, c_{t-1}^2))\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nRemember that the initial hidden and cell states to our decoder are our context vectors, which are the final hidden and cell states of our encoder from the same layer, i.e. $(s_0^l,c_0^l)=z^l=(h_T^l,c_T^l)$.\n\nWe then pass the hidden state from the top layer of the RNN, $s_t^L$, through a linear layer, $f$, to make a prediction of what the next token in the target (output) sequence should be, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$. \n\n$$\\hat{y}_{t+1} = f(s_t^L)$$\n\nThe arguments and initialization are similar to the `Encoder` class, except we now have an `output_dim` which is the size of the one-hot vectors that will be input to the decoder. These are equal to the vocabulary size of the output\/target. There is also the addition of the `Linear` layer, used to make the predictions from the top layer hidden state.\n\nWithin the `forward` method, we accept a batch of input tokens, previous hidden states and previous cell states. As we are only decoding one token at a time, the input tokens will always have a sequence length of 1. We `unsqueeze` the input tokens to add a sentence length dimension of 1. Then, similar to the encoder, we pass through an embedding layer and apply dropout. This batch of embedded tokens is then passed into the RNN with the previous hidden and cell states. This produces an `output` (hidden state from the top layer of the RNN), a new `hidden` state (one for each layer, stacked on top of each other) and a new `cell` state (also one per layer, stacked on top of each other). We then pass the `output` (after getting rid of the sentence length dimension) through the linear layer to receive our `prediction`. We then return the `prediction`, the new `hidden` state and the new `cell` state.\n\n**Note**: as we always have a sequence length of 1, we could use `nn.LSTMCell`, instead of `nn.LSTM`, as it is designed to handle a batch of inputs that aren't necessarily in a sequence. `nn.LSTMCell` is just a single cell and `nn.LSTM` is a wrapper around potentially multiple cells. Using the `nn.LSTMCell` in this case would mean we don't have to `unsqueeze` to add a fake sequence length dimension, but we would need one `nn.LSTMCell` per layer in the decoder and to ensure each `nn.LSTMCell` receives the correct initial hidden state from the encoder. All of this makes the code less concise - hence the decision to stick with the regular `nn.LSTM`.","62cc9d82":"### Seq2Seq\n\nFor the final part of the implemenetation, we'll implement the seq2seq model. This will handle: \n- receiving the input\/source sentence\n- using the encoder to produce the context vectors \n- using the decoder to produce the predicted output\/target sentence\n\nOur full model will look like this:\n\n![](assets\/seq2seq4.png)\n\nThe `Seq2Seq` model takes in an `Encoder`, `Decoder`, and a `device` (used to place tensors on the GPU, if it exists).\n\nFor this implementation, we have to ensure that the number of layers and the hidden (and cell) dimensions are equal in the `Encoder` and `Decoder`. This is not always the case, you do not necessarily need the same number of layers or the same hidden dimension sizes in a sequence-to-sequence model. However, if you do something like having a different number of layers you will need to make decisions about how this is handled. For example, if your encoder has 2 layers and your decoder only has 1, how is this handled? Do you average the two context vectors output by the decoder? Do you pass both through a linear layer? Do you only use the context vector from the highest layer? Etc.\n\nOur `forward` method takes the source sentence, target sentence and a teacher-forcing ratio. The teacher forcing ratio is used when training our model. When decoding, at each time-step we will predict what the next token in the target sequence will be from the previous tokens decoded, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}=f(s_t^L)$. With probability equal to the teaching forcing ratio (`teacher_forcing_ratio`) we will use the actual ground-truth next token in the sequence as the input to the decoder during the next time-step. However, with probability `1 - teacher_forcing_ratio`, we will use the token that the model predicted as the next input to the model, even if it doesn't match the actual next token in the sequence.  \n\nThe first thing we do in the `forward` method is to create an `outputs` tensor that will store all of our predictions, $\\hat{Y}$.\n\nWe then feed the input\/source sentence, $X$\/`src`, into the encoder and receive out final hidden and cell states.\n\nThe first input to the decoder is the start of sequence (`<sos>`) token. As our `trg` tensor already has the `<sos>` token appended (all the way back when we defined the `init_token` in our `TRG` field) we get our $y_1$ by slicing into it. We know how long our target sentences should be (`max_len`), so we loop that many times. The last token input into the decoder is the one **before** the `<eos>` token - the `<eos>` token is never input into the decoder. \n\nDuring each iteration of the loop, we:\n- pass the input, previous hidden and previous cell states ($y_t, s_{t-1}, c_{t-1}$) into the decoder\n- receive a prediction, next hidden state and next cell state ($\\hat{y}_{t+1}, s_{t}, c_{t}$) from the decoder\n- place our prediction, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$\/`output` in our tensor of predictions, $\\hat{Y}$\/`outputs`\n- decide if we are going to \"teacher force\" or not\n    - if we do, the next `input` is the ground-truth next token in the sequence, $y_{t+1}$\/`trg[t]`\n    - if we don't, the next `input` is the predicted next token in the sequence, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$\/`top1`, which we get by doing an `argmax` over the output tensor\n    \nOnce we've made all of our predictions, we return our tensor full of predictions, $\\hat{Y}$\/`outputs`.\n\n**Note**: our decoder loop starts at 1, not 0. This means the 0th element of our `outputs` tensor remains all zeros. So our `trg` and `outputs` look something like:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\text{trg} = [<sos>, &y_1, y_2, y_3, <eos>]\\\\\n\\text{outputs} = [0, &\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, \\hat{y}_3, <eos>]\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nLater on when we calculate the loss, we cut off the first element of each tensor to get:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\text{trg} = [&y_1, y_2, y_3, <eos>]\\\\\n\\text{outputs} = [&\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, \\hat{y}_3, <eos>]\n\\end{align*}$$","d967897c":"The period is at the beginning of the German (src) sentence, so looks good!\n\nNext, we'll build the *vocabulary* for the source and target languages.

The vocabularies of the source and target languages are distinct.\n\nUsing the `min_freq` argument, we only allow tokens that appear at least 2 times to appear in our vocabulary. Tokens that appear only once are converted into an `<unk>` (unknown) token.\n\nIt is important to note that your vocabulary should only be built from the training set and not the validation\/test set.

The encoder, the decoder and a seq2seq model that encapsulates the encoder and decoder and will provide a way to interface with each.\n\n### Encoder\n\nFirst, the encoder, a 2 layer LSTM. The paper we are implementing uses a 4-layer LSTM, but in the interest of training time we cut this down to 2-layers. The concept of multi-layer RNNs is easy to expand from 2 to 4 layers. \n\nFor a multi-layer RNN, the input sentence, $X$, goes into the first (bottom) layer of the RNN and hidden states, $H=\\{h_1, h_2, ..., h_T\\}$, output by this layer are used as inputs to the RNN in the layer above. Thus, representing each layer with a superscript, the hidden states in the first layer are given by:\n\n$$h_t^1 = \\text{EncoderRNN}^1(x_t, h_{t-1}^1)$$\n\nThe hidden states in the second layer are given by:\n\n$$h_t^2 = \\text{EncoderRNN}^2(h_t^1, h_{t-1}^2)$$\n\nUsing a multi-layer RNN also means we'll also need an initial hidden state as input per layer, $h_0^l$, and we will also output a context vector per layer, $z^l$.\n\nWithout going into too much detail about LSTMs (see [this](https:\/\/colah.github.io\/posts\/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs\/) blog post if you want to learn more about them), all we need to know is that they're a type of RNN which instead of just taking in a hidden state and returning a new hidden state per time-step, also take in and return a *cell state*, $c_t$, per time-step.\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nh_t &= \\text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})\\\\\n(h_t, c_t) &= \\text{LSTM}(x_t, (h_{t-1}, c_{t-1}))\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n\nYou can just think of $c_t$ as another type of hidden state. Similar to $h_0^l$, $c_0^l$ will be initialized to a tensor of all zeros. Also, our context vector will now be both the final hidden state and the final cell state, i.e. $z^l = (h_T^l, c_T^l)$.\n\nExtending our multi-layer equations to LSTMs, we get:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n(h_t^1, c_t^1) &= \\text{EncoderLSTM}^1(x_t, (h_{t-1}^1, c_{t-1}^1))\\\\\n(h_t^2, c_t^2) &= \\text{EncoderLSTM}^2(h_t^1, (h_{t-1}^2, c_{t-1}^2))\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nNote how only our hidden state from the first layer is passed as input to the second layer, and not the cell state.\n\nSo our encoder looks something like this: \n\n![](assets\/seq2seq2.png)\n\nWe create this in code by making an `Encoder` module, which requires we inherit from `torch.nn.Module` and use the `super().__init__()` as some boilerplate code. The encoder takes the following arguments:\n- `input_dim` is the size\/dimensionality of the one-hot vectors that will be input to the encoder. This is equal to the input (source) vocabulary size.\n- `emb_dim` is the dimensionality of the embedding layer. This layer converts the one-hot vectors into dense vectors with `emb_dim` dimensions. \n- `hid_dim` is the dimensionality of the hidden and cell states.\n- `n_layers` is the number of layers in the RNN.\n- `dropout` is the amount of dropout to use. This is a regularization parameter to prevent overfitting. Check out [this](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/lecture\/deep-neural-network\/understanding-dropout-YaGbR) for more details about dropout.\n\nWe aren't going to discuss the embedding layer in these tutorials. All you need to know is that there is a step before the words - technically, the indexes of the words - are passed into the RNN, where the words are transformed into vectors. If you would like to know about word embeddings, I'd recommend these articles [1](https:\/\/monkeylearn.com\/blog\/word-embeddings-transform-text-numbers\/), [2](http:\/\/p.migdal.pl\/2017\/01\/06\/king-man-woman-queen-why.html), [3](http:\/\/mccormickml.com\/2016\/04\/19\/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model\/), [4](http:\/\/mccormickml.com\/2017\/01\/11\/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling\/). \n\nThe embedding layer is created using `nn.Embedding`, the LSTM with `nn.LSTM` and a dropout layer with `nn.Dropout`. Check the PyTorch [documentation](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html) for more about these.\n\nOne thing to note is that the `dropout` argument to the LSTM is how much dropout to apply between the layers of a multi-layer RNN, i.e. between the hidden states output from layer $l$ and those same hidden states being used for the input of layer $l+1$.\n\nIn the `forward` method, we pass in the source sentence, $X$, which is converted into dense vectors using the `embedding` layer, and then dropout is applied. These embeddings are then passed into the RNN. As we pass a whole sequence to the RNN, it will automatically do the recurrent calculation of the hidden states over the whole sequence for us! You may notice that we do not pass an initial hidden or cell state to the RNN. This is because, as noted in the [documentation](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html#torch.nn.LSTM), that if no hidden\/cell state is passed to the RNN, it will automatically create an initial hidden\/cell state as a tensor of all zeros. \n\nThe RNN returns: `outputs` (the top-layer hidden state for each time-step), `hidden` (the final hidden state for each layer, $h_T$, stacked on top of each other) and `cell` (the final cell state for each layer, $c_T$, stacked on top of each other).\n\nAs we only need the final hidden and cell states (to make our context vector), `forward` only returns `hidden` and `cell`. \n\nThe sizes of each of the tensors is left as comments in the code. In this implementation `n_directions` will always be 1, however note that bidirectional RNNs (covered in tutorial 3) will have `n_directions` as 2.","85ad6ba0":"Next, we'll create a function that we'll use to tell us how long an epoch takes.","b56b9bab":"We can also print out an example, making sure the source sentence is reversed:","1e6c8bce":"We define our optimizer, which we use to update our parameters in the training loop.

This will turn on dropout (and batch normalization, which we aren't using) and then iterate through our data iterator.\n\nAs stated before, our decoder loop starts at 1, not 0. This means the 0th element of our `outputs` tensor remains all zeros. So our `trg` and `outputs` look something like:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\text{trg} = [<sos>, &y_1, y_2, y_3, <eos>]\\\\\n\\text{outputs} = [0, &\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, \\hat{y}_3, <eos>]\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nHere, when we calculate the loss, we cut off the first element of each tensor to get:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\text{trg} = [&y_1, y_2, y_3, <eos>]\\\\\n\\text{outputs} = [&\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, \\hat{y}_3, <eos>]\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nAt each iteration:\n- get the source and target sentences from the batch, $X$ and $Y$\n- zero the gradients calculated from the last batch\n- feed the source and target into the model to get the output, $\\hat{Y}$\n- as the loss function only works on 2d inputs with 1d targets we need to flatten each of them with `.view`\n    - we slice off the first column of the output and target tensors as mentioned above\n- calculate the gradients with `loss.backward()`\n- clip the gradients to prevent them from exploding (a common issue in RNNs)\n- update the parameters of our model by doing an optimizer step\n- sum the loss value to a running total\n\nFinally, we return the loss that is averaged over all batches.","8048340b":"TorchText's `Field`s handle how data should be processed.
