And yet, fewer and fewer young people are pursuing mathematics in their later years of high school, let alone at university. \n\nThe shortage of workers who are skilled in mathematics and technology is making its mark on industries such as banks, tech firms, and even government agencies. Even if better teaching methods do not lead directly to a career in mathematics, they will foster more informed citizens in general.\n\n****TEACHERS MATTER\n\nMost only knew about the subject if they happened to do a statistics course as part of their degree, in science.\n\n***CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING\n\nThe students aren't using formal statistical inference, such as p-values. They\u2019re asking questions, collecting data, drawing graphs, and analysing them to answer the questions, stating their confidence in the answer. They are using informal inference, which is based on the evidence they have collected. If they get to university, they will say, \u2018Oh, I've done that before.
