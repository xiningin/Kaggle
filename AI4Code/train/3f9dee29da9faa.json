The mean **BPM** of music is pretty fast with 120 Beat per Minute, but it has a standard deviation of 30 with fastest music with a beat of 190 BPM and slowest music with a beat of 85 BPM. \n2. The mean **Energy** of the song is 64.06 with standard deviation of 14.23. The min Energy is 32 and max energy is 88.\n3. The 50 percentile of the songs are above the mean dancibility. The max **Danceability** of the top 50 tracks is 90 and min Danceability is very low with a score of only 29.\n4. From a producer's perspective, I think the **Loundness** is relative regarding to the clipping sound, which is the volume go above the speak level that makes clip noise. All the sound tracks are below the clipping point, which is pleasant to listen.\n5. The 75 percentile of the tracks have really low **Liveness** score, which implies most of the songs are not recorded live. They are recorded in studio mostly.\n6. The mean **Valence** is slightly above neutral emotions. The max is 95, which implies very positive music.\n7. The mean **Length** is 200.96 that implies most of the songs are within 3 min and 20 seconds with standard deviation of 30 seconds difference.\n8. The mean **Accousticness** is low. This data tells us most of the productions are made with electronic plugins and synths instead of recording them accoustically with real grand piano, accoustic guitar, and other physical instruments.\n9. The overall **Speechinesses** are below 50. This implies most of songs are not filled with words entirely.\n10.
