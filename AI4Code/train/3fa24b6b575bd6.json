Then, in the following exercise, you'll put your new skills to work with a real-world dataset.  \n\n# Set up the notebook\n\nWe begin by setting up the coding environment.

To set the size of _any figure_, you need only copy the same line of code as it appears.  Then, if you'd like to use a custom size, change the provided values of `14` and `6` to the desired width and height.\n\nThe second line of code sets the title of the figure.  Note that the title must *always* be enclosed in quotation marks (`\"...\"`)!\n\n# Plot a subset of the data\n\nSo far, you've learned how to plot a line for _every_ column in the dataset.  In this section, you'll learn how to plot a _subset_ of the columns.\n\nWe'll begin by printing the names of all columns.  This is done with one line of code and can be adapted for any dataset by just swapping out the name of the dataset (in this case, `spotify_data`).","fc5ef72a":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

","12b8822d":"As you can see above, the line of code is relatively short and has two main components:\n- `sns.lineplot` tells the notebook that we want to create a line chart. \n - _Every command that you learn about in this course will start with `sns`, which indicates that the command comes from the [seaborn](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/) package. For instance, we use `sns.lineplot` to make line charts.  Soon, you'll learn that we use `sns.barplot` and `sns.heatmap` to make bar charts and heatmaps, respectively._\n- `data=spotify_data` selects the data that will be used to create the chart.\n\nNote that you will always use this same format when you create a line chart, and **_the only thing that changes with a new dataset is the name of the dataset_**.  So, if you were working with a different dataset named `financial_data`, for instance, the line of code would appear as follows:\n```\nsns.lineplot(data=financial_data)\n```\n\nSometimes there are additional details we'd like to modify, like the size of the figure and the title of the chart.

And, using the table, you can see that \"The Shape of You\" was streamed 12,287,078 times globally on the day of its release.

In general, to plot only a single column, we use this format with putting the name of the column in single quotes and enclosing it in square brackets.  (_To make sure that you correctly specify the name of the column, you can print the list of all column names using the command you learned above._)\n- We also add `label=\"Shape of You\"` to make the line appear in the legend and set its corresponding label.\n\nThe final line of code modifies the label for the horizontal axis (or x-axis), where the desired label is placed in quotation marks (`\"...\"`).\n\n# What's next?\n\nPut your new skills to work in a **[coding exercise](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/3303716)**!","491ad3ad":"In the next code cell, we plot the lines corresponding to the first two columns in the dataset."}}
