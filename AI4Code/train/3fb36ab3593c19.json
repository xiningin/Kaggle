Unlike min-max scaling, standardization does not bound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algorithms (e.g., neural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1).

If it's too good to be true, you're probably overfitting. ","9005d9ed":"The easiest way I can think to identify the traffic stations we want is to plot them on a map. Alternatively, I could employ some regex to search the station_location name... but there is no gaurentee that the station name includes the roadway numbers I'm searching by.","3889be81":"Got it. Worked. We've taken care of the numerical features, moving on to the categorical ones. There's only one categorical feature we need to fix missing values in: 'conds'. There are 2 missing values we need to handle before converting categorical features into numerical ones using OntHotEncoder. We'll use the most frequently occuring weather condition in the month of August (the 2 missing values are in the month of August) to fill the values.","646b5d1c":"Even though it's time consuming, I have a slight compulsion to always check that the code is doing what I think it should be doing. So, I first find the rows where we have nulls, fill those null values, and then check that the resulting Series is populated with data. ","7171f411":"## Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights","db5a9bc1":"First thing I want to do is create a benchmark RMSE. A prediction model simply using the median traffic volume per weekday and month can help here. Below, we aggregate the data as such and create traffic_volume_y (predictions) and traffic_volume_x (actuals), then use sklearn metrics to calculate the RMSE of those predictions.","80039e5b":"Perfect. Everything works as expected. That's the pipeline we'll use in the broader preparation pipeline below. ","7c76d7e5":"First major problem: in this dataset there are only traffic stations on one of the 4 roadways we want to predict traffic flow for. For the purporses of this notebook, I'll abbreviate the project to predicting traffic flow for only I-394 just to the west of Minneapolis. Two possible solutions to the problem could be A. find another source of data to supplement this one (maybe Waze provides an open-source dataset?) and\/or B. we could build additional models to predict traffic flow X miles away from the traffic station data we do have. I like option A because t[here are certainly more traffic cameras out there](https:\/\/hb.511mn.org\/#camerasHome?layers=cameras&timeFrame=TODAY)... but probably not pulling flow data. Onward.","b48e0be9":"For station_id=='000326' we have 730 entries which means we probably have ~1 years worth of data (daily observations for both directions). At this point, it was impossible for me not to try and obtain volume data for this one station from other time periods.. and with a little work [I found 2014 and 2016 on the Minnesotta DOT sight](http:\/\/www.dot.state.mn.us\/traffic\/data\/reports-hrvol-atr.html). However, the output is from SAS which means it requires a considerable amount of manual clean up. Plus, I'd have to run my weather API scraper for these years (not a problem, just time consuming since using free sevice). The bank holiday data already includes 2014 and 2016 so that would be no additional work. Since the objective of this notebook is to solidify the foundational skills of a machine learning project, I'm sticking with the smaller dataset (#scopecreep).\n\nSince I have narrowed the scope of the project, we don't need to merge the datasets since the traffic_station data will be constant through the entire resulting data. Hence, we'll move on with only a filtered down traffic_df.","258a63d0":"Tip from HandsOn: \"If a categorical attribute has a large number of possible categories (e.g., country code, profession, species, etc.), then one-hot encoding will result in a large number of input features. This may slow down training and degrade performance. If this happens, you will want to produce denser representations called embeddings, but this requires a good understanding of neural networks (see Chapter 14 for more details).\"\n\nChecking in. At this point we have a few dataframes. traffic_df is our original training dataset. traffic_num is a subset of traffic_df of only the numerical features. traffic_tr is a copy of traffic_num with missing weather values imputed using the median strategy and the more manual mode strategy for the 'conds' feature. On the cateogrical side, we start with traffic_cat which is a subset of traffic_df of only the categorical features. Finally, there is traffic_cat_1hot which expands traffic_cat into a wider, sparser dataframe of numerical features. There's a lot happening here and in the next section we wrap all those steps up into Sklearn pipelines."}}
