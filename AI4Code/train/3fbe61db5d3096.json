This is similar to how Python uses `as` for aliasing when doing imports like `import pandas as pd` or `import seaborn as sns`.  \n\nTo use **AS** in SQL, insert it right after the column you select.  Here's an example of a query _without_ an **AS** clause:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VelX9tP.png)\n\nAnd here's an example of the same query, but _with_ **AS**.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/teF84tU.png)\n\nThese queries return the same information, but in the second query the column returned by the **COUNT()** function will be called `Number`, rather than the default name of `f0__`.\n\n# WITH ... AS\n\nOn its own, **AS** is a convenient way to clean up the data returned by your query. It's even more powerful when combined with **WITH** in what's called a \"common table expression\".\n\nA **common table expression** (or **CTE**) is a temporary table that you return within your query. CTEs are helpful for splitting your queries into readable chunks, and you can write queries against them. \n\nFor instance, you might want to use the `pets` table to ask questions about older animals in particular.  So you can start by creating a CTE which only contains information about animals more than five years old like this:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/0Kz8q4x.png)\n            \nWhile this incomplete query above won't return anything, it creates a CTE that we can then refer to (as `Seniors`) while writing the rest of the query.  \n\nWe can finish the query by pulling the information that we want from the CTE.  The complete query below first creates the CTE, and then returns all of the IDs from it. \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3xQZM4p.png)\n    \nYou could do this without a CTE, but if this were the first part of a very long query, removing the CTE would make it much harder to follow.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that CTEs only exist inside the query where you create them, and you can't reference them in later queries.  So, any query that uses a CTE is always broken into two parts: (1) first, we create the CTE, and then (2) we write a query that uses the CTE.","381e4be0":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
