Everyone praised her decision but Lilly was nervous. The Dinner was delicious and everyone get on to their on spaces, then Lilly got Alice\n\n**Lilly: Are you serious about what you just said?**\n\n**Alice: About what?**\n\n**Lilly: Your future plan!

Let's use our analysis skills to investigate whether it is true or false.\n\n**The Annual Kaggle survey**\n\nKaggle's annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey is in its third year now. This year, as in 2017 and 2018, Kaggle has conducted an industry-wide survey that presents a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The Survey Challenges from 2017 and 2018 were very informative, and so is expected out of the 2019 survey too.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThis notebook will only focus on the women in ML and DS, thereby analysing the answers of the female respondents solely. The analysis will be two-fold:\n\n\u2022 Analysis of the 2019 Kaggle DS & ML survey for Female respondents.\n\n\u2022 Comparisons of the results in the 2019 study with the previous two surveys. This will present a better picture and show whether are things are improving for real or not.\n\n**Importing Libraries**"}}
