So, it is in our interest to make sure that the prime numbers end up at the beginning of every 10th step. **\n \n ### Approach:\n * Loop through the path, whenever we encounter a city that has prime CityId, we will try to swap it with the nearby city that have an index ending in 9 (ie 10th step), if they makes the total path smaller. \n * We try to swap the prime city with two cities that occur before the current city and have an index ending in 9, or two cities that occur after the current city and have an index ending in 9. \n     * For example if we have a prime city in the 76th place, we will try to see if that can be swapped with any of the cities in the 59th, 69th, 79th and 89th place and result in a shorter path. \n * When checking to see if the path becomes shorter by swapping the cities, we will only check the length of the sub-path that corresponds to the swap.
