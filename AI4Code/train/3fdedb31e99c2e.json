AutoML makes machine learning available in a true sense, even to people with no major expertise in this field.\n\nAdvantages\nThe advantages of AutoML can be summed up in three major points:\n\nIncreases productivity by automating repetitive tasks. This enables a data scientist to focus more on the problem rather than the models.\nAutomating the ML pipeline also helps to avoid errors that might creep in manually.\nUltimately, AutoML is a step towards democratizing machine learning by making the power of ML accessible to everybody.\nH2O AutoML\nH2O\u2019s AutoML can be used for automating the machine learning workflow, which includes automatic training and tuning of many models within a user-specified time-limit. Stacked Ensembles \u2013 one based on all previously trained models, another one on the best model of each family \u2013 will be automatically trained on collections of individual models to produce highly predictive ensemble models which, in most cases, will be the top performing models in the AutoML Leaderboard.\n\nProperties of H2O AutoML\n\nBasic data pre-processing (as in all H2O algos).\n\nTrains a random grid of GBMs, DNNs, GLMs, etc. using a carefully chosen hyper-parameter space.\n\nIndividual models are tuned using cross-validation.\n\nTwo Stacked Ensembles are trained (\u201cAll Models\u201d ensemble & a lightweight \u201cBest of Family\u201d ensemble).\n\nReturns a sorted \u201cLeaderboard\u201d of all models.

Since we specified a leaderboard_frame in the H2OAutoML.train() method for scoring and ranking the models, the AutoML leaderboard uses the performance on this data to rank the models.\n\nA default performance metric for each machine learning task (binary classification, multiclass classification, regression) is specified internally and the leaderboard will be sorted by that metric. In the case of regression, the default ranking metric is mean residual deviance. In the future, the user will be able to specify any of the H2O metrics so that different metrics can be used to generate rankings on the leaderboard.","f9cf376d":"## Ensemble Exploration\nTo understand how the ensemble works, let's take a peek inside the Stacked Ensemble \"All Models\" model.

The max_runtime_secs argument provides a way to limit the AutoML run by time. When using a time-limited stopping criterion, the number of models train will vary between runs. If different hardware is used or even if the same machine is used but the available compute resources on that machine are not the same between runs, then AutoML may be able to train more models on one run vs another.","c0d5499a":"Examine the variable importance of the metalearner (combiner) algorithm in the ensemble.
