In January, it introduced strict passenger-screening protocols at Addis Ababa\u2019s international airport, East Africa\u2019s largest aviation hub. The Ministry of Health and local and regional governments jointly conducted house-to-house screenings of more than 11 million households containing 40 million people in the capital and provinces. And diagnostic testing was scaled up from zero in early March to over 5,000 tests per day by May, though it continues to be a major challenge.\n\nPublic awareness and education have been central to the government\u2019s effort. The prime minister makes regular public announcements regarding COVID-19, while the health minister provides daily briefings. And, as part of a concerted media campaign to reach all citizens, state-owned telecoms monopoly Ethio Telecom uses cell-phone ring tones to remind people of the importance of hygiene measures such as hand washing, social distancing, and wearing facemasks.

By ABIY AHMED-Prime minister of Ethiopia and the 2019 Nobel #Peace prize laureate - MARCH 25 2020\n\nThere is a major flaw in the strategy to deal with the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. Advanced economies are unveiling unprecedented economic stimulus packages. African countries, by contrast, lack the wherewithal to make similarly meaningful interventions. Yet if the virus is not defeated in Africa, it will only bounce back to the rest of the world.\u00a0\n\nThat is why the current strategy of uncoordinated country-specific measures, while understandable, is myopic, unsustainable and potentially counter-productive. A virus that ignores borders cannot be tackled successfully like this.\n\nWe can defeat this invisible and vicious adversary \u2014 but only with global leadership. Without that, Africa may suffer the worst, yet it will not be the last. We are all in this together, and we must work together to the end.\n\nFragile and vulnerable at the best of times, African economies are staring at an abyss.\tThis grim reality is not unique to Ethiopia. It is shared by most African countries. But if they do not take appropriate measures to tackle the pandemic, no country in the world is safe.\u00a0\n\nMomentary victory by a rich country in controlling the virus at a national level, coupled with travel bans and border closures, may give a semblance of accomplishment. But we all know this is a stopgap. Only global victory can bring this pandemic to an end.\n\nCovid-19 teaches us that we are all global citizens connected by a single virus that recognises none of our natural or man-made diversity: not the colour of our skin, nor our passports, or the gods we worship. For the virus, what matters is the fact of our common humanity.\nhttps:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/c12a09c8-6db6-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\nHealth is a worldwide public good.

It requires global action guided by a sense of global solidarity.\n\nFinally, all of Africa\u2019s development partners must ensure that their development aid budgets remain ringfenced and are not diverted to domestic priorities. This is where true humanity and solidarity must be demonstrated. If such aid were ever necessary in Africa, it is now more than ever before.\nhttps:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/c12a09c8-6db6-11ea-89df-41bea055720b","47f0fe11":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQTRS-rkWYBJw03jtZCPbMTR_qLsarc-I2jcA&usqp=CAU)caasint","d13ec612":"#Which BCG strain has been used since the creation of the vaccine and during what time periods?","76898b9c":"One of the most perverse effects of the new coronavirus pandemic was the international dispute over medical supplies. The scarcity of hospital products has sparked an unfair race, in which rich countries pay more and underdeveloped nations find themselves without resources to fight the spread of the infection.\n\nIn this scenario of little, if any, empathy, a country has been standing out. Ethiopia has become a key support point for cargoes that are imported from China by countries in Africa and Latin America.\n\nThe airline Ethiopian Airlines, since February, the company has converted 30 of its 80 passenger planes to transport cargo. In the African continent alone, the airline has already been used to distribute 260 tons of equipment, benefiting 45 countries. Most of the cargo was donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, owner of the Alibaba site.\n\nUndoubtedly, an example of solidarity that should be copied by other international leaders. \nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/veja.abril.com.br\/mundo\/coronavirus-como-a-etiopia-virou-exemplo-de-ajuda-internacional\/&prev=search&pto=aue","5f06f9d8":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke ","ad0a719f":"Furthermore, since February, the Ethiopian authorities have implemented a strict regime of rigorous contact tracing, isolation, compulsory quarantine, and treatment. The government converted public universities\u2019 dormitories to increase the capacity of quarantine centers to over 50,000 beds, established additional isolation centers with a total of 15,000 beds, and set up treatment centers with a 5,000-bed capacity. It also introduced more comprehensive life insurance coverage to protect front-line health workers.\n\nWhereas many advanced and emerging economies have introduced huge economic-stimulus and rescue plans, the Ethiopian government has been constrained by dwindling revenues and the need to reallocate budget expenditures to contain the pandemic. It cannot please everyone, and therefore has had to prioritize its modest resources.\n\nThe government\u2019s COVID-19 economic-support package is based on the principle of shared costs and sacrifices. For example, the employers\u2019 confederation, labor unions, and the government agreed on a tripartite protocol to prevent layoffs during the crisis. Government subsidies have enabled manufacturing exporters to benefit from zero-cost rail transport and lower export logistics costs. And the government\u2019s new industrial-parks strategy envisages the establishment of manufacturing hubs to produce personal protective equipment for domestic and overseas markets.\n\nEthiopia continues to mobilize national resources and encourage voluntary activities to address the public-health emergency, with the government ensuring close coordination among federal agencies at all levels. And although the government\u2019s pandemic response is a work in progress, its success so far illustrates what African countries can achieve despite tight resource constraints.https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2020\/06\/ethiopia-covid19-response\/","64d4506e":"#Ethiopia\u2019s unconventional COVID-19 response\n\nDespite financial constraints, Ethiopia has managed to keep its COVID-19 cases to a minimum, with only 6 deaths out of a population of 109 million. The government's rapid response, including house-to-house screenings and diagnostic testings, were crucial in stemming the outbreak. Ethiopia has also encouraged production and other economic activities to continue during the crisis.\n\nTo the surprise of many, African governments have responded swiftly and boldly to the COVID-19 crisis. Ethiopia\u2019s unconventional approach, for example, reflects the country\u2019s limited financial and human resources, as well as the low level of available international support. Despite these severe constraints, the results so far have been better than anyone expected.\n\nFrom the start, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s government understood that Ethiopia\u2019s success in combating COVID-19 would depend not on the number of respirators it had, but on the public-health measures taken to contain the virus\u2019s spread. His government also wanted to prevent serious damage to one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing economies, which expanded at a 10.5% average annual rate in 2004-18 but remains vulnerable. Safeguarding these gains, preventing job losses, and ensuring firms\u2019 survival was critical.\n\nSo, instead of implementing a national lockdown like most other governments, including in Africa, Ethiopia initiated other essential measures in January, well ahead of most developed countries. The government then scaled up its response in mid-March, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in the country, and declared a state of emergency only on April 8. Moreover, it has encouraged production and other economic activities to continue during the crisis, thus considerably easing the pressure on vulnerable social groups and the informal sector.https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2020\/06\/ethiopia-covid19-response\/","46df8bb8":"The government ensured a coherent response by maximizing coordination among public agencies at different levels. It also engaged in dialogue with the private sector to find workable solutions when global brands and buyers abandoned their suppliers in developing countries.\n\nResource-constrained African countries cannot provide government and charitable support to all groups and firms. Governments must prioritize and target their limited resources at companies, and tie that support to performance criteria in order to incentivize vital social goals like employment retention. Learning what works and what does not in that regard has been a vital catalyst in Ethiopia\u2019s response.\n\nFinally, it is too early to judge the pandemic response mounted by Ethiopia and other African countries because governments still have to scale up their efforts to tackle the inevitable \u201csurge\u201d stage of the crisis. But one lesson is already clear: African governments\u2019 COVID-19 strategies must reflect the local context, the evolving nature of the pandemic, binding resource constraints, and weak international collaboration.https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2020\/06\/ethiopia-covid19-response\/"}}
