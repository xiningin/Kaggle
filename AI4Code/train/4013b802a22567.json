shortages are slowing test production\n\nAs the worldwide demand for testing has grown, so, too, have shortages of the chemical agents used in the test kits, the swabs used to get the samples, and the protective masks and gear used by health workers taking the samples.\n\"There is an inadequate supply of so many things associated with testing,\" says Wroblewski, which is why her group, along with officials in states including New York and cities including Los Angeles, recommend prioritizing who should be tested for COVID-19.\n\nAt the front of the line, she says, should be health care workers and first responders; older adults who have symptoms, especially those living in nursing homes or assisted living residences; and people who may have other illnesses that would be treated differently if they were infected.\n\nBottom line: Prioritizing who is tested will help speed the turnaround time for getting results to people in these circumstances and reduce their risk of spreading the illness.\n\nStill, urgent shortages of some of the chemicals needed to process the tests are hampering efforts to test health care workers, including at hospitals such as SUNY Downstate medical center in hard-hit New York.\n\nLooking forward, companies are working on quicker tests. The FDA in recent days has approved tests from two companies that promise results in 45 minutes or less, but those likely will be available only in hospitals that have special equipment to run them. One of those companies, Cepheid of Sunnyvale, Calif., says about 5,000 U.S. hospitals already have the equipment needed to process these tests. Both firms say they will ship to the hospitals soon but have given few specifics on quantity or timing.\n\nBut many public health officials say primary care doctors and clinics need a truly rapid test they can use in their offices \u2014 one like the tests already in use for influenza or strep throat.\n\nA number of companies are moving in that direction. Late Friday, for instance, Abbott Laboratories announced that the FDA has given emergency use authorization for the company's rapid, point-of-care test, which can deliver positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13.\n\nThe tests are processed on a small device already installed in thousands of medical offices, ERs, urgent care clinics and other settings. Abbott said it will begin next week to make 50,000 tests available per day.\n\n\"That's going to make a meaningful difference,\" says Van Meter at AdvaMedDx, who believes the rapid tests are a key additional piece in the continuum of available testing.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

That swab goes into a tube and is sent to a lab. Some large hospitals have on-site molecular test labs, but most samples are sent to outside laboratories for processing. More on that later.\n\nThat transit time usually runs about 24 hours, but it could be longer, depending on how far the hospital is from the processing laboratory.\n\nOnce at the lab, the specimen is processed, which means lab workers extract the virus's RNA, the molecule that helps regulate genes.\n\n\"That step of cleaning \u2014 the RNA extraction step \u2014 is one limiting factor,\" says Cathie Klapperich, vice chair of the department of biomedical engineering at Boston University. \"Only the very biggest labs have automated ways of extracting RNA from a sample and doing it quickly.\"\n\nAfter the RNA is extracted, technicians also must carefully mix special chemicals with each sample and run those combinations in a machine for analysis, a process called polymerase chain reaction, which can detect whether the sample is positive or negative for COVID.\n\n\"Typically, a PCR test takes six hours from start to finish to complete,\" says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.\n\nSome labs have larger staffs and more machines, so they can process more tests at a time than others. But even for those labs, as demand grows, so does the backlog.\n\nCapacity is expanding, but not fast enough\nInitially, only a few public health labs and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention processed COVID-19 tests. Problems with the first CDC test kits also led to delays.\n\nNow the CDC has a better kit, and 94 public health labs across the country do COVID-19 testing, says Wroblewski.\nBut those labs can't possibly do all that's needed. In normal times, their main function is regular public health surveillance \u2014 detecting more common threats such as outbreaks of measles or monitoring seasonal influenza \u2014 \"but not to do diagnostic testing of the magnitude that is required in this response,\" she says.\n\n\"A chief medical officer on the East Coast said that, up until two days ago, on average, it was taking 72 hours to get results,\" says Susan Van Meter, executive director of AdvaMedDx, a division of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a device and diagnostics industry trade group. \"That will get better as our member companies come on the market.\"\n\nEven so, supply is not keeping up with demand, Roche CEO Severin Schwan told CNBC on Monday. Roche won the first approval from the FDA for a test kit under emergency rules, and it has delivered more than 400,000 kits so far.\n\"Demand continues to be much higher than supply,\" Schwan told CNBC. \"So we are glad that overall capacity is increasing, but the reality is that broad-based testing is not yet possible.\"\nhttps:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2020\/03\/28\/822869504\/why-it-takes-so-long-to-get-most-covid-19-test-results\n","b208f666":"A message from the front lines of COVID-19 testing: The Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene\u2019s COVID-19 virus testing team. \"We stay at work for you.

Consults, echocardiograms, CT, or invasive angiograms and other further investigation of abnormal cardiac biomarkers run the risk of exposing healthcare providers and other patients,\" the article's author, James L. Januzzi Jr, MD, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology.\n\n\"For all those reasons, clinicians should strongly consider reserving measurement of troponin and natriuretic peptide testing for circumstances in which they would add meaningfully to the clinical picture, and where they would significantly alter the management of patients with the virus.\"\nThe assays include those for cardiac troponin (cTn) and either brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP). Elevations in cTn by high-sensitivity assay (hs-cTn) are even more likely in patients with COVID-19, the article cautions.\n\nGiven the novelty of coronavirus as a public health threat, there are as yet few publications on the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. However, elevations in the biomarkers are common in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in general, and are \"associated with an unfavorable course,\" the article notes.\n\"While neither alone is specific for acute MI or heart failure,\" Januzzi said, \"both biomarkers are prognostic, supporting the contention they are a measure of disease severity, regardless of their lack of a link to MI or heart failure.\"\nIn patients with COVID-19, therefore, \"clinicians are advised to only measure troponin or natriuretic peptides if the diagnosis of acute MI or heart failure are being considered on clinical grounds,\" the article states.\nMoreover, \"an abnormal troponin or natriuretic peptide result should not be considered evidence for an acute MI or heart failure without corroborating evidence.\"\n\nAmerican College of Cardiology.

Serum urea, creatinine (CREA) and cystatin C (CysC) concentrations in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.001), and there were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). Serum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including urea, CREA, CysC, which reflect glomerular filtration function, may have some significance as potential indicators for the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and to distinguish it from mild COVID-19. Glomerular filtration function injury in severe COVID-19 patients should also be considered by clinicians.https:\/\/www.medrxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.03.19.20034447v1","279630dc":"#Codes from Thor the God of Thunder","8e219720":"grandviewresearch.com","9a58d428":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke"}}
