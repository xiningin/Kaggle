Most of the song Popularity is 50 to 70*\n\nThese are the following features impact on the Popularity of Album","d077e325":"**Danceability**: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.\n\n\n**Valence**: Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\n\n**Energy**: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.\n\n\n**Tempo**: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece, and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n\n\n**Loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.\n\n\n**Speechiness**: This detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.\n\n\n**Instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. \u201cOoh\u201d and \u201caah\u201d sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \u201cvocal\u201d.\n\n\n**Liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n\n**Acousticness**: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.\n\n\n**Key**: The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C\u266f\/D\u266d, 2 = D, and so on.\nMode: Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n\n\n**Duration**: The duration of the track in milliseconds.\n\n\n**Time Signature**: An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure)."}}
