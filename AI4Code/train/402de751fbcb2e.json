In particular, it works by taking each minority class sample and introducing synthetic data samples along the line segments joining any\/all of the *k* minority class nearest neighbors.\n\nSynthetic samples are generated in the following way:\n- Take the difference between the minority class sample under consideration and one if its *k* nearest neighbors. \n- Multiply this difference by a random number between 0 and 1, and add it to the minority class sample under consideration. \n- This causes the selection of a random point along the line segment between two data points where it is synthetized a new minority class sample. \n\n###### The objective of this section is only the exploration of the effects of the SMOTE algorithm on the dataset and not building an oversampled training set to be used lately for fitting a model.\n_As we will see in the following section [4. Classification](#4.-Classification), in order to estimate the best set of hyperparameters for each classifier I will use Cross-Validation. <br> \nPerforming Cross-Validation using the oversampled training set would result in biased outcomes of the algorithm, because the folds used for validation would contain synthetic samples generated by the oversampling of the original samples contained in the folds used for training, resulting in a leakage of information. <br>\nThe correct way of applying SMOTE using Cross-Validation, as we will see later, is to create a Pipeline so that the oversampling is performed only after the split and esclusively on the folds used for training.

In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n\nThe objective of this dataset is to predict whether a patient has or not diabetes, so this is a **supervised binary classification** problem.\n\nI also report here some additional information about the topic of our analysis, Diabetes, that I found at the following link: https:\/\/www.idf.org\/aboutdiabetes\/what-is-diabetes.html.\n\n#### What is Diabetes?\n\n> Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces.\nInsulin is a hormone made by the pancreas, that acts like a key to let glucose from the food we eat pass from the blood stream into the cells in the body to produce energy. All carbohydrate foods are broken down into glucose in the blood. Insulin helps glucose get into the cells. \nNot being able to produce insulin or use it effectively leads to raised glucose levels in the blood (known as hyperglycaemia). Over the long-term high glucose levels are associated with damage to the body and failure of various organs and tissues.","34dacd2c":"From the table we can see that some features, like SkinThickness and Insulin, have a maximum value that is far away from mean of that feature. So, probably, there are some outliers among the samples. We will explore more in depth the presence of outliers using Boxplots later in section [2.5 Boxplots and Crosstabs](#2.5-Boxplots-and-Crosstabs).","eb5de039":"As expected, the classes are now balanced.","8c5deca2":"The learning curve shows that both the training score and the validation score increase with the number of samples of the training set but it seems that using more than 350 samples does not improve the performances of the classifier as both the scores remain almost steady.","fd73a86c":"### 2.3 Statistics","1548ad9c":"In this part, I will try several classifiers in order to evaluate which of them performs the best with our dataset.\n\nI chose the following classifiers:\n- **k-Nearest Neighbors**\n- **Linear Discriminant Analysis**\n- **Support Vector Machine**\n- **Decision Tree**\n- **Random Forest**\n\nFor each classifier I will fit three different models: one using the original dataset, one using the dataset balanced by SMOTE and one using the dataset reduced with PCA.\n\nIn order to properly select the hyperparameters for each classifier I will use a **GridSearch 5-fold Cross-Validation** approach, which allows to estimate which are the hyperparameters that give the best generalized results in a more reliable way than just trying several hyperparameters' configurations using only the training set and a validation set.\n\nThe **5-fold Cross-Validation** consists of the following steps:\n- splitting the dataset into 5 folds of equal size.\n- building 5 different models using the 5 different possible combinations of 4 of the 5 folds as training data.\n- evaluating each model using the remaining fold that was not used to train that model as validation data and obtaining its score value.\n- averaging all the score values obtained in order to provide a good estimation of the generalization performance of the model.\n\nThe **GridSearch 5-fold Cross-Validation** consists of applying the 5-fold Cross-Validation algorithm explained before for each of the possible configurations of hyperparameters that we want to test. As a result, the mean validation score is obtained for each parameter setting and the one that gave the best results is chosen.\n\nGiven the class imbalance, I decided to use different validation scores depending on the type of dataset used: \n- for the original dataset and the dataset reduced by PCA I selected the F1 score, which takes into account the class imbalance and the Precision-Recall trade-off.\n- for the dataset oversampled by SMOTE I selected the Accuracy because the samples of both classes are balanced by the algorithm.\n\nFinally, after having fitted the models using the hypermaters' configurations suggested by the GridSearch 5-fold Cross-Validation, I will evaluate them by having them make predictions on the data samples of the test set.\n\nIn order to properly evaluate each model I will use several metrics, which are defined through the following values:\n- **TP**: the number of true positive samples that have been correctly classified as positives. In our case the positive samples are those with a positive diagnosis of diabetes.\n- **TN**: the number of true negatives samples that have been correctly classified as negatives. In our case the negative samples are those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes.\n- **FP**: the number of true negatives samples that have been wrongly classified as positives.\n- **FN**: the number of true positives samples that have been wrongly classified as negatives.\n\nThe metrics that I will use are the following:\n- **Accuracy**: ${ \\displaystyle \\frac{ \\mathsf{ TP + TN } }{ \\mathsf{ TP + TN + FP + FN } } }$\n\n\n- **Precision**: ${ \\displaystyle \\frac{ \\mathsf{ TP } }{ \\mathsf{ TP + FP } } }$\n\n\n- **Recall**: ${ \\displaystyle \\frac{ \\mathsf{ TP } }{ \\mathsf{ TP + FN } } }$\n\n\n- **F1 Score**: ${ \\displaystyle \\frac{ \\mathsf{ 2TP } }{ \\mathsf{ 2TP + FP + FN } } }$\n\n\n- **Confusion matrix**: it is a square matrix that visually reports the counts of the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions of a classifier.\n\nEach of those metrics provides different information about the performace of a classifier: Accuracy is usually a good metric when dealing with balanced datasets while the other ones are more suitable when there is a class skew or when there are differential misclassification costs, like in our case.\n\nIn fact, predicting an healthy patient as affected by Diabetes would result in further useless analysis and costs, but predicting a deseased one as healthy could result in serious consequences for the health of that person. So, I will give more importance at detecting as many deseased patients as possible (higher Recall score) at the expense of a lower classification accuracy (lower Precision score).\n\nLastly, after having chosen the best classifier among the three built in the previous steps, I will also plot its **learning curve**, which shows the training and the validation scores for several sizes of the training set, for detecting wheter the model suffers from high bias or high variance.","8b68a6b8":"The **Random Forest** is an ensemble method specifically designed for Decision Tree classifiers. As an ensemble method, it generates several different weak learners and then it combines them in order to achieve an higher accuracy.\n\nIt consists of growing a forest of many different Decision Tree classifiers by introducing two sources of randomness:\n- each tree is trained using a different bootstrap sample of the original training data.\n- at each node of each tree, the best split is chosen not from all the attributes but from a random subset of them.\n\nThe final result of classification is given by majority voting over all the trees in the forest.\n\nThe hyperparameters that I will test with the GridSearch Cross-Validation are the following:\n- `criterion`: the split criterion to be used.\n- `n_estimators`: the number of Trees to be trained.\n- `max_depth`: the maximum depth of each Tree.\n- `class_weight`: wheter or not to take into account the class imbalance.","cf61489d":"The learning curve shows that both the train and validation scores do not have a clear trend as they increase and decrease several times as the training set size changes. This shows, as expected, that **the classifier is unstable** and so, as a consequence, we can conclude that __this model is not appropriate for our purposes__.","734e4a5d":"The analysis has been conducted using Python 3.7.1 and Jupyter Notebook 5.7.4, which is a browser-based interactive programming environment.\n\nIn particular I used the following Python packages:\n- **Pandas**: it provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to work with relational data.\n- **NumPy**: it provides a large library of high-level mathematical functions for operating on arrays and matrices.\n- **Scikit-learn**: it is a Machine Learning library that features many classification, regression and clustering algorithms.\n- **Imbalanced-learn**: it provides methods to deal with imbalanced dataset in machine learning and pattern recognition.\n- **Matplotlib**: it is a plotting library which provides a MATLAB-like interface. \n- **Seaborn**: it is a visualization library based on matplotlib.

This happens because the classifier is not able to generalize well and it is overfitting the training data. \n- a too high value of *k* will result in a too simple model that is not able to discriminate properly the sample among the different classes. This causes underfitting.\n\nThe hyperparameters that I will test using the GridSearch Cross-Validation are the following:\n- `n_neighbors`: it is the value of *k*. It represents the number of neighbors that the algorithm considers in order to classify data points.\n- `weights`: wheter to consider all the neighbours equally or to give more weight to the nearest ones.","fe07b553":"Using histograms we can quickly visualize the distributions of the values of the features:","cb52d6b0":"The goal of this notebook was to analyse the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and to try to predict wheter or not a patient is affected by Diabetes given a set of medical parameters.
