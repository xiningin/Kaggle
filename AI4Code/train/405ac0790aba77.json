Only available for the training set.\n\n* age - customer age in years.\n\n* number_dependent_family_members - number of family members who economically depend on the customer.\n\n* monthly_income - total monthly income of the customer\n\n* number_of_credit_lines - total number of loans and credit lines (e.g. credit cards) opened by the customer.\n\n* real_estate_loans - number of real estate loans and credit lines (e.g. mortgage).\n\n* ratio_debt_payment_to_income - ratio of monthly debt payment to monthly income.\n\n* credit_line_utilization - total balance on credit lines and loans divided by sum of credit limits.\n\n* number_of_previous_late_payments_up_to_59_days - number of times the customer has historically been late in debt payment, but not later than 59 days.\n\n* * number_of_previous_late_payments_up_to_89_days - number of times the customer has historically been late in debt payment, but between 60 days and 89 days late.\n\n* number_of_previous_late_payments_90_days_or_more - number of times the customer has historically been late in debt payment at least 90 days.\n\n* Note: submission files should include a probability prediction for loan default, under a column named \"Predicted\". The submission should include the customers' ID as well.-"}}
