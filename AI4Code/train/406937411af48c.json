And since we are able to learn from the test data as well, it's best to create an *online \/ incremental model* for this competition.\n\n\n#### Evaluation metric:\n\nLet's understand the evaluation metric - `roc_auc_score`. It ensures that random predictions always yeild a score of 0.5. If however our score is less that 0.5 it means that we have made some mistake in our predictions (wrongly labeled the data, model does beter than random guess). A score of 1 (or 0) means that model is absolutely perfect and makes correct predictions 100% of the time. \n\nLet's verify this with some random guesses:","1d4d9a8b":"#### We now try to understand `ex_sub` & `ex_test` csv files:\n\nThese files are provided as sample for how the files produced by `env.itertest` would be.

If you are using Python, you will likely want to call eval on the non-null rows. Some rows may be null, or empty lists.\n\n- `prior_group_answers_correct` (string) provides all the answered_correctly field for previous group, with the *same format and caveats as prior_group_responses*. Some rows may be null, or empty lists.\n\nA more thorough understanding can be obtained from this post [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/riiid-test-answer-prediction\/discussion\/190430) by Alex:\n\n     Once you submitted your predictions for a group, you get the next test_df off the iterator and that immediately tells you whether you were right or not. You can use this information to improve your model before continuing with going through the test set, or you can just ignore it.\n    As you can't submit predictions for the same group twice, you can't cheat with it.
