","87d594c1":"### Another initial LR","fd087fe4":"# Recognize named entities on Twitter with LSTMs\n\nIn this assignment, you will use a recurrent neural network to solve Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. NER is a common task in natural language processing systems. It serves for extraction such entities from the text as persons, organizations, locations, etc. In this task you will experiment to recognize named entities from Twitter.\n\nFor example, we want to extract persons' and organizations' names from the text. Than for the input text:\n\n    Ian Goodfellow works for Google Brain\n\na NER model needs to provide the following sequence of tags:\n\n    B-PER I-PER    O     O   B-ORG  I-ORG\n\nWhere *B-* and *I-* prefixes stand for the beginning and inside of the entity, while *O* stands for out of tag or no tag. Markup with the prefix scheme is called *BIO markup*. This markup is introduced for distinguishing of consequent entities with similar types.\n\nA solution of the task will be based on neural networks, particularly, on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTMs).\n\n### Libraries\n\nFor this task you will need the following libraries:\n - [Tensorflow](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org) \u2014 an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence.\n \nIn this assignment, we use Tensorflow 1.15.0. You can install it with pip:\n\n    !pip install tensorflow==1.15.0\n     \n - [Numpy](http:\/\/www.numpy.org) \u2014 a package for scientific computing.\n \nIf you have never worked with Tensorflow, you would probably need to read some tutorials during your work on this assignment, e.g. [this one](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/recurrent) could be a good starting point. ","04220306":"Congratulations! You have specified all the parts of your network. You may have noticed, that we didn't deal with any real data yet, so what you have written is just recipes on how the network should function.\nNow we will put them to the constructor of our Bi-LSTM class to use it in the next section. ","305d984f":"Now, let us specify the layers of the neural network. First, we need to perform some preparatory steps: \n \n- Create embeddings matrix with [tf.Variable](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/Variable). Specify its name (*embeddings_matrix*), type  (*tf.float32*), and initialize with random values.\n- Create forward and backward LSTM cells. TensorFlow provides a number of RNN cells ready for you. We suggest that you use *LSTMCell*, but you can also experiment with other types, e.g. GRU cells. [This](http:\/\/colah.github.io\/posts\/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs\/) blogpost could be interesting if you want to learn more about the differences.\n- Wrap your cells with [DropoutWrapper](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/contrib\/rnn\/DropoutWrapper). Dropout is an important regularization technique for neural networks. Specify all keep probabilities using the dropout placeholder that we created before.\n \nAfter that, you can build the computation graph that transforms an input_batch:\n\n- [Look up](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/nn\/embedding_lookup) embeddings for an *input_batch* in the prepared *embedding_matrix*.\n- Pass the embeddings through [Bidirectional Dynamic RNN](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/nn\/bidirectional_dynamic_rnn) with the specified forward and backward cells. Use the lengths placeholder here to avoid computations for padding tokens inside the RNN.\n- Create a dense layer on top. Its output will be used directly in loss function.  \n \nFill in the code below. In case you need to debug something, the easiest way is to check that tensor shapes of each step match the expected ones. \n ","4db7da30":"Finally, we are ready to run the training!","4f0cd92c":"The last thing to specify is how we want to optimize the loss. \nWe suggest that you use [Adam](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/train\/AdamOptimizer) optimizer with a learning rate from the corresponding placeholder. \nYou will also need to apply clipping to eliminate exploding gradients. It can be easily done with [clip_by_norm](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/clip_by_norm) function.

Note that it should be applied to logits of the model (not to softmax probabilities!). Also note,  that we do not want to take into account loss terms coming from `<PAD>` tokens.

It means that weight updates of the network are based on several sequences at every single time. The tricky part is that all sequences within a batch need to have the same length.
