PEs typically arise from blood clots in the leg veins (deep vein thromboses, or DVTs) that dislodge and become trapped in the pulmonary vasculature. The clinical presentation of PE can vary from asymptomatic to severe illness requiring intensive care (shock, cardiac arrest, etc). <br> It can damage part of the lung due to restricted blood flow, decrease oxygen levels in the blood, and affect other organs as well. Large or multiple blood clots can be fatal. The blockage can be life-threatening. According to the [Mayo Clinic](https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/pulmonary-embolism\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20354647), it results in the death of one-third of people who go undiagnosed or untreated. However, immediate emergency treatment greatly increases your chances of avoiding permanent lung damage.\n\n<a id=\"2\"><\/a>\n<font color=\"black\" size=+2.5><b>2.

Intravenous contrast is administered through the patient's veins just prior to obtaining the CT, and the CT scan is timed to obtain images when the contrast is primarily in the pulmonary blood vessels. **Note: this is where quality issues can occur.** Sometimes the timing of the scan is off, resulting in a suboptimal scan. This can result in non-diagnostic or equivocal studies. In addition, if the patient is moving a lot or has metal in their body, this can cause artifacts which may obscure a clot.\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/8sfiEUU.jpg)\n\nThis image shows a single axial slice of a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA or CTPE) at this level of the pulmonary trunk. The pulmonary trunk (the <font color=\"green\">green annotated part in the image <\/font>) is a major blood vessel that comes from the right side of your heart to supply blood to your lungs. Note how bright the blood vessels are - this is due to the intravenous contrast.\n\n![](https:\/\/imgur.com\/eUWTVwU.jpg)\n\nIn this image, notice how there are <font color=\"red\"> \"filling defects\" in red color <\/font> in the pulmonary trunk. Unlike the previous image, there are areas in the  <font color=\"red\"> blood vessels (marked in red) <\/font> that are more gray. This is evidence of a pulmonary embolism in the blood vessel, as the blood clot prevents the contrast from filling up the entire vessel. <font color=\"blue\">This type of PE would be a central PE in our dataset (it is in the central blood vessel of the lungs). <\/font>\n\n![](https:\/\/prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org\/images\/17483790\/2cc61c62b20f31c98b8b9df642b4d9_gallery.jpeg)\nNote that PEs can occur anywhere in the lung vasculature, which is very extensive and resembles a tree. <font color=\"blue\">However, the finding we are looking for is the same: filling detects. <\/font>.

Generally, acute (sudden-onset) PEs are more likely to cause symptoms, as your body has not had time to adapt to the presence of a clot. There are imaging findings that can distinguish acute from chronic PEs, but this can be challenging to discern. For more on this topic you can have a look at this paper [Acute and Chronic Pulmonary Emboli: Angiography\u2013CT Correlation](https:\/\/www.ajronline.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.2214\/AJR.04.1955)\n\n\n<a id=\"7\"><\/a>\n<font color=\"black\" size=+2.5><b>7.

The muscular chambers that do most of the pumping are known as the ventricles. Your right ventricle pumps blood to your lungs; your left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of your body.\n\n![](https:\/\/imgur.com\/iNIoOkN.jpg)\n\n\nRemember - everything is flipped in radiology, so the RIGHT SIDE of the body is on the LEFT, and vice versa. That giant ball just off-center in this image is the heart. Normally, your left ventricle (lower right) is larger than your right ventricle (upper left), like in this image above. This is because the left ventricle has a much harder job to do: pump body throughout the entire body versus just the lungs. \n\n![](https:\/\/imgur.com\/4lUEZG9.jpg)\nHowever, having a PE can put a big strain on the right side of your heart. Intuitively, this makes sense - if you have a blockage in the blood vessels in your lungs, the right side of your heart has to work a lot harder to try and pump blood through the obstruction. Sometimes, we can see evidence of this on the CT - we call this **right heart strain**. This suggests a more severe PE because the blood clot is forcing your right heart to work harder and causing blood to become backed up into the right ventricle (it's just plumbing!). We can measure the ratio of diameters of the right ventricle to the left ventricle to see if this is high. A high ratio is suggestive of right heart strain.\n\n![](https:\/\/prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org\/images\/807719\/db43f21911fc4f6f8522ca7a3af124_gallery.jpg)\n\nNotice how the upper left part (right ventricle) is much larger than the lower right part (left ventricle). This patient is having a severe PE causing significant right heart strain.\n\nBecause of its importance as a prognostic indicator, <font color=\"blue\"> **detecting RV\/LV ratio > 1** in this competition is weighed most heavily across all the other classes. <\/font> Please note that this is a 3D image. <font color=\"blue\">  The proper way to compute RV\/LV ratio is to find the maximum diameter across all slices.

Typically, we will use blood thinners, either IV or oral. In severe cases, we may attempt catheter-directed thrombolysis. An interventional radiologist inserts a catheter into the pulmonary blood vessels to deliver clot-busting medication directly to the clot. Rarely, surgery may be required.\n\n\n\n<a id=\"9\"><\/a>\n<font color=\"black\" size=+2.5><b>9.

A pulmonary embolism (PE) is caused by an artery blockage in the lung. It is time consuming to confirm a PE and prone to overdiagnosis. Machine learning could help to more accurately identify PE cases, which would make management and treatment more effective for patients.Currently, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), is the most common type of medical imaging to evaluate patients with suspected PE. These CT scans consist of hundreds of images that require detailed review to identify clots within the pulmonary arteries. As the use of imaging continues to grow, constraints of radiologists\u2019 time may contribute to delayed diagnosis.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll detect and classify PE cases. In particular, you'll use chest CTPA images (grouped together as studies) and your data science skills to enable more accurate identification of PE. If successful, you'll help reduce human delays and errors in detection and treatment. With 60,000-100,000 PE deaths annually in the United States, it is among the most fatal cardiovascular diseases. Timely and accurate diagnosis will help these patients receive better care and may also improve outcomes.","24c47719":"From the documentation we get the follwoing information about the columns of the dataframes. \n\n| Field Name | Feature Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :---- |\n| **StudyInstanceUID** | UID | unique ID for each study (exam) in the data. |\n| **SeriesInstanceUID** | UID | unique ID for each series within the study. |\n| **SOPInstanceUID** | UID |  unique ID for each image within the study (and data) |\n| **pe_present_on_image**|  image-level | notes whether any form of PE is present on the image.|\n| **negative_exam_for_pe**|  exam-level | whether there are any images in the study that have PE present.|\n| **qa_motion** |  informational | indicates whether radiologists noted an issue with motion in the study. | \n|**qa_contrast** |  informational | indicates whether radiologists noted an issue with contrast in the study.|\n| **flow_artifact** | informational | ---|\n| **rv_lv_ratio_gte_1** | exam-level| indicates whether the RV\/LV ratio present in the study is >= 1|\n| **rv_lv_ratio_lt_1** | exam-level| indicates whether the RV\/LV ratio present in the study is < 1|\n| **leftsided_pe** | exam-level | indicates that there is PE present on the left side of the images in the study| \n| **chronic_pe**  | exam-level | indicates that the PE in the study is chronic|\n| **true_filling_defect_not_pe** | informational | indicates a defect that is NOT PE|\n| **rightsided_pe** | exam-level | indicates that there is PE present on the right side of the images in the study|\n| **acute_and_chronic_pe** | exam-level| indicates that the PE present in the study is both acute AND chronic|\n| **central_pe** | exam-level| indicates that there is PE present in the center of the images in the study|\n| **indeterminate**  | exam-level| indicates that while the study is not negative for PE, an ultimate set of exam-level labels could not be created, due to QA issues|\n\n<br>\n\n### What is `image-level` and `exam-level` features:\nIn this competition, `image-level` feature prediction means you have to find predict that particular feature for each of the image separately. Here all the images are unique.\n\nOn the contrary `exam-label` feature means you have to characterize that particular image exam or observation. Here one thing should be very clear that one exam has many images. Here the prediction is based on the experiment\/examination. \n\nThe following image is a flowchart outlining the relationships between labels. Note that there are four labels in the training set that are purely informational and require no predictions. They are `QA Contrast`, `QA Motion`, `True filling defect not PE`, and `Flow artifact`, and are not scored, but are meant to be used as helpers. Also note that `Acute PE` is not an explicit label, but is implied by the lack of `Chronic PE `or A`cute and Chronic PE`.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/download\/storage\/v1\/b\/kaggle-user-content\/o\/inbox%2F115173%2Fa2a5ee66b5799274141dd547cc3ea466%2FPE%20figure.jpg?generation=1599575183749576&alt=media)\n","94821469":"Now let us have a look at the sample submission file so that we can understand what to predict from all the images. **","65033f36":"### 3.
