To better contextualize the MSE obtained by our model, let's see how well we can do with a higher-powered model: a **neural network.**\n\nNote that even though the two models perform similarly for this particular dataset, this won't usually be the case. Also, linear regression models can only handle very specific types of inputs, whereas neural networks are much more flexible--they can even handle image, audio, and text as inputs!","604e7420":"# Splitting into training and testing sets\nThe training set will be used to fit our model (find the best $\\beta$ values) and the test set will be used to evaluate our model's ability to generalize to _new_ data.","bc20ded5":"# Setup\nWe'll most be using the `sklearn` library, which supports a lot of different machine learning models.
