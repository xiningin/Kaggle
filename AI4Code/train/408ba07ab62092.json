This poses a problem because it affets pixels values that are even far away from it (because of the shiny rays that emanates from them).

It's also consistent with the values found in the [wikipedia page for hounsfield units](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hounsfield_scale#cite_note-BolligerOesterhelweg2009-22): \n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nThis why I said at the beginning of this kernel that we couldn't discard these pics. We don't want our models to be completely lost when they encounter this type of situation in the wild, because a guy deserves the same quality of health care no matter if he's an \"edge case\" for a model because of his\/her dentition or not. This is the kind of situation where I suppose a Hippocrates Serment for data scientist would start to make sense. \n\nBut I digress... The following cell will let you plot random picture with those high pixel values, so that you can get a sense of what's going on.\n","8fa6c65e":"# HounsField Units: 50 shades of gray","aba03b66":"This work builds on top of Jeremy Howard's amazing kernel \"Some DICOM gotchas to be aware of (fastai)\". In that kernel, Jeremy notices some range of pixel values are WAY out of what we can usually expect in terms of Hounsfield Units. We could decide to discard those scans entirely, but some similar value appear in the test set as well, and (as we'll see) for good reason. I decided to investigate those in depth, to understand what was going on.\n\nNote: this is the first time in three or four competitions that I dare publish a kernel (because usually I never have anything new to offer). So please forgive me if the following is total nonsense, or something that everybody knew and thought was obvious. We'll start by importing the needed stuff."}}
