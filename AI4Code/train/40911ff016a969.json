While demographic filtering is very elemantary and cannot be used practically, **Hybrid Systems** can take advantage of content-based and collaborative filtering as the two approaches are proved to be almost complimentary.\nThis model was very baseline and only provides a fundamental framework to start with.\n\nI would like to mention some excellent refereces that I learned from\n\n1.

These are the following steps we'll follow :-\n* Get the index of the movie given its title.\n* Get the list of cosine similarity scores for that particular movie with all movies. Convert it into a list of tuples where the first element is its position and the second is the similarity score.\n* Sort the aforementioned list of tuples based on the similarity scores; that is, the second element.\n* Get the top 10 elements of this list. Ignore the first element as it refers to self (the movie most similar to a particular movie is the movie itself).\n* Return the titles corresponding to the indices of the top elements.","f6186015":"While our system has done a decent job of finding movies with similar plot descriptions, the quality of recommendations is not that great. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" returns all Batman movies while it is more likely that the people who liked that movie are more inclined to enjoy other Christopher Nolan movies. This is something that cannot be captured by the present system.","bce10350":"For any of you who has done even a bit of text processing before knows we need to convert the word vector of each overview. Now we'll compute Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors for each overview.\n\nNow if you are wondering what is term frequency , it is the relative frequency of a word in a document and is given as (term instances\/total instances). Inverse Document Frequency is the relative count of documents containing the term is given as log(number of documents\/documents with term) The overall importance of each word to the documents in which they appear is equal to TF * IDF\n\nThis will give you a matrix where each column represents a word in the overview vocabulary (all the words that appear in at least one document) and each row represents a movie, as before.This is done to reduce the importance of words that occur frequently in plot overviews and therefore, their significance in computing the final similarity score.\n\nFortunately, scikit-learn gives you a built-in TfIdfVectorizer class that produces the TF-IDF matrix in a couple of lines. That's great, isn't it?","5d44bf1e":"# **Content Based Filtering**\n> *  **Content Based Filtering**- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n\nIn this recommender system the content of the movie (overview, cast, crew, keyword, tagline etc) is used to find its similarity with other movies. Then the movies that are most likely to be similar are recommended.\n\n![](https:\/\/image.ibb.co\/f6mDXU\/conten.png)","c3de1702":"The next steps are the same as what we did with our plot description based recommender. One important difference is that we use the **CountVectorizer()** instead of TF-IDF. This is because we do not want to down-weight the presence of an actor\/director if he or she has acted or directed in relatively more movies. It doesn't make much intuitive sense.","592fdbbf":"We see that our recommender has been successful in capturing more information due to more metadata and has given us (arguably) better recommendations. It is more likely that Marvels or DC comics fans will like the movies of the same production house. Therefore, to our features above we can add *production_company* . \nWe can also increase the weight of the director , by adding the feature multiple times in the soup.","7b71e52c":"Next, we'll write functions that will help us to extract the required information from each feature.","d7fcb334":"We can now reuse our **get_recommendations()** function by passing in the new **cosine_sim2** matrix as your second argument.","93b9928f":"The next step would be to convert the names and keyword instances into lowercase and strip all the spaces between them. This is done so that our vectorizer doesn't count the Johnny of \"Johnny Depp\" and \"Johnny Galecki\" as the same.","e4738ca0":"We see that over 20,000 different words were used to describe the 4800 movies in our dataset.\n\nWith this matrix in hand, we can now compute a similarity score. There are several candidates for this; such as the euclidean, the Pearson and the [cosine similarity scores](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cosine_similarity). There is no right answer to which score is the best. Different scores work well in different scenarios and it is often a good idea to experiment with different metrics.\n\nWe will be using the cosine similarity to calculate a numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies. We use the cosine similarity score since it is independent of magnitude and is relatively easy and fast to calculate. Mathematically, it is defined as
