Context\n\nAnimal Crossing is a video game series on Nintendo which allows you to create an island and grow a little village. You start the game with a random set of 3 villagers, and you can find other villagers to invite to your town by visiting mystery islands. You can also add villagers by purchasing amiibo products. You're able to have conversations with your villagers, and you're able to visit their homes. You can even give them gifts within the game, and it helps to choose gifts that are more accurate to their personality\/interests. Many users seem to form attachments with their villagers, which is why I'm interested in this research area.","e1101a63":"**Setup**\n\nI'm starting with some initial checks to familiarize myself with the data, to have a place to double-check what datasets are in the file, and to import the necessary libraries.","21a6e51b":"# Conclusions\n\nThis data shows us a few interesting insights. Analysis 1 shows that the main points of discussion around critic and user reviews have to do with \"one island\" or \"per island\", which refers to the fact that you can only have one island per Switch console. This seems to be a popular point of contention around how people view the platform. \"Villager\" appears on both word clouds but is not particularly large point of discussion. I wonder if this has to do with villagers not being something people tend to complain about, or something that works so well that it's not something notable enough for a review?\n\nAnalysis 2 shows the trends in villager personalities, and how these have changed in the last two major games of the series. I think this is more helpful if you have some zodiac sign data to compare to, so here's a short snippet of zodiac descriptions I pulled from the first Google link that shows up when searching \"zodiac sign and description\" (accuracy or looking for a specific link to explain the signs doesn't seem important here as, in my opinion, a lot of astrology feels made up...).

From this, I would utilize the columns that describe the villager name, birthday, and personality type. I may also be interested in exploring things like favorite colors or songs. \n\nThe limits to this may be that there is no column with an interpretation of the labels. For example, it might be nice to have data about what genre their favorite songs fall into, or what the color theory of their favorite colors are. This could help further my analysis, but would need to be entered manually if I wanted to study it (I mean, technically I could use Python to add an extra column but that would only be helpful if the songs reappeared multiple times--it would be helpful if I wanted to do this for the colors). Things I wouldn\u2019t need from this dataset are information about the items, wallpaper, flooring, furniture, filename, and unique entry ID. These are not needed because either they look like gibberish (random numbers that don\u2019t mean anything in this context), or because they are not repetitive themes. For example, colors reappear for various villagers, but only a few may have the same wallpaper\/flooring overlap. This makes it harder to identify patterns. \n\nI\u2019m interested in this data because I\u2019ve been playing a LOT of Animal Crossing: New Horizons lately and the fanbase is super fascinating to me. Some people get really attached to the villagers in the game, and there\u2019s a bit of astrology within the game (star fragment types vary based on what astrology season it is). I also don\u2019t believe in astrology, so I find this extra interesting because it means I need to find meaning or patterns in something I don\u2019t quite understand. It\u2019ll be a fun exercise to learn more about how these villagers were created and if there are identifiable patterns that can help us learn more about them (for example, maybe this information could help users pick better \u201cgifts\u201d for their villagers, as that\u2019s a sizable part of the game\/interaction with villagers for many users).","8b54c975":"# Analysis #2: Zodiac Signs\nI'll be setting up lists that define the various dates and which zodiac sign they fall into. By setting up a function to auto-sort the villagers based on their birthday, I'll add a column for the zodiac sign data to the csv and rewrite it as a new file as well.","401113d1":"Ran a quick bit of code for distribution graphs (this is the only code I kept from the \"starter notebook\" when I forked the new data from an Animal Crossing dataset on Kaggle) of sampled columns for a quick overview of the villager data.","6d58237e":"Now, we can graph this data in a stacked bar graph to see exactly how many villagers are new or removed between the two games, per zodiac sign.","0564f08e":"# Directions for future work\n\nI didn't get a chance to review some other questions I had, but I'd like to find a way to do these eventually as I think the results could be very interesting. Here's a few of the questions I'd like to explore, if I had more time to learn how to try to answer these:\n\n**Question 1: Which zodiac signs are found most often within certain personality types?**\nI would try to do this by doing multiple-bar graphs which would show, for example, how many Leo, Capricorn, Aries, etc. villagers are of the \"Snooty\" personality type or the \"Cranky\" personality type. I think this would be fascinating to see if the zodiac sign their personality relates to is indeed a representative of the personality type they are.\n\n**Question 2: Which zodiac signs are found most often within certain style types?**\nThis would be done the same way as question 1, but I might need to find a way to reconcile the fact that there are two different style types. Would I only use \"Style 1\" data? Maybe a second graph would show \"Style 2\"? Is there a way to relate the combination of three different datasets and how many times they occur in a similar grouping (for example, \"Pisces\" but also \"Cool\" and \"Simple\" style should appear as 1 count and \"Pisces\" with \"Simple\" and \"Cool\" should also count as a 2nd occurrence)?\n\n**Question 3: Which zodiac signs prefer which songs the most?**\nThis one sounds super fun because first I'd want to run a script that dictates what genre each song belongs to. Then, I'd want to graph the data similar to Question 1 where I'd want to see which songs are most common for which zodiac signs (for example, how many and what genres occur under the \"Aries\" zodiac sign?). \n\nFor mini project 2, I would continue this work not necessarily by answering the questions below, but by running a sentiment analysis on some set of tweets relating to Animal Crossing and villagers. I'm very interested in the topic of personalities of villagers and am mostly trying to figure out how I can continue to analyze that from a machine learning perspective.","27928f68":"# Analysis #1: WordCloud Exploration\nHere, I'm studying the different ways of exploring user and critic reviews through wordclouds. I'm hoping to answer some questions here about what users talk about most when it comes to reviewing and evaluating the experience of the game. I'm hoping to gain a better understanding of whether villagers are a big part of the experience, or what else users and critics look towards when analyzing this game.","7b84708e":"**Question 1: What words are most prevalent in the critic reviews?**\n\nTo do this, I'll first test it out on one review, and then create a variable to assess all reviews and do a second wordcloud image to show all the reviews.","8ccf091c":"**Question 2: What sign is each villager in New Leaf?**\n\nSince we've analyzed zodiac data for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, we can now set up the Animal Crossing: New Leaf data in the same way so that it's ready for comparison later.","e62870e0":"**Question 4: What are the zodiac signs of the characters that have been removed in New Horizons, or added in New Horizons, compared to New Leaf?**\n\nUsing the data found in question 3, I ran the \"zodiac_sign\" function to see what kind of personalities comprise the removed\/new villagers.","6e6242a5":"**Question 2: What words are most prevalent in the user reviews?**\n\nNow, let's see how the word cloud for critics compares to user reviews.","ec69ea40":"**Question 5: How does quantity of certain zodiac signs vary from New Leaf to New Horizons?**\n\nIn this, I'm trying to do a double bar graph to show the quantity of one zodiac sign in both New Horizons and New Leaf. The data has changed because more characters were added, but it also seems to have changed because there's fewer of certain zodiac signs in the new game. Interesting... I wonder who they deleted and who they kept when making New Horizons?","1db762a8":"Now, I need to convert this data to a new csv file that includes this data so that I can compare it against the Animal Crossing New Leaf villager dataset.","d3523535":"# Overview\nThe study of this data stems greatly from the datasets available to compare with, and from my interest in better understanding the villagers' personalities. I am re-using my villagers.csv datafile from A5, which I found from an online Google Doc, and am also incorporating a second dataset that offers 4 different CSV files for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which include user reviews, critic reviews, villager data, and item data (the only data I'm not using from this is the item data). After doing the zodiac analysis on my original villager dataset, I realized I had more questions about villagers from past versions of the game, so I incorporated a third dataset that shows villager data from Animal Crossing: New Leaf.\n\nMy overarching goal for both Mini Project 1 and 2 is to gain a better understanding of the personalities of villagers and how their personalities relate to experiences\/attachment of users with villagers. I'd like to ask questions like the following:\n* What do users and critics have to say about the games? Is there any reference to villagers?\n* What traits are most commonly found in villagers?\n* What impact do these traits have on likability by users, and the overall experience of the game?\n* Is there some reason why some villagers are more or less liked by users?","d03071d8":"**Question 3: Which characters are missing from New Leaf to New Horizons?**\n\nTo understand some trends in villager personalities and to better understand the type of experience Nintendo is aiming for, I thought it'd be beneficial to know which villagers were kept\/removed from New Leaf, and any new villagers that were added in New Horizons.","1e2b2a91":"**Question 1: What zodiac sign is each villager in New Horizons?**\n\nThis code block sets up a function called \"zodiac_sign\" that analyzes birthdays and sorts them by their zodiac sign based on lists of dates"}}
