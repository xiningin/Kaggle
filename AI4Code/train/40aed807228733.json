In addition, Volkswagen's ROE has a similar increase from 5.79% from 2016 to 10.5% in 2017 before slowing trending back up to 10.36% in 2018 and 11.40% in 2019. We will perform Dupont Analysis to determine the reason for the increase in 2017.\n","ea9fe8d9":"Volkswagen is a well established brand with strong and stable cash flows from its diversified brands. While it sufferred a majore dip due to diesel scandal in 2015, resulting in a strong rebound starting in 2017.

However, Volkswagen Debt-to-Assets Ratio remain stable at 0.74 to 0.77 throughout 2016 to 2019. This implies that debt in increasing faster than equity in order to fund the growth in the firm. The ratios vould be a concern in future in face of the new recession, where Volkswagen may be incentivized to increase debt due to the low interest-rates.","aec54e50":"Overall, Volkswagen maintained a strong liquid position over the years. Volkswagen's Current and Quick ratios have improved over the years, where the Current Ratio surpassed 1.00 in 2018.

This implies Volkswagen requires longer periods to acquire cash from its operations, where it takes 87 days paying for inventory and the cash collected from the sale of inventory. The significant increase is from 2018 where inventory days and receivable days increased by 8. \nVolkswagen's total asset turnover is relatively high but suffered a decrease from 53.02% in 2016 to 51.76% in 2019.
