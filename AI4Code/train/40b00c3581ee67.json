While I initially considered doing the extraction with regular expressions, I discovered the versatility of SpaCy\u2019s sentencizer and leveraged it. The sentencizer permits an easy, intuitive, pythonic way to examine tokens appearing before and after words, including built-in functions for checking tokens for case combinations and sentence positions.\n\nI iteratively developed these extractor functions by running them on the training data, ranking the extracted dataset mentions by their document frequency, and modifying the functions to make cleaner extractions with more focus put on the dataset mentions with higher document frequency.","53ac19b5":"Load up all the IDs and raw text  of the test data into a dataframe.","a8313a9e":"# Submit predictions","700682b4":"# Frequency filtering\nAfter combining the outputs of all extractor functions, I rank them by their document frequency and retain only the top 95 percentile.
