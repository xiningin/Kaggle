very little students who got less percentage in ssc did best in hsc and degree.\n\n 1. The \"MKT&Fin\" students with degree background \"Comm & Mgmt\" students got more placed. The students with degree backgound \"Sci & tech \" also perfomed well in placements with better placed percentage than Comm & Mgmt.\n\n 2. Although, The analysis also told us that ssc% and hsc% are also important for strong foundation. There are more students less than 60% in hsc_p and ssc_p who did not get placed. As we see there are only little students who performed well in etest_p and mba_p did not get placed.\n \n 3.
