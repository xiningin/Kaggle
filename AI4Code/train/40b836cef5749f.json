And why is it important?\n\nIn the past, scientists derived drugs from natural products or were inspired by traditional remedies. Very common drugs, such as paracetamol, known in the US as acetaminophen, were put into clinical use decades before the biological mechanisms driving their pharmacological activities were understood. Today, with the advent of more powerful technologies, drug discovery has changed from the serendipitous approaches of the past to a more targeted model based on an understanding of the underlying biological mechanism of a disease. In this new framework, scientists seek to identify a protein target associated with a disease and develop a molecule that can modulate that protein target. As a shorthand to describe the biological activity of a given molecule, scientists assign a label referred to as mechanism-of-action or MoA for short.\n\n## How do we determine the MoAs of a new drug?\n\nOne approach is to treat a sample of human cells with the drug and then analyze the cellular responses with algorithms that search for similarity to known patterns in large genomic databases, such as libraries of gene expression or cell viability patterns of drugs with known MoAs.","6fa2b1a4":"# Imports","396c26e7":"# Checking for null values","9d1e7ba2":"## Number of Gene expression columns","d0ebe52b":"## Number of Cell viability columns","03efd5ef":"# What does the data look like?","292baa16":"## Distribution"}}
