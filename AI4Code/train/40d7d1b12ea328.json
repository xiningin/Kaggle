If we wanted to know the best value for the `n_estimators` parameter, we could fit a few models, each with a different value, and see which one tests the best.   \n\n**Grid search** allows us to do this for multiple parameters simultaneously. We will select a few different parameters that we want to tune, and for each one we will provide a few different values to try out. Then grid search will fit models to every possible combination of these parameter values and use **cross-validation** to assess the performance in each case.   \n\nFurthermore, since we are using CV, we don't need to keep a separate validation set.","9c448e18":"### Create Random Forest model\nWe will first make a random forest model, using all of the default parameters.   \n> Note: set the `random_state` to 42 for reproducibility","622fe86b":"### 3.2.2.

Regular label encoding assigns some category labels higher numerical values. This implies some sort of scale (Embarked = 1 is not **more** than Embarked = 0 - it's just _different_). One Hot Encoding avoids this problem.   \n\nWe will assume that there is some ordinality in the `Pclass` variable, so we will leave that as a single column."}}
