Deaths From Air Pollution Worldwide Data","bfe9b81d":"<h1>Air Pollution in India Analysis <\/h1>\n\nAir pollution occurs when harmful or excessive qualities of substances including gases, particles, and biological molecules are introduced into the Earth's atmosphere. Air pollution in India is a serious issue, ranking higher than smoking, high blood pressure, child and maternal malnutrition, and risk factors for diabetes. At least 140 million people breathe air 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit  and 13 of the world's 20 cities with the highest annual levels of air pollution are in India.  Air pollution contributes to the premature deaths of 2 million Indians every year. In urban areas, most emissions come from vehicles and industry, whereas in rural areas, much of the pollution stems from biomass burning for cooking and keeping warm. In autumn and winter months, large scale crop residue burning in agriculture fields \u2013 a low cost alternative to mechanical tilling \u2013 is a major source of smoke, smog and particulate pollution. India has a low per capita emissions of greenhouse gases but the country as a whole is the third largest after China and the United States. A 2013 study on non-smokers has found that Indians have 30% lower lung function compared to Europeans.\n\nThe Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was passed in 1981 to regulate air pollution and there have been some measurable improvements. However, the 2016 Environmental Performance Index ranked India 141 out of 180 countries.\n\n\nIn 2015, Government of India, together with IIT Kanpur launched the National Air Quality Index. In 2019, India launched 'The National Clean Air Programme' with tentative national target of 20%-30% reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 2024, considering 2017 as the base year for comparison. It will be rolled out in 102 cities that are considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\n\n\n\n\n![](http:\/\/si.wsj.net\/public\/resources\/images\/BN-OJ027_POLDET_G_20160607063315.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven of the world's 10 worst polluted cities are in India, a new study has revealed, with wider South Asia home to scores more blighted by dirty air.\n\nGurugram, a city about 30km southwest of India's capital New Delhi, had the worst pollution levels globally in 2018, the study published on Tuesday by AirVisual and Greenpeace showed.\n\nThree other Indian cities, and Faisalabad, in Pakistan, made up the top five. Out of the 20 most polluted cities worldwide, 18 were in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\nNew Delhi, home to more than 20 million people, was ranked at 11, making it the world's most polluted capital, ahead of Dhaka, in Bangladesh, and Kabul, in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n![](http:\/\/cdni0.trtworld.com\/w960\/h540\/q75\/22324_IND-2017-11-12-India-new-delhi-air-pollution-AFP_1510451129110.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\"Air pollution steals our livelihoods and our futures,\" Yeb Sano, executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said in a statement. \"In addition to human lives lost, there's an estimated global cost of 225 billion dollars in lost labour, and trillions in medical costs,\" he added.\n\n\"We want this report to make people think about the air we breathe, because when we understand the impacts of air quality on our lives, we will act to protect what's most important.\"","a8f945e8":"<h1> 6.

Air pollution in India is caused by fuelwood and biomass burning, burning of crop residue in agriculture fields on a large scale, use of adulterated fuel, emission from vehicles and traffic congestion.\n\nIndia is the third largest in the emission of greenhouse gases after China and the United States. The severity of air pollution is so much that life expectancy among Indians on an average reduces by 3.4 years while among the residents of Delhi it reduces by almost 6.3 years.\n\nIn this section, we will assess the quality of air in India based on indicators like Household Air Quality and Outdoor Air Quality affected by PM10, PM2.5, Ozone (O3), Nitrogen oxides (NOX), Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and Carbon monoxide (CO).\n\nIt has been found that, around the world, more deaths occur due to poor air quality than water. The World Health Organization (WHO) gives a guideline to measure air pollution in a region according to which it had fixed the limit of particulate matters in the air.\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization considers air unsafe when average exposure to any of these matters exceeds the limit. According to the 2016 EPI, more than 3.5 billion people \u2013 half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 are exposed to unsafe air quality which also includes 75% of India\u2019s population.\n\nHowever, Indian air quality standard limits the safe exposure to PM2.5 up to 40 \u03bcg\/m3 and a recent study reveals that 50% population living in 45% districts of India is exposed at PM2.5 concentration beyond 40 \u03bcg\/m3.The World Health Organization considers air unsafe when average exposure to any of these matters exceeds the limit. According to the 2016 EPI, more than 3.5 billion people \u2013 half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 are exposed to unsafe air quality which also includes 75% of India\u2019s population.\n\nAs some indicators are common for indoor as well as outdoor pollution, to understand clearly, we need to first know what these indicators really are.\n\nParticulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture consisting of varying combinations of dry solid fragments, solid cores with liquid coatings and small droplets of liquid. These tiny particles vary greatly in shape, size and chemical composition, and can be made up of many different materials such as metals, soot, soil, and dust.\n\nParticulates are highly carcinogenic and have been classified in Group I carcinogen because of their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstreams. They can also cause permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks, and premature death.\n\nPM10 is roughly one-seventh the diameter of a normal human hair. PM10 is a major component of indoor air pollution and forest fires. It consists of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, and black carbon; it may also include concentrations of natural windblown dust. PM10 is harmful to health because it can block and inflame nasal and bronchial passages, causing a variety of respiratory-related conditions that lead to illness or death. The European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), published in 2013, stated that with every increase of 10 \u03bcg\/m3 in PM10, the rise of 22% in the lung cancer was observed.\n\nPM2.5 is often produced by biomass and fossil fuel combustion as well as natural sources such as windblown dust and volcanic activity. It is often considered even more dangerous to human health because of its ultrafine size and ability to cause several diseases related to lung and heart. With every increase of 10 \u03bcg\/m3 in PM2.5 concentration, 36% increase in lung cancer was also observed.\n\nOzone (O3), an important ingredient of smog, is a highly reactive and unstable gas capable of damaging the linings of the respiratory tract that can cause lung inflammation, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, coughing and exacerbation of respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and asthma. Long-term exposure has been linked with chronic respiratory illnesses. Approximately 142,000 people died as a result of exposure to ozone in 2010 \u2013 an increase of about 6% since 1990.\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOX) are one of the principal pollutants that result from fossil fuel combustion. It helps in the formation of ozone and also causes several chronic diseases.\n\nSulphur dioxide (SO2) is a colourless gas with a very sharp odour formed with the combustion of sulphur-based coal and oil. Sulfur dioxide can form Sulphuric acidic upon combination with water and can cause acid rain. SO2 can also cause respiratory and cardiac diseases which lead to increased mortality rate.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless gas, produced mostly by vehicles, fuel combustion boilers and incinerators. It can cause headaches, visual impairment, reduced cognitive functioning and ability, and reduced ability to perform complex tasks.

As stated here, this is a very serious problem which is difficult to treat due to the nature of airborne particles.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), outdoor air pollution is classified into four main categories: particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Additionally, air pollution is further divided into primary and secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants are released directly into the atmosphere from a source, where secondary pollutants occur as a result of complex chemical reactions taking place from two pollutants reacting with each other (Kibble and Harrison 2005).\n\nIn the 1970's, the United States government formed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to growing concern of our impact on the environment. Ever since then, an entire industry has opened, focusing to remediate what was done before as well as maintain a sense of responsibility for what we do to the environment now. Unfortunately, since this is a relatively new concern, there is very little history of how air pollution has been dealt with in the past. Through current research, we are now making history.\n\n<h2>Source of air Pollution<\/h2>\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2d\/Sources_of_Air_Pollution.png)\n","4fc9561f":"\nNitrogen dioxide is formed naturally, but is primarily produced by automobiles, electric plants, and other sources that burn fuel at high temperatures.
