the Nophhytes and the Wisezards, because of the years of experience programming we can suppose that age  must be proportional to years of experience. \nBut, let's check the graphs!","f8220989":"## **Programming Languages**","d3f17e21":"Now let\u2019s see a little bit more about this special social classes starting by the women\u2019s power, because Wisezards and Neophytes are not exclusive just for men.\nI mean, we are at the XXI century. ","2ad2ef6a":"Trought the pass of years some programming languages have become most populars than others, and some of the older people prefer to use what they already knows instead of try in a new language. So, in this last part I'm showing you what are the most common programming languages used for Wisezards and Neophytes. ","68cd292d":"## **Wisezards and Neophytes**","ade88fe2":"Once upon a time there was a beautiful and magic place called \u201cThe kaggle\u2019s kingdom\u201d,  where thousands of people from all over the world used to live in peace everyday,  no matter where they came from, their gender, education, even their age because all of them had one thing in common \u201cprogramming\u201d.\n\nIn the village of Kaggle we may find powerful  from Machine Learning Knights, honorable Data Scientists to  Code slaves. But I\u2019m going to introduce you to a very distinctive social class called \u201cThe Wisezards\u201d, this is the people who have been writing code to analyze data for more than 20 years, consider as the most experimented people programming,  also I need to talk about the opposite side \u201cThe Neophytes\u201d, this are the ones who are starting in this wonderful world of writing code, and for last but not less important \u201cThe Sourcerer's Apprentice\u201d better known as intermediate ones, who have been writing code for more than 5 years but less than 20. \n","3d186f4f":"*The top 5 of programming languages that Wisezards use are...*\n* Python\n* R\n* Visual Basic\/VBA\n* C\/C++\n* Other","08e6ce97":"As you can see there are not many women as I was actually expecting in the Kaggle's comunity but also we can realized that from the past 5 years to now  the amount of them is increasing and getting an important place between Neophytes. \n","d9b3e41e":"* Data shows that most of the Neophytes belong to the 25-29 age group and another big amount of people belong to 22-24 age group , with majority of them being males. There is any woman before her 60's trying to learn write code in the Kingdom.\n\n* Wisezards are dominated by the oldest men of the kingdom, in this grph I have my doubts, as you can see there is a few group of women from 22 to 24 years that seems to have more than 30 years writing code, it must be a completely joke! \n\nIt's also interesting how men about their 80's or more continue writing code, maybe it's a joke too. ","65e95275":"The Wisezards is a group of people really documented with lots of experience, it's a selected group with just a few on the other hand Neophyte's group is a bigger especially the ones who have been writing code between one to two years.
