Take your data point, subtract the mean from the data point, and then divide by your standard deviation. That gives you your Z-score.\n### You can use Z-Score to determine outliers. When you determine outliers it depends on you to delete them or use log, winsorize, and similar methods.","87eb230c":"## Step 2: Calculate mean, standard deviation","bc84ee7a":"# What are the criteria to identify an outlier?\n- Data point that falls outside of 1.5 times of an interquartile range above the 3rd quartile and below the 1st quartile\n- Data point that falls outside of 3 standard deviations. we can use a z score and if the z score falls outside of 2 standard deviation","30c5830c":"#### A normal distribution is shown below and it is estimated that\n- *68%* of the data points lie between +\/- 1 standard deviation.\n- *95%* of the data points lie between +\/- 2 standard deviation\n- *99.7%* of the data points lie between +\/- 3 standard deviation \n![Image of normal distribution](https:\/\/media.geeksforgeeks.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/20200428193707\/image-111-1.png)\n\n*Image Credit: [geekforgeeks](https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/)*","e937f4b8":"# What is an outlier?\n####  An outlier is a data point in a data set that is distant from all other observations.

Z score is also called standard score. This score helps to understand if a data value is greater or smaller than mean and how far away it is from the mean.
