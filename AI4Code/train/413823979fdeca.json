insights on the website's traffic, users, locations, search engine crawlers, referring sites, consumed content, performance, and anything else that can be gleaned. \n\nThis first step is the prototype of a process of convering a log file to an efficient format on disk (Apache Parquet), and then to read it into an efficient DataFrame with optimized datatypes. \n\nIn this example we convert a 3.3 GB text file to a 258 MB `parquet` file, which is later read into a 342 MB DataFrame. The total time can vary between three to five minutes, depending on the system used. This notebook ran the full process in 204 seconds.

And how many \"large\"? What about medium size pages? \nHow do we even define those labels? \n\nSummarizing a large number of values is not always easy. One way to do it is by using KMeans clustering on a list of numbers. We specify the number of clusters, and the algorithm finds the a set of `K` (number) points, where each is the mean of a group of points. Hence \"K-Means\".\n\nWe can also get other statistics for each cluster (min, max, std, and so on), then visualize those centers, and see how many points we have in that cluster. We can do this interactively, changing the number of clusters to see the optimal number based on the application. In this case, we are stil exploring, so this is basically allowing us to identify pages with a small, medium, large, etc. size, without us giving those values explicitly. We are discovering them this way.\n\nFirst instantiate the model with the desired number of clusters: ","8cf8ace8":"# Log Format \nThis approach assumes the common log format and\/or the combined one, which are two of the most commonly used.

This ensures minimal memory consumption. \n* For each line, check it against the regular expression, and process it: \n  * Match: append the matched line to a `parsed_lines` list\n  * No match: append the non-matching line to the `errors_file` for later analysis\n* Once `parsed_lines` reaches 250,000 elements, convert the list to a DataFrame and save it to a `parquet` file in the `output_dir`. Clear the list. This also ensures minimal memory usage, and the 250k can be tweaked if necessary.\n* Read all the files of the `output_dir` with `read_parquet` into a pandas DataFrame. This function handles reading all the files and combines them. \n* Optimize the columns by using more efficient data types, most notably the pandas categorical type.\n* Write the DataFrame to a single file, for more convenient handling, and with the more efficient datatypes. This results in even faster reading.\n* Delete the files in `output_dir`.\n* Read in the final file with `read_parquet`.\n* Start analyzing.\n","437f8be6":"## Sample lines from the log file","fd62df48":"# Analyzing Organic Search Traffic\n\nReferer traffic that is from search engines can provide valuable information on that traffic. \nMost importantly, the query parameters of the URLs of those referers contain that information. \n\nWe can easily filter for those URLs, and then parse their different elements to get some information on the type of traffic they are sending:","16f0c3eb":"Sort the parameters by the frequency of their use: ","5dde73e1":"Get the `cluster_centers_` These are the means of the groups\/clusters of points that were discovered based on the given `k`.","73a2eca1":"Now reading the file took almost half the previous time.
