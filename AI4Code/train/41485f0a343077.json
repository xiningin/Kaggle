Probably it happens due to the fact that most of them are produced by Netflix. Once the company started investing on it later than the big players on the market, those titles present less seasons yet. It is another argument showing that Netflix is investing to be a great Media Player, not only just a movie distribuitor or tech\/streaming company.\n\nA great conclusing after exploring the countries where Movies and TV Shows were made is that Netflix still having most of its titles from USA and UK, once those are the greatest producers in the globe (in financial and awards numbers). However, it presented a diverse catalog, with more than 81 nations, even though 2\/3 of titles are concentrated in less than 20% of these countries.\n\nThe next steps of Netflix Exploratory analysis would be include financial factors and also analyse it in a more granular way, including producers and other stakeholders on the analysis.
