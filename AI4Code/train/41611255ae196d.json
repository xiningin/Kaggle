This plot shows how the abscence of one variable affects another.","3a510241":"As expected, we see that duration, description, identifier and media_type all have high scores of correlation (1, or almost 1). We also note that these variables all have strong negative correlation with coordinates which suggests they are in different types of games.\n\nLooking at the bottom right we also see various strong correlations such as jar_filled with bottles and bottle. These combinations are all likely from the same game which has specific event information.","fb92c2bd":"### Bar Plot\n\nSimply plot the percent of missing values for each feature, as well as the total occurrences at the top.","0b1035cf":"## Events Data Exploration\n","01810f31":"### Dendrogram\nThe dendrogram reveals deeper trends than the pairwise ones shown in the heatmap by applying clustering by their nullity correlation.\n\nThe closer to 0 that variables are linked, the more closely they predict each other's nullity. For example, event_count and event_code are linked at 0 as they exactly match in terms of nullity. This contrasts game_time which is less correlated due to the missing values seen earlier.","2f28c562":"## Data Augmentation\nConvert the events data to a dataframe after parsing the json.","80ebeaaa":"### Matrix Plot\nThis plot shows a quick view of the data sparsity.

For example, bunched together we see jar and jar_filled; cloud, cloud_size and water_level; rocket, height and launched.","5c36150b":"## Conclusion\nWe've seen there are a lot of different fields in the events data and that the majority are mostly null. We've also seen the relationship between various fields which comes mostly from their co-occurrence in games.\n\nSome interesting next steps would be trying to combine these fields into some smaller number that could provide good features for our machine learning.","cf700143":"# Events Data Missing Values Analysis\n\nIn this analysis, we will explore the data in the events_data field, particularly looking at which values are defined and which are missing.\n\nWe'll be using the awesome missingno library, so if you haven't used before, feel free to check it out (afterwards): https:\/\/github.com\/ResidentMario\/missingno.\n\nIn most cases we will show only the top 50 columns by amount of non-null entries as we have limited space and many, many features.","da23e94c":"## Read Data\n\nRead in all the data and process to get some convenient lists.\n\nFunctions taken from [this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/braquino\/890-features).","a1192639":"OK, so these are all for event_code 2000. This is the event that corresponds to the start of the game, so it makes sense that game_time is undefined!\n\nRound and coordinates are also pretty big, and these likely correspond to specific games.\n\nThe next group description, media_type, identifier and duration all seem to appear together. We'll see this better with our upcoming plots.\n\nOverall we see that the vast majority of features are defined in less than 10% of the events. It would be great if we could condense these features down in some way that provides more meaning than simply the event code.","a7dfd62e":"The two biggest would be event_count and event_code which is defined for every event. Following that we have game_time for most events, weird that it's undefined for some, what are they?"}}
