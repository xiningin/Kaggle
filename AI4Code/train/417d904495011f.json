Most of the programmers who were participated in the survey were from United States, India, Germany, UK, Canada and France. The age range of the most of the programmers around the world is 25-34 years old. Lot of the programmers started coding when they were 11-17 yrs old. Most of the developers seems to be working in the field of `web and app development`. Since lot of them are in the field of web development it can be seen that the popular languages in which they are working are `JavaScript` and `HTML\/CSS`. After them we also a Python as a popular language too. Coming to databases, it was found out that `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL` are commonly used Databases by developers. Also tools like `Git` and `Docker` are popular among the developers.\nNow coming to mental health, as per the responses given by programmers it was very clear that lot of the programmers doesn't seem to be having a very good mental health conditions.
