It is therefore necessary to have such a practical system that can automatically monitor and identify the surveillance videos.\nThe development of various deep learning techniques, thanks to the availability of large data sets and computational resources, has resulted in a historic change in the community of computer vision. Various techniques have been developed to address problems such as object detection, recognition, tracking, action recognition, legend generation, etc. However, despite recent developments in deep learning, very few techniques based on deep learning have been proposed to address the problem of detecting violence from videos.","01511c61":"### Helper-function for getting video frames\nFunction used to get 20 frames from a video file and convert the frame to a suitable format for the neural net.","5202ded6":"When defining the LSTM architecture we have to take into account the dimensions of the transfer values.

Experiments in the literature suggest that the LSTM and GRU have roughly similar performance. Even simpler variants also exist and the literature suggests that they may perform even better than both LSTM and GRU, but they are not implemented in Keras which we will use in this tutorial.\n\nA recurrent neuron has an internal state that is being updated every time the unit receives a new input. This internal state serves as a kind of memory. However, it is not a traditional kind of computer memory which stores bits that are either on or off. Instead the recurrent unit stores floating-point values in its memory-state, which are read and written using matrix-operations so the operations are all differentiable. This means the memory-state can store arbitrary floating-point values (although typically limited between -1.0 and 1.0) and the network can be trained like a normal neural network using Gradient Descent.\n\n","3ea662dc":"## Load Data\n\nFirstly, we define the directory to place the video dataset","6c4b4553":"Then we are going to load 20 frames of one video, for example","fe624d10":"## Test the model","9b2f0d60":"### Split the dataset into training set and test set\nWe are going to split the dataset into training set and testing.
