This will have a moderate effect on the distribution and usually works for data with non-constant variance. However, it is considered to be weaker than logarithmic or cube root transforms.","b98f9a02":"# Logarithmic Transformation\n\n**What is Log Transformation?**\n\nLog transformation is a data transformation method in which it replaces each variable x with a log(x).When our original continuous data do not follow the bell curve, we can log transform this data to make it \u201cnormal\u201d.","5819f825":"## Method to show the graph","7fc33dc6":"# Exponential Tanformation\n\n\nAn exponential transformation provides a useful alternative to Box and Cox's, one parameter power transformation and has the advantage of allowing negative data values. it has been founs in particular that this transformation is quite effective at turning skew unimodel distribution into nearly symmetric normal like distributon.\n\n\n![222.PNG](attachment:222.PNG)","32167f1b":"# Histogram and Q-Q plot\n**What is a histogram?**\n\nA histogram is a plot that lets you discover, and show, the underlying frequency distribution (shape) of a set of continuous data. This allows the inspection of the data for its underlying distribution (e.g., normal distribution), outliers, skewness, etc.\n\n**What is Q-Q Plot?**\n\nThe Q-Q plot, or quantile-quantile, are plots of two quantiles against each other. A quantile is a fraction where certain values fall below that quantile. For example, the median is a quantile where 50% of the data fall below that point and 50% lie above it. The purpose of Q Q plots is to find out if two sets of data come from the same distribution. A 45 degree angle is plotted on the Q Q plot; if the two data sets come from a common distribution, the points will fall on that reference line.\n\n","43cfe9c3":"# Cube root transformation\n\n**What is Cube root transformation?**\n\nThe cube root transformation involves converting x to x^(1\/3).It is useful for reducing right skewness. This is a fairly strong transformation with a substantial effect on distribution shape, but is weaker than the logarithm. It can be applied to negative and zero values too. Negatively skewed data.","3cdccf9c":"# Yeo-Johnson Transformation\n\n**What is Yeo-Johnson?**\n\nThis is one of the older transformation technique which is very similar to Box-cox transformation but does not require the values to be strictly positive.\nThis transformation is also having the ability to make the distribution more symmetric.\n\n","767e8338":"# Reciprocal transformation\n\n**What is reciprocal transformation?**\n\nThe reciprocal transformation is defined as the transformation of x to 1\/x. The transformation has a dramatic effect on the shape of the distribution, reversing the order of values with the same sign. The transformation can only be used for non-zero values.","24b94d10":"# BoxCox\nAt the core of the Box Cox transformation is an exponent, lambda (\u03bb), which varies from -5 to 5. All values of \u03bb are considered, and the optimal value for your data is selected; The \u201coptimal value\u201d is the one which results in the best approximation of a normal distribution curve. The transformation of Y has the form:\n\n![boxcox-formula-1.png](attachment:boxcox-formula-1.png)"}}
