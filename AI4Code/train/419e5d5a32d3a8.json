They want use advancements in drone technologies and object recognition to automate the surveillance.\nA first step and a proof of concept is the creation of a classifier capable of identifying cacti on aerial imagery.\n\nThis kernel shows how to use the [fast.ai library](https:\/\/docs.fast.ai\/) to create a baseline model for the [Aerial Cactus Identification\n](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/aerial-cactus-identification) competition.\n\nIn this competition we're provided with a dataset that contains 17.5k of low-resolution (32px x 32px) images in the test set and 4k images in the training set.\n\nI already did the setup, evaluation and prediction, so that you can get right into the training of the CNN.\n\nTo learn more about the fast.ai library check out the [documentation](https:\/\/docs.fast.ai) and the [fast.ai course 'Practical Deep Learning for Coders'](https:\/\/course.fast.ai\/)","a299f263":"## Prediction\nLet the neural network predict.
