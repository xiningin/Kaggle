One of CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED or CONFIRMED.\n\nkoi_pdisposition: The disposition Kepler data analysis has towards this exoplanet candidate. One of FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED, and CANDIDATE.\n\nkoi_score: A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the confidence in the KOI disposition. For CANDIDATEs, a higher value indicates more confidence in its disposition, while for FALSE POSITIVEs, a higher value indicates less confidence in that disposition.\n\nkoi_fpflag_nt: A KOI whose light curve is not consistent with that of a transiting planet. This includes, but is not limited to, instrumental artifacts, non-eclipsing variable stars, and spurious (very low SNR) detections.\n\nkoi_fpflag_ss: A KOI that is observed to have a significant secondary event, transit shape, or out-of-eclipse variability, which indicates that the transit-like event is most likely caused by an eclipsing binary. However, self-luminous, hot Jupiters with a visible secondary eclipse will also have this flag set, but with a disposition of PC.\n\nkoi_fpflag_co: The source of the signal is from a nearby star, as inferred by measuring the centroid location of the image both in and out of transit, or by the strength of the transit signal in the target's outer (halo) pixels as compared to the transit signal from the pixels in the optimal (or core) aperture.\n\nkoi_srad: The photospheric radius of the star.\n\nkoi_kepmag: This is the Kepler band.\n\nkoi_period: The interval between consecutive planetary transits.","608e7a63":"# What are Exoplanets?\nExoplanets are planets beyond our solar system. These worlds come in a huge variety of sizes and orbits. Some are gigantic planets hugging close to their parent stars; others are icy, some rocky. NASA and other agencies are looking for a special kind of planet: one that's the same size as Earth, orbiting a sun-like star in the habitable zone.","d2443e56":"# Mission of Kepler Space Telescope","f84ebfdf":"![3055_Keper_EOF_By_The_Numbers_1600.jpg](attachment:3055_Keper_EOF_By_The_Numbers_1600.jpg)","2eda877e":"# Description of some of the important features in the dataset"}}
