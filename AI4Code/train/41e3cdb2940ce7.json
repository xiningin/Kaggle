If you were going to deploy this model in practice, you would make it even more accurate by using all of the data and keeping that tree size.  That is, you don't need to hold out the validation data now that you've made all your modeling decisions.","b9ebd40c":"You've tuned this model and improved your results. But we are still using Decision Tree models, which are not very sophisticated by modern machine learning standards. In the next step you will learn to use Random Forests to improve your models even more.\n\n# Keep Going\n\nYou are ready for **[Random Forests](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/random-forests).**\n","940586ca":"## Recap\nYou've built your first model, and now it's time to optimize the size of the tree to make better predictions. Run this cell to set up your coding environment where the previous step left off.","cfc4642d":"# Exercises\nYou could write the function `get_mae` yourself. For now, we'll supply it. This is the same function you read about in the previous lesson.
