Lemmatization is similar to stemming but it brings context to the words. So it links words with similar meaning to one word.\n\nText preprocessing includes both Stemming as well as Lemmatization. Many times people find these two terms confusing. Some treat these two as same. Actually, lemmatization is preferred over Stemming because lemmatization does morphological analysis of the words."}}
