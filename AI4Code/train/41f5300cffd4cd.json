Before 2018, Java is the king and until 2016 PHP is always the queen. After Python come out with his 'hello world' that was very simple. It liberate the market, Java and PHP is becoming downgrade. \n\nWithout loosing attention, we can also see that JavaScript from 2004 until 2018 is mostly stagnan in number 3-6. I believe after Angular and other framework come out, It change the market and turn PHP to be downgrade again. \n\nIn the $10^{th}$ place, we can see since 2019, TypeScript is comeout and it mostly take place from Matlab, but the competition between them is not ending yet. We can't conclude right now, but I believe TypeScript will also get the $5^{th}$ places in less than five years from now. You can display it if you wan in that time.\n\nThe conclusion is until May 2021, we got information that the most popular language is\n\n* Python\n\n* Java\n\n* JavaScript\n\nWhat we can learn from this is this\n\n> Technology is changing everytime, if they can adapt the world, they will dissapear from it ~ [@theDreamer911](https:\/\/github.com\/theDreamer911) a.k.a [@handhikayp](https:\/\/twitter.com\/handhikayp)\n\n**Thanks For Reading**\n\n*22 June 2021*\n","ae8057f3":"Right now, the index is become 'Date', because we want to know the most popular programming language, let's check the May row","ff6f18d1":"## Popular Languages (May 2021)","0c271237":"From the output above, we see that the zero index is Date, it's not a programming language, so let's turn it into index","cdcd3404":"## Visualizing the Data Into Pie Chart","d9f740da":"# Most Popular Programming Language\n\nNothing last forever in this world, programming language is just a little part of the world that affected with this\n\nIn this notebook I just want to update the code from this [link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/japandata509\/popular-programming-languages-every-month) by [Kaito](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/japandata509)\n\nHis code is build about six months ago, but the dataset had been changing.
