Australia may seem like a wildlife paradise, but looks can be deceiving.\n \n* KOALA HOSPI\u271aAL presents the poignant and surprising life of koalas.\n\n* For almost 40 years, the Koala Hospital and its community of volunteers have been caring for sick and injured wild koalas, giving them a second chance at life.\n\nIt's hard to know exactly how many koalas there are in the wild, but the Australian Koala Foundation who track the population, estimate the number could have fallen to as low as around 40,000 koalas. Alarmed by the drastic decline, an army of protesters fight back on the koalas behalf, taking over the city with political confrontations and a display of koalas in coffins - real life victims of dogs, cars and deadly logging machines, that remove the koalas home and kill them in the process.\n\nA safe life in the bush is the ultimate goal for the hospital's many hundreds of patients, and to increase our understanding of koalas in the wild, we explore this unknown and fascinating world. Traveling across the koalas home range of eastern Australia, we meet scientists who reveal the remarkable natural history of this curious marsupial, the only one of its kind. The koalas life is not what you'd expect.\n\nSusan Kelly\nDirector\nE: director@globalbriefing.info\nCopyright Global Briefing 2011\n","2dd50abd":"Next 3 Codes from Andre Sionek @andresionek","3eb05df3":"<iframe width=\"951\" height=\"535\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nOo3cAz7w8Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","a05528b8":"The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which comprise the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60\u201385 cm (24\u201333 in) and weighs 4\u201315 kg (9\u201333 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Koala"}}
