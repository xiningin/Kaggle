An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BC, which was succeeded in the third century AD by the Sasanian Empire, a major world power for the next four centuries.[17][18] Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century AD, which led to the Islamization of Iran\"\nsentence = Sentence(txt)\nsentence","69d2de0c":"tagger = SequenceTagger.load('ner')\n","45fee600":"tagger.predict(sentence)","c86db99c":"print(sentence)","978891dd":"for entity in sentence.get_spans('ner'):\n    print(entity)","78311e7f":"tagger = SequenceTagger.load(\"flair\/ner-english-ontonotes-large\")","1261c15a":"tagger.predict(sentence)","86ba1919":"for entity in sentence.get_spans('ner'):\n    print(entity)","2ec002cb":"![Screenshot from 2021-10-04 11-23-36.png](attachment:7720ad75-d433-4d3e-843e-081838470699.png)","3f4dadba":"# Tagging your text","94163a7a":"![Screenshot from 2021-10-04 11-24-54.png](attachment:f43b73b9-a305-48b1-80a9-ca265dedb7fe.png)"}}
