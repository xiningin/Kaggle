Given these distances, for each test example we find the k nearest examples and have them vote for the label\n\nLets begin with computing the distance matrix between all training and test examples. For example, if there are **Ntr** training examples and **Nte** test examples, this stage should result in a **Nte x Ntr** matrix where each element (i,j) is the distance between the i-th test and j-th train example.\n\n**Note: For the three distance computations that we require you to implement in this notebook, you may not use the np.linalg.norm() function that numpy provides.**\n\nFirst, open `cs231n\/classifiers\/k_nearest_neighbor.py` and implement the function `compute_distances_two_loops` that uses a (very inefficient) double loop over all pairs of (test, train) examples and computes the distance matrix one element at a time.","671a1b27":"# k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) exercise\n\n*Complete and hand in this completed worksheet (including its outputs and any supporting code outside of the worksheet) with your assignment submission.
