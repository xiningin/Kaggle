I thought this graph would show that canadian kagglers have more university degree than other countries.","7e141815":"Canada has the highest percentage of females Kagglers amongts the most popular countires on Kaggle, and the fifth best percentage of women on Kaggle for countries that have at least 100 respondents on the survey.\n\nWe saw earlier that Canada is a popular country on Kaggle, let's try to find pieces of evidence that could explain why.","4bdf0259":"I am as surprised in these graphs as I was with the precedent graph. Canadian kagglers seem to work in smallest companies than other top 9 countries of Kaggle. Also, in their company, there is not more individuals responsible for data science and the machine learning is nor more incorporated.\n\nTo conclude this notebook, I gotta say that I am surprised of the results that I got. Women are more inclined to data science in Canada and canadian kagglers have a nice pay, but they are not more educated and don't work in companies where data science is more of a priority.\n\nI am not an expert in python, so don't hesitate to point out mistakes in my code.","be79f254":"This graph shows the different salary categories of Canada, the 9 other top 10 Kaggle Countries and the other countires. For each salary category, I took the max value to show as legend. When you look at the bottom of Canada's bar, you see alot of categories with few data in it. Conversely, all categories from 60,000 to 150,000 have alot of data in it. So as far as this graph shows, data science in Canada pays pretty well compared to other countries and this could explain why there is alot of canadian kagglers.","8790d20e":"Being a canadian myself, I wanted to know what looked like the canadian Kaggle community. And yes, I am sorry. I put my country in a variable so you could just change the COUNTRY variable to another country and the code would adapt.","8d5bcecb":"We can see Canada is the tenth most important country in Kaggle, despite having only a population of 37 millions, according to Statistics Canada. According to the United States Census Bureau, americans are 327 millions, so 8.7 times more, but only 6.9 times more on Kaggle. This means every canadian is more likely to be on Kaggle than an american.\n\nGender equality is a very important topic in Canada, so let's see if the data refletcs it."}}
