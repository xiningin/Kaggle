It can use *Tensorflow* or *Theano* as backend. This tutorial series will cover Keras from beginner to intermediate level.\n\n<font color=red>IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH THE PART 1 OF THIS TUTORIAL, IT'S RECOMMENDED FOR YOU TO GO THROUGH THAT FIRST.<\/font><br>\n[LINK TO PART 1](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/akashkr\/tf-keras-tutorial-neural-network-part-1)\n\nIn this part we will cover:\n* Basics of Convolutional Neural Network\n* Image Data basic preprocessing for CNN\n* Training Convolutional Neural Network\n* Visualizing data in intermediate layers\n\n# WHAT IS CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK?\nConvolutional Neural Network comprises of Convolutional layers. A Convolutional layer is the layers that focus on neighbouring\/local properties of an image rather the complete input image.\n\n**CONVOLUTION LAYER**<br>\nA n*n 2D matrix with some predefined values is called a **kernel**. The kernel moves step by step on the entire image. Each value is multiplied with the corresponding inplace value on image and summed to get the output value. This picture will make it clearer.\n\n<img src='https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*TwMfGALfE0naUC8pLOK4Vg.jpeg' width=500>\n\nNote that the size of the input reduces after convolution layer because it can't process values at the edges. For a 3x3 kernel size convolution, a NxN image converts to N-1xN-1 size. \n\n**POOLING**<br>\nPooling layers are used to reduce the dimension of the image. There are many types of pooling layers in CNN like *Max Pooling, Average Pooling, Global Pooling* etc. The most common is Max Pooling.\n* **Max Pooling**<br>\nIn max pooling the pixel with maximum value is the output on a pool size of nxn. This image will make it more clear.\n\n<img src='https:\/\/media.geeksforgeeks.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/20190721025744\/Screenshot-2019-07-21-at-2.57.13-AM.png' width=500>\n\nYou would have seen **Dense** and **Flatten** layer in the previous part. So we will be using that here. THIS WAS AN OVERVIEW, JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME FEELING OF WHAT IS GOING INSIDE. NOW LET'S DIVE INTO THE CODE TO GET MORE INTUITIONS.","b5392eff":"# Importing libraries","49ac5ab6":"## Training\n\n```model.fit``` trains the model.\n> * **x_train**: Training data\/features\n* **y_train**: Target\n* **epochs**: Number of times the entire dataset is fed in the model\n\nWhile training you can see the loss and accuracy calculated on the training data itself. *The number of epochs are a kind of try and test metrics. It depends on a number of factors like size of data and complexity of classification, etc.* You will slowly get a feeling of how to estimate number of epochs required for a particular model and dataset.\n\n## Validation\n\nWe've verified our model's accuracy for training data which comes out to be 97% approx. This accuracy is calculated on the same data on which the model is trained. Now let's see the accuracy when our model gets new data on which it is not trained. Generally it should be slightly lower than the training accuracy.<br>\n> This is done to avoid overfitting. **Overfitting** is the case when the model gives *high accuracy on training data but low accuracy on test data*. Whenever you see a hugh difference in the Train accuracy and Validation accuracy, it is an example of overfitting. \nOverfitting can be caused due to a number of reasons and have several ways to avoid and fix. We will discuss that later in the course.<br>\n*Note that we expect the validation accuracy to be slightly lower than training accuracy but not much lower.*","21ec4d6c":"**IN THE NEXT TUTORIAL WE WILL SEE HOW TO PROCESS REAL LIFE DATASET AND SOME TECHNIQUES TO AUTO LABEL TRAIN AND VALIDATION DATA FROM FOLDER**\n\n> # PART 3 [Binary Classification](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/akashkr\/tf-keras-tutorial-binary-classification-part-3)","cc7c558c":"# Overview of Dataset\n\nThe dataset contains images, each image of 28x28px.
