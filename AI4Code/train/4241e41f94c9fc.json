","18424d82":"**Analysis**","7194b570":"**Pareto Distribution**\n\nAn obseravtional law that is used to explain distribution of social, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena, for example, distribution of wealth in a society, it states that, 80% of the wealth of a society is held by 20% of its population.\n\nInformally called the Pareto Principle(80\/20) or the Matthew principle.\n\nPareto Principle:\nRoughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.\n\nNote that this is an observational law and not a law of Nature.\n\n\n\n**FIFA Dataset**\n\nTo observe pareto distribution in FIFA Dataset, We select the Top 20% of the players using attribute \"Overall\" as a metric to asses the how good a player is, compare their wages with that of the bottom 80% of the players.\n\nExpectation:\nThat Top 20% of the equal or earn more than that of the bottom 80% of the players.\n\n\n\nWhy is it interesting:(other observations)\n\n- 20% of employees are responsible for 80% of the results\n\n- 20% of criminals commit 80% of crimes\n\n- 20% of drivers cause 80% of all traffic accidents\n\n- 20% of all factories cause 80% of pollution\n\n- 20% of a companies products represent 80% of sales\n\nWhy is it important:\n \n- Identifying the employees in different categories can be directly tied to the profitability of the company by either incentivising the top 20% of the employees so they continue to be more effective or train the 80% of the employees to be more effective.\n\n- Identifiying and catching the just 20% of criminals can result in reduction of 80% of the crimes.\n\n- Regularising the 20% of the factories which cause 80% of the population can cause massive reduce in pollution.\n\n\n\n\n","1f022085":"Updating the string values of Wage column to integers for mathematical operations","a3e2ac40":"Plotting the histogram to observe the distribution of Wage, Expect to
