Also, knowing the most ordered colours and the less ordered ones can earn money to the company by predicting how many units of each configuration should be produced. In this case, the Black dot option has been a huge success, so this model should be produced in larger quantities compared to the Walnut Finish wich, despite having good reviews, is still the least requested configuration.","72bcd443":"#### Creating a small and easy to do table to find the exact number of counts for each rating.","77f78cd0":"### Word Cloud","a8059d81":"#### Each peak on some position on the x axis corresponds to a word.
