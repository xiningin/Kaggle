The suggest that study design and dose selection for immunoglobulin products for the treatment of COVID-19 require special considerations such as viral load, antibody-virus interaction, and dosing adjustment based on the pharmacokinetics of the antibody.\n\nA higher viral load for SARS-COV-2 significantly correlated with higher mortality. In this study, viral titers from nasopharyngeal swabs of a cohort of 1145 hospitalized patients and a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test were re-evaluated using a real-time quantitative PCR.\n\nEven after adjusting for multiple co-morbidities and other factors (such as sex and age), a significant independent association was seen between viral load and mortality. In yet another study, mortality in 3014 hospitalized patients was higher for subjects with a high viral load (lower Ct value) measured at admission using a nasopharyngeal swab .\n\nRecently, 2807 patients with COVID-19 transfused with SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma exhibited a statistically significant gradient of mortality in relation to antibody levels, with those receiving units with higher antibody levels having lower 7- and 30-day mortality.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7705402\/","b5439cd1":"Here, Length must result INTEGER.","5a9b91dd":"Study design and dose selection for antiviral antibody products require special consideration of viral load, antibody\u2013virus interaction, and PK of the antibody.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Relationship between antibody dose, Pharmacokinetic Monitoring and Viral load<\/font>\n\nPreclinical studies can help determine the first-in-human dose regimen based on the relationship between antibody dose and viral load. Timing of antibody administration is critical, in that the antibody is more likely to be effective given early in the course of the disease when the viral load is relatively low. \n\nThe initial dose regimen for an antibody product should be sufficiently high to compensate for the rapid clearance as a result of a high viral load. Later, as the rate of drug clearance is decreased because of elimination of the virus, the dose can be lowered. Dose adjustment based on pharmacokinetic monitoring is critical to achieve an optimal treatment effect.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7705402\/","fa3f0c4e":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Suggestions on Dosing Strategy for COVID-19<\/font>\n\n\nSARS-COV-2 has been found in the nasopharynx, lungs, and stools. The total body viral load is not known but is probably high in hospitalized patients with moderate and severe infections.\n\nPre- and post-exposure therapy in mild cases may be amenable to single doses of polyclonal antibody or mAb administration in individuals at high risk because of age, underlying diseases, or first responders.\n\nHowever, moderate or severe cases with high viral loads may require a different dosing strategy.\n\nDosing with high-titer polyclonal antibodies or mAbs should be monitored by sampling serum levels in the first few days to see if antibodies are present or being cleared rapidly.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">High virus load requires repeated doses.<\/font>\n\nRapid clearance will indicate that the virus load is high and that repeated doses are needed. This should be continued until antibody levels plateau, signaling that the virus is under control and that the frequency of dosing can be reduced. \n\nThus, even in the absence of accurate viral load levels, it may be possible to adjust antibody doses based on rates of antibody clearance, as the latter likely correlates with viral load. This is only feasible in patients with relatively early disease before they develop endogenous antibody responses.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7705402\/","9c83dc49":"![](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7728433\/bin\/fx1_lrg.jpg)https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7728433\/","ae23b2b0":"The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the sewage or wastewater samples.

The evidence of shedding of live virus in stool is weak, and for which purpose more studies are suggested, however municipal wastewater from the affected communities may contain the virus. \n\nIn wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 50% samples (6\/12) from influent untreated wastewaters in the world's worst-affected country, Italy.
