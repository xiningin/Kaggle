Although the electoral college (state by state results) is most important in American elections, there are still less paths to win the presidency the less support a candidate acquires nationally.\n* In every battleground state we looked at, with the exception of Florida, Trump was underestimated in average polling by 4.5-6%, beyond margin of error for the average poll.  There is incredibly small probability that this occurred by chance, so this most likely means that these polls failed to be truly random or they did not take into account some outside factor such as voter enthusiasm.  However, the polls of likely voters barely deviated from the average of all polls.  Either the polling of \"likely voters\" is not at all accurate itself, or voter enthusiasm was not a huge factor.\n* In every populated state we looked, Trump was overestimated in the average of all polls, though this carried little effect in the electoral college process as these states voted the same direction anyway.  As New York, California, and Illinois are solid blue states, a simple explanation could be that Trump voters didn't see their ballot as worthwhile in these regions.  However, Texas, a consistent red state, is a different story.  Either Trump voters were complacent in Texas, or there was strong turnout for Clinton.\n* In Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, the average of all polls did better than the polls that have been historically reliable.  In Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, three bordering northern states, the historically reliable polls were more accurate.  We should keep this in mind when analyzing 2020 polls.\n* In the final polling days leading up to the election, Clinton had negative momemtum nationally and in most states.  Keep in mind there were an additional few days between the end of the final polling period and voting day, so this negative momentum likely continued which caused polls to underestimate Trump's chances.\n\n* The Times-Picayune\/Lucid, ABC News\/Washington Post, and YouGov predicted the national popular vote most accurately.\n* Google Consumer Surveys and SurveyMonkey were most consistently accurate in the battleground states.\n* SurveyMonkey was a very accurate pollster in Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin\n* Google Consumer Surveys was a very strong pollster in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Minnesota\n\n* Nationally, the number of polls a pollster released the final two weeks before the election predicted the final accuracy incredibly well.

","cf2ed5d7":"Clinton did manage to win Minnesota, but by much closer margins than expected.  Again, the historically reliable polls did better here and there was negative momentum for Clinton across the board.","21d0ad77":"In the spirit of the election season, I will be analyzing US presidential election polling data from 2016 and 2020.  I will be answering many questions, including who might win in 2020.  \n\nThis notebook will be updated until the conclusion of the 2020 election.","baca153a":"### Illinois","16c2c958":"Trump's chances in Pennsylvania were underestimated by huge margins, especially by historically reliable polls, despite Clinton having mostly positive momentum towards the end.","4b37ff7a":"## What Happened in 2016? (The Best Pollsters)","fd9d20b8":"Finally, let's take a look at the results of the 2016 election.  We will get the percentage of Trump and Clinton voters for each state (not including third-party candidates), as well as manually add a row displaying the national results.","f8712bc0":"### Ohio","84a9bce9":"Now, we have 2020 polling data in the exact same format as our 2016 polling data.","04f44012":"#### Trump vs. Sanders","d1c128d8":"### Nationally","28e36bc7":"Another state where every pollster underestimated Trump's chances, though SurveyMonkey was very close.\n\nThere existed a moderate correlation between number of polls released the final two weeks before the election and inaccuracy (r = -0.42).  The probability that this occurred by chance is 34.5%.","78d16a10":"#### Trump vs. Warren","7d3651d4":"Now, which individual pollsters did the best job calling the election nationally and in each battleground state the two weeks leading up to the election? Furthermore, did pollsters who released more polls predict the national and battleground states more accurately?","53f5f667":"# General Election Poll Analysis","bb968ae2":"### Minnesota","a01960a5":"### Texas","2a1ef4c4":"We will have to clean this data by spreading the candidates into their own separate columns, and will also remove irrelevant candidates.  First, it will be necessary to separate different individual matchups involving Trump into different data tables.","d30665ae":"### New York","f0ba681a":"Since the national polls estimated the results of the popular vote perfectly, yet polls underestimated Trump's chances in battleground states, there must have been some states which overestimated Trump's chances.  Note that these states don't play a huge factor in the election because they always decisively vote in a certain direction, so **we have a smaller sample size of polls**.  Let's take a look at the polls of the most populated states in the country.","2bc7c082":"Trump was overestimated across the board in New York polls.","3ff0bf94":"Another good prediction by Google Consumer Surveys.\n\nThere existed a small positive correlation between number of polls released the final two weeks before the election and inaccuracy (r = 0.29).  The probability that this occurred by chance is 63.6%.","07a44afd":"Of course, the US presidential election is decided by the electoral college, not the national popular vote, so it would be helpful to look at battleground states (states that may go either way and decide the election) and other states where Trump performed better than expected.","ab386d6e":"The polling averages only barely underestimated Trump's chances in Florida, with historically reliable polls being least accurate by a slight margin and polls of likely voters being the most accurate.  Only the historically reliable polls had Clinton winning Florida, though we can see her numbers went down quickly in those polls right before the election.","fd343474":"### Pennsylvania","72d03aa3":"### 2016 Election Results"}}
