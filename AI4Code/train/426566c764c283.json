Since I'm going to use this agent as a basis for other agents it has the additional ability that it will always move to an adjacent square with more halite.  This agent:\n* almost always survives until the end of the game\n* if it survives it scores 5000 (beating yard_only_agent)\n* it collects halite (but it doesn't do anything with it!)","f58b7834":"Before we get to the part about building agents, we'll need some way to tell the score after the game is over.  I'm not going to calculate how to break ties, I'll just print the score at the end of the game.","a65465f5":"#### always_one_agent\n\nThis agent builds a shipyard on it's first turn and then always builds one ship if there isn't one.  This agent:\n* almost always scores 2500\n* isn't that good, because the ship it builds acts like runaway_agent (which doesn't know how to deposit halite!)","bc8731ef":"This agent easily beats my bad agents on almost all maps.  Against an agent that is smart about collecting and depositing halite in the shipyards this agent wouldn't fare nearly as well.","8649a23b":"#### run_yard_one_agent\n\nThis agent controls one ship that wanders the board until it has collected enough cargo to CONVERT.  When a shipyard is created it builds a new ship that does the same thing.  This agent:\n* builds multiple shipyards (but only 1 ship at time!)\n* scores incredibly well against bad opponents\n* against even half-way decent opponents would not do nearly as well","215fdce9":"### yard_only_agent\nOk, simplest one first.  It will create a shipyard on the first turn and then...nothing.  This may sound useless, but consider that this agent:\n* always survives until the end of the game\n* always scores 3000 points\n* consistently beats the builtin \"random\" agent","df50e1f8":"#### take_invalid_action_agent\n\nI built this agent to convince myself that I understood what happened when you took an invalid action.  What happens when you take an invalid action is that your player is disqualified and you get no more moves for the remainder of the game.","2c57df21":"This is my collection of simple bad agents for Halite.\n\nThese are all very simple agents that control at most one ship.  I'm certain they won't win anything.  Building them helped me think about how the game works.  The agents are:\n\n**yard_only_agent** - builds a shipyard and then does nothing else\n\n**runaway_agent** - runs away from other ships\n\n**run_yard_agent** - runs away from others until it has enough cargo to build a shipyard\n\n**always_one_agent** - builds a shipyard on the first turn then builds a ship if one doesn't exist\n\n**run_yard_one_agent** - combination of run_yard and always building a replacement ship\n\n**take_invalid_action_agent** - confirms that your game ends after taking an invalid action\n","cc8980ec":"#### Additional Improvements\n\nThere are, of course, some incredibly obvious improvements that could be made.  For instance:\n* tell the ships how and when to return to the shipyard to deposit cargo\n* tell the ships how to go directly to big halite squares instead of wandering around until they are adjacent to them\n* coordinate among friendly ships so that the ships aren't always running away from one another\n* stop building shipyards next to one another\n\nBut these sound useful enough to move these agents out of the \"bad agents\" category so I'll stop this notebook now.\n","68a25f1b":"#### Improvements\n\nLet's attempt to put some of these ideas together into a reasonable agent.  Here are the rules for the new agent:\n\nShipyards:\n* spawn new ships until we have at least half as many ships as the biggest opponent\n\nShips:\n* wait to unload cargo if at a friendly shipyard\n* wait until the current square is empty if we have cargo and there is no danger \n* build a shipyard if we have no shipyards and some cargo\n* build a shipyard if we have enough cargo to convert and spawn\n* build a shipyard if we have enough cargo and it is the last move\n* move to an adjacent space with better halite and no danger\n","01215959":"#### run_yard_agent\n\nThis agent has a single ship that wanders the board like runaway_agent until it has collected enough halite to CONVERT.  This agent:\n* always (assuming survival) scores more than runaway_agent because you are credited with any excess halite when you CONVERT\n"}}
