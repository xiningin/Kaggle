The answer is **No**, because we can't determine which all instances will the classifier will use to train itself. As the training and testing data changes, the accuracy will also change. It may increase or decrease. This is known as **model variance**.\n\nTo overcome this and get a generalized model,we use **Cross Validation**.\n\n\n# Cross Validation\n\nMany a times, the data is imbalanced, i.e there may be a high number of class1 instances but less number of other class instances. Thus we should train and test our algorithm on each and every instance of the dataset. Then we can take an average of all the noted accuracies over the dataset. \n\n1)The K-Fold Cross Validation works by first dividing the dataset into k-subsets.\n\n2)Let's say we divide the dataset into (k=5) parts. We reserve 1 part for testing and train the algorithm over the 4 parts.\n\n3)We continue the process by changing the testing part in each iteration and training the algorithm over the other parts. The accuracies and errors are then averaged to get a average accuracy of the algorithm.\n\nThis is called K-Fold Cross Validation.\n\n4)An algorithm may underfit over a dataset for some training data and sometimes also overfit the data for other training set.

Before understanding the plot, let us see what exactly correlation is.\n\n**POSITIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to increase in feature B, then they are positively correlated**. A value **1 means perfect positive correlation**.\n\n**NEGATIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated**. A value **-1 means perfect negative correlation**.\n\nNow lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as **MultiColinearity** as both of them contains almost the same information.\n\nSo do you think we should use both of them as **one of them is redundant**. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n\nNow from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated.

The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 (ship's time)[a] on Sunday, 14 April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (ship's time; 05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, which made it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.\n\nTitanic received six warnings of sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic had been designed to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore, with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge for many of the passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.\n\nAs a result, when Titanic sank, over a thousand passengers and crew were still on board. Almost all those who jumped or fell into the water either drowned or died within minutes due to the effects of cold shock and incapacitation. RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene about an hour and a half after the sinking and rescued the last of the survivors by 09:15 on 15 April, some nine and a half hours after the collision. The disaster shocked the world and caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of the three passenger classes during the evacuation. Subsequent inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today.","89efa9ff":"Now the above correlation plot, we can see some positively related features.
