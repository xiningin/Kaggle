Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000\/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.\n\nJust like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called \u2018sum assured\u2019) to the customer.\n\n## Business Goal\nBuilding a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.\n\nNow, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.","363dd94a":"People that had their vehicle damaged previously are much more interested in a vehicle insurance.  \n\n### Annual Premium","70220433":"There is 812 people with no driving license, even when they could be interested we could think to get them off of the data, considering that we shouldnt ensure people without driving license.","28828e48":"Gender Distribution is almost equal, a bit higher for male, as it is also the probability to get an interested response.   \nThe interested response represents a values close to 14% for male and to 10% for female.","2b9a1e61":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","e8917448":"## Final Test Data Submission","1979624f":"### AUC of Random forest classifier","1d634e13":"### Vehicle Damaged","7aa41f59":"We have a really high variability in the premium price, we should recheck it, maybe comparing with another data base the kind of cars vehicle that is insured. \n\n### Vintage distribution"}}
