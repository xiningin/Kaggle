Linear Regression \nLinear Regression is one of the simplest statistical models we have. It tries to find the relationship between dependent variable (y) and feature space $X = \\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \\dots , x_{n}\\}$ assuming there are $n$ independent variables. Linear Regression tries to predict the value of $y$, given $X$, where $y$ is a continuous value and $x_{i}$ can have continuous or discrete values both. \n\nThe relationship which is given linear regression looks like this.\n\n$y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2} + \\dots + \\beta_{n}x_{n}$ , where $\\beta_{i}$  are the coefficients or parameters associated with each feature, $\\beta_{0}$ is the bias term so that our model is not forced to go through the center. \n\nLinear regression is a linear model because the relationship is given with linear combination of parameters and features. \n\nThere are many flavours or extensions of linear regression which can be used in different scenarios. In fact, linear regression is just a special case of **Generalized Linear Models (GRMs)** where the assumption is that the dependent variable follows normal distribution.","259dbbb5":"### 1.2.1. Ridge Regression - L2 Regularization\nRidge Regression is also known as ridge regularization which is a penalization technique. It penalizes the SSE with a term $\\lambda * |{\\beta_{1}}|^2$, where lambda is called regularization strength. Regularization actually helps a model to **not** overfit the data. It introduces a bias in our model which helps to reduce generalization error.\n\nNow, our optimization problem becomes like this:\n\n$Find \\quad \\min Q(\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}),\\quad for \\ Q(\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i} - \\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1}x_{i})^2 + \\lambda*|{\\beta_{1}}|^2$\n\nRidge penalizes more for higher values of $\\beta_{1}$. Also, $\\lambda$ is positive value. Higehr is the value of $\\lambda$, higher is the penalization.\n\nRidge regression is also called L2 regularization beacuse it is squared L2 norm of coefficients.","a44f1d5b":"Above last cell is just a food for your thought.
