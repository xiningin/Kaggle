Now the grid search technique will construct many versions of X with all the possible combinations of hyperparameter (a1, a2 and a3) values that you defined in the first place. This range of hyperparameter values is referred to as the grid. \n\nSuppose, you defined the grid as:\na1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5]\na2 = [10,20,30,40,5,60]\na3 = [105,105,110,115,120,125]\n\nNote that, the array of values of that you are defining for the hyperparameters has to be legitimate in a sense that you cannot supply Floating type values to the array if the hyperparameter only takes Integer values.\n\nNow, grid search will begin its process of constructing several versions of X with the grid that you just defined.\n\nIt will start with the combination of [0,10,105], and it will end with [5,60,125].
