NO2 forms when fossil fuels such as coal, oil, gas or diesel are burned at high temperatures. NO2 and other nitrogen oxides in the outdoor air contribute to particle pollution and to the chemical reactions that make ozone. It is one of six widespread air pollutants that have national air quality standards to limit them in the outdoor air. NO2 can also form indoors when fossil fuels like wood or natural gas are burned.\n\n**How it Affects Human Health?**\nNitrogen dioxide causes a range of harmful effects on the lungs, including:\n\nIncreased inflammation of the airways;\nWorsened cough and wheezing;\nReduced lung function;\nIncreased asthma attacks; and\nGreater likelihood of emergency department and hospital admissions.\n\n**Top Contributors**\n* Cars, trucks, and buses are the largest sources of emissions, followed by power plants, diesel-powered heavy construction equipment and other movable engines, and industrial boilers.

Particulate matter is the sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in air many of which are hazardous. This complex mixture includes both organic and inorganic particles, such as dust, pollen, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. These particles vary greatly in size, composition, and origin. It consists of microscopically small solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in the air. The smaller the particles, the deeper they can penetrate into the respiratory system and the more hazardous they are to breathe. Particulate matter is primarily a problem in the wintertime in the Bay Area, when seasonal wood-burning makes a substantial contribution.","52880d04":"## 1. Sulphur Dioxide(So2)- \n\nSulfur dioxide is a gas. It is invisible and has a nasty, sharp smell. It reacts easily with other substances to form harmful compounds, such as sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid and sulfate particles.\n\nAbout 99% of the sulfur dioxide in air comes from human sources. The main source of sulfur dioxide in the air is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur. Some mineral ores also contain sulfur, and sulfur dioxide is released when they are processed. In addition, industrial activities that burn fossil fuels containing sulfur can be important sources of sulfur dioxide.\n\nSulfur dioxide is also present in motor vehicle emissions, as the result of fuel combustion.\n\n**How it Affects Human Health?**\nSulfur dioxide affects human health when it is breathed in. It irritates the nose, throat, and airways to cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or a tight feeling around the chest. The effects of sulfur dioxide are felt very quickly and most people would feel the worst symptoms in 10 or 15 minutes after breathing it in.\n\nThose most at risk of developing problems if they are exposed to sulfur dioxide are people with asthma or similar conditions\n\n**Top Contributors**\n* Thermal and Coal Plants\n* Factories\n* Vehicles\n","92230d22":"# Objective : Identify the trends, causes and the demographic insights of the pollution levels across the states of India","a41281d6":"**Take Away**\n\nWest Bengal emission over the years has always been higher than Uttarakhand.
