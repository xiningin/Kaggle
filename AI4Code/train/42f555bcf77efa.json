(Remember, each turn at the slot machine costs $1.)\n\nSo, if he has $10, he can definitely play 10 spins (because he'll have enough money to pay for the 10th spin even if he never wins). But he could only play an 11th spin if his total winnings from the first 10 was enough to pay for the 11th spin. How likely is that?\n\nYou will estimate the probability with the Monte Carlo method. That is, you will simulate the scenario many times, and return the proportion of simulations where he ran out of money before a desired number of spins. \n\nComplete the function below to estimate the probability that he can complete a given number of spins of the machine before running out of money.","938976ce":"## 3.\n\nComplete the body of the function below according to its docstring","e15db678":"Welcome to the exercises for day 5 (these accompany the day 5 tutorial notebook on [loops](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/colinmorris\/learn-python-challenge-day-5))\n\nAs always, run the setup code below before working on the questions (and if you leave this notebook and come back later, remember to run the setup code again).","02a713a8":"Try to identify the bug and fix it in the cell below:","0cb59303":"## 4. <span title=\"A bit spicy\" style=\"color: darkgreen \">\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f<\/span>\n\nNext to the Blackjack table, the Python Challenge Casino has a slot machine. You can get a result from the slot machine by calling `play_slot_machine()`. The number it returns is your winnings in dollars. Usually it returns 0.

Don't worry, we'll send you the bill later.\n\nOn average, how much money can you expect to gain (or lose) every time you play the machine?  The casino keeps it a secret, but you can estimate the average value of each pull using a technique called the **Monte Carlo method**. To estimate the average outcome, we simulate the scenario many times, and return the average result.\n\nComplete the following function to calculate the average value per play of the slot machine.","b445e5f7":"# Exercises"}}
