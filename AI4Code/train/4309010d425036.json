It helps to find the best model that represents our data and how well the chosen model will work in the future. Evaluating model performance with the data used for training is not acceptable in data science because it can easily generate overoptimistic and overfitted models. There are two methods of evaluating models in data science, Hold-Out and Cross-Validation. To avoid overfitting, both methods use a test set (not seen by the model) to evaluate model performance. In this method, the mostly large dataset is randomly divided to three subsets:\nTraining set is a subset of the dataset used to build predictive models. Validation set is a subset of the dataset used to assess the performance of model built in the training phase. It provides a test platform for fine tuning model's parameters and selecting the best-performing model. Not all modeling algorithms need a validation set. Test set or unseen examples is a subset of the dataset to assess the likely future performance of a model. If a model fit to the training set much better than it fits the test set, overfitting is probably the cause.","33537a1c":"To compare the shape of different testing and training sets, use the following piece of code:","aad240d2":"#  Residuals\nIn statistics and optimization, errors and residuals are two closely related and easily confused measures of the deviation of an observed value of an element of a statistical sample from its \"theoretical value\". The error (or disturbance) of an observed value is the deviation of the observed value from the (unobservable) true value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean), and the residual of an observed value is the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean). The distinction is most important in regression analysis, where the concepts are sometimes called the regression errors and regression residuals and where they lead to the concept of studentized residuals.\n\nWhat is a Residual in Regression?\nWhen you perform simple linear regression (or any other type of regression analysis), you get a line of best fit. The data points usually don\u2019t fall exactly on this regression equation line; they are scattered around. A residual is the vertical distance between a data point and the regression line. Each data point has one residual. They are:\n\nPositive if they are above the regression line,\nNegative if they are below the regression line,\nZero if the regression line actually passes through the poin\nAs residuals are the difference between any data point and the regression line, they are sometimes called \u201cerrors.\u201d Error in this context doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s something wrong with the analysis; it just means that there is some unexplained difference. In other words, the residual is the error that isn\u2019t explained by the regression line.\n\nThe residual(e) can also be expressed with an equation. The e is the difference between the predicted value (y\u0302) and the observed value. The scatter plot is a set of data points that are observed, while the regression line is the prediction.","53ceda35":"# LinearRegression","511e880e":"# LinearRegression\nIn statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables).
