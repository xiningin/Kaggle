about the customer's location to identify keys\n  insights and impact on the campaign's success rate.\n\n- Products such as meat and wines are doing well in maximizing sales. Hence, the CEO should pay significant attention to reviewing these customers' profiles to retain these customers and increase the sales of the other products simultaneously.\n\n- As 'high' and 'very high' income customers made more than 60% of their purchases via 'in-store and 'company website.' Besides, the low & medium-income customers rank high in the number of purchases made with discounts. And new customer profile has a high score on campaign 3.
