There are states always red or always blue since the 1976 election. However, the period of 1980 to 1992, we can see most states in America turned to the warm-tone. It was the recognition of the Republican credentials, under the leading of Ronal Reagan and Reagan Revolution.\n\nThe next 2 elections which brought the presidency to Bill Clinton, the popularity between 2 parties were quite competitive, which represents by the neutral colour tones.\n\nGetting closer to the present, American politic opinions getting more divided. Many states get heavy red, many others get heavy blue, while some stay \"swing\", which are: Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Georgia, Florida and Arizona. That's why they call these are 'battleground' for presidential campaigns because, with only one more popular votes, a candidate can get all college votes.","3d48c086":"1. Methodology\n\nThe presidential election in the US is popularly known about the competitive of 2 candidates. However, the fact is, there are more than 2 candidates in this final round. They come from smaller parties than the famous Republican and Democratic parties. To make the analysis more concentrate, I will only focus on these 2 parties which get the most support from American voters. Republic and Democrat. The race to the white house is not only about getting more public interest than the challenger but also reach the threshold of 270 Electrol college votes. Each state has a fixed number of college votes, and in all states but Maine and Nebraska, if a candidate wins popular, he gets all the electoral college. In this analysis, I will not dig into the details of election policies change over the years, but focus on popular votes and assume electoral votes by:\n\nMaine and Nebraska: Candidates share the college votes by their popular vote rates, round the number to an integer. (In real life, using the 'congressional district method', these states allocate two electoral votes to the state popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each Congressional district (2 in Maine, 3 in Nebraska). Maine enacted this rule in advance of the 1972 presidential election, while Nebraska enacted it starting with the 1992 election.\n'Winner takes it all' for all other states.\nThe result of electoral college votes sightly differ from the official results. However, it does not change the outcome to make the elected-president.\n\nThe data for the election this year is incompleted, some states are still carry on counting ballots, so this result is NOT the official outcome. (However, we have already known who won!)","4211a0d4":"\nThe voter turnout rate in America has fluctuated over time but in general, it has been increasing. It's heavily relied on the voting policies change in America. The fact is, the voting right has reached closer to each of every group of society.\n\nDoes the voter turn-out rate have a strong correlation to economy recession? This question perhaps needs a much deeper analysis to answer. Nonetheless, this chart does show some relation between the increasing number of people who vote and the economic situation, especially from 1990.","f4612e4e":"**US Presidental Elections Analysis**\n\nAs in the heat of the US election, I make this this project to crush data of the president elections in the US, to draw some insights of the US top politic over presidental elctions over the past 4 decades.

Democrat Clinton replaced Republican Bush after the 1990 recession. The initial issue Obama had to face is the economic recovery from the great recession since 2007, in the late period of Bush. And this year, Democrat got back the White House from Trump during the century global health pandemic with the deepest deep of the GDP growth.\n\nIn conclusion, because there are only two big parties which can able to govern the country, American has not always voted to choose the president but the party. And more importantly, they vote to decide whether to continue the direction of the current ruling party or to change.","4962aa91":"To the national-scale, after the presidency of (father) Bush, it seems to be more challenging for any Republican candidate to get more popular votes. Significantly, in 2000, Bush (son) won the White House without winning the public. He was behind Gore Al ONLY 46 thousands votes. History repeated in the 2016 election with 8 times larger margin, Trump won the presidency with almost 3 million votes behind Clinton.\n\nClearly, getting more public votes is not the key to the White House."}}
