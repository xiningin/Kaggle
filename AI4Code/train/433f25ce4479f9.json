The first two blocks follow the same structure:\n1. Apply a Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel size and valid padding, then another Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel but with same padding to keep the same dimensions\n2. Apply a BatchNormalization layer to avoid layers being too depended from one another and allowing each activation to have 0 mean\n3. A RELU activation and a MaxPooling2D layer with 2x2 kernel size and stride=2\n4. An element-wise Dropout layer applied to MaxPooling2D keeping 80% of the activation units\n\nThe final 2 layers consists of a Fully Connected Layer that uses a Softmax activation for classification.","945b94f7":"# What is 784?\n\nEach image is 28 pixels wide and 28 pixles long..... 28x28=","a2ea09fb":"### Data Conversion\nWe have a validation set of 20%","df7c57f2":"# Read Directories & Folders","e559e390":"### Model Compilation\n\nHere we will use an Adam optimizer with a Cross entropy loss function.","a3a301b8":"Download the predictions from folder \"output\" \n\nrefresh  if not visible\n\nSUBMIT the predictions here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/digit-recognizer","fce015a9":"# Get train and test data","cfd4642b":"### Graphing Accuracy\n\nLet us check how our model went by graphing accuracy with validation accuracy, and our training loss with validation loss.","3b36de71":"As you can see 20 epochs should have been fine.
