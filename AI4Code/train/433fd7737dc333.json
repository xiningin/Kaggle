It is nice to have an overview of the API if you do things localy first.\nLet us import the module and initialize the environment:","d47e27db":"The `iter_test` is an iterator, i.e. a generator, so in order to have a single value we use the `next` statement:","006c3c98":"If you run more than once in a single session the API returns:\n```\nYou must call `predict()` successfully before you can continue with `iter_test()`\n```\nThe conclusion is that if we want to progress with reading the test values the full cycle must be performed. The yield of the test generator returns a tuple.
