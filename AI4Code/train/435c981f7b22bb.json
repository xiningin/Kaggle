I present to you this notebook consisting of an exhaustive method of different Hypothesis Testing Methods.\n\n**Now what is Hypothesis Testing?**\nThe main purpose of statistics is to test a hypothesis. Hypothesis as defined is a statement or a proposed supposition based on the basis of limited evidence we have it with us.\nFor Example: It's going to rain tomorrow. This is a hypothesis based on the climate we have been seeing at a particular place. It's not necessary for the Hypothesis to be true, but we will talk about such conditions after sometime.\n\n**What is the role of Hypothesis Testing in Data Science?**\nBased in the population or the data at hand, a Hypothesis Test tends to evaluate two statements about a population. The statemenst among themselves are mutually exclusive. The test concludes which statement tends to reflect the tendency of the given population. This a hypothesis test helps us determine the statistical significance of a finding. Now having established the groundwork , let's move forward and define those two statements.\n\n***Null Hypothesis (H0)***\n1. A statement about a population parameter. Example: The temperature of the city at 10AM will be 30 degree celcius.\n2. We test the likelihood of this statement being true in order to decide whether to accept of reject our alternative hypothesis.\n3. These can include \u2265, \u2264,= sign.\n***Alternative Hypothesis (H1)***\n1. A statement that directly conctradicts the null hypothesis. Example: The temperature of the city at 10AM won't be 30 degree celcius.\n2. We determine whether or not to accept or reject this statement based on the likelihood of the null hypothesis being true.\n3. These include opposite sign to null hypothesis.\n\n***The five main steps in executing a statistical hypothesis are :***\n\n1. Set up a null and alternative hypothesis\n2. Choose a significance level \u03b1 (or use the one assigned)\n3. Determine the critical test statistic value or p-value (Find the rejection region for the null hypothesis)\n4. Calculate the value of the test statistic\n5. Compare the test statistic value to the critical test statistic value to reject the null hypothesis or not\n\n***Let's define Significance level (\u03b1)***\n\n1. The significance level is the probability of rejecting the **NULL HYPOTHESIS WHEN IT IS TRUE**. \n2. For example, a significance level of 0.05 indicates a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference.\n\n***Let's talk about P-Value***\n1. A p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance.\n2. The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference.\n\nAlso when it comes to hypothesis testing there tends to be a confusion matrix that will help you visualize what sort of error we might face when forming a hypothesis and testing it.\n\n![](https:\/\/community.alteryx.com\/t5\/image\/serverpage\/image-id\/63786i04AB6B2DF57DD37B\/image-size\/large?v=v2&px=999)\n\nThe above is a very famous and a simple visualisation to help you clear the different types of error in hypothesis testing.\n\nNow this might help you get started so let's dive into some code and visualisation."}}
