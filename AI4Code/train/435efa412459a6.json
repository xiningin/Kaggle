Let's see how much we can gain of the baseline model.","e3647ac4":"The value 1, i.e. \"having ST-T wave abnormality\" has the highest high-risk cases, where there is hypertropy of right ventricle. Surprisngly, the left ventricular hypertrophy case(value 3) has lower high risk patients than even normal resting ecg case.","539c8338":"The chest pain type are as follows:\n    -Value 1: typical angina\n    -Value 2: atypical angina\n    -Value 3: non-anginal pain\n    -Value 4: asymptomatic\n \nTypical angina is the chest pain which has characteristics of heart attack. In the current case, we see that surprisingly, the high risk cases of heart-attack. It suggests that this angina, although showing symptoms warned patients of implending fatality which could have led to medical help or\/and change in lifestyle.\nThe most dangerous ones is the atypical angina, which did not have all the characteristics of heart-attack. So, they might not have been taken so seriously or as warning of increasing risk of heart-attack. \nThe non-anginal pain is which is not related to heart, but could be due to something else. It is interesting that it has almost 80% prevelence of risky cases.","364bc4f9":"## Age","413869e2":"We will use autmoviml package for automatic generation of features, and selection of the best features.","362a391c":"Less than 20% of the total cases have high fasting blood sugar. However, the distribution of high and low risk is almost same for both high and low fbs groups.","93d15ca1":"There are no missing values.","91d4454e":"For this feature too, most cases have value of either 1 or 2. Value 2 has the highest prevelence of high-risk cases.","2ea1f656":"The code '0' has hardly any cases attached to it. Code 2 has highest number of cases, and it has highrest prevelence of high risk patients too.","b3360b69":"## exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)","ebd2e9c2":"The group where the angina was induced during exercise exertion had has lower prevelence of high-risk cases, as angina could have been contributed due to exercise or the angina might have given warning about the condition of heart, leading to taking of proper measures."}}
