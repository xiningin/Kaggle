Adding to that \n   the age is also not providing any good insight since both level patients are there in almost all age groups.\n2. The dataset is ofcourse imbalance, but from the histogram of nodes (axillary positive nodes) we come to know that if the        number of positive axillary nodes are less, then there is a fair chance for the patient to survive more than 5 years. We        cannot conclude the same but we will get some insight if we dig deep on to the nodes variable.\n3.

About 71% of non-survived patients are having nodes from 0 to 10.\n2. In the bin window 0 to 5 nodes 56% of the status 2 cases are identified.

Age - Age of the person when she undergoes the treatment\n2. Year - Year of the treatment\n3. Axillary Nodes (Positive) - This implies whether the cancer affected the lymph nodes or not. If there are positive nodes it\n   indicates that cancer has been spread to lymph nodes\n4. Status - 1 represents patients survived more than 5 years ; 2 represents patients died within 5 years of treatment.","7afb4b31":"1. From the box and violin plots its clear that more than 50% of status 1 patients doesn't have positive nodes. Also the area\n   is denser in the bottom which indicates most of the status 1 patients have less nodes identified.\n2. On the other hand the status 2 violin is thinner and distributed from bottom to top. This indicates that a significant number\n   of nodes are there for status 2 patients.\n3. To see further deeper we shall analyse the median and quantiles for the nodes in both statuses.","28834ff5":"### Objective","f17b1b11":"1. The dataset is imbalance with higher survived patients details\n2. Based on the data exploration the patients with no or very less number of postive axillary nodes had a higher chance of\n   survival. But it is not true for all the cases, since we are also having no or very less nodes for even un-survived patients.\n   Also the dataset is very small.\n3. Number of positive axillary nodes field is better than other fields for classification.\n4. Age field is not very informative since patients are there in all age groups with both statuses. The violin and box plots in    furthur analysis of data section shows it clearly.\n5. Years also scattered across all intervals for both statuses.","7c45e6f4":"In the dataset, about 44% (136 out of 306) of records don't have axillary positive nodes. In that 136 records about 117 records\nare patients who lived more than 5 years."}}
