in AI and related fields of Data Science benchmarked across 60 countries.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*vu0cAstnYfhBntpmwfnISw.jpeg)\n\n\"Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\"\n\n[Coursera](http:\/\/https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/) is an online platform for higher education that serves over 45 million learners around the world by providing access to high quality content from leading universities and companies. The platform currently includes includes **3,700+ **courses, **400+ specializations**, and **16 degrees**, This undoubtedly creates one\nof the largest skills databases as millions of learners take graded assessments ranging from multiple choice exams to programming assignments to peer reviewed projects that measure their skill proficiency.[Source](https:\/\/hai.stanford.edu\/sites\/g\/files\/sbiybj10986\/f\/ai_index_2019_report.pdf)\n\nThe [Coursera Global Skills Index (GSI)](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/gsi) draws upon this rich data to benchmark 60 countries and 10 industries across Business, Technology, and Data Science skills to reveal skills development trends around the world.\n\nCoursera measures the skill proficiency of countries in AI overall and in the related skills of :\n* **Math** : is the study of numbers and their relationships as well as applying these principles to models of real phenomena. (Sample skills: calculus, linear algebra)\n\n* **Machine learning** :  creates algorithms and statistical models that computer systems can use to perform a specific task without explicit instructions. (Sample skills: neural networks, natural language processing) \n\n* **Statistics** : deals with all aspects of data collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. (Sample skills: linear regression, AB testing)\n\n* **Statistical programming** : is the set of programming languages and tools used to create statistical models and algorithms. (Sample skills: R, Python)\n\n* **Software engineering** : involves the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software. (Sample skills: software development, algorithms)\n\nThese related skills cover the breadth of knowledge needed to build and deploy AI powered technologies within organizations and society. \n\n\n### Benchmarking(https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/gsi\/methodology\/)\nSkills in this taxonomy are mapped to the courses that teach them using a machine learning model. For every competency in the GSI, this tagging makes it possible to extract assessments in courses teaching relevant skills. These serve as the pool of assessments used to measure individual learners\u2019 skill proficiencies.\n\nWith the set of assessments for each competency defined,grades were considered for all learners taking each assessment in the relevant pool. Machine Learning models were then trained to estimate individual learners\u2019 skill proficiencies, adjusting for item difficulty.\n\nThe average proficiency for a company for industry has been calculated by averaging across proficiencies of learners in an entity, weighting by the inverse of the standard error on the proficiency estimates and trimming these weights to avoid undue influence by any one learner.\n\nThis weighted average for each domain or competency is the GSI estimate of an entity\u2019s skill proficiency. Performance bands are computed by segmenting skill proficiencies into quartiles:\n\n* **Cutting-Edge** for 76th percentile or above\n* **Competitive** for 51st to 75th percentile\n* **Emerging** for 26th to 50th percentile\n* **Lagging** for 25th percentile or below\n\nThe GSI reflects the average skill proficiency of learners within each entity on the Coursera platform. Note that the GSI estimate does not necessarily reflect the average skill proficiency of all entity members because Coursera learners may differ from the average resident of a country or employee in an industry.","e37ac751":"## East Asia & Pacific\nLet's look at the performance of every country in the East Asia & Pacific Region.","d77483e0":"## North America\nLet's look at the performance of every country in the North American Region.","81c749ea":"# Countrywise Results\nFor each major geographic region, we can also see the average country\u2019s share of enrollments in AI and the five related competencies.
