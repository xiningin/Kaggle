How America\u2019s partisan divide over pandemic responses played out in the states\n\nThe response to the COVID-19 pandemic became increasingly politicized in the United States (US) and political affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease.\n\n### Covid-19 Hit\/Spread Differences\n\nIn terms of the generic epidemiologic parameters, the following trends had been caputured\n\n- From March to early June 2020, Republican-led states had lower COVID-19 incidence rates compared to Democratic-led states. On June 3, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had higher incidence (RR=1.10, 95% PI=1.01, 1.18). This trend persisted through early December 2020. \n- For death rates, Republican-led states had lower rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 4 (RR=1.18, 95% PI=1.02, 1.31) through mid-December 2020. \n- Republican-led states had higher test positivity rates starting on May 30, 2020 (RR=1.70, 95% PI=1.66, 1.73) and lower testing rates by September 30, 2020 (RR=0.95, 95% PI=0.90, 0.98).\n\nSome argue that states led by Republicans were hit by COVID-19 later or not as hard as states led by Democrats. Yet based on data from the COVID Tracking Project, there was little difference in the number of cases in each state when governors announced the emergency orders in Mar 2020.\n\nSources:\n\n- Associations between governor political affiliation and COVID-19 cases, deaths, and testing in the United States - https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7587838\/\n\n### Early Pandemic Response Policy Differences\n\nIn terms of the policy actions in the early pandemic phase (end of Feb - Mar 2020), the significant difference in the responses of the Democrat-ruled and Republican-ruled states has been observed.\n\n- The median date for instituting a state of emergency for Democratic governors was March 10, 2020 and for Republican governors, March 13, 2020.\n- Although stay-at-home orders have only been issued in 41 states as of April 4, 2020, a similar trend is emerging there.\n- All 24 Democratic governors have issued such an order with a median date of March 24, 2020. On the other hand, only 17 of 26 Republican governors had, and of those the median date is March 30, 2020.\n- Most governors used boilerplate language citing public health experts in their announcements. But some evidence shows that Republican governors were responding to leadership from then-President Donald Trump, who largely downplayed the severity of the pandemic for weeks, which discouraged governors from taking actions that contradicted the leader of their party. For instance, on March 7, he said \u201cI\u2019m not concerned at all,\u201d and on March 10 he claimed \u201cit will go away.

Phil Scott, a Republican, adopted relatively stricter measures and this likely led to better health outcomes.\n- Republican-led states tended to soften the Covid-19 pandemic-driven restrictions, effectively Aug 2020, as oppose to Democrat-goverend states (with some exceptions related to certain Republican governors having strong disapproval to the policy of then-President Donald Trump)\n- The partisan divide over healthcare policies in the U.S. existed before COVID-19, and the pandemic reaction policies in different states just highlighted it once more\n\nSources\n- How America\u2019s partisan divide over pandemic responses played out in the states - https:\/\/theconversation.com\/how-americas-partisan-divide-over-pandemic-responses-played-out-in-the-states-157565\n- The partisan pandemic: Do we now live in alternative realities? - https:\/\/theconversation.com\/the-partisan-pandemic-do-we-now-live-in-alternative-realities-140290\n\n## Appendix C.

Higher percentages were enrolled in hybrid and in-person instruction (23 percent and 50 percent, respectively).\n- Among White students, 15 percent were enrolled in remote instruction, 22 percent were enrolled in hybrid instruction, and 63 percent were enrolled in in-person instruction.\n- Among Black students, 38 percent were enrolled in remote instruction, 23 percent were enrolled in hybrid instruction, and 39 percent were enrolled in in-person instruction.\n- Among Hispanic students, 32 percent were enrolled in remote instruction, 26 percent were enrolled in hybrid instruction, and 42 percent were enrolled in in-person instruction.\n- Among Asian students, 54 percent were enrolled in remote instruction, 21 percent were enrolled in hybrid instruction, and 25 percent were enrolled in in-person instruction.\n- Among American Indian\/Alaska Native students, 22 percent were enrolled in remote instruction, 25 percent were enrolled in hybrid instruction, and 53 percent were enrolled in in-person instruction.\n- Among Pacific Islander students, 34 percent were enrolled in remote instruction, 32 percent were enrolled in hybrid instruction, and 31 percent were enrolled in in-person instruction.\n- Among students of Two or more races, 27 percent were enrolled in remote instruction, 25 percent were enrolled in hybrid instruction, and 48 percent were enrolled in in-person instruction.\n\nSources\n- NCES Back-to-School Statistics charter - https:\/\/nces.ed.gov\/fastfacts\/display.asp?id=372","1d73b2c2":"## Appendix D. Instruments, Tools, and Additional Data Sources\n\nWhen collating this notebook, I heavily relied on *Plotly* and its wonderful capability to render animated charts with the reasoanbly low amount of coding effort required.\n\nMore specifically, I used the following animated charts to draw insights on usage of Digital Learning Platforms across the different U. S. states\n\n- animated Geo Scatter plots\n- animated Bar charts\n\nOverall, I preferred to use *plotly* (both static and animated charts) due to its interactive appeal.\n\nA separate visualization tool in policy action analysis section was utilized to draw the timeline with the most essential dates in 2020 that affected Educational system in the U. S. states being the subjects of our in-depth case studies. UML Activity diagrams as well as its easy-to-use text representation in PlantUML format were used, and the special IPython integration (namely, *iplantuml* library and *%%plantuml* in-line cell tag) was invoked to render and draw such charts across this notebook.\n\nAlthough I am a big fan of applying Rapid EDA tools (especially *AutoViz* and *Sweetwiz*), there was no any room for them in the kind of analysis I have undertaken in this notebook.\n\n*Oxford Policy Tracker* was used as a policy actions data source due to\n\n- its comprehensive and detailed log of events during the Covid-19 pandemic spread (IMHO, it is one of the best and accurate datasets of this sort)\n- ease of access to it via BigQuery and its SQL interface\n\n**Why Using Animated Charts and Geospacial Charts?**\n\nThe animated charts can be beneficial in many senses.\n\nThe intuition behind animation seems to be clear enough: if a two-dimensional image is good, then a moving image should be better.\n\nMovement is familiar: we are accustomed to both moving through the real world and seeing things in it move smoothly.\n\nAll around us, items move, grow, and change color in ways that we understand deeply and richly.\nIn a visualization, animation might help a viewer work through the logic behind an idea by showing the intermediate steps and transitions, or show how data collected over time changes. A moving image might offer a fresh perspective, or invite users to look deeper into the data presented (especially if there is a temporal, or time series component in it).\n\nThe same is about geographical maps. They can help us to watch the patterns\/phenomena that happen with the observed events\/attributes in different areas of a country\/continent\/globe on the parallel tracks, in the same time.\n\n## Appendix E\n\n- *Sep 27, 2021* - intial public version of the notebook posted in Kaggle\n- *Sep 28, 2021* - minor typos fixed in *Executive Summary* section","85e591b3":"As we can see, the dataset indicates all countries (school districs) for Florida represented in the contest's dataset to be in *'0.4, 0.6'* category (in terms of the ratio of black and hispanic ethnical groups within the county\/school district's population).

Some schools such as Hillsborough County Public Schools announce they will comply with FDOE's directive.(https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200809165231\/http:\/\/www.fldoe.org\/core\/fileparse.php\/7590\/urlt\/SchoolCampusClosuresExt.pdf , https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200809171811\/https:\/\/www.sdhc.k12.fl.us\/doc\/2652\/communications\/resources\/coronaupdates\/ )\n- On Apr 18, 2020, \"Governor Ron DeSantis and Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran recommended that all Florida public and private K-12 schools continue distance learning and keep school campuses closed through June 3rd, the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic year.\"(https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200809172436\/http:\/\/www.fldoe.org\/newsroom\/latest-news\/florida-extends-distance-learning-through-remainder-of-academic-year.stml)   \n- \"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that K-12 students in the state will continue distance learning until the end of the school year during a press conference Saturday, April 18, 2020.\"( https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200809174723\/https:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/news\/coronavirus\/article242117181.html)\n\n\nHowever, the decision to re-open schools remained on the school district level, and not every school district followed the recommendations above. Therefore we can see the gradual decline in both the engagement index and percentage access of the students to Digital Learning Platforms on Apr 16 - May 24, 2020 as some school districts issued the directives to re-open the schools for in-person education. \n\nPercentage Access remains at 25-29% through May 17, and it drops down to 21% at the last week of Spring Semester.\n\n**Note:** The decision to let school districts decide on the school re-opening on their own has been confirmed in court as of Oct 9, 2020. A Florida appeals court \"overturned a ruling that said Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran violated the Florida Constitution when he issued a July order aimed at reopening schools amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The overturned rule was originally in August by Leon County Circuit Judge Charles Dodson, who sided with teachers unions that challenged Corcoran\u2019s order. The Judge Lori Rowe stated, that the State's emergency order doesn't disrupt a school district\u2019s discretion to determine when to reopen schools and whether to offer in-person instruction, and forcing a teacher to return to the classroom is under the remit of the school board (https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201023013311\/https:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/news\/local\/education\/article246338630.html).\n\n**May 25 - Mid Aug 2020**\n\nThis was the time of the Summer Break, and the activity in Digital Learning Platforms went down as expected, due to the student vacations.\n\n**Mid Aug - Sep 2020**\n\nThis period of time is interesting due to the school re-opening targeted by the end of Aug 2020. \n\nOn Jul 6, Florida Department of Education (DOE) introduces reopening requirements and reopening plans for all public and some applicable private K-12 school districts in the state in DOE Order NO. 2020-E0-06. All schools are required to fully reopen schools by the end of August with face-to-face instruction five days a week. Moreover, school districts are required to submit reopening plans to DOE for approval prior to reopening (https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200707015622\/http:\/\/www.fldoe.org\/core\/fileparse.php\/19861\/urlt\/DOE-2020-EO-06.pdf).\n\nAt the same time, we see the State Governor to insist on parents to have the right to demand either in-person, remote (virtual) or hybrid education for their children in Autumn Semester of 2020.\n\nAs a cumulative result of the inference of the above-mentioned regulations, we can see gradual increase in Engagement Index after Aug 23 and through the mid Sep 2020. However, the peak values of the Engagement Index remained smaller vs. Apr and even May 2020 as a lot of people have choosen to request in-person eduction for their  children in Autumn Semester.\n\nWe can see some trending down for Engagement Index in mid Sep 2020 due to the short Autumn Break. \n\n**Oct - Dec 2020**\n\nWe can see a certain decline in Engagement Index since early Oct 2020. It can be explained by the factors below\n\n- Miami-Dade Public Schools, the four largest public school district in the nation, resumed in-person classes on Monday, October 5. Over 22,000 students returned to schools on Monday and another 40,000 are expected to return for face-to-face instruction by the end of the month( https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201005215433\/https:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/news\/local\/education\/article246197760.html).\n- Gov. Ron DeSantis starting to actively criticise the scool closures in Mar-Apr 2020, encouraging school districts to keep their schools open regardless Covid-19 cases statistics \n\nYou can see Ron DeSantis arguments in the quotes and actions below\n\n- Oct 20, 2020: Gov. Ron DeSantis in at a press conference said that event in the event of Covid-19 outbreaks as the school year continues, school closures should be \"off the table.\" DeSantis stated, \u201cClosures don\u2019t do anything to mitigate COVID-19, but they do cause catastrophic damage to the physical, mental and social well-being of our youth.

Therefore changes in using such a type of the systems are going to be indicative of the global impact of Covid-19 pandemics on both the Pre-K12 school system and higher eduction in USA.\n\nData about the usage of Digital Learning Platforms in 2020, selective U.S. states, has been used in the analysis (as per the dataset provided by the organizers of this contest).\n\nAdditional data source for the policy action tracking at the U.S. state level was *Oxford Policy Tracker Dataset* (see the explanations in *Appendix A* below).\n\nWhen doing the policy action impact analysis, the some of the publicly available analytical reports have been reviewed (see the summary provided in *Appendix B* and *Appendix C* below).\n\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nDigital Learning Platforms (LC) products are the principal classroom-level eLearning systems where students get their instructions as well as complete homework\/tests and do self-learning activities. Therefore changes in using such a type of the systems are going to be indicative of the global impact of Covid-19 pandemics on both the Pre-K12 school system and higher eduction in USA.\n\nThis study has discovered the key insights below \n\n- The significant difference in Covid-19 policy actions between Democrat- and Republican-governed states observed in 2020 affected the charts for Engagement Index (EI) and Max Percentage Access to Digital Learning Platforms in the Spring Semester of School Year 2019-2020 and Fall (Autumn) Semester of School Year 2020-2021 for the states\n- Democrat-ruled states, being more reactive and more strict in their policy actions, had more schools and students committing remote education both in the Spring Semester of School Year 2019-2020 and Fall (Autumn) Semester of School Year 2020-2021 (you can see it in CT, MA etc.); as a result, the higher trends for Engagement Index (EI) and Max Percentage Access to Digital Learning Platforms in the Spring Semester of School Year 2019-2020 and Fall (Autumn) Semester of School Year 2020-2021 have been observed\n- Democrat-ruled states that displayed relatively low values of Engagement Index (NJ, NY) have relatively low amount of the students enrolled in the systems\n- Rebuplican-ruled states displayed drammatically different Covid-19 containment policy action patterns, and therefore different trends for Engagement Index and Max Percentage Access were observed for such states\n- In Republican-governed states with the high approval rate of then-President Donald Trump, less strict actions implemented overall (some of these states had never called for Covid-19-related Emergency State and stay-at-home policies); it resulted  in relatively low values of Engagement Index and Max Percentage Access in these states both in the Spring Semester of School Year 2019-2020 and Fall (Autumn) Semester of School Year 2020-2021 (you can see it in FL, TX, TN etc.)\n- In Republican-governed states with the low approval rate of then-President Donald Trump, more strict actions have been implemented (vs. their counterpart states with the high approval rate) to oppose the ignorant stance of Donald Trump toward Covid-19-related threats; as a results, such states demonstrated quite high values for Engagement Index (EI) and Max Percentage Access rates in the Spring Semester of School Year 2019-2020 , being on a par with those for the Democrat-governed states (see it in OH and UT)\n- In Republican-governed states with the low approval rate of then-President Donald Trump, less restrictive policies have been implemented in the Fall (Autumn) Semester of School Year 2020-2021 vs. the Spring Semester of School Year 2019-2020 , and therefore they started to display lower trends for Engagement Index and Max Percentage Access to Digital Learning Platforms (you can see it in OH, for instance)\n- In every state, there were observed peak increases in the trends for Engagement Index and Max Percentage Access in Feb 2020 (prior to  any official Covid-19 containment policy actions started to happen across the U.S.); there is no clear data to find the fact-driven explanation to this phenomenon; however, the gut-feeling assumption is such peak values were originated from both the school districts and vendors of Digital Learning Platforms running the test drives of the respective software systems to make the schools ready for  more extensive remote education (eLearning) delivery in the upcoming months\n- Ethnicity of the  students (and their families) does affect the EI and Max Percentage Access charts for the particular states\n- In the states with the heterogenic ethnicity of the population (like California, North Carolina, and Washington), we can see more traffic in Digital Learning Platforms generated (and thus higher values of EI and Max Percentage Access displayed) by the populations of black and hispanic families; it demonstrates that families of such ethnical origins more often choosed to let their children recieve remote education (eLearning) in the  situations where parents had a right to request either remote or in-person education mode in the schools with hybrid education model\n- In the extreme cases of Republican-governed states with the high approval rate of then-President Donald Trump (like Florida or Texas), we see the traffice in Digital Learning Platforms generated solely by the counties\/school districts with quite high ratio of black\/hispanic people; since white-predominated counties in such states also exist, we can conclude the families with black\/hispanic ethnicity requested in-person education for their children when\/if parents provided with the right to ultimately decide on it\n- In the states with  more homogenous population and Democrat governance (with more strict regulations toward school closure and other Covid-19 containment measures), we can see that students of white\/caucasian ethnicity were also active online in Digital Learning Platforms (you can see it examplified by the EI and Max Percentage Access trends in Connecticut, Utah, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia etc.)\n- Rural locations appeared to generate less or sometimes even no traffic in Digital Learning Platforms in certain states (Arizona, Utah); this can be explained by the desert landscape of those states that determines (1) less population in rural areas, and (2) poorer coverage of such rural areas by sufficient internet connectivity backbone to sustain and facilitate the traffic-intensive eLearning activities in Digital Learning Platforms\n- In the states where Rural and Suburb areas are covered with good connectivity, such areas generate a lot of the traffic (and thus ensure higher values of EI and Max Percentage Accesss attributes) in Digital Learning Platforms\n\nYou can review the chapters below to delve into the detailed analitics journey that led to the above-mentioned discoveries.\n\nThe rest of the notebook is organized in the following manner \n\n- **Pre-Requisites** chapter explains preparation steps to automate the analytics flow required by this research (import of the neccessary Python packages as well as custom Python functions to automate repeatable routines inclusive)\n- **Reading and Pre-Processing the Data** chapter explains data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline used in this notebook\n- **Digital Learning Platform Patterns** chapter captures the rapid insights by looking at the whole dataset on the country level (with power of Geoscatter plots leveraged to briefly grasp on such insights)\n- **Policy Impact Analysis** chapter performs a series of the deep-dive case studies to research on the impact of Covid-19 containment actions in different states on Educational system in both the Spring Semester of school year  (SY) 2019-2020 and the Autumn Semester of SY 2020-2021 (with Florida, Connecticut, and Ohio selected for such an in-depth review)\n- **Holistic View on State, Ethnicity, and Locale Impact** chapter conveys the analysis of the impact  of population ethnicity and locales of the school counties on the trends in using Digital Learning Platforms at the time of Covid-19 pandemic spread\n- **References** chapter provides links to the helpful blog posts, articles, and other materials used across this research effort\n\nThe **Appendix** sections provide the supplementary notes\/materials as follows\n- **Appendix A** explans the structure of data regarding Education-related policy action tracking at the U.S. state level in *Oxford Policy Tracker* database\n- **Appendix B** contains the literature review on how America\u2019s partisan divide over pandemic responses played out in the states (since such a difference had a critical impact on the usage of Digital Learning Platforms across the states in both the Spring Semester of SY 2019-2020 and the Autumn Semester of SY 2020-2021\n- **Appendix C** displays the key facts on Remote, Hybrid and In-Person Learning Modes in K-12 System in 2020-2021 as presented by NCES's Back-to-School Statistics resources\n- **Appendix D** provides some technical explanations on instruments, tools, and additional data sources used in this notebook\n- **Appendix E** provides revisions history to this notebook\n\n\n# Pre-Requisites\n\nFirst of all, we are going to place some preparational (pre-requisite) code into our notebook.
