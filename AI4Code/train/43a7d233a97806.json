Hypertension and Obesity came out on top as the prime medical conditions among hospitalised population. While metabolic and cardiovascular diseases were second most priortised ailments. The majority of deaths recorded had Circulatory System Diseases and metabolic diseases.\n\nAvailable data were then used to check if prediction of patients suffering from COVID - 19 would require ICU.
