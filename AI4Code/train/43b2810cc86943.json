The code to build the model is the same as what you saw in the tutorial. So that is copied below for you.\n\nBut because your data is different, there are **two lines in the modeling code cell that you'll need to change.** Can you figure out what they are? \n\nFirst, run the cell below to look at a couple elements from your training data.","682315a7":"## Keep Going\n\nThe next step is a big one. See how you can **[represent tokens as vectors that describe their meaning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/matleonard\/word-vectors)**, and plug those into your machine learning models.","d7326186":"Now, having seen this data, find the two lines that need to be changed.","e12bed30":"# Step 6: Keep Improving\n\nYou've built the necessary components to train a text classifier with spaCy. What could you do further to optimize the model?\n\nRun the next line to check your answer.","f7d2360e":"These probabilities look reasonable. Now you should turn them into an actual prediction.\n\n# Step 4: Making Predictions\n\nImplement a function `predict` that predicts the sentiment of text examples. \n- First, tokenize the texts using `nlp.tokenizer()`. \n- Then, pass those docs to the TextCategorizer which you can get from `nlp.get_pipe()`. \n- Use the `textcat.predict()` method to get scores for each document, then choose the class with the highest score (probability) as the predicted class.","0622f760":"# Natural Language Classification\n\nYou did such a great job for DeFalco's restaurant in the previous exercise that the chef has hired you for a new project.\n\nThe restaurant's menu includes an email address where visitors can give feedback about their food. \n\nThe manager wants you to create a tool that automatically sends him all the negative reviews so he can fix them, while automatically sending all the positive reviews to the owner, so the manager can ask for a raise. \n\nYou will first build a model to distinguish positive reviews from negative reviews using Yelp reviews because these reviews include a rating with each review. Your data consists of the text body of each review along with the star rating. Ratings with 1-2 stars count as \"negative\", and ratings with 4-5 stars are \"positive\". Ratings with 3 stars are \"neutral\" and have been dropped from the data.\n\nLet's get started. First, run the next code cell.","85f66858":"# Step 2: Review Data and Create the model\n\nMoving forward with your plan, you'll need to load the data.

However you need to calculate some metric for the model's performance on the hold-out validation data.\n\n# Step 5: Evaluate The Model\n\nImplement a function that evaluates a `TextCategorizer` model. This function `evaluate` takes a model along with texts and labels. It returns the accuracy of the model, which is the number of correct predictions divided by all predictions.\n\nFirst, use the `predict` method you wrote earlier to get the predicted class for each text in `texts`. Then, find where the predicted labels match the true \"gold-standard\" labels and calculate the accuracy.","873ee9b1":"# Step 1: Evaluate the Approach\n\nIs there anything about this approach that concerns you? After you've thought about it, run the function below to see one point of view.","ddccfdad":"# Step 3: Train Function\n\nImplement a function `train` that updates a model with training data. Most of this is general data munging, which we've filled in for you. Just add the one line of code necessary to update your model.","78756e6d":"We can try this slightly trained model on some example text and look at the probabilities assigned to each label."}}
