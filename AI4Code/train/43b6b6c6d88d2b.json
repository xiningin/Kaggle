Country, Gender, and Age Group***\n\n* Almost all countries follows the general tendency (there are more younger kagglers and less female kagglers.) There are some exceptions. For example, Japan has more older kagglers. 65% of Japanese Kagglers are older than 30 years old.\n\n***5. Education*** \n\n* People with Bachelor's and Master's degree are 77% of the total. People with Doctoral degree is 11%. It would be interesting if we have data of their majors, since the data science skills are applicable to multiple fields.\n\n***6.

If we find the reason, we would be able to bring more people in from the other countires. I did not expect the result that we have much less female Kagglers, since I watched a lot of female data scientists' Youtube channels.\n\nAbout Canada data, I would like to see more people from Canada will join Kaggle. I believe it will increase Canadian companies recognission of Kaggle, and they will use Kaggle profiles in their hiring process. From the data, it will be a good strategy to target students since Canada has less younger age groups and students. \n\n\nAnyways, I am excited to see how Kaggle use this data to make their decisions in the future.\n","b55a9a3b":"# ***\u270d Learning Obectives***\n\n***1.
