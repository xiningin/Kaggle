It is inspired by Richard Feynman's path integral formulation. That's why the python module to use it is called Feyn, and the Q in QLattice is for Quantum.\n\nQLattices have been shown in research to perform very well and yield simple and explainable models: Symbolic regression outperforms other models for small data sets\n\nAbzu provides free QLattices for non-commercial use to anyone. These free community QLattices gets allocated for us automatically if we use Feyn without an active subscription, as we will do in this notebook. Read more about how it works here: https:\/\/docs.abzu.ai\/docs\/guides\/getting_started\/community.html\n\nThe feyn Python module is not installed on Kaggle by default so we have to pip install it first.","1220aa51":"## We are making separate columns for the first 5 characters of the language.
