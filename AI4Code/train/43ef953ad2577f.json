Cross Validation method : A quick recap\n\n\nK-Fold Cross Validation is a more sophisticated approach that generally results in a less biased model compared to other methods. This method consists in the following steps:\n\nDivides the n observations of the dataset into k mutually exclusive and equal or close-to-equal sized subsets known as \u201cfolds\u201d. \nFit the model using k-1 folds as the training set and one fold (kth) as the test set. After each iteration has been finished, store the error of the model.\nRepeat this process k times using one different fold every time as a test set and the remaining folds (k-1) as the training set. \nOnce all the iterations have finished, take the mean of the k models. This would be the Mean Squared Error of the model.\nThe error model in using the K-Fold cross validation has the following formula:\n\n![Cv](https:\/\/financetrain.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/error-model.png)","c7d36cac":"# Observation\n\n* Linear and Ridge Regression Models have constant stable CV Results\n* Support vector, Random forest , Decision trees show fluctuating performance output.

But did you know a picture can save a thousand lives? Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. You might expect pets with attractive photos to generate more interest and be adopted faster. But what makes a good picture? With the help of data science, you may be able to accurately determine a pet photo\u2019s appeal and even suggest improvements to give these rescue animals a higher chance of loving homes.\n\nPetFinder.my is Malaysia\u2019s leading animal welfare platform, featuring over 180,000 animals with 54,000 happily adopted. PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare.\n\nCurrently, PetFinder.my uses a basic Cuteness Meter to rank pet photos. It analyzes picture composition and other factors compared to the performance of thousands of pet profiles. While this basic tool is helpful, it's still in an experimental stage and the algorithm could be improved.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll analyze raw images and metadata to predict the \u201cPawpularity\u201d of pet photos. You'll train and test your model on PetFinder.my's thousands of pet profiles. Winning versions will offer accurate recommendations that will improve animal welfare.\n\nIf successful, your solution will be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and rescuers around the world to improve the appeal of their pet profiles, automatically enhancing photo quality and recommending composition improvements. As a result, stray dogs and cats can find their \"furever\" homes much faster. With a little assistance from the Kaggle community, many precious lives could be saved and more happy families created.\n\nTop participants may be invited to collaborate on implementing their solutions and creatively improve global animal welfare with their AI skills.\n\n![pets](https:\/\/www.petfinder.my\/images\/cuteness_meter-showcase.jpg)","d419445e":"# Evaluating the models\n","46220805":"Now below, we will perform cross-validation on the data set and get our scores.

It cannot \"cause\" overfitting in the sense of causality. However, there is no guarantee that k-fold cross-validation removes overfitting.\n> The data set is divided into k subsets, and the holdout method is repeated k times. Each time, one of the k subsets is used as the test set and the other k-1 subsets are put together to form a training set. Then the average error across all k trials is computed. The advantage of this method is that it matters less how the data gets divided. Every data point gets to be in a test set exactly once, and gets to be in a training set k-1 times. The variance of the resulting estimate is reduced as k is increased. The disadvantage of this method is that the training algorithm has to be rerun from scratch k times, which means it takes k times as much computation to make an evaluation.","0c741e71":"If this helped you, your **UPVOTES** would be very much appreciated \u2013 as they are the source of motivation!\n\nHappy learning"}}
