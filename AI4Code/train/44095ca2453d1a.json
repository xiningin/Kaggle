Loading and visualizing the images\n### Airbus Ship Detection Challenge - A quick overview for computer vision noobs\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHi, and welcome! This is the first kernel of the series `Airbus Ship Detection Challenge - A quick overview for computer vision noobs.` \nIn this short kernel (~50 lines) we will find, load, resize and display the jpg satellital images using [PIL](https:\/\/pillow.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/), we will map them to a rgb matrix representation using numpy [array](https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/numpy\/reference\/generated\/numpy.array.html) and we will display those rgb matrices on a nice grid using matplotlib's [imshow](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html) and [subplots](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html)).\n\n\n\nThe full series consist of the following notebooks:\n1. *[Loading and visualizing the images](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/1-loading-and-visualizing-the-images)*\n2. [Understanding and plotting rle bounding boxes](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/2-understanding-and-plotting-rle-bounding-boxes) \n3.

[1.0 submission: submitting the test file](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/julian3833\/5-1-0-submission-submitting-the-test-file)\n\nThis project aims to get some good understanding about the specific topic (image segmentation), including going over the dataset, learning common approaches and understanding the best models proposed by the community from a technical and theoretical point of view. The ideal reader is a data scientist noob with some general knowledge about deep learning.\n\nThis is an ongoing project, so expect more notebooks to be added to the series soon. Actually, we are currently working on the following ones:\n* Understanding and exploiting the data leak\n* A quick overview of image segmentation domain\n* Jumping into Pytorch\n* Understanding U-net\n* Proposing a simple improvement to U-net model","1810b2c3":"<a id='seven'><\/a>\n## 7.
