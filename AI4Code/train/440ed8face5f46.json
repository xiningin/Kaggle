In other words, GDP measures the 'monetary value of final goods and services produced by a country\/state in a given period of time'.\n\n \n\nGDP can be broadly divided into goods and services produced by three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry), and the tertiary sector (services).\n\n \n\nIt is also known as nominal GDP. More technically, (real) GDP takes into account the price change that may have occurred due to inflation. This means that the real GDP is nominal GDP adjusted for inflation. We will use the nominal GDP for this exercise. Also, we will consider the financial year 2015-16 as the base year, as most of the data required for this exercise is available for the aforementioned period.","7d1b55f6":"#### Per Capita GDP and Income\nTotal GDP divided by the population gives the per capita GDP, which roughly measures the average value of goods and services produced per person. The per capita income is closely related to the per capita GDP (though they are not the same). In general, the per capita income increases when the per capita GDP increases, and vice-versa. For instance, in the financial year 2015-16, the per capita income of India was \u20b993,293, whereas the per capita GDP of India was $1717, which roughly amounts to \u20b91,11,605.
