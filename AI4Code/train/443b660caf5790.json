something that I constantly hear, \"You get paid based off of your experience\". Which I do agree with, lets now see if we can show this in a graph clearly. \n\nWe are going to use a simple line graph .plot() to plot the frequency of each experience level for each income bracket. We will place all line graphs on the same axis to get a better idea and to compare. \n\nSteps:\n\n1. group each income bracket into a dataframe of its own \n2. access the index and values (values in this case is the frequency of each experience level) \n3.

So our earlier \nassumption in the beginning of the chapter seems to be true so far. \n\n* For masters and doctoral, the green and red bar respectively, we can see that there is a greater number of people that have <1 year and 1-2 years of experience than any other \ncategory of experience.

","72587be4":"## Chapter 1: LOADING AND CLEANING THE DATA\n\nIn this chapter we will simply load and filter the data so we are working with the right information. \n\nSteps:\n\n1. load the data using pandas\n2. drop any person who left the income section of the survey empty. We dont care for the people that didnt put down their income for obvious reasons. \n3. split the data into two dataframes. top1_data and top6_data that consist of the people that make the top 1% and top 6%, respectively, based on their income (> 300,000 and > 150,000, respectively)","a9c467ca":"## Take aways from the pie charts: \n\n* Almost 50% of the top 6% have a masters degree, and almost 40% of the top 1% have masters degree.

If you live in the USA, you have a higher chance of being in the top 6%. This makes perfect sense. The biggest companies in the world headquaters are in the USA. Some of the best STEM universities are in the states. And so on. \n\n2. Ages 35-44 tend to have a better chance of making more money. This makes sense cause by that age, if you have been in the field long enough, you can have the right amount of expereince and knowledge to excel. Plus Im assuming you also have more energy and time compared to the older people. I dont know for sure though cause Im only 22 :) \n\n3. Your level of education does play a factor in the money you will make down the road. masters or doctoral are the better options. I think this is self explanatory. Education is important and what you do with it is even more important.\n\n4. If you have a high level degree, then experience does not play as strong of a factor to your income compared to a lower level of education. This makes perfect sense to me, again self explanatory. \n\n5. Other factors play a bigger role than years of expereince when you start making more than 300,000. I think this has to do with stuff outside the line of work you do haha. When you start making that much money, you are doing more than just \"data analysis\". \n","12b5825b":"### What to take away from this graph? \n\n* majority of people in each income bracket do have at the least 10-20 years of experience under their belt. \n* Almost 0 people are in the top 6% that have never written code. Duh. Yet there might be a bit of noise in the data since not ever employment type in the data is a hands on \nprogrammer. Not a big deal since this still clearly shows what we have said before. \n* the slope from 10-20 years to 20+ years for the blue, orange, green lines is greater than the red and purple. This is interesting because this shows that to be making enough to be in the top 1%, is it that important to have 20+ years of experience compared to 10-20 years. Something to think about.
