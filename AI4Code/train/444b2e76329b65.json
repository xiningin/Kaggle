Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n**PyCaret** is an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python that allows you to go from preparing your data to deploying your model within minutes in your choice of notebook environment.\nSource: [https:\/\/pycaret.org\/](http:\/\/)"}}
