A lot of media picked this story up and published articles about it, like for example:\nhttp:\/\/dailyhive.com\/vancouver\/world-cup-report-belgium-free-tv-2018\n\nThe chain called 'Krefel', now claimed they were well prepared for this to happen. As I was wondering how likely this was, I webscraped the Fifa website for yearly statistics per country since FIFA started recording stats (1934). \n\nAlthough it's very short kernel, I thought it would be intresting to share\/\n","3f48898f":"# Conclusion\n\nTurns out, in the 395 participations (excluding this World Cup) only 15 times a team accomplished this feat, which translates to 3,80 %.\nIt was very unlikely Krefel anticipated this result."}}
