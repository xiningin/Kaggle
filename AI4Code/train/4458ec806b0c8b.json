For the most part, these came of age as the :-) and :-( and 8-D of chatroom conversations in the 1990s. These primitive gestures represented an important part of early netspeak: You could convey sarcasm by tacking on ;-) at the end of your message, or share your ambivalence with the \u00af_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af face.\"\n\n\"The first emoji were created in 1999 by Japanese artist Shigetaka Kurita. Kurita\u2019s original 176 emoji\u2014now part of the permanent collection at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art\u2014privileged symbols over faces, because DOCOMO\u2019s goal was to find new ways to express information. There were characters to show the weather (sun, clouds, umbrella, snowman), traffic (car, tram, airplane, ship), technology (landline, cell phone, TV, GameBoy), and all the phases of the moon. But those characters weren\u2019t purely informational: For the first time, emoji offered a way to add emotional subtext to a message. \u201cI understand\u201d might sound cold or passive on its own, but add \u2764\ufe0f and the message offered a sense of warmth and sympathy. It was the beginning of a new visual language.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/guide-emoji\/","ce8990df":"![](https:\/\/media3.giphy.com\/media\/l3vR4SFn7LLJf8WQM\/200w.webp?cid=ecf05e477juhb60xo88mhlq3k2awwws43dhlv83zv85duqcb&rid=200w.webp&ct=g)","50b183a8":"![](https:\/\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/3o7buirYcmV5nSwIRW\/200w.webp?cid=ecf05e470nhdl4kgjcphjutm33vtne8lpjzyzv2fikr6h4gn&rid=200w.webp&ct=g)","76065069":"<center style=\"font-family:verdana;\"><h1 style=\"font-size:200%; padding: 20px; background: #001f3f;\"><i><b style=\"color:orange;\">Use your Emojination<\/b><\/i><\/h1><\/center>","c9cb979d":"#Winking face emoji","7252e2e3":"#Eyes Emoji"}}
