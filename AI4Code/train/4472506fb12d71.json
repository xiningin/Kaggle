Through their routine work, CHWs contribute to inherent resilience and pandemic preparedness by increasing access to health products and services, distributing health information, and reducing the burden felt by the formal healthcare system-all of which act to buffer against emergencies. Recognizing that CHWs already play a role in pandemic preparedness, the roles and responsibilities of CHWs in pandemic preparedness could be expanded to improve health security and communitylevel resilience. However, access to these capacities is not always a reality, and CHWs represent a proven strategy for improving access to healthcare. CHWs can also contribute to adaptive resilience by increasing social mobilization, completing surveillance activities, and by filling health systems gaps left in the wake of infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n**Clinician Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Extraordinary Times and Unusual Challenges for the Allergist\/Immunologist (4\/4\/2020):**\n> As we realize that we are in a seminal 453 moment, that future generations may refer to \"pre-COVID\" and \"post-COVID\"(61), we must 454 also pause to reflect, to breathe, and to care for ourselves and our loved ones. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Engage in non-professional related online endeavors, i.e. podcasts pertaining to areas of interest \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Find social groups of similar interests to your own and engage or simply follow \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Seek out groups and friends with positive, uplifting messaging \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Implement social media to share resources, such as PPE access. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Use social media to promote kindness to others and connect with those that are socially distanced.\n\n# Efforts to support sustained education, access, and capacity building in the area of ethics.\n\n**Health Systems' \"Surge Capacity\": State of the Art and Priorities for Future Research (3\/1\/2013):**\n> Any general conceptual and\/or analytical model will need to incorporate geographical, temporal, and social contingencies in the outcomes, so that surge and surge capacity scenarios derive from, and inform, real-world events. Despite the disproportionately high occurrence of surge-generating events in low-and middle-income countries, and their considerably heightened vulnerability to such events, the research on surge capacity to date has focused largely on high-income countries, principally the United States. Work is, however, needed to generate robust conceptual and analytical frameworks, along with innovations in data collection and methodological approaches.\n\n**A Multi-Method Approach to Curriculum Development for In-Service Training in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Newly Established Health Emergency Response Offices (6\/27\/2014):**\n> It describes the multimethod approach used to identify training needs systematically, and to adopt international best practice in partnership with senior decision-makers and content experts from the government, academia and the military. The consultative process for developing the curriculum was designed to address the scale of the challenge for coordinating planning and training activities across jurisdictions that cover a population of over 1.3 billion people, and where most provinces have more than 60 million residents.\n\n# Efforts to establish a team at WHO that will be integrated within multidisciplinary research and operational platforms and that will connect with existing and expanded global networks of social sciences.\n\n**China's Belt and Road Initiative: Incorporating public health measures toward global economic growth and shared prosperity (6\/30\/2019):**\n> A strategy with a definition of health that goes beyond the absence of disease, involving partnership and community participation and that requires governments, organizations, communities, and individuals to work together to improve healthcare quality delivery would be most effective. More recently, it includes community and institutional development, early warning systems, surveillance and detection-such as developing platforms that would make operational and epidemiological information publicly available to decision-makers in the event of an outbreak or potential health emergency-and investment in strengthening countries' biosecurity and pandemic preparedness through a focus on national-scale immunization programs. It is also necessary to leverage the unique cross-disciplinary approach to understand the principles underlying research, policy, and practice in global health; to foster critical thinking; and to build transferable skills from a range of academic and professional backgrounds in the process of tackling local and global health issues and challenges. Behind It is crucial to promote greater cooperation and good practice among practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to ensure that quality evidence is translated into real and practical action, health education, and development implementation.\n\n\n# Efforts to identify how the burden of responding to the outbreak and implementing public health measures affects the physical and psychological health of those providing care for Covid-19 patients and identify the immediate needs that must be addressed.\n\n**Health Inequalities and Infectious Disease Epidemics: A Challenge for Global Health Security (9\/1\/2014):**\n> Policymakers and THE INEQUALITIES AND HEALTH SECURITY public health leaders must take these existing inequalities into account when planning for pandemics in order to prevent unnecessary suffering and the perpetuation of health and broader social inequities. Clearly, to achieve global health security and alleviate unnecessary suffering caused by social disadvantage and the social determinants of health requires complex collaboration across multiple sectors. We believe that neither the GHSA nor the PIP Framework gives true attention to inequalities within nations (which exist independent of national GDP) and their potential impact on disease transmission and resulting illness and death from influenza or other respiratory diseases with pandemic potential such as SARS or MERS-CoV. Therefore, it is our role as public health and healthcare professionals to work within our organizations, with communities, and with policymakers to decrease unnecessary exposure, minimize susceptibility (eg, by enhancing access to vaccines when available), and assure care after disease has developed. Our ability to accomplish that goal requires seeing pandemics for what they are: infectious diseases embedded in a social and political context-contexts defined by social determinants of health and unequal access to resources often resulting in behavioral and\/or biological disparities between population subgroups.\n\n**Emerging infectious diseases and outbreaks: implications for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reproductive health and rights in resource-poor settings (4\/1\/2020):**\n> In this time of global pandemic of Covid-19 and the new demand placed on the system to cope with the resulting new demands, Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights has emphasized in its statement that there are concerns regarding increased wait times to access SRHR services, difficulties in accessing SRHR medications (including contraceptives, hormone therapy and HIV treatment and increased health risks), and increased health risks experienced by pregnant and immune-compromised people. All these global epidemics have been weakening the health care systems and increasing the barriers to access reproductive health services in the LMICs, especially by impacting the economic, social and personal decision-making of women. The report from African Development confirms the impossibility of building resilience to Ebola and future infectious disease shocks in households and communities without also addressing systemic gender inequality [16] , national development strategies for EVD response (or any EID), and gender-sensitive recovery that addresses the associated negative impacts on women and girls [17] .","2f164b74":"# Creating the abstract embeddings:","7d0b5535":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","c450d36c":"# **About Us:**\nWe are a group of AI and NLP scientists with experience across NLP, image processing and computer vision.
