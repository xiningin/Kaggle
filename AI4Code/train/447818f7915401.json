For example, respondents with 1-2, 3-5, and 20 or years of experience in ML prefer GCP a little more, and all other groups prefer AWS.","9de6edf0":"Machine learning (ML) has been gaining popularity in recent years: almost 70% of the respondents have less than 2 years of relevant experience, and only about 2.5% have more than 10 years.

He is still a student, but with a master's degree (or plans to attain it within the next 2 years).\nFrom that point on, he uses Colab Notebooks instead of Kaggle Notebooks, local development environments instead of basic statistical software for data analysis, and Coursera instead of Kaggle Learn Courses for new knowledge.\nHe also hopes to become more familiar not only with AWS in the next 2 years, but a little with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and selected only Google Cloud Vertex AI for machine learning management, and yet TensorBoard in order to help manage ML experiments.\nEverything else is the same.\n\n**---------------- 2-3 years ---------------**\n\nHe is 25-29 years old and since then he already works as a Data Scientist with a yearly compensation of 0-999 USD in a small company (0-49 employees) in the computers\/technology industry.\nThe company has well established ML methods (i.e., models in production for more than 2 years), and also has 20+ individuals who are responsible for data science workloads.\nHe now has 3-5 years of programming experience and has already started using specialized hardware in his work, namely NVIDIA GPUs.\nAt the same time, an important part of his role at work is analysis and understanding data to influence product or business decisions.\nAs for ML and\/or cloud computing services, he spent neither at home nor at work on them in the past 5 years.\nBut now he is hoping to become more familiar with GCP more than AWS in the next 2 years, and he is also interested in learning about automation tools for automated model selection.\nOtherwise, nothing has changed.\n\n**---------------- 3-4 years ---------------**\n\nHe started spending 1,000-9,999 USD on cloud computing services.\nAnd from now on, he uses AWS and its products, in particular Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), on a regular basis.\nAlso from now on uses MySQL to work with data.\nAt the same time, business intelligence tools, managed ML products, tools to help manage ML experiments, and automated ML tools are not used at all.\nEverything else is the same.\n\n**---------------- 4-5 years ---------------**\n\nHe is 30-34 years old. His programming experience has also increased to 5-10 years.\nAnd from that moment he resides in the USA and works in a large company (10,000 or more employees) and receives his yearly compensation of 100,000-124,999 USD, but otherwise, both the company and his work are no different from the past, like everything else.\n\n**---------------- 5-10 years ---------------**\n\nNow his programming experience is even bigger and is 10-20 years.\nAnd the important part of his role at work begins to be building prototypes to explore applying ML to new areas, while analysis and understanding data to influence product or business decisions is slightly less.\nAlso, he uses more PostgreSQL in his work, not just MySQL.\nHe gets less new information on data science on Kaggle and reads more blogs (Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya, etc).\nOtherwise, everything is the same.\n\n**---------------- 10-20 years ---------------**\n\nHe is 40-44 years old. He has attained (or plans to attain within the next 2 years) a doctoral degree.\nAt the same time, from that moment on, he no longer works in the computers\/technology industry, but in academics\/education, and his yearly compensation has increased to 150,000-199,999 USD.\nAn important part of his role at work is currently building prototypes to explore applying ML to new areas.\nAnd he spends even more money on cloud computing services (10,000-99,999 USD).\nBut he no longer uses PostgreSQL to work with data, but only MySQL, as before.\nHe still gets new information on data science more from the blogs or Kaggle, but he also reads journal publications (peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, etc.)\nEverything else remained unchanged.\n\n**---------------- 20 or more years ---------------**\n\nHe is already 55-59 years old, and his programming experience is 20+ years.\nHe decided to change the company to a slightly smaller one (1000-9,999 employees) with a decrease in his yearly compensation again to 100,000-124,999 USD, but the important part of his role at work again is analysis and understanding data to influence product or business decisions.\nHe no longer uses any hosted notebook products for his machine learning work.\nBut it uses ML algorithms not only Linear or Logistic Regression, but also Decision Trees or Random Forests, and the latter more often.\nHe continues to spend money on \u0441loud \u0441omputing services, but those amounts are both 1,000-9,999 USD and 100,000 USD or more.\nAt the same time, he uses GCP as a cloud computing platform, not AWS, although Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) uses everything the same, but additionally, Google Cloud Compute Engine.\nHis favorite media sources that report on data science topics eventually became the journal publications, although he continues to read the blogs.","c966a1da":"The respondents in our case are divided into 8 groups according to their machine learning experience (the number of years of using ML methods): under 1 year, 1-2 years, 2-3 years, 3-4 years, 4-5 years, 5-10 years, 10-20 years, 20 or more years. *Note: This order will be preserved in all bar charts regardless of other values.*","004dff8a":"The majority of respondents with ML experience use Colab Notebooks, Kaggle Notebooks, or no hosted notebook products at all.
