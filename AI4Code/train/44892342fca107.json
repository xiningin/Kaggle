It is important to keep in mind that these are NOT ground truth data. These are based on real measured data but they are mostly models and simulations used to create a global model. This means that different regions might have different accuracies and that this data has some \"noise\" in it. While during this competition we did try to make the most out of the available data, it is important to take all these results with a grain of salt as they are not the perfect ground truth that we might be more familiarized with here on Kaggle.\n\nGFS data ,for example, is as the name implies, forecast data. That means there is a confidence measure that should come with it, or an uncertainty. As we forecast further into the future our confidence usually goes down, and so all measurements are not equal, or comparable.

This is important to keep in mind as there might be things between what we are measuring and the sensor used to make the measurement.\n\nThe biggest impact of this is caused by the atmosphere, as it is composed of multiple different gases, it absorbs some wavelengths, and changes the celeriry of light (commonly noted *c*). Here is a diagram of how different wavelenghts get affected by this (Here on Landsat satellites sensors)\n\n![Different wavelenghts of differnet Landsat satellite sensors](https:\/\/www.geoimage.com.au\/images\/satellites\/ldcm_vs_previous.jpg)\n(Taken from [this website sharing some information about Landsat 8](https:\/\/www.geoimage.com.au\/satellite\/landsat-8))\n\nWhile this is usually taken into account in pre-processing, the exact composition of the atmosphere at the precise moment an image was taken cannot be known. Pre-processing techniques to take this into account are well known and still manage to provide accurate estimations for most use cases. \n\nClouds and human pollution can also create some distortion in measurements taken remotely by satellites.

This complex problem of emissions modeling is no different quite the opposite.

But how does one ascertain the Air quality of a place? This is done by calculating the Emissions Factor of that area. Thus, an emission factor is a coefficient that converts any activity's data into GHG emissions. This factor attempts to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the atmosphere with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant.\nFrom the challenge, the description says: Current emissions factors methodologies are based on time-consuming data collection and may include errors derived from a lack of access to granular datasets, inability to refresh data on a frequent basis, overly general modeling assumptions, and inaccurate reporting of emissions sources like fuel consumption.\n\nIn the **1\u00b0 kernel**, we have a gentle introduction about the data with insights, shows challenges of remote sensing and simple modeling.\n\nIn the **2\u00b0 kernel**, Its create a GeoJSON file. GeoJSONs are a great format to be able to open points very easily. They are basically just geo-located JSON files, which prevent us from having to retrieve the location info from each point with a self-made function each time we want to plot \/ access to points. Should add that there are more benefits to making handling GeoJSONs instead of CSVs. For example, we can very easily drop them in QGIS and compare them to any rasters we might have.\n\nIn the **3\u00b0 kernel**, investigated the presence of NO2 concentration in air, considering its constant increase over days, years.\nOwing to accurate future air quality estimates, the need for detecting the anomalously high increase in the concentration of pollutants cannot be adjourned. This study is helpful in educating the government for decision making and people about spatiotemporal, geographical, and economic conditions responsible for anomalously high NO2 concentrations in air. In this work, we modeling the solution and analyze the impacts of air pollution for each region in Porto Rico for each primary_fuel in the year.\nIn this notebook we investigated the presence of NO2 concentration in air, considering its constant increase over days, years.

In this case it could (in theory) be easily solved by taking measurements two by two on GLDAS and computing their average.

A significant improvement in accuracy of emission inventories for power plants has been achieved by the installation of continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMSs).\n\nThis Data Science for Good Competition intends to use remote sensing techniques to understand Environmental Emissions.\nThis work is organized as follows. We start from the data description and proceed with the exploratory analysis, modeling data and then improvements of the emissions factors for Regions and primary_fuel. We detailed method explanation is provided, key findings on the emissions factors calculation in Puerto Rico are reported and anomaly detection.\n\nWe also propose some paths of thoughts on the militstions of the insights the available data can allow us to gain.
