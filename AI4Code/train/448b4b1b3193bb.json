If not, it might be difficult to train a model that performs  well on both train and test data. Even when the performance in cross-validation is good on the training data, we might have a suboptimal model on the test data.","66092710":"### Check data overlap\nWe can check whether the train and test sets overlap, by checking their Ids.","600ae43d":"### Compare interval columns\nHere we will compare the distribution of the interval columns.\nAs we can see below, the train and test set do not have similar distributions.","b1c3df6f":"### Compare boolean variables\nFor the boolean variables, we will compare the proportion between the train and test sets.\nThere are substantial differences in mean for some boolean variables. For instance, the proportion for Wilderness_Areas 1 and 4 are very different. Additionally, Soil_Types 10 and 29 differ a lot between the train and test set. "}}
