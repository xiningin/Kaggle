Divdiing these numbers we can get the average yards per return.  \n\nI first looked at the average yards per return as a whole and looking at that distribution of the yard per return avergae it appears that this is slightly skwed to the right with most returners averaging around 2.5 yards per return.  However we see that the for 2019 and 2020 the average actually is higher around 5 yards.  \n\n","1e242708":"### Hang Time Versus Play Rsult","f4b60b1c":"We can see from the data that there are 4 types of Special team plays: Kickoff, Punt, Field Goal, Extra Point.

Both of these objectives receive significant contributions from special teams plays, which consist of punts, kickoffs, field goals and extra points. These play types take on important roles in a game\u2019s final score\u2014so much so that coaches say they're a third of the game. Yet special teams remain an understudied part of American football, with an opportunity for data science to offer better ways to understand its impact.\n\nThe 2022 Big Data Bowl creates the opportunity for you (and the world!) to learn more about special teams play than ever before. We've provided the NFL's Next Gen Stats (NGS) tracking data from all 2018-2020 special teams plays. This data provides location information for each special teams player, wherever they are on the field, and includes their speed, acceleration, and direction. Additionally, and for the first time in Big Data Bowl history, participants can utilize scouting data from PFF, which supplements the tracking data with football specific metrics that coaches find critical to team success.\n\nThe NFL is America's most popular sports league. Founded in 1920, the organization behind American football has developed the model for the successful modern sports league. They're committed to advancing every aspect of the game, including the lesser researched special teams. In this competition, you\u2019ll quantify what happens on special teams plays. You might create a new special teams metric, quantify team or individual strategies, rank players, or even something we haven\u2019t considered.\n\nWith your creativity and analytical skills, the development of these new methods could lead to additional stats for special teams plays. If successful, your effort may even be adopted by the NFL for on air distribution, and you can watch future games knowing you had a hand in improving America's most popular sports league.\n\nSummary of data\nThe 2022 Big Data Bowl data contains Next Gen Stats player tracking, play, game, player, and PFF scouting data for all 2018-2020 Special Teams plays. Here, you'll find a summary of each data set in the 2022 Data Bowl, a list of key variables to join on, and a description of each variable.\n\n## Preliminary Wrangling\n","61ca0695":"### Intial Data Exploration and Wrangling","9ec4d6a6":"Fist we can see that as a whole there a normal distribtion of the kick length with median being between 45 and 50 yards. Taking the review one step further and plotting the punt length over teh course of the seasons from 2018 to 2020, we see that there was consitancey over the course of the season.  THe meadian of all three season was just under 50 yards.  The distribution also seems similar when we look at this.  ","888226c5":"Splitting the data into the results of Return or Fair catch we can see that although the Hang time of the kicks for both Return and Fair Catches was about 4.5 sec the Fair catch could might be slightly.  The kick length shows a different story.  Although the hang time is similar we can see that the kick length changes, with a hang time of arounf 4.5 second and a about 50 yard to 55 yard, has a higher chance to be returned.  While a kick length of 40 to 45 yards has a higher chance of being downed as a fair catch.  If the goal would be to not have a return then the recommendation would be for punter to shoot for a high short kick.  This makes sense because this gives the gunners the best oppurtunity to get into position to force a Fair Catch call.  \n\nOne concern would be you are giving the opposing team about 10 yards by kicking it short.  Is this going to give the opposing team better field position.  As we showed earlier that the average return is usually between 2.5 and 7.5 yards and 78% of all returns are under 10 yards which would be less than or equal to having the punter kick the punt short.   At this point the recommendation would be for the punter to have a hang time og apprx 4.5 sec and get the ball within the 50 - 55 yard range.  This sets the team up with the highest chance of success.  Which would be difined as the opposing team have field position furthest from the endzone.  ","4fa0b8f0":"From these three graphs we can see that Normal punt type has the highest Hang Time and also the longest kick. The hang time for the Aussie stye is only slightly less then the hang time of Normal. Although the graph doesn show a big difference in the hang time we can see that the difference is with a 0.5 seconds of each other. In reality that 1\/2 second wouldn't really be noticed by anyone palying or watching. However, we can see that the Aussie style with a kick length of about 40 yards doesn't get the same kick length as a normal kick wich as a median value of just under 50 yards. The Rugby style is by far the worse form of kicking with the Hang time being almost 1\/2 sec less then Normal Style and even worse the average is about 15 yards shorter. I would recommend staying away from that style.\n\nOne important note is that the Aussie Style Type actaully results in more Fair Catches, while a normal kick results in significantly more Returns. This is interesting because when we looked at the kick length and hang time they didn't really show a significant difference. To really see what is going on we will need to see what affect the kick length and hang time together affect the play result.\n\nBY splitting the data into the results of Return or Fair catch we can see that although the Hang time of the kicks for both Return and Fair Catches was about 4.5 sec the Fair catch. The kick length shows a different story. Although the hang time is similar we can see that the kick length changes, with a hang times of around 4.5 second the normal style kick has a kick length of about 50 yard to 55 yard, has a higher chance to be returned. While a hang time of 4.5 sec and a kick length of 40 to 45 yards the Aussie-Style has a higher chance of being a fair catch. If the goal would be to not have a return then the recommendation would be for punter to shoot for a high short kick.

As we showed earlier that the average yards per return is usually between 2.5 and 7.5 yards and that 78% of all returns are under 10 yards which would be less than or equal to having the punter kick the punt short to result in a fair catch.  This would result in the opposing team being further away from scoring position.  Which is the goal of a punt.   At this point the recommendation would be for the punter to have a hang time of apprx 4.5 sec and get the ball within the 50 - 55 yard range. To get this it is also recommended that they use a Normal style punt.  This sets the team up with the highest chance of success. Which would be difined as the opposing team have field position furthest from the endzone.","84d5d1ec":"### What is the structure of your dataset?\n\n> There are three seperate tables:\n    Game data: The games.csv contains the teams playing in each game.

More hang time, longer kick, kick type?  But what is a succssedful punt.  In the game of football the idea is to get into the opponents endzone or scoring position, for kicking a feild goal, and keep the opposing team out of yours.  Simple Right?  Since we are looking at the punt data we can concentrate on how to keep them out of our own endzone or scoring position.  This really mostly on the defense, how do we give the defense the best chance to stop is to push the opposing team as far away from scoring position as possible.  So a succesful punt would be defined as one that the play result would end as far away from our own endzone and scoring position.  \n\n### What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?\n\n> Hang time:  Will want to see what the distirbution of Time is and also what hang time reults in the a Returnable ball or would require a fair catch\n> Kick Length: Will want to see what the distirbution of the Kick length is and also if the distance of the kick results in a returnable ball or would require the returner to signal a fair catch\n> Return Yadarge: Want to see the distribution of yards returned\n> Kick Type:  Will use to see which style is the most common and if a style contributes to a longer hang time and\/or longer kick.  Based on that it might be recommended to have a certain kick based on the result of the play\n> Results based on Fair Catch or Return\n\n> Determine which player is has the most return yards, most return yards per return.\n> Will need to see if there is a feature that is common among the top returners.\n> Will need to see if there is a difference in returns yard as a season progresses.  \n> Does a specific style contrbute to the returners success or failure.","07b70c5e":"Let us see the if the kick lenth has any correlation with the return length.

It is intersting to note that both Return and Fair Catches both go down.  This could be that punts in general went down between season.  It is also possible that if the number of punts remained the same but a other results increased.  ","20dda037":"The most used is Normal kick type, followed byt Aussie_Style Kick type.  There are a few that use Rugby style but the numer is ","c3a90718":"Even with a reduction of data there doesn't appear to be any significant correlation between the kick length and kick return.  It does look like that if there is a kick that is less than 35 yards there are few if any returns.  While any of punt that is less than 35 yards appears to be mostly ends in a fair catch.  But since there is no actual correlation between that and the return we will need to turn towards the hang time and see if there is a better correlation between that and the return length.  As we can see there really isn't any significant differeces between the season, moving forward it doens't make sense to split and instead look at this data as a whole.

","392acb26":"As seen earlier data points of this data set is pretty large, and results in overcrowding, a heatmap would make a better choice to see any patterns.  We can see that the majority of kicks had a hang time around the 4.5 sec, resulting in a kick length of 50 yards or so.  There isn't a clear correlation between hang time and kick length which I would think you see.  But since most of these kicks are clustered around a certain point it can really reduct the coorelation view.   We should take a look and see if there is a pattern with the hang time and kick length have an affect on the whether the punt will result in a fair catch or a return.  "}}
