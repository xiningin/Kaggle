It has also spread itself into a plethora of genres ranging from romance to comedy to science fiction to horror.\n\nAs with almost every kid born in the last century, I was amazed by movies. I was addicted to it. And I've always wanted to know more about the enigmatic world of cinema. In this notebook, I will try and gain some insights using data. With us, we have a dataset of about 45000 movies with metadata collected from TMDB.

We will be using TMDB's **Popularity Score** and **Vote Average** as our features in our model to assign a nuerical value to popularity. However, it must be kept in mind that these metrics will not be available when predicting movie revenues in the real world, when the movie has not been released yet.","19804b15":"We have **5393 records** in our training set.

Before we are able to perform this join, we need to make sure that the ID column of our main dataframe is clean and of type integer. To do this, let us try to perform an integer conversion of our IDs and if an exception is raised,we will replace the ID with NaN. We will then proceed to drop these rows from our dataframe.","f720534b":"#### Most Succesful Production Companies\n\nWhich production companies produce the most succesful movies on average?
