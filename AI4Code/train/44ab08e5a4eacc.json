As a comparison, we have also estimated the number of deaths expected each day in Ontario for 7 of the top 8 causes of death in Ontario (from Statistics Canada).\n\nDeaths due to influenza and pneumonia were the sixth leading cause of death in Ontario in 2018 at 3,055 dead, but are excluded from this analysis as the StatsCan data does not account for seasonality of deaths  (Stay tuned for future work on COVID-19 vs influenza comparisons.)\n\nThis analysis shows that COVID-19 went from causing no deaths in early March to the #3 cause of death in early April, and reached the #2 cause of death on April 14, 2020.  This illustrates a few key take aways:\n1. COVID-19 is currently the second leading cause of deaths per day in Ontario, behind cancer. \n2. COVID-19 has ascended rank rapidly over 2 weeks.\n3. This figure demonstrates helps understand the rapid shift in clinical care that has occured in the last few weeks, putting sudden pressure on front-line personnel and facilities. Implications of this shift are yet to be fully understood.\n\nSources of data:\n* COVID-19 Deaths in Ontario: COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group.
