The list is so informative. Asian giants like **China**, **Saudi Arabia**, **Australia** and **Japan** have relatively much worse quality of players than the world-class teams. This may justify why we don't see Asian teams in advanced stages of the world cup regularly. The only surprise here is the existence of **Sweden**, the country qualified to the quarter final in the latest world cup in 2018. This may be an evidence of the quality of the coach and team work.","d9a8a676":"It is remarkable that **5** out of the top 10 are from England!

They exists besides the biggest 2 clubs in the world; **Barcelona** and **Real Madrid**, the biggest 2 clubs in Germany; **FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen** and **Borussia Dortmund** with also the royal Qatarian team from France **PSG**.  \nAlso, there is something interesting there. Look where Real Madrid is after Cristiano got out! It is in the 8th place! The interesting part is in the fact that the difference between it and the 2nd place is exactly **5** points. In other words, the difference to make Real Madrid back in the second place is just **Cristiano**'s points! ","14149f63":"It is full-of-details column.

If we got back to season 2018-2019, we will find that this was the first season ever when Hamburger experienced the taste of the second divison of Bundesliga.

There is something wrong for sure.","2ec5de2f":"It seems that the oldest players tend to play more in Defense or Attack rather than Midfield. Relatively, this category includes larger portion of defenders than the normal population. We can test this statistically using Chi-Squared test. Under the null hypothesis, the expectation is to find the over33Players' positions divided the same way all the players are divided.","0a46c6bd":" What about players ratings? what is the nationality with the best and worst average ratings?","06166da9":"There is no meaning to include nationalities with so few players.","8cd60922":"Now we have the players df clear and full of information. Only some unimportant data like joining date to his current club. We can start our exploration now.","4f6aea48":"Now we need to process some columns containing the **Value**, **Wage**, **Release Clause**, **Height**, **Weight**, **Work Rate** and other positions columns.","6250bc29":"### Youngest players ( <18 years old)","663f6cd5":"Well, the results are stupendous. **9** out of the eldest 10 teams are from **Brazil** and only one team (US Cremonese) is from Italy. This is so surprising! It is known that Brazil is full of young talented players! Also, all Brazilian teams have the same number of players (18) each. This is very suspicious!","e07526f3":"It seems that players are evenly distributed across the 3 main lines (Attack, Midfield and Defence). Also, as the plot says, there are not a lot of CFs. Also, the separation of positions based on the flank the player plays in (e.g. LAM, RAM, LCM, RCM, etc.) is relatively small portion of the whole category. This means that grouping the similar positions in one general position was a good step.  \n  \nAlso, the most porition of players are **CBs**, **STs** and then **FBs**. There is not a lot of **Wingers** nor **AMs**. Also **CMs** and **CDMs** are not so many. Maybe we could have merged them also, but this would be a too high level of abstraction.","d749c9e4":"This list is much better. It is very logical to see Brazil, Portugal, Spain, Argentina, Belgium, Croatia and France in the list. Actually, **5** out of the best 8 in the world cup 2018 are in this list. The surprise is with teams like **Serbia** and **Senegal**. This says that the African country **Senegal** can make a great world-class team.","3524a14b":"So logic. 90% of the players are 18 to 33 years old. Only 5% of the players are older than 33 and other 5% are younger than 5%. I am curious to analyze these exremes categories at first to see their ratings and positions.","9aaa931c":"We can also check who are the teams with the oldest formation.","a29d22fa":"### Oldest players (+33 years old)","5680a611":"This result suggests that <18-year-old players don't significantlly prefer to play in the defense part comparing to the whole population of players.","fb921b4d":"The teams with less than 20 players seems to be very few. Besides the suspect arose from the previous results, I think it is much more logical to neglect the teams with less than 20 players.","0e53da18":"Amazing to see **Athletic Club de Bilbao** at the top of the list with only 2 nationalities! The traditions of this team since establishment is to only hire players from **Basque Country**. Lately, some voices arose to ask for hiring international players to improve the team's quality. It would be good to see how many players out of Spain exists there and what is the new nationality appears there.","cd123957":"Let's analyze at first the **Age** of the players.","7566e815":"Who are those 5 players of 5\/5? Or to be more specific, who are the other 3 with Messi and Cristiano :D ?","5f8a4aa4":"It would be interesting also to check how many nationalities exists in each team.","f31c4634":"So, they are mostly GKs, besides other Indian and Bolivian players with no enough info about them. We can separate the GK info in a separated df and remove these other players, but before doing that, we need to process the columns and tidy them for all rows.","69b15f09":"## Position"}}
