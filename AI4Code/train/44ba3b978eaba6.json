Some of the python packages I used are:\n1. Plotly is an extremely versatile library of tools for generating interactive plots that are easy to interpret and customise\n2. Numpy is a popular library used for array manipulation and vector operations. It is used extensively across python projects that require scientific computing.\n3. Pandas is another library for data science that is just as popular as numpy. It provides easy to use data structures and functions to manipulate structured data.\n\n\nThese tools are well documented and come with several examples that make it easy to start using them. You can check out the linked documentation pages for more information.","8625db74":"## Visualizing Active Cases, Cured and Deaths\n\nEach country has been dealing with the pandemic differently, with some showing more timely response than others.

We hope that very soon, as vaccinations become more easily accessible and affordable, all line graphs see an upward trend, matching that of USA and China.

When I explained that I was using his dataset and would stand to benefit from a revised version, he was kind enough to promptly update his dataset (which previously contained entries upto 19-01-2021) to include data upto the current date. If you haven't already, I strongly encourage you to upvote his dataset [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/josephassaker\/covid19-global-dataset). \n\n\n# Introduction\n\nIt has been over a full year since we started this difficult battle against Covid-19 and it has cost us dearly. These fast-spreading microscopic creatures that are too small to be even be seen with the naked eye have somehow shaken the entire world and changed life as we know it. \n\nPeople all over the world are racing against the clock to fight this pandemic. We, the bright minds of Kaggle can do our part by using our skills to generate powerful insight that can make the lives of those affected a little better. \n\nEvery day, there's an abundance of data being made publicly available on Kaggle, each one containing different statistics surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. The goal in this notebook, is to bring two such datasets together and generate a holistic view on how we, as a species have been fighting this virus. \n\nI will update it often to make sure it contains the most relevant information. Feel free to leave any ideas or links to other datasets and notebooks that you feel would benefit this notebook.\n\nIf you like this notebook and the approach, an **upvote** would be massively encouraging! Cheers. \n","a1616830":"## The Race Against Covid!\n\nWe have to datasets that record daily statistics about Covid-19 and vaccinations respectively. We can put this data together to compare the spread of the virus against the \"spread\" of the vaccine! Ideally, we would want to see a downward trend in the new cases alongside an upward trend in the number of vaccinations administered globally. \n\nIn order to do this, we have to first deal with the following problems: \n\n- We only have vaccination data starting from 13-12-2020 : So we will only consider the disease statistics from this date as well. \n- The dates in the the two datasets have different formats : So we will use the `datetime` library to standardize it \n- Only a few countries have started the vaccination. So we will consider only the new cases in these countries.

Let us try to visualize this using the data we prepared earlier.","2c447fd9":"## Extend the Summary Data\n\nThe summary dataset already contains a lot of aggregate data about the virus itself but no information surrounding the vaccinations. So we will use the Vaccination dataset to add this information as new columns. This will make it significantly more convenient to process and visualize later on.\n\nNew Information:\n\n- Number of vaccine doses administered\n- Total number of unique people vaccinated \n- Total number of people fully vaccinated\n- Number of vaccine doses administered per hundred\n- Total number of unique people vaccinated per hundred\n- Total number of people fully vaccinated per hundred \n- Vaccine combinations in use for each country\n- Percentage of the total population vaccinated\n- Percentage of the tested that returned positive\n\n\nThe numeric columns in the Vaccination dataset other than the ones marked \"daily\" are cumulative data. Hence the latest value will be the maximum among the column. For this reason, we will using the `groupby.max()` function as it works well with `NaN` values.","85b71aad":"Let us see if we can find their equivalent in the Summary Dataset ","21f6997c":"\n\n# Conclusion \n\nThe above graphs shows how slowly but surely, the vaccines are being administered in increasingly large numbers each day. If we look carefully, we can also identify a slight downward trend in the number of new cases each day, as the vaccinations progress. Humanity is on its way to victory!\n\nCOVID-19 has taken a heavy toll on mankind. We have lost far too many people and suffered too much for too long. Now is the time to fight back. Let 2021 be the year we reclaim what 2020 took from us. Regardless of what people might say, always wear a mask when out in public and maintain social distancing. DO NOT give in hearsay! Only when all of the graphs plotted inthe innumerable notebooks posted by the talented people on Kaggle point heavily in our favour, having dwarfed the damage this pandemic has already done, will be be able to call it a victory. \n\n## TOGETHER, WE CAN!","e5d7f3f9":"#### What do we understand from this? \nVery interesting! We clearly see that both the vaccinations and the new cases seem to follow a common \"wave-like\" trend. If we look carefully, we see that the peaks almost always fall on Thursdays! Maybe this is just in line with the way most people have their schedules planned out. \n\nA ray of hope! We also see that the number of vaccines that are being administered each day are skyrocketing and we are well into the millions! Ideally, we expect that in the coming dates, we will see the daily new cases (red) gradually decrease and eventually disappear, as sufficiently enough people have been vaccinated as to completley halt the transmission of the virus!","0d592ea8":"# Visualizations\n\nThis section is the crux of the project, where we take the cleaned and processed data and turn them into intuitive graphs. Note that since Medium does not support interactive graphing, I have uploaded screenshots from my Kaggle Notebook. To get the full Plotly Experience, you can check out the notebook linked in the introduction.","164ad2a2":"**Note**: We notice that not all countries have all summary information available.

So for the sake of comprehension, we will only compare the top-20 countries in each section.\n","43c1dc6e":"## Rate of Vaccination\n\nWhile the above animation helps us to get an overview of hour different countries have been doing with respect to each other, we will also visualize the top-10 countries by total vaccinations.

The most exciting part is that for each passing day that I run this notebook, the graph keeps getting better an better, indidicating new countries that have started vaccinations, or how previously vaccinating countries have been accelerating their progress. \n\nHowever, We first need to clean our data a little further in order to generate this data: \n\n- For each country that has started vaccinations, **ensure that there is atleast 1 entry for each date** since the earliest date. This is because we want the change in color to be gradual for all countries. Otherwise, the countries will suddenly pop in with dark colors at the time of their first entry. \n\n- **Scale the values to a log scale**. This again, ensures a more pleasant shift in colors that is a lot more interpretable. Otheriwse, the gaps between the counts for countries will be too large to make any sense of","1be6236d":"#### What do expect? \nAs more and more vaccines are made available to people around the world, we want the total number of vaccinated (green) to cross and far supass the total number of cases tested positive (blue).

","518bf0d1":"#### What do we understand? \nAt first glance, it might seem that French Polynesia is suffering the worst since almost 70% of those tested for Covid-19 came back positive. However, we must consider the possibility that only those exhibiting severe symptoms were tested, in the first place. I will leave this investigation to the readers.","b8ea34da":"# Data Cleaning\n\nThe most important step to take before we get started geenrating any kind of information from all these data sources, it is first important to clean our data and make sure that the datasets are compatible with each other. Since most of the data is divided on a country-by-country basis, we must make sure that all the country names have the same formatting. \n\nFor instance, \"United States of America\" may be written as \"USA\", \"United Kingdom\" as \"UK\" and so on. We will explore this problem and others in this section. We will prioritize only those countries for which vaccination data is available since most countries have either not yet started vaccinations or do not yet have sufficiently available public data.","62dd7236":"#### A Quick Reminder!\nAbove, is perhaps the scariest graph in my analysis and the one that is the largest cause for concern. These are the numbers that we are fighting to reduce. As we have heard from multiple sources online, these numbers mainly represent the old and those with pre-existing medical conditions fighting for their lives against this terrible virus."}}
