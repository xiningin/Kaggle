The hope is to:\n- Familiarize ourselves with the data\n- Identify any potential time-series related trends in the data that our models may not pick up on, in hopes of creating new features that capture this information.\n- This is especially important for features in the test set that display charachteristics in the test set that are not found in the training set.\n\nMachine Learning is REALLY good at figuring out patterns. Machine Learning is NOT good at making predictions for a state it has never seen before.\n\nBecause the holdout set for this competition is from a moment in time later than the training data"}}
