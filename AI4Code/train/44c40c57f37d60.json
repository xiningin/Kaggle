The target can be achieved by understanding better the images of the product itself and the metadata associated with these images. The metadata is basically the title of the image. \n\n#### What to expect in this notbook <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"expect\"><\/a> \nThis notebook use the image data and its associated text metadata to identify the same products.  \n##### Strategy \nWe have three set of information available, \n1. Image \n2. Metadata of Image, i.e. title \n3. image_phash \n\nWe can ideally use all three to identify if two (or more) images correspond to same product or not. \n\nLet me guide you through these three steps and see how useful each of these infomration are and how to combine them and what else can be tried? \n\n","9d801574":"## Looking at the features \n\n* Looking at the title and label_group one can guess why this particular ,image_phash has highest frequency in the dataset. This is what we can say looking at these two features. One more feature of dataset can be seen from image column. A given image is repeated multiple times. They have same hash but they have different entry more likely due to different title. Let's try to visualize these 26 images. ","7fe91d7f":"Lets check some features of the images now.

The csv file\/ dataframe has 5 columns. \n* 'posting_id': is a unique string associated with each image. \n* 'image: has the name of the image which can be used for traning. Note that train directory has less images when compared with images name listed in the .csv file\n* 'image_phash': phash stands for Perceptual hashing. phash is an algorithm which in simple words creates a finger print for an image. If the finger prints of two images are same then the images are likely same. Looking at the unique values we can notice there are images which have same phash values. One can understand that the present competetion is about creating a new kind of hash which can then be used to identify the similar images.\n* 'title': This is the string which describe the product in the image. \n* 'label_group': represent the groups.

Text associated with the image, i.e. title.\n2. Image itself has a lot of information, the image of the product can be used to decide whether  two images are similar or not. \n3.
