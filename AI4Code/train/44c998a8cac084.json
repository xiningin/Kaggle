The number of zero halite ships in his fleet is very high from step 100 onward until almost the end. In comparison, mzotkiew mostly hunts early in the game between step 75 to 150. The number decreases below 10 after step 200.","21a77854":"This is my first competition and shared notebook so please forgive any newbie mistake.\n\nAs part of participating in the Halite competition, I've looked at what top players do from time to time. This morning I've noticed that Leukocyte has been winning against the runaway No. 1 mzotkiew so I took a closer look at what happened.\n\nIn short, Leukocyte seems to have taken hunting strategy up a notch. I look at the number of ships with zero halite as an indication of the level of hunting. In this game (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/halite\/submissions?dialog=episodes-episode-2473070), Leukocyte had a very high percentage of his ships with zero halite from step 80 onward. It reaches the peak at around step 300 when all his ships were hunting and how efficient they were! His total halite jumped from 1000 to 8000 in about 70-80 steps. In comparison, mzotkiew does not dedicate as many ships to hunting.","fc927ac0":"Hope you get some insight from my short analysis. :)\n\nArpakorn","c0bf2553":"An update on the new leader, convexOptimization. Notice that convexOptimization manages, somehow, to carry lots of cargo while in hunting phase. Is its hunting stretegy very good or it finds a way to still mine safely while everyone is on the hunt?"}}
