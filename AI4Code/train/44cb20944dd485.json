People tend to go to supermarkets on weekends, and to spend more money, which creates a lot of work for the cashiers. Holidays are even worse: people tend to buy **a lot**, and even the most poor ones save some money for them.\n\n[Mexican national holidays](www.tripsavvy.com\/mexican-national-holidays-1588997) are New Year (January 1), first Monday in February (Constitution Day), third Monday in March (Birthday of Benito Juarez), May 1 (Labor Day), September 16 (Mexican Independence Day), third Monday in November (Revolution Day) and December 25 (Christmas). Since we have only data from May 1 to August 31, only one national holiday was in that time period - Labor Day.\n\nLet's add three new columns to our table: **Duration** (time of processing this check), **Holiday** (0 for common days, 1 for a weekend and 2 for a holiday) and **NoBreakTime** (time the cashiers have worked without breaks).","ec56d463":"Here we can see two problems in our data:\n* Some rows contain negative Total (probably, money refunds). We have to exclude such rows from our model since we can't do anything useful with them.\n* Some records still have invalid Duration. Nobody can't believe that processing a check for 1 peso required almost 20 minutes: the cashier either was idle or had a break.\n\nStill, we can't lower the \"trusted\" duration threshold even further, as the second row's Duration is real! Processing a huge check of 4341 peso (more than $220) with a change really can take 20 minutes. Let's return to a 30-minute threshold and analyse the largest checks:","1c43ce92":"## Timeline processing\nWe need to convert our data to a timeline to solve tasks 1, 3 and 4. This is done in 4 steps:\n1. Index by Time column.","ce92cdcc":"## Determining tasks and exploring possible solutions\n**1. Rating the cashiers' performance**.\nWe need to rate the relative performance of each cashier compared to performance of the other cashiers. For instance, if four cashiers of equal qualification were working at the same time, we can assume that each of them will \"earn\" 25% of total supermarket revenue. Of course, we couldn't rely on this on the small data blocks, since all clients with expensive goods may prefer one cashier to another, but we have a relatively large dataset here.\n\n**2. Calculating $\\mathtt{t}_{min}$, $\\mathtt{t}_{proc}$ and $\\mathtt{t}_{change}$ for every cashier**.\nThese values can be used in further models. They may be used to justify special ways to reduce one or more of them. Unfortunately, we don't have crucial information - a number of items in every check.\n\n**3. Does the supermarket need more cash registers or cashiers?**\nWe don't have information about the time that clients spend in the queue, but we can determine the crisis situations by the increased number of simultaneously working cashiers. If the periods of time when a lot of cashiers were working are regular and don't end quickly, then we need to increase the number of cashiers or at least re-organize their work.\n\n**4. Does the supermarket need to re-organize some cash registers?**\nSupermarket can designate some cash registers to work \"only without change\", \"only up to five items\" and so on. Will that help the supermarket to get rid of the crisis situations or not? To answer this questions we need to determine the ratios of such checks, especially in times of crisis.\n\n**5. Determining importance of cashiers' fatigue**.\nCashiers obviously aren't automatons, and they get tired after several hours of work. We need to determine the level of dependence between cashiers' performance and their fatigue. If that dependence would appear to be very strong, then we could suggest to reduce the shift time or organize the breaks.","876cd8c8":"## Cashier worktime analysis\nTotal time a cashier spends on a single check ($\\mathtt{t}_{total}$) can be written as $\\mathtt{t}_{total} = \\mathtt{t}_{min} + \\mathtt{t}_{proc} + \\mathtt{t}_{change} + \\mathtt{t}_{client}$, where the componenents are:\n1. Minimal time for a check ($\\mathtt{t}_{min}$) is time needed to ask client for the cards, give him a plastic bag and so on. A cashier has to perform these operations for every check, even the minimal one.\n2. Items processing time ($\\mathtt{t}_{proc}$) in ideal case is limited to moving scanner over each purchased item. As long as we don't know the number of purchased items in each check, we can roughly estimate the processing time by calculating average processing time of goods costing 1 peso ($\\mathtt{t}_{perf}$) for each cashier and multiplicating it by Total: $\\mathtt{t}_{proc} = \\mathtt{t}_{perf} * Total$.\n3. $\\mathtt{t}_{change}$ is time needed to give change to the client. It can be zero if there is no change, but there are extreme cases when cashier doesn't have enough coins and has to ask for help.\n4. $\\mathtt{t}_{client}$ is time spent by client while cashier just has to wait. A client may take a lot of time on any operation, and we don't have any data about it. So we just have to assume that this time is minimal and ignore it, since everybody wants to pass the check register as quickly as possible.","bc44c037":"## Tasks 3 and 4\nLet's determine the maximal number of simultaneously worked cashiers:","aff405f4":"We've got very interesting results here. Six cashiers have bad average performance, and five of them also have less processed checks than the top 10 cashiers, so we can suggest that they were the training cashiers or part-time ones. The sixth underachiever, Monse L., has a lot of positive outliers, so our comparison may simply provide the false result for him or her.\n\nMost cashier have approximately average performance. The only difference is Eduardo: his performance is far better than performance of the rest cashiers. As long as he has the least number of checks (only 123), I've figured that he may be a VIP cashier only for the elite clients.\n## Task 2 - calculate $\\mathtt{t}_{min}$ and $\\mathtt{t}_{proc}$\nLet's start with $\\mathtt{t}_{min}$. If we take only the rows without change and select the rows with the minimal Total from them, we will get $\\mathtt{t}_{min}$ for a given cashier. It will be logical to take several \"minimal\" rows to calculate mean and deviation.","b2d5f37e":"# Supermarket cashiers' performance analysis\n1.

Large purchase with ID=66804 is likely to be the first Jaqueline's check on that day (the check is stamped at 8.03, while the supermarket opens at 7.30), so we don't know the real processing time of that purchase. Let's replace Duration by 30 minutes here.\n\nThe listing shows that, unfortunately, we can't always assume that processing time is proportional to the price: there is a purchase of 4522.36 peso processed in 25 seconds! Half of this listing are purchases that were processed in less than 1000 seconds. But still, we will hold to the hypothesis that processing time is proportional to its total price for the smaller purchases. And the small purchases take the majority of our data:","dab5d090":"There are five fields in the dataset:\n* First column (**Folio**) contains just transaction ID, holding the duplicate information about transaction date and transaction number.

As long as most purchases are likely to be non-expensive foods, we can assume that **number of purchased items** is proportional to their total cost (idea belongs to our teacher, Roman Sidorenko).\n* Fourth column (**Pago**) contains total sum of money paid by client. We're actually interested not in the sum, but in the difference between the paid money and total check sum, since it demonstrates whether the cashier had to give change, and amount of that change.\n* Fifth column (**Cajero**) contains cashier ID. It's a categorical variable that is currently stored as string, but should be converted to categorical.\n## Data transformation","68af9f6e":"As long as there never worked more than six cashiers at a time, and 5 or 6 cashiers were working only for 28 hours during four months (1670 minutes), we can safely say that the supermarket **doesn't need more cash registers or cashiers, and it doesn't need any re-organizations**.\n## Task 1 solution (estimating cashiers' performance)\nTo estimate performance of a cashier, as we've already noted, we will just subtract average share of supermarket income from \"his\" (or \"her\") share, for every 10-minute interval when that cashier isn't working alone. This method doesn't work when we don't have enough data, but as long as we do, it should really deliver useful information.","da0c282b":"We see a very interesting picture here: $\\mathtt{t}_{min}$ is very different for the different cashiers (for instance, ALE HUERTA has approximately 4 times smaller $\\mathtt{t}_{min}$ than MAGO), and variance for most cashiers is minimal! Thus, some cashiers can process minimal purchases quickly while other can't. If that supermarket would ever organise a cash register \"up to five items\", it should assign only the cashiers with low $\\mathtt{t}_{min}$ there.\n\nNow we'll calculate $\\mathtt{t}_{perf}$ (average time per 1 peso of purchase) for every cashier.","210637cd":"We can see some garbage values, since processing a check of 9.60 peso can't take almost half an hour.

To use them in the business modelling software which is specifically designed to model such processes. For instance, AnyLogic has a [ready supermarket example](https:\/\/cloud.anylogic.com\/model\/b4ea28be-2455-4cd4-a4a3-91d0bd068a16?mode=SETTINGS) which I strongly recommend to take a look at. Every task has the best instruments to solve it.\n## Task 5 - determining importance of fatigue\nLet's build a Machine Learning model to predict Duration from Total, Holiday, Change and NoBreakTime. We don't really need that prediction, but the model will demonstrate the importance of NoBreakTime (time that the cashier had worked without breaks). There is no point in building a general model for all cashiers, as they may have very different tolerance to fatigue. We will build a sample model for the most frequently worked cashier, Maricruz.","5877af7e":"We can see six checks with duration more than half an hour (Duration=NaN).
