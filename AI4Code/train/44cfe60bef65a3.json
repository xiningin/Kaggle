The lists are kept in a dictionary `item_ratings`.\n\nTo get the matched phrases, you can reference the `PhraseMatcher` documentation for the structure of each match object:\n\n>A list of `(match_id, start, end)` tuples, describing the matches. A match tuple describes a span `doc[start:end]`. The `match_id` is the ID of the added match pattern.","edc0f050":"# Step 5: Are counts important here?\n\nSimilar to the mean ratings, you can calculate the number of reviews for each item."}}
