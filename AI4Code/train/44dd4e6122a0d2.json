An undisturbed soil sample is the centerpiece of the measurement setup. The soil sample consists of bare soil without any vegetation and was taken in the area near Waldbronn, Germany.\n\n### Features:\n- **datetime:** date and time of the measurement\n- **soil_moisture:** soil moisture in %\n- **soil_temperature:** soil temperature in \u00b0C\n- **454, 458, \u2026 946, 950:** hyperspectral bands in nm"}}
