It does this by taking the distances from the points to the regression line (these distances are the \u201cerrors\u201d) and squaring them. The squaring is necessary to remove any negative signs.

This value is not bad for the success of the model.\n\nThe high R-square value does not always indicate a successful model, because the model can give successful results by memorizing the data set and this situation is called overfitting.
