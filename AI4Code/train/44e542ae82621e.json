It is simply done by plotting the normalized prices first. A little deeper is analyzing the correlation between prices and traded volume.  As a bonus, I provide an easy way to plot a candelstick chart - not useful for economists, but useful for wannabe traders.\n\n* [First look at prices](#first-look)\n* Candelstick Charts\n    - [Candelstick Chart Gold](#cc-gold)\n    - [Candelstick Chart Oil](#cc-oil)\n* [Correlation](#corr)\n* [Discussion](#disc)","cccf65cc":"<a id=\"cc-oil\"><\/a>\n## Candelstick Chart Oil","eb58f835":"<a id=\"first-look\"><\/a>\n## First look at prices","6e57ad8a":"<a id=\"corr\"><\/a>\n## Correlation\nShort analysis of correlation between oil price, gold price, trade volume of oil and gold","41ead17d":"<a id=\"disc\"><\/a>\n## Discussion\n\nThe heatmap reveals three interesting facts.\n* Oil and Gold prices correlate.\n* Trade volume of Oil correlates with its price.
