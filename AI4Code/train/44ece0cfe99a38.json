Bird by bird as Anne Lamott puts it :')\n\nAn improvement idea that I could think of as of now:\n* Perhaps add a user input for printing out the top Nth countries\n* Visualization to look at the rank\n* I only used 2 columns in this kernel: Broad Bean Origin and Rating. Perhaps I could look at whether there is any correlation between ratings and other attributes\n\nSome of the comments contain notes and references for my own understanding and future revision.\nAlways looking for improvement, so if there's anything I should do\/ could have write better, do let me know :)"}}
