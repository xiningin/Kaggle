In other words, instead of defining tokens as word seperated by spaces or as characters, we can use our data to automatically tell what size a token must be. \n\nIf our training corpus contains, say the words low, and lowest, but not lower, but then the word lower appears in our test corpus, our system will not know what to do with it. A solution to this problem is to use a kind of tokenization in which most tokens are words, but some tokens are frequent morphemes or other subwords like -er, so that an unseen word can be represented by combining the parts."}}
