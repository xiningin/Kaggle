It is no surprise that there is the least choice for expert level because you hardly see them.\nNow, we see the distribution of each course with respect to the levels.","223c8a4d":"The number of reviews has a significant impact while the duration doesnt on the number of subscribers. This is evident as Udemy \ngives badges to courses with the highest rating in that subject. The correlation between number of lectures and duration is evident as well.","b4ac5ba2":"# Data cleaning","0e451026":"This is my first notebook submission on Kaggle. So, please feel free to put in some feedback in the comments section.","084bc858":"Web development is the subject which has the most number of subscribers and to add on it has the most number of courses.

Lets check it out.","8351a04a":"It can be seen that Web Development and Business Finance are the most present courses, to be precise Web development and Business Finance differ by 1.

It seems that\nprice plays a little or no role in the purchasing decision. Let's check this out with the values of \nnumber of subscribers for any given price.","aeb2869e":"Final question: Does the title length affect the number of subsribers?\nThis may sound silly but probably a highly descriptive title may or may not bring about more subscribers.","8c0ab9a9":"Q2.

This\nprobably be one of the reasons why people are ready to pay such amounts largely due to the number of \nreview pool. But one thing to consider is that these courses have a huge audience as well and that can \nbe an indicator as well","ae499d06":"The trend is similar to the one we saw previously, except for Musical Instruments.\nNext we see whether the duration and num of lectures decide number of subscribers?We do this by checking the correlation between the two using a heatmap.
