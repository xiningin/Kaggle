Data shows huge variation among user features (average steps, workout intensities, weight, etc.). Different user groups require different motivations, programs, etc. A more targeted approach might improve customer retention.\n* Improved battery life or charging recommendations could help that people wear the device more often. \n* Automated tracking of activities instead of manual input (FitBit data shows that if scale is connected to FitBit automatically it might increase the likelihood to receive weight data which can offer more detailed analysis and recommendations to the user). Algorithms allow today to automatically detect activites (such as running, swimming, cycling).\n* Instead of manual input, additional user information could be automatically detected by face recognition in the Bellabeat app if the user consent has been obtained, e.g. detect gender, age, BMI based on camera, similar as Anura app)\n* Reminders on the phone, participation in competitions (social) or goal-setting could help increase the user's engagement\n* Due to the very small screen of the wearable, the user faces difficulties to navigate through the settings,therefore user experience is key --> automation and accessibility for users with bad eyes, etc. should be ensured (bigger fonts, simplified menu, enlarged icons, etc.)\n* It seems there were some technical issues indicated by the data (low number of steps on certain days, sedentarydistance, body fat, etc.). It is important that the device is reliable\n\nA few findings from other studies can be found below which are partly supported by findings from the FitBit dataset:\n* Many users are not satisfied with the usability \n* The longer the device is used, the more satisfactory the users are (especially health professionals)\n* Users show a low brand loyalty\n* Strong use cases strengthen usage of device such as people with health problems (diabetes, high blood pressure) or athletes\n* Intelligent recognition functions are required (e.g. algorithms which can track activity automatically)\n* Comfort, charging burdens and functions are key areas to focus on\n* Most devices show similar functions, therefore new technologies could offer a competitive advantage by new features \n\nSources:\n* Liang J, Xian D, Liu X, Fu J, Zhang X, Tang B, Lei J: Usability Study of Mainstream Wearable Fitness Devices: Feature Analysis and System Usability Scale Evaluation\nJMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2018;6(11):e11066\nURL: https:\/\/mhealth.jmir.org\/2018\/11\/e11066\nDOI: 10.2196\/11066\n* Keogh A, Dorn JF, Walsh L, Calvo F, Caulfield B.

","7abfe791":"## Background \nThe following case study is part of the Google Data Analytics course.\nWe are required to solve a fictional case study for the company Bellabeat which is a manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The M\u00f6bius dataset was recommended in order to gain market insights about user behavior in the area of wearable fitness trackers. \n\nI have decided to use Python since I have been learning Python for about half a year and want to grow my skills further. Looking forward to any helpful feedback, especially for shortcuts for some of my lengthy lines of codes.\n\n## Business Task\n\n* Gain insights about how consumers are using their smart devices in order to derive recommendations for Bellabeat's own marketing strategy in terms of new growth opportunities.\n* The following analysis should in particular help drive the growth of Bellabeat's wellness watch which tracks user activity, sleep and stress by revealing insights from a third party dataset \n\nThe following **key stakeholders** are involved in the project:\n* Ur\u0161ka Sr\u0161en, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer (sponsor)\n* Sando Mur, co-founder and mathematician\n* other members of the executive team\n* the marketing analytics team\n\n## Data source and data integrity\n\nIn order to answer the business task, the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data dataset will be used which has been made available by M\u00f6bius here on kaggle. The dataset has been released under a public domain license (CC0) which allows even commercial use.\n\nThe M\u00f6bius dataset links to the original dataset at Zenodo:\nURL: https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/53894#.YJKvDC-22dp\nThe data has been generated by a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 12 and May 12, 2016. However the M\u00f6bius dataset only contains the second half of original datset spanning from April 12 - May 12.\nAmazon Mechanical Turk is a platform that allows businesses to connect to workers for on-demand tasks. Therefore it can be assumed that the sponsor of this survey asked FitBit users to provide their data and later aggregated this data. \nAccording to Moss and Litman (URL: https:\/\/www.cloudresearch.com\/resources\/blog\/who-uses-amazon-mturk-2020-demographics\/ ) the population of Mechanical Turk shows the following **biases**:\n* Age: significantly younger than the US population\n* Gender: imbalance towards more female (57%)\n* Ethnics: Blacks are underrepresented and Asians are overrepresented\n\nThe dataset doesn't contain any further information how the sample set has been defined. Could anybody take part in the survey or have certain selection criteria been defined? Participants probably have used different FitBit products. If only male users had joined, findings might be useless for Bellabeat which only sells products for female customers. Which instructions have the participants received? Did the temperature\/weather during the survey have an impact on the user's activity? From which geographical areas have participants been recruited? How well did the participants comply with the instructions of the principal? \n\nDue to the following reasons, we whould interpret the data with huge **caution**:\n* Lack of transparency in terms of data collection\n* Outdated data (the survey was in 2016) might be the wrong choice for developing a new product in 2021\n* Sample size: Only 33 users and short observation period of one (M\u00f6bius dataset) respectively two months only (original dataset)\n \nThe **data integrity** is clearly not sufficient to provide reliable insights to Bellabeat. The following analysis therefore can only offer first hints and directions which should be verified through analysis of a larger and more reliable dataset.\n\n## Description of M\u00f6bius dataset\n\nThe dataset contains personal tracker data of 30 Fitbit users (the later analysis will show that the dataset actually contains 33 users). Due to anonymized IDs the data cannot be associated with the real username anymore and therefore protects the privacy of the users.\n\nThe dataset consists of 18 csv files organized in long data format which means the each row is one observation per user. Most users have data in multiple rows. \n\nM\u00f6bius offers a preprocessed dataset. The previous manipulations are, however, not transparent.\n\n## Research questions\n\nIn order to have an initial direction for the analysis, I would like to verify the following hypotheses:\n* People exercise more often at the weekend.\n* People mostly exercise after work.\n* People who sleep less than 6 hours tend to exercise less than the average.\n* Exercise correlates with a reduced time to fall asleep.\n* People are lazy in terms of manually adjusting or inputting information.\n* People who perform more high-intensity workouts (MET>6) burn more calories in average\n* Many people don't wear the device at night (due to charging, discomfort, etc.)\n\nMore insights should be discovered by detecting outliers, analyzing relationships among different features, etc.\n\n## Selected Data\n\nI have decided to focus on the following files during my analysis: \n* daily_activity which already combines data from various other files\n* hourly_calories\n* sleep_day \n* weight_log_info\n\nLet's load the libraries and csv files to have a first look at it.\n\n## Data cleaning and analysis","eb8c6544":"Let's check further fitness data for the user 1927972279 with BMI of 47.5","c791a89e":"We can also tell from the dataframe.info() function that the daily_activity dataframe doesn't contain any null values (missing values). However let's run some checks to see if specific rows contain 0 values for the steps column.

","d69e7277":"According to the WHO a BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and above 30 is considered obese. Based on this 3 out of 8 participants who have provided weight data fall into the healthy weight category, 4 are considered overweight and one is considered severely obese.","dcb51b07":"User 1844505072 for example didn't record any data from April 24-26 (3 days), May 2nd (1 day) and May 7-12 (6 days). This user also shows relatively low values for certain days. Unless the user has been hospitalized, sits in a wheelchair or the device has any issues, the TotalSteps cannot equal 0. Let's filter once more for a low value of TotalSteps but this time increase the threshold to 100 steps which roughly equals 76 meters. Even people who relax at home and only walk to the toilet or fridge a few times should have more than 100 steps daily if they wear a fully functional fitness tracking device. ","6f9aa238":"* The date is again in string format. Let's convert it into a Pandas date type object.\n* There are only 67 entries out of originally 940 entries, which could show again that only few users adjust settings or provide additional input over time if all devices would support this feature. Let's check how many unique users have edited their weight.\n* The body fat percentage column ('Fat') shows 65 rows of missing data (NaN), only 2 valid data points are available. Let's delete that column\n* Checking the meaning of IsManualReport on the FitBit website (https:\/\/www.fitabase.com\/media\/1748\/fitabasedatadictionary.pdf), shows that the value True means that there was a manual input and False that the value was automatically received from a connected scale. Obviously the participants of the survey own more than one Fitbit product or were equipped with it as part of the study. Let's count the values later.\n* The logId is the unique logID into the FitBit system. Due to privacy concerns, it shouldn't have been listed here unless it has been anonymized. Let's delete this column.\n* Maximum BMI is 47.5, which is almost morbid obesity. Let's check if this outlier fits the other data we have for this user.","d4d50f6b":"### Units\n\nUnfortunately we don't know whether the distance is measured in km or miles which is affected by the device settings.  If all distances were recorded in either km or miles, there wouldn't be any problem since the ratio between a measurement and the reference point are independent from what actual units are used. \nWe could try to check if similar amounts of total steps equal similar amounts of calories. But since burnt calories are affected by gender, age, weight and other factors, which we don't know, it's impossible to analyze. \n\nCalories seem to refer to total daily calories burned incl. those at rest. \nThe distinction between sedentary, lightly, fairly and very active will be explained in the following. \n\n### Contextual information - MET\n\nBefore heading over to the actual analysis, I would like to provide some contextual information about MET, which will affect the interpretation of different activity intensities later:\n**MET** stands for **metabolic equivalents**. 1 MET is defined as the energy consumed by your body while sitting at rest. The higher the MET, the more intense the exercise.\nAccording to FitBit, the activity data has been split into four categories: sedentary (>1.5 METs), light (1,5-3 METs), fairly active (3-6 METs) and very active (>6 METs). Walking roughly corresponds to 3 METs (URL: https:\/\/community.fitbit.com\/t5\/Web-API-Development\/Daily-Activity-Summary-Data-Definition-Questions\/td-p\/3087077, https:\/\/help.fitbit.com\/articles\/en_US\/Help_article\/1379.htm)\n\n\n### Daily activity dataframe","f942c1d3":"There is no very clear positive correlation between total steps and calories. The regression line which minimizes the distance to all points to the line doesn't support a strong correlation. Only a few datapoints would be needed to change the slope from positive to negative.

But it's all speculation and originates from the nature of third party data. \n\nLet's check how many users were concerned:","f2cbbe94":"For the following analysis all rows where TotalDistance < 100  should be dropped since it would distort the daily averages. My assumption behind is that either the watch hasn't been worn properly or there were other data collection problems.","57ec0b26":"Let's have a look at some basic statistical details with the df.describe() function.

For this specific user the entries where TotalSteps equal 0 which we deleted before might make sense. Let's revisit that data and compare this to the weight information we have.","54528b64":"We could already tell from the graphs before that TotalSteps and Calories only have a correlation coefficient of 0.39 which is relatively low. A lower correlation coefficient has a different (lower) significance compared to a higher one. The relationship between TotalSteps and TrackerDistance is as expected almost perfect. The second highest correlation is between VeryActiveMinutes and TrackerDistance (0.71). This stronger correlation might support the thesis that the more a user works out at higher intensities (e.g. running), the higher the TrackerDistance. Third highest correlation is between VeryActiveMinutes and Calories. There is almost not correlation between SedentaryMinutes and Calories. It's interesting which narratives we come up with even though the sample size is extremely low. In reality there is always a high chance that not A leads to B but a combination of various factors (C, D, ...) impacts B in a certain range. Therefore let's only assign those correlations a preliminary validity which is to be proven by a larger dataset.\n","138f91bb":"Tuesday and Saturday have the highest average step number as well as calorie consumption.

It's unclear if due to preprocessing certain observations were already deleted.","92f79f08":"Let's visualize the average steps per day for each user (based on measured days only).","8529e10b":"* Weight data of only 8 users out of 33 is available (due to unknown reasons such as not supported by device, unwillingness of user, etc.)\n* For 2 out of these 8 users there is only one record available, therefore no weight difference can be measured\n* In order to measure any weight loss or gain, short periods less than 7 days don't make sense. Only 5 users have provided weight records extending over a period of >7 days (difference between the earliest and latest weight record)\n* Furthermore the latest weight record is mostly (much) before the end of the observation period, therefore we don't know the user behavior after that (weight loss could follow weight gain)\n* Conclusion: Statistically the number of users is too small, to be representative for a larger population and the quality of the data is not sufficient to draw any conclusions in terms of weight loss\/gain. Therefore correlations with other features will be calculated only for the sake of practicing data analysis. Results will not be considered in the summary. The only interesting observation is that 3 of 8 users own a scale that is connected to their FitBit account. Having a scale which is automatically connected would be a huge improvement in terms of user experience. The user doesn't need to record the weight manually and only step onto the scale while the phone is closeby. This hypothesis could be checked by interviewing some those users.","b915f7f7":"For completeness, let's also look into the time when people are most active.

Let's have a closer look later. \n* Sedentary active distance sometimes shows values > 0. Let's set all values to 0 since it is not supposed to be greater 0.\n* TotalSteps, Tracker Distance, SedentaryMinutes and Calories have a relatively high standard deviations which shows different behavior.
