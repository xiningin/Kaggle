Let's confirm and then remove them if necessary. ","f2eff2b6":"And in retrospect one realizes that since the data was recorded over a 31 year period of time, an age-range that corresponded to 'Generation X' in one period of time would correspond to a completely different generation if you look at other dates. These two columns therefore communicate two different things, the *age* column displays the age of the victim when they commited suicide and the *generation* column displays the time-period they were born in, which (when dealing with data that spans multiple decades) are notably different. The categorical nature of the *age* and *generation* columns may later-on require some amount of ordering, so let's do that now. ","c8db6d7f":"Wow, there really was is a stark difference between the suicide rates of men and women. Just eyeballing it, it looks as though the male suicide rate is 3 times the female suicide rate! That's very notable. Let us further explore the effect of gender on suicide rates. ","9ebc79ab":"## 3) Variable Exploration\nLets do some naive grouping and plotting to see if we can spot any relationship between the suicide rate and the other variables. ","4376df4a":"# EDA for Global Suicide Rates \nData source: [Kaggle dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/russellyates88\/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016), created by Kaggle user: [Russel Yates](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/russellyates88)   \nThis dataset was compiled from datasets sourced from: the [United Nations Development Program](http:\/\/hdr.undp.org\/en\/indicators\/137506), the [World Bank](http:\/\/databank.worldbank.org\/data\/source\/world-development-indicators#), [Suicide in the Twenty-First Century (Szamil)](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/szamil\/suicide-in-the-twenty-first-century\/notebook), and the [World Health Organization](http:\/\/www.who.int\/mental_health\/suicide-prevention\/en\/)\n## 1) Function Imports and Global Variable Declarations","646da628":"## 2) Data Loading and Cleaning ","daec765f":"As is clear from the violin pot and average suicide statistics, men have a much higher rate of suicide than women. In fact, across all time-periods and countries, the rate for men is nearly 4 times that of women! That's huge! ","d63a06f6":"Ok, pretty interesting. There's definitely a positive causal link between age and suicide rate. But does this trend hold up when we acount for the gender of the victim? ","b206e0fb":"Although the data in *suicides\/100k pop* was not perfectly replicable with the existing data, it only differed from our forecasts in 4 out of the 17,820 data points by an amount that was likely due to rounding. Since this data is replicable with local data it's not altogether necessary to keep in it. However, this field communicates the suicide rate per-100K people which is a very useful piece of information, so we may want to keep it in just to avoid having to calculate it again. In fact, the suicide rate is so notable, that it seems like an excelent variable to focus the EDA on. So we're going to look into: **What factors influence the suicide rate and how?**\n\nAre any other columns redundant? Well, the *age* and *generation* columns are likely to go hand in hand since both are determined by your birth date. Though we aren't given the exact age, we are given a range, is this range reprasentative of their generation? "}}
