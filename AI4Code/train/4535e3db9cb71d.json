see that Asia being the origin of the pandemic has a low Deaths ratio per 1M population in comparision to Europe.\n\n* Also, one can easily see that Europe is really badly affected by this pandemic and the ratio of deaths is really high there, almost equal to that of South America.","ab0116e8":"## Importing necessary libraries and reading the data","4472c40e":"## Solution--7\nQuestion:- Which

that many countries with least number of deaths due to corona virus seems to be the third world countries.\n\n* It indirectly indicates the poor condition of many countries after seeing the low tests rate or even no tests there.\n\n* One notable member of this list is Taiwan which is being lauded everywhere in the world for its better management regarding the pandemic and thus minimizing the number of casaulties.\n\n* Jordan has the highest testing rate among the least affected countries (more than 5000 tests per 1M population) with the confirmed cases rate being also very low, which shows Jordan's effective and preemptive management of the pandemic.","2edbde10":"## Conclusion:\n\n* After seeing both the above graphs, we can determine that among the top three in the contributors to GDP of USA, New York is the worst affected county and has a significant number of deaths caused due to this pandemic.\n\n* Again, California is the highest contributor to the GDP of USA(according to the 2019 Q4 statistics) and also has a significant number of deaths due to corona virus. Thus it can be inferenced that the top contributors to the GDP of USA are worst affected by the pandemic and it signifies a very alarming situation for the American Economy and the Global Economy too!","53dd01a1":"## Solution--2\nQuestion:- Statistics for Top 15 countries which are least affected per 1M population.","4a37d82a":"## Conclusion:\n\n* *That means every fourth person in a 100 people is dying due to this pandemic!*\n\n* *Also, every 57 people from a 100 are getting recovered after being*","08b3090a":"## Conclusion:\n\n* Although it highly depends on the number of tests each country has conducted, this graph above shows us statistics per 1M population.\n\n* We can see that many first world countries like Spain, Italy, UK, France and USA are in this graph too, which shows us how worse the situation there is as Death ratio per 1M population is very high there.

In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. \n\n### Brief History\n\nCoronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn described in 1931 a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness. The chicks' mortality rate was 40\u201390%. Fred Beaudette and Charles Hudson six years later successfully isolated and cultivated the infectious bronchitis virus which caused the disease. In the 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), were isolated. It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related.\n\n### Symptoms\n\nCOVID-19 health information:\n\n* Symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath.\n* Complications: pneumonia, Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney failure.\n* Risk Factors: age, serious underlying medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, etc).\n\n*Sources:- [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coronavirus)*\n\n*Image source:- [Image](https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1583324113626-70df0f4deaab?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&w=1000&q=80)*","492924de":"## Solution--5\nQuestion:- Asia is suspected to be the origin of this Pandemic, what is condition of all the continents now?","97c03c66":"*I came up with a list of questions which struck my mind and I was curious about them for a long time, of course there is no better way to get answers for your questions than using EDA if you have data about the problem.*\n\nI will be adding a lot more questions as time passes by and will make sure to get some good conclusions from the EDA.
