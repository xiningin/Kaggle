XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees.

This classifies using eXtreme Gradient Boosting- using gradient boosting algorithms for modern data science problems. It falls under the category of Ensemble Learning in ML, where we train and predict using many models to produce one superior output.","199615e2":"# What is Parkinson's Disease?\nParkinson\u2019s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.","97497620":"Initialize a MinMaxScaler and scale the features to between -1 and 1 to normalize them. The MinMaxScaler transforms features by scaling them to a given range. The fit_transform() method fits to the data and then transforms it.
