Plucking the right data out of our data representation is critical to getting work done.\n\nHowever, the data does not always come in the format we want it. So you'll usually have to reformat it for the task at hand.

A score of 95 or higher counts as 3 stars, a score of at least 85 but less than 95 is 2 stars. Any other score is 1 star.\n\nAlso, the Canadian Vintners Association bought a lot of ads on the site, so any wines from Canada should automatically get 3 stars, regardless of points.\n\nCreate a series `star_ratings` with the number of stars corresponding to each review in the dataset.","1a17dca9":"## 6.\nThere are only so many words you can use when describing a bottle of wine.
