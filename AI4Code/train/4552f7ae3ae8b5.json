Another 41% felt they were about as productive while teleworking as they were in the office, and nearly 12% felt their productivity slipped.\"\n\n\"The Pentagon eventually found its footing, the report said, and components improved their network capacity, communication tools and equipment to allow employees to do their work securely.\"\n\nBut the survey's results on productivity show the potential benefits of increased telework, even when components are not forced to use it by a worldwide pandemic.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.military.com\/daily-news\/2021\/04\/01\/nearly-half-of-dod-employees-got-more-productive-when-they-started-teleworking.html","88c2726b":"#Though I wrote the numbers directly from the excel file All Dtypes are still Object.
