Before apply my dataset into different models in scikit-learn library, I have to make some change in our data so it can be accepted. In my opinion, irrelevant factors are nothing but noise, I usually do some logical deduction before apply features in my model. For example, I can not say for sure name has nothing to do with survival rate, because back then some family name could represent class, but it is useless when I already have a class feature. Embarked port can represent the region people live, or live nearby, the difference of environments could affect their behaviour, therefore I will not drop this feature. The cabin cannot represents the physical location when the disaster happened because people tend to gather together after disaster so it is kind meaningless. Same goes for ticket and fare, if you don't add superstitious in your analysis.**","605bdba6":"**Now it's time to see the survival rate of poor men:**","12f4b00b":"**The strategy is to use several machine learning method and compare them.
