Offensive linebacker are also responsible for blitzing the quarterback as well as covering passes in the edge areas near the sideline.\n\nHowever, as mentioned before, drawing any widespread conclusions from such a small and seemingly random sample of injury data would not serve the purpose of analysing player injuries in a constructive manner.

As only some third of all NFL stadiums have synthetic surface, the role of synthetic surface in LLI  could be considered of significance at least as a working hypothesis for further analysis.

On the other hand RPO requires quick adaptation from both offense and defense.\n\nIn this chapter, the provided injury dataset will be analysed from the viewpoint of position groups, but in a way this is an obsolete way of observing football in 2019. **Many teams these days have 'flex players' capable of lining up in different positions: some of them occasionally even switch from offense to defense or vice versa**. These kind of players are valuable and sought after, but on the flipside increasing the number snaps these players take in a game inevitably increases also their injury probability.\n\n\nThere are also factors in football even the most extensive data cannot measure. Is the head coach on hot seat or maybe a rookie? Is the team record 1-9 after ten games? Is the locker room united? Maybe the top running back's contract was just extended but the quarterback didn't get a new deal?

This creates challenges especially for special teams player as well as wide receivers and their defenders in the secondary.\n\nTherefore one could ask the following two questions based on the injury data available:\n\n-   **has the pre-game player warm-up been sufficient before the game?**\n-    **does the pre-game warm-up take into account that special teams players 'cool down' (have less plays and thus have to wait for their turn longer in the game)?**\n","1cb74103":"<img src= \"https:\/\/i2.cdn.turner.com\/money\/dam\/assets\/160909075115-zebra-technologies-coin-780x439.jpg\" width = 50%\/> ","509c1238":"**Injuries in the NFL don\u2019t however necessarily originate from playing professional football**. Most NFL team members have already been part of the game over a decade before turning professional. Although surfaces used in high school as well as college football lie outside of the scope of this analysis, as a working hypothesis it will be assumed that also these surfaces can both cause and aggravate lower leg injuries. As a result, players may already have a significant injury history before they have taken a single snap as professionals.\nWe also know from individual players\u2019 injury history that LLI are often \u2018nagging\u2019 i.e. recurring by nature. As I write this in December, the news about Odell Beckham Jr's sports hernia broke, revealing that he has played with the injury ever since the season started. If Beckam is to leave a game with an injury in one of three remaining regular season games, the specific play shown in data would leave out the fact of him battling through the same injury for three months.","75f44c2b":"Further divided by roster positions, the analysis returns the following result: ","16d53a15":"- **6 recorded injuries**\n- **main play types for injuries: rush (4), pass (2)**\n- **2 injuries took place on natural surface, 4 on synthetic**\n- **an injured player participated in 10 or less plays in 1\/6 cases**\n- **the average running count of plays before injury: 17.8**\n- **4 injuries were outdoor games (1\/4 had rain)**\n- **2 injuries were ankle injuries, 4 knee injuries**\n- **4 injuries lead to missing 42 or more days**\n- **5 injuries lead to missing 28 or more days**","6b7d30c5":"The play below that was knowingly excluded from the plot above, because it was the tagged under play type 'Kickoff Not Returned'. The play took place outdoors on synthetic surface. As the kickoff commenced, the special teams player took off from lower right corner of the image ( x = 76, y = 31). The play landed on endzone (x = 43, y = 34) after which the safety continued on top speed. This would indicated that there indeed was at least a serious possibility that the kickoff would be returned. This play sidelined the player for one week after what was later reported as a knee injury.","905e634d":"<img src= \"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d8\/Modernartificialgrass2.svg\" width = 75%\/> ","6da24c8c":"The National Football League (NFL) consists of 32 teams, each having 53-player active rosters. That makes 1696 players in total. According to the official NFL statistics, the total number of all reported injuries per season is in average about 1900 per one season. Thus **if a player is a week 1 starter in September in NFL, the odds of that very player getting injured during the season is - hypothetically - more than one hundred percent**.\n\n","25c0b97b":"It was later revealed that Guice had suffered a torn meniscus in his first game, requiring surgery, with him being placed on injured reserve on September 13th. Guice was reactivated off the injured reserve on November 7th. and four days later he took the field against the New York Jets in a week 11 matchup. Only two games later, in week 13, Derrius Guice again left the field mid-game, and he was diagnosed with a season-ending knee injury (MCL sprain) on December 10th 2019, leaving his whole career in question. Because of all this, **since the beginning of his professional NFL career Derrius Guice has appeared only in five games (one start) in two years and contributed 245 yards and two touchdowns on 42 carries**. Because of the nature of his injuries, it is however possible that he may have ended up as part of the dataset provided for this challenge. If that is indeed the case, it is good to know that a lot was going on before that one row of data was added in the player data. Also, drawing too deep conclusions based on that one row of data only would be somewhat misleading.","fe57fc1c":"As the graph below shows, the dataset mainly includes injures from linebackers, wide receivers and safeties. There are no significant differences between roster position when surface is concerned. Then again, only about a third of all stadiums have synthetic surface. From this viewpoint, **injuries on artificial surfaces are overrepresented especially in the case of cornerbacks**.","95b2c72d":"The website *TeamRankings.com *provides various up-to-date statistics on NFL. Using the website it is possible to state the following:\n\n-    **in average an NFL team has had 62 plays in a single game in 2019 season (before week 15)**\n-    **a special teams player has had an average of 14 plays per game in 2019 season**\n-    **for a team, an average NFL game thus consists of 24 offensive plays, 24 defensive plays and 14 special team plays**\n-    **furthermore, an average NFL game consists of 15-16 plays per quarter**\n\n\nThe PlayKey column in the provided datasets consists of three different parts: PlayerKey-GameID-X. The X in PlayKey identifies in sequential order a player's plays in a game. Thus it is possible to see on which play the player got injured, as seen before in this analysis.\n\nCombining this with data from the provided dataset with estimated the number of plays per quarter, it is possible to predict on which quarter each player got injured. The table below consists of the 77 cases where an injury could be further identified to a specific roster position.

As for surface, knee injuries are split evenly between natural and synthetic surface, with 24 cases on both surfaces. According to data provided, ankle injuries took place more often on synthetic surface, with 25 ankle injuries on synthetic surface compared to 17 that were recorded on natural surface. As for other LLI cases in the data, 6 out of 7 cases of toe injuries were recorded on synthetic surface, whereas 5 out 7 cases of foot injuries were recorded on natural surface.\n","6573da4e":"The new table InjuredPlayers consists of 105 rows, but there are some factors that should be addressed more closely. First, only 77 of the 105 injury logs include the relevant data on Position and PositionGroup.

The figure in question was in the range of 196-201 million USD, which is is a 40-percent increase from 2015, when salary cap was 143 million dollars**.\n\nThis is a significant incentive to keep the key players healthy, since they are becoming increasingly larger an investment. ALso ticket-buying NFL fans want to see the superstars playing with their full skillset and abilities. This is however possible only if these players are not injured.\n\n\n\n\n","e3f6a24a":"Injuries recognize no garbage time, whether it's ice hockey or football.

The kickoff resulted as touchback (x = 85, y = 40), causing the linebacker quickly decrease his speed. As the closer tracking plot below shows, the player ended up staying on the ground for a while after the play. This would suggest that the linebacker injured himself during the top-speed run before touchback. \n\n","3f94a2dd":"There are also factors such as for example the altitude at the Mile High stadium in Denver that necessarily affects the premises of how a particular game turns out.

Instead of being venues for football only, the new stadiums are designed to be multi-use arenas, as live entertainment hubs, to increase venue use and thus the revenue the location can create.\n\nFor example, the new Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas will be the new home of not only the Las Vegas Raiders but also the UNLV Rebels college football team. In addition to football, the stadium will host a great variety of other events such as live concerts. This means the arena surface has to be interchangeable - no fixed surface would survive under such heavy use.\n\nAs the image below showws, in football a synthetic surface consists of artificial fibres on top of rubber granules (image: Wikipedia Creative Commons):","c9d8a9ea":"\nWhat we can see from the dataset is that in these days linebackers are used in multiple ways in defense and special teams.

As cleats are in constant contact with the surface during the game, this is a variable with significant hypothetic relevance concerning lower leg injuries. However cleats used by players are beyond the data available and will thus be sidelined in this analysis.","ef986725":"The \u2018damp factor\u2019 i.e. air and ground humidity could be of significance in LLI cases concerning the actual structure and building materials of synthetic surface.
