Thus, placing advertisements in stores would be ideal for the next promotion. In this way, it will have a high possibility that the campaign is going to get a higher return.\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nThis analysis delivers a 4W analysis by using K-means clustering, a basket analysis, and a simple quantile method. The purpose of this analysis is to guide the marketing team for the following promotions. Finding the right customers, right products, and right channels to promote is the way to maximize the profit. The findings of this analysis are as below:\n\n1. Which Cluster?\n\nBy using K-means clustering, this analysis split the customers into 4 groups.\n\n- Cluster 0: High Recency with Low Monetary (721 customers)\n- Cluster 1: Low Recency with High Monetary (376 customers) *Best\n- Cluster 2: Low Recency with Low Monetary (716 customers)\n- Cluster 3: High Recency with High Monetary (427 customers)\n\nMost of the customers in cluster 1 have a bachelor degree and are married without a child. Also, a high proportion of the customers have a PhD or Master's degree. Most of them were born in 1960-1980, and the income is in the range of around 70,000-80,000 USD per year.\n\n2. What Products?\n\nThe most popular items are meat and wine products. Fish and gold are the most possible consequents that customers are more likely to buy after taking meat and wine. This is important information for the marketing team to organize the next promotion in order to maximize the profit.\n\n3. Who are the cutomers that usually accepted the promotions?\n\n190 customers in cluster 1 have accepted a promotion at least one time. Customer ID - 380, 3924, 4299, 6299, 9760, 4491, 5207, 873, and 2072 are the customers who frequently accepted promotions. These are the top patron the marketing team should target.\n\n4. Where are the places that the valuable customers usually purchase?\n\nIn-store shopping is the channel customers in cluster 1 prefer to purchase. Also, the customer who accepted promotions rather purchases in stores as well. Thus, this channel is where the marketing team should implement the promotions.\n\nLastly, here are suggestions for further analysis to explore more insights.\n\n1. Take a closer look at all clusters\nExplore the characters of other clusters for further analysis since this analysis only focuses on cluster 1.\n\n2. different clustering methods\nUsing a different clustering method to cross-validate the results of different clustering methods.\n\n3. Classification analysis\nThis analysis is the first part of the analysis which only contains EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). The next part could be a classification analysis by using a machine learning method to predict whether customers would complain.\n\n","b83d8c10":"![Screen Shot 2021-11-21 at 12.19.26 PM.png](attachment:61bec1da-2145-4973-85db-38adfea2e9cf.png)","2fdfa452":"As we know, the most popular items are meat and wine products.
