That notebook was focused on TF-IDF, and as such, involved lots of preprocessing of text tokens. These clean tokens are beneficial for CorEx topic modeling. BERT doesn't need this type of preprocessing because the neural networks learn to suppress stopwords and other noise.

I have a few lingering questions I'd like to get your feedback on in the comments:\n\n* Is there any automated way to determine the optimal number of CorEx topics?\n* I couldn't get BERT-as-a-Service to run using the GPU - any ideas what I did wrong? In theory, running with a GPU should dramatically reduce the 6 hour vectorization time of the full 22k documents.\n* Is there an Authors dataset I could join to the results? I'd like to provide full names and contact info for the authors. This strikes me as useful for journalists who search for a topic and wish to contact an expert.","bb9ea773":"# CoreEx Topic Modeling\n\nI found the optimal number of topics was between 16-24, but you can experiment with different values of target_num_topics.
