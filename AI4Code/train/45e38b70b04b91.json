However, when I analyze the league, I see that general statistics of team is not related with final performance. Final performance has something inclusive inside. There can be several methods that can be created. Nonetheless, while I am improvasing my method, I finally thought that again a total metric score for final measurement of wins could be benefical. Nonetheless, I took mostly samples from data and compare it with tourney win results. Then ranking the score and win rate can give us the tournement result in the end. I do not know about NCAA or its process. However, we can say that some parameters of team performance in some time period could be the projector of final tourney performance as a win rate. Thus, this analysis is based on these assumptions.","ce5d74b9":"We have 81 different teams on the final dataset.
