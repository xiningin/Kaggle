Scatter plots are used to plot data points on a horizontal and a vertical axis in the attempt to show how much one variable is affected by another.

People with number of nodes close to 0 and age between 30-35 or 50-60 years old tend to survive.\n\n","c35011bd":"Now that we know a littel bit about box plots , lets analyse what they are telling us.  You can see that the middle 50% of the nodes of people who survived fall between 0 to 3. While as middle 50% of the nodes of people who didn't survive for long, fall between 1 to 11. \n\nThe straight lines above and below the boxes are called whiskers , which represent the max and min value of the data points.

However, mean is highy affected by the presence of outliers or when the data is skewed. If the data is symetric then the value of mean is close to the value of median. \n\nHere from the above analysis, we can observe that age and year data points seem to be symetric as thier mean and meidan are close to each other. However the mean of nodes is quite greater than the median of nodes. It indicitates that our data is \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mathsisfun.com\/data\/skewness.html\">Right skewed<\/a>\" i.e. it has some outliers on the larger side.  \n\nNow lets plot some graphs to better understand the data.","6b23be1e":"<h3>CDF of Nodes<\/h3>","5e0a37d7":"Observations from the above plot are : \n1.

Among the people who didn't survive, only less than 25% of them had 0 auxilary nodes. 90% of them had less than 20 auxilary nodes. \n3. So we can wirte if auxilary nodes <= 3 then survial = 1 (survived) else suvival = 2 (didn't survive).

After the number of nodes increase beyond 20 , the chances of survial and non survial is same as the red and orange line overlap with each other. \n3.
