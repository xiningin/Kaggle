This is because `dt.day` doesn't know how to deal with a column with the dtype \"object\". Even though our dataframe has dates in it, we have to parse them before we can interact with them in a useful way.","2d889e48":"# Convert our date columns to datetime\n\nNow that we know that our date column isn't being recognized as a date, it's time to convert it so that it *is* recognized as a date. This is called \"parsing dates\" because we're taking in a string and identifying its component parts.\n\nWe can determine what the format of our dates are with a guide called [\"strftime directive\", which you can find more information on at this link](http:\/\/strftime.org\/). The basic idea is that you need to point out which parts of the date are where and what punctuation is between them. There are [lots of possible parts of a date](http:\/\/strftime.org\/), but the most common are `%d` for day, `%m` for month, `%y` for a two-digit year and `%Y` for a four digit year.\n\nSome examples:\n\n * 1\/17\/07 has the format \"%m\/%d\/%y\"\n * 17-1-2007 has the format \"%d-%m-%Y\"\n \nLooking back up at the head of the \"date\" column in the landslides dataset, we can see that it's in the format \"month\/day\/two-digit year\", so we can use the same syntax as the first example to parse in our dates: ","2f440dc4":"We'll be working with the \"date\" column from the `landslides` dataframe.

But just because I, a human, can tell that these are dates doesn't mean that Python knows that they're dates. Notice that at the bottom of the output of `head()`, you can see that it says that the data type of this  column is \"object\". \n\n> Pandas uses the \"object\" dtype for storing various types of data types, but most often when you see a column with the dtype \"object\" it will have strings in it. \n\nIf you check the pandas dtype documentation [here](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/basics.html#dtypes), you'll notice that there's also a specific `datetime64` dtypes. Because the dtype of our column is `object` rather than `datetime64`, we can tell that Python doesn't know that this column contains dates.\n\nWe can also look at just the dtype of a column without printing the first few rows:","f07b5c07":"# Select the day of the month\n\nNow that we have a column of parsed dates, we can extract information like the day of the month that a landslide occurred.","f9d5e4ac":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

The `to_datetime()` function does have very helpful error messages, but it doesn't hurt to double-check that the days of the month we've extracted make sense. \n\nTo do this, let's plot a histogram of the days of the month. We expect it to have values between 1 and 31 and, since there's no reason to suppose the landslides are more common on some days of the month than others, a relatively even distribution. (With a dip on 31 because not all months have 31 days.) Let's see if that's the case:","f4e52770":"Now that our dates are parsed correctly, we can interact with them in useful ways.\n\n___\n* **What if I run into an error with multiple date formats?** While we're specifying the date format here, sometimes you'll run into an error when there are multiple date formats in a single column. If that happens, you can have pandas try to infer what the right date format should be. You can do that like so:\n\n`landslides['date_parsed'] = pd.to_datetime(landslides['Date'], infer_datetime_format=True)`\n\n* **Why don't you always use `infer_datetime_format = True?`** There are two big reasons not to always have pandas guess the time format. The first is that pandas won't always been able to figure out the correct date format, especially if someone has gotten creative with data entry. The second is that it's much slower than specifying the exact format of the dates.","009010de":"You may have to check the [numpy documentation](https:\/\/docs.scipy.org\/doc\/numpy-1.12.0\/reference\/generated\/numpy.dtype.kind.html#numpy.dtype.kind) to match the letter code to the dtype of the object. \"O\" is the code for \"object\", so we can see that these two methods give us the same information.","f9df0a99":"Now we're ready to look at some dates!","0a882f5c":"# Get our environment set up\n\nThe first thing we'll need to do is load in the libraries and dataset we'll be using.
