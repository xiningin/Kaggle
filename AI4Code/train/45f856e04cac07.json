Here's a summary of a few of them:\n\n- Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries and women & non-binary genders.\n\n- The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although things are improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.\n\n\n- Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.\n\n- A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.\n\n- Javascript & HTML\/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.\n\n- Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.\n\n- Rust and TypeScript are the most \"loved\" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.\n\n- Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.\n\n- You can learn and start programming professionally at any age. You're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.\n","d7a76c71":"## Thank You For Having A Look At This Notebook\n## Please Upvote if this was Helpful.","446243fc":"You can see points all over the graph, which indicates that you can **start programming professionally at any age**.

Here's what we can do:\n\n- Create a new data frame `languages_loved_df` that contains a `True` value for a language only if the corresponding values in `languages_worked_df` and `languages_interested_df` are both `True`\n- Take the column-wise sum of `languages_loved_df` and divide it by the column-wise sum of `languages_worked_df` to get the percentage of respondents who \"love\" the language\n- Sort the results in decreasing order and plot a horizontal bar graph","f5d5c5d4":"Let's visualize the distribution of compensation and hours of work independently.","e9779bd9":"A pie chart would be a great way to visualize the distribution.","193b616f":"The following topics are covered in this tutorial:\n\n- Downloading a dataset from an online source\n- Data preparation and cleaning with Pandas\n- Open-ended exploratory analysis and visualization\n- Asking and answering interesting questions\n- Summarizing inferences and drawing conclusions","44b0e79f":"The dataset contains over 64,000 responses to 60 questions (although many questions are optional).

We can use a histogram and box plot to visualize its distribution. ","f0a29c22":"### Compensation vs. Working Hours\n\nLet's visualize the relationship between working hours and compensation for two countries: US & India. We can do this using a scatter plot.","5168ec98":"As one might expect, the most common roles include \"Developer\" in the name. \n\n","41534f7d":"# Exploratory Data Analysis - Stack Overflow Developer Survey \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xX4uUFZ.png)\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring, investigating and gathering insights from data using statistical measures and visualizations. The objective of EDA is to develop and understanding of data, by uncovering trends, relationships and patterns. \n\nEDA is both a science and an art. On the one hand it requires the knowledge of statistics, visualization techniques and data analysis tools like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn etc. On the other hand, it requires asking interesting questions to guide the investigation and interpreting numbers & figures to generate useful insights.\n","b97a99da":"### Country\n\nLet's look at the number of countries from which there are responses in the survey and plot the ten countries with the highest number of responses.","396917d7":"## Asking and Answering Questions\n\nWe've already gained several insights about the respondents and the programming community by exploring individual columns of the dataset. Let's ask some specific questions and try to answer them using data frame operations and visualizations.","ce3b1016":"There seems to be a problem with the age column, as the minimum value is 1 and the maximum is 279. This is a common issue with surveys: responses may contain invalid values due to accidental or intentional errors while responding. A simple fix would be to ignore the rows where the age is higher than 100 years or lower than 10 years as invalid survey responses. We can do this using the `.drop` method, [as explained here](https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/drop-rows-from-the-dataframe-based-on-certain-condition-applied-on-a-column\/).","dd70c0bf":"Most columns have the data type `object`, either because they contain values of different types or contain empty values (`NaN`). It appears that every column contains some empty values since the Non-Null count for every column is lower than the total number of rows (64461). We'll need to deal with empty values and manually adjust the data type for each column on a case-by-case basis. \n\n","403cc16f":"## Data Preprocessing & Cleaning with Pandas\n\nWhile the survey responses contain a wealth of information, we'll limit our analysis to the following areas:\n\n- Demographics of the survey respondents and the global programming community\n- Distribution of programming skills, experience, and preferences\n- Employment-related information, preferences, and opinions\n\nLet's select a subset of columns with the relevant data for our analysis.","48a8f600":"Let's view some basic information about the data frame.","3eb886c1":"As you might expect, most people seem to have had some exposure to programming before the age of 40. However, but there are people of all ages and walks of life learning to code.\n\n","2566485f":"We can identify the countries with the highest number of respondents using the `value_counts` method.","35c13b3c":"Since `schema_df` contains just one column, let's retrieve the column as a Pandas series.","0dad4452":"#### Q: In which countries do developers work the highest number of hours per week? Consider countries with more than 250 responses only.\n\nTo answer this question, we'll need to use the `groupby` data frame method to aggregate the rows for each country. We'll also need to filter the results to only include the countries with more than 250 respondents.","d87e89e0":"We've now cleaned up and prepared the dataset for analysis. Let's take a look at a sample of rows from the data frame.","02c77ed0":"The `dev_type_df` has one column for each option that can be selected as a response. If a respondent has chosen an option, the corresponding column's value is `True`. Otherwise, it is `False`.\n\nWe can now use the column-wise totals to identify the most common roles.\n","1f21a06e":"Perhaps unsurprisingly, Javascript & HTML\/CSS comes out at the top as web development is one of today's most sought skills. It also happens to be one of the easiest to get started. SQL is necessary for working with relational databases, so it's no surprise that most programmers work with SQL regularly. Python seems to be the popular choice for other forms of development, beating out Java, which was the industry standard for server & application development for over two decades.\n\n","26bc44a2":"You can go through the downloaded files using the \"File\" > \"Open\" menu option in Jupyter. It seems like the dataset contains three files:\n\n- `README.txt` - Information about the dataset\n- `survey_results_schema.csv` - The list of questions, and shortcodes for each question\n- `survey_results_public.csv` - The full list of responses to the questions \n\nLet's load the CSV files using the Pandas library. We'll use the name `survey_raw_df` for the data frame to indicate this is unprocessed data that we might clean, filter, and modify to prepare a data frame ready for analysis."}}
