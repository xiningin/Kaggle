A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. * \n*Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. * - From WHO Website - [coronavirus](https:\/\/www.who.int\/health-topics\/coronavirus)\n\nPrayers for all those who are suffering the agony of this calamity!!","01485b0e":"Hubei, the MOST impacted city because of Corona Virus!","54083648":"Thank you for reading this Kernel.
