Kernels do not yet support enough memory to load the whole dataset at once, at least using `pd.read_csv`.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n* Use more columns from the input data.  Here we're only using the start\/end GPS points from columns `[pickup|dropoff]_[latitude|longitude]`.  Try to see if the other columns -- `pickup_datetime` and `passenger_count` -- can help improve your results.\n* Use absolute location data rather than relative.  Here we're only looking at the difference between the start and end points, but maybe the actual values -- indicating where in NYC the taxi is traveling -- would be useful.\n* Use a non-linear model to capture more intricacies within the data.\n* Try to find more outliers to prune, or construct useful feature crosses.\n* Use the entire dataset -- here we're only using about 20% of the training data!","c7d0dca3":"### Train our model\nOur model will take the form $X \\cdot w = y$ where $X$ is a matrix of input features, and $y$ is a column of the target variable, `fare_amount`, for each row.

The matrix $X$ should consist of the two GPS coordinate differences, plus a third term of 1 to allow the model to learn a constant bias term.
