In this particular dataset, labels are stored in the filenames themselves. We will need to extract them to be able to classify the images into the correct categories.

We will try to see if what the model predicted was reasonable or not. In this case the mistakes look reasonable (none of the mistakes seems obviously naive). This is an indicator that our classifier is working correctly. \n\nFurthermore, when we plot the confusion matrix, we can see that the distribution is heavily skewed: the model makes the same mistakes over and over again but it rarely confuses other categories. This suggests that it just finds it difficult to distinguish some specific categories between each other; this is normal behaviour.","45236f58":"If you're using a computer with an unusually small GPU, you may get an out of memory error when running this notebook.

Our model will need to learn to differentiate between these 37 distinct categories. According to their paper, the best accuracy they could get in 2012 was 59.21%, using a complex model that was specific to pet detection, with separate \"Image\", \"Head\", and \"Body\" models for the pet photos.
