Sports and Gender distribution**\n\nHere is nothing unusual  - Baseball includes only men athletes, Softball - only women. And mostly there are more male athletes than female ones. Did it always happen like that? Let's check.","c024492a":"The graph above shows mean values for men and women per year. The general tendency is that number of female participants is increasing, especially in 1984 and 1996. The number of male medalists is slowly decreasing, especially after year 1992. \n\nThe graph below confirms the rise of number of women who got medals (from less than 400 to more than 900) while the male participants' medal numbers are within the approximate range 900 - 1100.","ab67923a":"Continuing the previous question we would like to see at the medals ratio for countries per year. For example, having  500 medals when you participated 2 times is not the same if you have participated 5 times. Ratio would be totally different. Let's have look at the best participants.","7407ef86":"Here it is obvious that the most Summer Olympic medals went to the United States. And it looks like a huge difference between the first and second places. But is that really so? We have political and economical reasons due to which some countries participated only a few times, for example, Soviet Union disappeared in 1991 (and participated only 4 times), such countries like Ukraine, Russia and Belarus started participating only in 1996. And Germany showed great results being separated into East and West Germany. If we added the results of Germany, East and West Germany, we would get 1662 medals in total, which is not that far from the United States' total result.\n\nThe graph below shows medals of countries by year for those countries which got more than 50 medals in total. We suppose that in the years where there are no medals, those countries did not participate.","3af50c3b":"**For men**, we can conclude that there are 20-60 male medalists at every Olympics edition with a small difference every time (within normal) and there is permanent increasing in Aquatics which could be related with adding new activities. Also, not all of the Sports took place starting in 1976, some of them were added to Olympics programm later.\n\nLet's have a look at **women's numbers.**","fded54b8":"That looks very interesting - the lines are not that stable as we saw for men. Aquatics like demonstrates sharp increasing, in the last years there are even more women than men. There is also drastic increasing of female medalists in Football, Judo, Hockey, and high starting number at the appearing Softball in the program.  ","00a729fd":"This is how our data looks like - 11 columns, 15316 rows, it contains information about City of Olympics, year, sport, its disciplines and events, athletes' names, gender of athletes (and event gender wich is basically the same as gender), country and its code, and medals. Let' explore it.","6cd13944":"Wow! The Soviet Union is much better than the United States. The difference is ~90 medals per year on the graph.\n\nNow we are intereted at looking at relative champions, which countries have the highest percent of gold medals among their total medals. The results for top 30 countries are in the table below (the index in top 30 is also included).","d8f6b9e4":"We have systematic absence of some values, there should be 15432 rows, but only 15316 are not nulls. Let's get rid of the null values.","b04a90d4":"# **1. What about quantity of medals and overall athletes contribution through time?**","784789c4":"# **5. The best athletes.**","c46d3cd5":"Looking at the graph above we can clearly see increasing of athletes contribution and increasing tendency of numbers of medals.\n\nNow let's create a table that shows number of medals in categories and total medals per country.","173b1b09":"# **2. Medal distribution within Sports**\n\nWhich sport activities get the most medals? The graph below shows that Aquatics climbs the number one throne. Well, these are summer Olympics after all. Athletics and Rowing are also in top 3. Medal distribution within particular sports is almost equal. There are only Boxing and Judo that have more bronze medals than gold or silver ones.","81f97f5d":"# **4. Gender and Sports per year.**"}}
