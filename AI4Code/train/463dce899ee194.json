The diagonal Axes are treated differently, drawing a plot to show the univariate distribution of the data for the variable in that column.","84428f5c":"2.

Understanding the dataset\n\nTitle: Haberman\u2019s Survival Data\nDescription: The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago\u2019s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.\nAttribute Information:\nAge of patient at the time of operation (numerical)\nPatient\u2019s year of operation (year \u2014 1900, numerical)\nNumber of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)\nSurvival status (class attribute) :\n1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer\n2 = the patient died within 5 years","cf2d42c3":"> ************Exploratory Data Analysis: Haberman\u2019s Cancer Survival Dataset****","c7bc05fa":"What is Exploratory Data Analysis?\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task.\nIt is always a good idea to explore a data set with multiple exploratory techniques, especially when they can be done together for comparison. The goal of exploratory data analysis is to obtain confidence in your data to a point where you\u2019re ready to engage a machine learning algorithm. Another side benefit of EDA is to refine your selection of feature variables that will be used later for machine learning.","07d3ab18":"Observations:\n\n*     Major overlapping is observed, which tells us that survival chances are irrespective of a person\u2019s age.\n*     Although there is overlapping we can vaguely tell that people whose age is in the range 30\u201340 are more likely to survive, and 40\u201360 are less likely to survive. While people whose age is in the range 60\u201375 have equal chances of surviving and not surviving.\n*     Yet, this cannot be our final conclusion. We cannot decide the survival chances of a patient just by considering the age parameter","a17af0be":"Observations:\n\n*     There is major overlapping observed. This graph only tells how many of the operations were successful and how many weren\u2019t. This cannot be a parameter to decide the patient\u2019s survival chances.\n*     However, it can be observed that in the years 1960 and 1965 there were more unsuccessful operations.","5b768251":"Observations:\n\n    The plot between year and nodes is comparatively better.","044a491e":"Observations:\n\n*     There are no missing values in this data set.\n*     All the columns are of the integer data type.\n*     The datatype of the status is an integer, it has to be converted to a categorical datatype\n*     In the status column, the value 1 can be mapped to \u2018yes\u2019 which means the patient has survived 5 years or longer. And the value 2 can be mapped to \u2018no\u2019 which means the patient died within 5 years.","aa968f4e":"3. Univariate Analysis\n\nThe major purpose of the univariate analysis is to describe, summarize and find patterns in the single feature.\nProbability Density Function(PDF)\nProbability Density Function (PDF) is the probability that the variable takes a value x. (a smoothed version of the histogram)\nHere the height of the bar denotes the percentage of data points under the corresponding group","bbc06b72":"Observations:\n\n*     Patients with no nodes or 1 node are more likely to survive.
