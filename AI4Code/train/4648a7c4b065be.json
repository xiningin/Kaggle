This file format was created as a way to distribute and view medical images using a standardized file format.\n\nThe DCM file format was developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. In addition to medical images, DCM files may also contain patient information.\n\nThe DiskCatalogMaker software application has also been known to use the .dcm file suffix.
