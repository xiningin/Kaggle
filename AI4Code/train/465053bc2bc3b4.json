If you've been through FastAI's course before this might seem firmiliar, if not take a look at some of the basics from week one. \n\nBecause this is a balenced dataset today I'm simply going look at accuracy as the evaluation metric. This project is for educational purposes and considering that I cobbled together with some spare time on my weekend, I'm pretty happy with this. I'm not a doctor (I don't even play one on TV).\n\nThanks to:\n* Cluadio Fanconi https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/fanconic for the Task, and also for creating a submission to compete against (His model produced an accuracy of about 92% so thats what I'm shoot for)\n* The International Skin Imaging Collaboration https:\/\/www.isic-archive.com\/ for the dataset. All the images are well centered and are size 224 so they made the bar for entry very reasonable.","918afa8b":"# Final thoughts:\n\nInitially this would appear to have an accuracy of 93%(on validation set). Each week I challenge myself to complete one Kaggle Task and this week I didn't have enough time to do this project justice. While my results look good, I did not manage to test for overfitting (which is a serious asterisk to append to this). Later I will revisit this notebook to when I'm able to retest the model against the test data instead of just a validation set.\n\nIf you have any constructive feedback feel free to message me or leave a comment. If you liked the notebook I'd appriciate the upvote. And if you would like to collaborate with me on a future Kaggle task send me a message here or on LinkedIn."}}
