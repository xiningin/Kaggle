Why the numbers went down?\n\n* International Media pressure?\n* Decrease of conflict, which decreased migration?\n* More humane treatment of migrants by the police coast?\n","4822744a":"Another oportunity to improve the data is to split location coordinates\nThe location coordinates is in only one column and it would be good to split them into to by manipulating string ising the expand property\n","d68926f6":"only 45 reports looks have done \"correctly\"... not a good thing but let's see anyway","b6aa5bf3":"Let's now visualise the proportion of missing people of Male, Female and Children","7c89061a":"It is very similar visually the proportion for both dataframe.
