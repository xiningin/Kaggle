the probability of players experiencing a concussion.\n\nTo change the player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior of leading with the helmet when they block or tackle, the NFL needs to enforce stricter penalties similar to the new targeting rules that college football has put in place.\n\n\nTo reduce the average player velocity during a punt play, the traditional punt play formations for the returning and coverage team needs to be altered.\n\n* Only 4 players are allowed on or near the line of scrimmage by the ball snap location for each team, otherwise it would be called an illegal
