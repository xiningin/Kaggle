Therefore, when seeing the SCADA records, we can refer to status and fault data to see what happens on the turbine at certain timestamps.","49d084b8":"We analyzed data that comes from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system of a wind turbine from April 2014 until April 2015, with the associated faults that occured during the operating times. The SCADA system gives more than 60 records of all components of the wind turbine such as nacelle, inverter, bearing, and so on. There were 5 fault modes that developed, labeled as FF, AF, EF, MF, and GF. We found out that the number of faults significantly increases in October 2014. \n\nDuring faulty times, there are anomalous behaviors of the wind turbine components. For example, during GF, the temperatures of all wind turbine components are lower than during normal conditions. However, temperatures during AF and EF are higher than normal. And then, the reactive power is anomalously high during EF, while power is lower during MF. Therefore, we could classify fault modes based on various SCADA measured components. \n\nWe made an Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) based predictive model to classify fault modes. The data is largely imbalanced among fault modes, therefore SMOTE was implemented within a 5-fold CV pipeline. From that attempt, we achieved a macro F1 score of 64-65%. Two problematic classes, EF and FF, were falsely predicted. To correct this and improve the model performance, we performed hyperparameter tuning to tune 4 AdaBoost hyperparameters. After tuning, the macro F1 score improved to 69-70%. The number of false prediction of EF classes successfully reduces. \n\nThe individual F1 scores of AF and MF were still low. Therefore, an improvement of this work is recommended and will be appreciated.\n\n**Thank you!**","5e6756ce":"We are going to build a predictive model to classify fault modes of wind turbine based on the information or status of wind turbine components (gear box, tower, nacelle, bearing, etc.) from SCADA system.

The classifier that we use is **LightGBM** (Gradient Boosting Machine). To avoid overfitting, we did **Stratified K-Fold** cross-validation with 5-folds. **Multiple scoring metrics** are used: accuracy, macro-averaged precision, macro recall, and macro F1 score.  \n\n**NOTE.** During cross-validation, the train set will be divided into train set and validation set. Therefore, to ensure that the train set is balanced, the SMOTE should be put inside via **pipeline**.
