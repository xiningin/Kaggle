While these technologies are associated most frequently with promises to strengthen public safety, a growing number of other applications have also emerged from verifying the identity of bank users, through to \u2018smart billboards\u2019. Access system and digital security based also on face recognition. Face recognition is applied on Images saved as a dataset or video saved on special path or real time use by using camera even for captured picture or video.\n\n1- How we can recognize face on saved image ?\n\n2- How we can recognize face on saved picture?\n\nWe will discover in this blog how develop python code to detect face in picture. We require python 3 and PIL (Python Imaging Library)[ https:\/\/he-arc.github.io\/livre-python\/pillow\/index.html] and face recognition library .","48fb1462":"zina.miss1@yahoo.com\n","529f0c7c":"# * How install Face recognition ?\n\nFor Ubuntu \/\/ pip3 install face_recognition\n\nGoogle Colab \/\/ Pip install face_recognition","4c2d5608":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","bd62b7ea":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","ab115bf2":"# 1- How we can recognize face on saved image?"}}
