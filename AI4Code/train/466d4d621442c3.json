We could potentially identify those incident records and try to correct whatever issue prevented them from matching, but since we still have over 394K records to use for demonstration we will let those go for now.\n\n#### Next we will aggregate this data to the LEA district level and then join it to the LEA boundaries. There are many ways this can be done, depending on the ultimate use of the data. We could count up all the incidents in each LEA district, or we could subset them by the Incident Reason and provide separate counts. We could could also aggregate by date or time or incident disposition or any specific combinations of these.\n\n#### To keep it simple we will aggregate the data by LEA district, but we will only look at embezzlement and drug\/narcotic incidents and we will aggregate them separately. We will also look at the incident disposition in these cases. Since the most common disposition is 'NONE', we will simplify this variable into a binary indicator of whether any action was taken or not.","03798aaa":"#### The tract shapefile for California has 8041 rows and 10 columns.

We now have a geodataframe that contains LEA boundaries, police activity measures, and census data. We can now begin to explore what we can do with this rich dataset.\n\nThere are some limitations, though, to what we can do in this demonstration. We have downloaded only a small fraction of the data that is available via the Census Bureau API, pulling only the most basic demographics. In addition, the police activity data provided by CPE for San Francisco does not contain any data on the demographics of the officers or suspects involved in the incidents. Therefore we are not able to explore relationships between characteristics of suspects or officers on the disposition of incidents that might indicate bias on a personal level. And since we have aggregated data at the LEA district level, we are limited to looking at differences at the LEA district level.","d0371092":"# CPE Data Science for Good Challenge\n### Integrating data with different geographic units to promote policing equity.\n\nThis notebook offers solutions to the Kaggle challenge from the Center for Policing Equity (CPE). CPE is building a National Justice Database to track police activity in participating cities. They would like to integrate this data with geographic boundary files of the local police precincts. They would also like to integrate policing data with social and economic data about the local community that is collected at the census-tract level. The key aspects of the challenge are:\n\n>Our biggest challenge is automating the combination of police data, census-level data, and other socioeconomic factors. Shapefiles are unusual and messy -- which makes it difficult to, for instance, generate maps of police behavior with precinct boundary layers mixed with census layers. Police incident data are also very difficult to normalize and standardize across departments since there are no federal standards for data collection..\n\n>Main Prize Track submissions will be judged based on the following general criteria:\n\n>Performance - How well does the solution combine shapefiles and census data? How much manual effort is needed? CPE will not be able to live-test every submission, so a strong entry will be able to automate using shape files with different projections and clearly articulate why it is effective at tackling the problem.\n\n>Accuracy - Does the solution provide reliable and accurate analysis? How well does it match census-level demographics to police deployment areas?\n\n>Approachability - The best solutions should use best coding practices and have useful comments. Plots and graphs should should be self-explanatory. CPE might use your work to explain to stakeholders where to take action,so the results of your solution should be developed for an audience of law enforcement professionals and public officials.\n\nThe notebook is organized as follows:\n\n1. Integrating census tract data with Law Enforcement Agency boundary files by overlaying LEA boundaries with census tract boundaries.\n2. Automatically downloading census data through the Census Bureau API.\n3. Integrating police activity data by generating geographic data files from raw latitude\/longitude data, and then using point-in-polygon overlay to generate precinct-level data on police activity.\n4. Demonstrating how integrated data from police activity and the US Census can be used to generate metrics related to police bias.\n\nCPE has provided LEA shape files, police activity data, and census tract data files for 12 partner cities in the US. The type of police activity data provided varies across the cities, as do the time periods that are covered. Six cities provide 'Use of Force' data, although two seem to contain only 35 and 79 instances and so are probably incomplete. Three cities provide 'Incidents' data, one provides 'Field Interviews', another 'Arrests', and another 'Vehicle Stops'. There are a variety of issues with these files, for example the shapefile for the LEA boundaries in Austin, TX is missing projection information, the LEA shapefile for Dallas, TX contains only a subset of precincts, and the shapefile for Charlotte, NC contains point data instead of polygons. There are also undoubtedly some issues with the data files that will require cleaning and transformation. The focus here will be less on data cleaning and more on the spatial transformations that can be used to integrate data at different geographic levels. To do this I will demonstrate with the data for San Francisco, CA as an example case.\n\nThe concepts presented here are intended to be generalizable to other locations or datasets beyond those used here. This notebook uses Python 3, including common libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. It also uses the libraries Geopandas for spatial operations and CensusData for accessing the Census Bureau API. There are many tools or sets of tools that could be used depending on the desired application and scale.","31160da9":"#### The policing data for San Francisco contains 394,235 records and 11 columns. There is no missing data and on preliminary inspection the data file appears to be very clean and tidy. It is also a rather slim dataset, as it does not give us any descriptive information about the officers, suspects, or victims involved. Therefore we will not be able to investigate police bias based on this dataset alone and we will not be able to investigate any impacts of the demographics (race, sex age, etc.) of the persons involved. \n\n#### That leaves us with examining patterns of police activity and how they may differ across communities in San Francisco. This could be done at either the census tract or the LEA district level. The choice depends on how the information will be used. For this demonstration we will stick with using the LEA boundaries as the aggregation level for both census data and policing data. Next we will convert the police activity data to a geodataframe.","27138a3b":"#### This merge shows us that our intersection picked up a few census tracts that are not in the census data. Notice that each of these polygons make up a tiny fraction of the LEA district they intersected with. These tracts have been picked up in error due to small misalignments between the census tract and LEA district maps. We can delete them now. Alternatively, we could have eliminated these earlier in the process by only taking census data from San Francisco county. But not all LEA boundaries coincide with county boundaries, so it is important to make that decision on a case by case basis.","096d62fe":"#### Embezzlement incidents seem to occur more often in the central business district. What about drug offenses?","7169b21d":"#### There are no obvious relationships in the bivariate scatter plots. I hope, however, that this brief exercise has helped to demonstrate how data with varying geographies can be integrated to produce useful datasets. The potential uses for this type of data include standardized reports for local law enforcement, rich datasets for statistical analysis, flat files for export to BI, GIS, or data visualization applications.\n\n#### Some parts of the process involved in producing the integrated data are more amenable to automation than others. The initial validation of police\/LEA shapefiles will likely need human attention in some cases, although validation functions can be created to screen for certain specific requirements such as projection information. Correcting problems with shapefiles is not really possible to automate when working with files from partner institutions, but the good news is you will not have to do it often as these boundaries are not likely to change frequently.\n\n#### The same can be said for cleaning data provided by law enforcement agencies: data cleaning can only be automated so much. If a set of data standards can be agreed upon, then it certainly possible to create validation tools that will isolate problematic records. Correcting them will require human intervention.\n\n#### Files from the Census Bureau are usually highly reliable and well-documented. Shapefiles for tracts or other boundaries change infrequently, so they can be probably be downloaded manually. Shapefiles can also be accessed via URL. Census population data can be downloaded manually or can be accessed via an API. Writing some code to make use of the API may be worth the effort if you will want to update the data anually or if you will want to make requests for the same data for different cities as they come on board.\n\n#### Once data is in a standardized format, it can certainly be possible to write code that will take in shape files and data files, and then produced standardized ouput for further use.","37bb9786":"### Thanks for Reading!","a3433ff5":"\nOutside of the decennial census, the primary source for census data at the geographic level of the census tract or lower is the 5-year American Community Survey data. The 5-year ACS is a rich source of data. Tables are available containing many detailed breakdowns, and the full range of long-form census questions are included. The tradeoff, however, is that this data represents an overall 5-year period. So, for example, the 2017 ACS 5-year data is reflective of the period 2013-2017. Updated 5-year tables are released each year, but they are not intended to be used as moving averages.  The 5-year window allows the Census Bureau to protect individual privacy while managing a large scale survey research process. The names of the data files provided for this challenge indicate that the data is from the 2015 5yr ACS release, which covers the years 2011-2015.\n\nThe files provided by CPE are ACS 5yr 2015 files that have been downloaded from the American Fact Finder website. Most are from Data Profile tables, which provide many of the most popular demographic measures. It can be convenient to obtain census data in this way. But the US Census Bureau offers an API for more direct access, and using this process can have some advantages:\n\n- When files are manually downloaded, the requested columns are automatically assigned names, which are documented in the associated metadata file. These names are reused for each downloaded file. Accessing data through the API allows the use of unique names which provides for better documentation of the download process.\n- The API allows users to access only the columns that are required, rather than downloading entire tables.\n- Code can be reused by passing parameters to get data for different time periods or different locations.\n\nSome disadvantages of accessing census data through the API:\n- Requires lookup of census table and column identifiers, which can be tedious.\n- Writing code can be more time consuming than using the interactive download page, especially if only a few files are needed.\n\nDirectly accessing the Census API is not possible on the Kaggle platform, so for this section I have again provided the file that would result from running the code in the hidden cells.","9fac391f":"#### Drug related incidents are much more common than embezzlement, and are prevalent in several areas outside the CBD.\n\n#### Since these geodataframes all have the same projection they can easily be plotted together without actually merging the data. we will need to combine the files in order to generate statistics using the police incident data and the census data that we transformed to LEA districts. Geodataframes can be joined based either on attributes (matching on a shared column) or based on the spatial relationship between the two geometries. \n\n#### In this case we want to join the LEA boundaries with the LEA incident points so that we can assign an LEA district to each point. Then we can count the incidents in each district and generate other metrics. Because the San Francisco incidents data is so tidy, it already contains a column with the district name that we can probably use for an attribute join (assuming all the spelling lines up). But it is not reasonable to expect that all police data will be this tidy, and since this notebook is intended to be a demonstration of automating the integration of spatial data, I will use the spatial join. This type os spatial join is also sometimes called a point-in-polygon operation. As mentioned before, we could alternatively do the spatial join with incidents and census tract boundaries and perform an analysis at that level.\n\n#### Note that this operation also is not supported by Kaggle, so I have provided the resulting data file.","dd534c31":"#### It's interesting that action is taken in a higher percentage of drug-related incidents than embezzlement incidents.\n\n#### Now that we have created some police activity measures at the LEA district level, we can now join that data to the geodataframe we created that contains census data at the LEA district level","7b093fce":"#### For each intersection polygon in this dataframe, we now also know what proportion of land area the polygon contributes to the tract it falls within and the LEA district it falls within.
