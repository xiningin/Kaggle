Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of 2020, Facebook claimed 2.8 billion monthly active users, and ranked seventh in global internet usage.\n\n","1fdf3325":"**Maximum number of clicks received by an ID**","1057d0a8":"**Top Five values in the Datset**","d63626cd":"Id 1178 has received the maximum number of conversions of 1050","08feceae":"The correlated valued lies between 0.7 and 1 ","01cc15ec":"# Importing Packages for Analysis","7ecccc68":"# Thank You","82ea81c5":"**Setting Index of the dataset**","6cb183d4":"**Removing all empty rows**","7dc038cc":"**The targetted Age in the Ad Campaign**","c5158d2c":"**Finding out the number of null values in each column**","ad07affe":"Id 936 has spent the highest with 296936.80","02392e04":"**Assigning independant variables(X) and dependant variable(y)**","b611a966":"**Total Number of clicks received**","1c5643a8":"**Finding out total amount spent of Ads**","17641ef6":"**Total Approved conversions by each Id**","c0f35e3c":"Id 1178 has received the maximum number of approved conversions of 378","aaa123b6":"**Pairplot of the Dataset**","c865553c":"# Regression Analysis","5a05b006":"Id 1178 has received the highest number of impressions of 9577","dad1953c":"**Finding out who spent the maximum on Ad Campaign**","deb64e5f":"Id 1178 has received the highest number of impressions of 69902476"}}
