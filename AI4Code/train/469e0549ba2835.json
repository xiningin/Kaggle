One-Vs-Rest for Multi-Class Classification**\n\nThe One-vs-Rest strategy splits a multi-class classification into one binary classification problem per class.\n\nOne-vs-rest (OvR for short, also referred to as One-vs-All or OvA) is a heuristic method for using binary classification algorithms for multi-class classification.\n\nIt involves splitting the multi-class dataset into multiple binary classification problems. A binary classifier is then trained on each binary classification problem and predictions are made using the model that is the most confident.\n\nThis approach requires that each model predicts a class membership probability or a probability-like score. The argmax of these scores (class index with the largest score) is then used to predict a class.\n\nOne advantage of this approach is its interpretability. Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier.\n\nA possible downside of this approach is that it requires one model to be created for each class.\n"}}
