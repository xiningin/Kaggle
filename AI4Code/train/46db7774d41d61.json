This may be due to the presence of a lot of Unkown data in the shooter fields, but we could also easily assume that women are more prone to be shot than shoot herself - unfortunately or not, the conclusion is hard to draw ...\n- Older persons (45+ years old) are also more victims than shooters, and we can draw the same conclusion than for women.\n- I have performed the same analysis only taking into account fatal shootings, and the proportions are the same (that's why I don't display it here). ","77e93547":"### Observations\n- A lot of data is missing (labelled as 'UNKNOWN'), certainly because some shooters may not have been identified, or because the identity details of the shooters aren't always reported. Thus, the following observations must be taken with caution.\n- We see how much young men dominate this table: excluding the 'unknown' persons, men younger than 45 years old have committed more than 70% of the total shootings for which shooter information is available. That is huge!\n- As we could have expected, young persons are doing more shootings than their elders, and men are way more violent than women in general.\n- Let's also note the old woman that is the only one in her group to have committed a shooting in this time period. It occurred in March, 2010 in the Queens borough.\n- We see that Blacks and Hispanics have committed more than 80% of the total shootings (exluding once again the 'UNKNOWN' profiles). With economic data, I am sure this could be linked to the poverty and social distress of these populations.","92182193":"<a id = 'shooter-identity'><\/a>\n# VII - Analysis of the shooter identity","05d9b596":"<a id = 'annual-patterns'><\/a>\n# II - Annual patterns","a6130b77":"### Observations\n- Shootings (whether fatal or not) are more common during week-ends, while the most peaceful day is Thursday ... If week-ends can be explained (people have \"more time to shoot\"), I would be curious to know why Thursdays are so peaceful!\n- Let's also note that only Sundays and Saturdays have a median higher than 0 for fatal shootings.\n- During the 13 years covered by the dataset, ie approximately 730 weeks, only 18 Saturdays were peaceful ! Hence, only 2.5% of the Saturdays of this time period were peaceful: that is huge.\n- The day with most shootings is Sunday, 04th of September 2011, with 31 shootings in total, and 4 homicides. I couldn't find any documentation on that day. By looking at the details of that day, this high number was certainly not due to a coordinated group of shooter (shootings happened in different places and at different time).\n- Each day of the week has outliers with high number of shootings ending in the death of the victim, the highest number being 10 out of 11 total shootings, during Monday, 12th of December."}}
