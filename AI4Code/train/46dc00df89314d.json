Doing a train and test on the same dataset will most likely have low out-of-sample accuracy, due to the likelihood of our model overfitting.\n\nIt is important that our models have a high, out-of-sample accuracy, because the purpose of any model, of course, is to make correct predictions on unknown data. So how can we improve out-of-sample accuracy? One way is to use an evaluation approach called Train\/Test Split.\nTrain\/Test Split involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are mutually exclusive. After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set.\n\nThis will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that has been used to train the model. It is more realistic for real world problems.\n","fc838d28":"<details><summary>Click here for the solution<\/summary>\n\n```python\nk = 6\nneigh6 = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = k).fit(X_train,y_train)\nyhat6 = neigh6.predict(X_test)\nprint(\"Train set Accuracy: \", metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, neigh6.predict(X_train)))\nprint(\"Test set Accuracy: \", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat6))\n\n```\n\n<\/details>\n","42e33ece":"Let's download the dataset.

Where the data is 'trained' with data points corresponding to their classification.

This function is equal to the jaccard_score function.

If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company can customize offers for individual prospective customers. It is a classification problem. That is, given the dataset,  with predefined labels, we need to build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case.\n\nThe example focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, and marital, to predict usage patterns.\n\nThe target field, called\u00a0**custcat**,\u00a0has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows:\n1- Basic Service\n2- E-Service\n3- Plus Service\n4- Total Service\n\nOur objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases.

It is supposed to be specified by the user. So, how can we choose right value for K?\nThe general solution is to reserve a part of your data for testing the accuracy of the model. Then choose k =1, use the training part for modeling, and calculate the accuracy of prediction using all samples in your test set. Repeat this process, increasing the k, and see which k is the best for your model.\n\nWe can calculate the accuracy of KNN for different values of k.\n","5c8eb027":"### Feature set\n","7a49726f":"### Predicting\n\nWe can use the model to make predictions on the test set:\n","b4c6742e":"<div id=\"visualization_analysis\">\n    <h2>Data Visualization and Analysis<\/h2> \n<\/div>\n","28cb9099":"### Training\n\nLet's start the algorithm with k=4 for now:\n","27e3b0f4":"Let's load required libraries\n","5e0c9c65":"#### Import library\n","ee724b73":"Classifier implementing the k-nearest neighbors vote.\n","41657ddc":"<h1>Table of contents<\/h1>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n    <ol>\n        <li><a href=\"#about_dataset\">About the dataset<\/a><\/li>\n        <li><a href=\"#visualization_analysis\">Data Visualization and Analysis<\/a><\/li>\n        <li><a href=\"#classification\">Classification<\/a><\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<br>\n<hr>\n","46ed489b":"What are our labels?\n","2f229165":"### Here's an visualization of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud\/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork\/labs\/Module%203\/images\/KNN_Diagram.png\">\n","cb44d0ac":"Let's define feature sets, X:\n"}}
