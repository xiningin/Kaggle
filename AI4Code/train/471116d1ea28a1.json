We all know that there are variety of good phones out there in the Market. There's Apple, Samsung, Oppo, OnePlus, Google, etc. How are you going to decide which phone to buy now? You'll probably go to Youtube and watch MKBHD or Linus Tech Tips or MrWhoseTheBoss videos and will narrow down your choices. Is that it? If I was at your position, I would have compared the specifications of the phones too and compare them out so that I can narrow down my choices on a more deeper level now and I think that you would also do the same. \n\nNow this **investigation** that you or me are doing before buying a new phone is what in today's technological world or Data Science world known as \"Exploratory Data Analysis\". \n\n**Exploratory Data Analysis** is an approach to analyze any data set to summarize its main features or characteristics. We use statistical graphs and other data visulization models most of the time here.","10a7cb85":"[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n<a id=\"2.2.3.6\"><\/a>\n### 2.2.3.6.
