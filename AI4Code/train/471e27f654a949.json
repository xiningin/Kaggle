You should see a correlation between your local improvements and LB score\n- Try TF-IDF, ngrams, Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings\n- Try various NLP techniques like stemming and lemmatization\n- Tune hyperparameters. In our example, we've left only 50k features and used `C`=1 as a regularization parameter, this can be changed \n- SGD and Vowpal Wabbit will learn much faster\n- In our course, we don't cover neural nets.
