The United State has much higher rates of police killings than comparable Western first world countries (see: https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2015\/jun\/09\/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries). These comparably higher killing rates begs the questions who is targeted and how likely is this to affect your life?\n\nThis notebook has a specific focus on race and ethnicity and will explore how that variable changes the likelihood of being a victim of police killings. To better understand the how police killings effect different racial groups, United States Census data will be used. This data is not always from 2015 and will be used as a way to estimate what racial groups are more affected than others.\n\nPlease also note that I am using the language specified by the data when referring to race and gender, I do not believe all racial groups and gender identities fall into the categories provided.","35a548c2":"By breaking down the number of killings over time by race, we can see that the general uniformity of the distribution continues.","6f3fdb3c":"Here we can see the median household income level of the victims is below the national median income.","c053abbe":"Looking at the previous histogram, it is apparent that more White people have been killed by police than any other race. This makes sense given the large percent of Americans who identify as White. To see which racial group is most likely to be a victim of a police shooting we can divide the total number of victims of each racial group by the the total number of people in that racial group. Using 2010 census data pulled from Wikipedia, we can see which racial groups are most frequently victims. The census does not treat the hispanic racial group as a separate racial group so we'll only look at White, Black, Native American, and Asian racial groups.","f692f9d3":"Breaking down this plot by race, specifically Black and White racial groups shows that White people were nearly 10% more likely to be killed by guns and Black people were more likely to be killed by a taser or die in custody.","aa40fb02":"The following maps display the location of each killing and the race of the victim.","49553252":"Since the Black racial group is affected the most per capita, we'll examine where Black people are killed by police. The following map shows the location of each Black person's death and the cause of death. The distribution shows more Black deaths in the southern and eastern areas of the United States.","1e8858c3":"Moving on to which states have the most police killings, we can look at the top 7 most killings and also see how the state population affects these numbers. California leads the states in most police killings, but when the large population of the state is factored in, the number of police killings per state citizen is more on par with other states. On the other hand, Oklahoma an Arizona have very high rate of police killings per number of state citizens.","e9b67c34":"## Conclusion:\n\nBased on this data set, we can see that in just five months a significant number of Americans are killed by police and on average 20% of these victims are unarmed. It's also worth noting that these killings disproportionately affect minority groups, specifically Black men. Police violence that results in death undermines the American criminal justice system by exicuting potential criminals before they have access to a fair trial. These numbers help validate claims made by those who feel minority groups are more likely to be victims of police killings. While this data set doesn't capture the United State's full history of police violence, this does offer important information on trends that occur within the five month time frame. One can also speculate that some of these trends continue on into the future and are relavant today.\n\nAlso please note that this is my first Kaggle notebook and constructive criticsm is welcome.","d1b478d1":"## Analysis:\n\nFirst we'll examine police killings over the given time frame. We don't have data from a long enough time frame to look for an overall trend but we can see that there appears to be some uniformity in the number of killings over time. This is somewhat unsurprising as one wouldn't expect time of year to greatly impact the number police killings in the United States.","e63e2069":"This reveals the cause of death for all victims. Nearly 90% of victims were killed with guns.","b423abac":"Based on the data, we can see that any given Black male in 2015 was more than 3 times more likely to be killed by police than a given White male. These numbers support arguments that there are racial biases when police interact with Americans. This data also shows the vast gender discrepancy across all racial groups; males are much more likely to be victims of police killings.","c9e55664":"Now, we'll examine the percentage of each racial group killed while unarmed. Here we can see that police killed roughly the same unarmed percentage of each racial group. The Asian\/Pacific Islander group is a bit of an outlier given the small number of data points in that racial group.","7976cfc4":"Here, we can see the racial break down of victims. There are a notable number of Black, White, and Hispanic killings.","f6b802d6":"Since the data set includes the most number of Black and White victims we'll examine how each racial group was affected by their armed status. Here we see the biggest discrepancy in those victims unarmed or armed with a vehicle. More unarmed and driving victims were Black than White.","2d12c487":"We can also see that the average personal income of Black people killed is lower than the total average personal income and that the White average personal income of people killed is higher than that of both the total average and the Black people killed. It is also worth noting that the most personally wealthy people killed are Black and made over $80,000 a year.","160956a5":"Next, we'll examine how the average age of victims compares with the average life expectancy. While the life expectancy present here doesn't take into account specific information like race, gender, income, or education, when compared with the group involved in the data set, that is, the data set is predominantly male, but this life expectancy is based on both genders in the United States. Regardless, the gap between the average age of death of these victims and the average life expectancy is significant.","bab55f54":"The following correlation matrix could potentially reveal correlations between unlikely numeric variables. Although, there aren't many surprising results here."}}
