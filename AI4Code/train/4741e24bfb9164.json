One reason could be that Data Science is a very lucrative career. Working in the industry even for a few years might be enough for some to retire and enjoy a peaceful life. Also, we need to also consider in the fact that Data Science is a relatively new term. Most of the people in the upper age bracket might still be doing Data Science work, but its just that their job titles are not Data Scientists per se. Yet another factor might be that people tend to give up roles that require such significant amounts of learning even in the later stage of their career. Life-long learning is something that is not attractive for everyone. <\/p>\n<\/div>","7a85bcfa":"<div class=\"containers\">\n   <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/5418212-kg.jpeg\" alt=\"Avatar\">\n  <p>Yes...Sure...Thank you...Bye<p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers datascience\">\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/4422823-kg.png\" alt=\"Avatar\" class=\"right\">\n    <p>Who were you talking to and why are you smiling like a dork?<p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers\">\n   <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/5418212-kg.jpeg\" alt=\"Avatar\">\n  <p>Just got off the call from an interviewer from a Company I had applied to.

Nowadays, it is not so easy. You need to have at least some sort of familiarity with all or some of the Cloud Computing, Big Data and Business Intelligence Tools. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers\">\n   <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/5418212-kg.jpeg\" alt=\"Avatar\">\n  <p>I understand what you are trying to say. I certainly feel that having these skills is also important as model building is only one aspect of Data Science. Data Science also involves working with large Databases for which we need Big Data skills. It involves deployment of the created model - this involves having knowledge of Cloud Computing and how to use it to train and serve models. Another crucial step is Data Visualization and communicating insights to your clients. This is where knowledge of Business Intelligence comes in handy. <p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers datascience\">\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/4422823-kg.png\" alt=\"Avatar\" class=\"right\">\n    <p>Exactly. I'm not saying you have to be a master in each of those field. Honestly, that is not even possible. They are in itself very vast fields. But having said that, having basic familiarity with these topics gives the companies a strong positive impression about you. It shows that you have understanding of the entire Data Science pipeline from Data Collection, Visualization to Model Creation and Model Deployment<\/p>\n    <p> Choose the kind of role you see yourself taking and work accordingly. As a Data Analyst, you should work on Developing your expertise using Business Intelligence and Big Data tools and products. While a Machine Learning Engineer would be better off focusing on Cloud Computing skills. Being a Data Scientist however is somewhat more demanding and requires familiarity with all 3 aspects - Big Data, Cloud Computing and Business Intelligence<\/p>\n<\/div>","964568b5":"<div class=\"containers\">\n   <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/5418212-kg.jpeg\" alt=\"Avatar\">\n  <p>Damn!

I was hoping I'd get a chance to work with some State of the Art models or proprietary models that are really complex, but it turns out it is nothing like that. While the people I work with are very smart individuals, yet what we are doing is nothing but basic decision tree based models or linear models. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers datascience\">\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/4422823-kg.png\" alt=\"Avatar\" class=\"right\">\n    <p>Aww dude. What else did you expect? I've seen lots of people think that Data Science industry is some sort of magic land that hides a state of the art model in every nook and corner, but unfortunately it is not the case. While a lot of companies are doing work that is absolutely cutting-edge, these companies are also very few. The rest of the companies honestly do not have that use case that requires using anything more than a simple Logistic Regression model. <\/p>\n    <p>You know, one of the biggest reasons why so many Data Scientists leave their jobs is because of this difference between what they expected and what actaully happens in the industry. This rift between reality and expectation is what causes dissatisfaction.

Honestly, I started with Data Science only because I read a few articles that said Data Science is the hottest field and because Data Scientists have perhaps the highest salaries in the industry. However, I soon realized that I am in love with this. And that is what is most important in such a demanding career.<p>\n    <p>Sure, you can be attracted to Data Science for the money, but that is not enough of a motivating factor to keep to involved in the field. Sooner or later, if you do not love the very idea of working with Data, you are going to find the Data Science journey to be extremely difficult.<p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers datascience\">\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/4422823-kg.png\" alt=\"Avatar\" class=\"right\">\n    <p>Yes. Now speaking of life long learning. Can you see another interesting trend?<\/p>\n    <p>The students and people who are currently not employed have a high reliance on YouTube to gain information. As you start working in the industry, this source is replaced with Blogs. As you start tackling newer and newer problems, you soon realize that YouTube is one big sea of entry level tutorials. Your best source of information then becomes Blog posts. So keep that in mind and start cultivating the habit of reading.<p>\n<\/div>","6db313cd":"<div class=\"containers\">\n   <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/5418212-kg.jpeg\" alt=\"Avatar\">\n  <p>But does the years of coding experience correlate to proficiency in Coding?<p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers datascience\">\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/4422823-kg.png\" alt=\"Avatar\" class=\"right\">\n    <p>Good.

Just like you take steps for tackling class imbalance in a dataset, the Data Science industry too needs to collectively work in order to tackle this issue. I remember something Parul Pandey said in one of her interviews - it is not like there aren't many good Women Data Scientists or that there is any shortage of Women Data Science professionals who are holding key positions in their companies, it is that not many of them come forth and give talks\/presentations which would in turn inspire other Women to take up Data Science.

You must see that Data Science is still a very new field. Most companies either do not know how to go about leveraging Data Scince or have very recently started using Data Science techniques.

There is an ever-widening gap between what data scientists expect and what they actually work on in the industry.Taking the example of aspiring data scientists, they are typically self-learned and have gathered their knowledge from books and online courses. They don\u2019t have a lot of exposure to real-world projects and datasets. To such people data science soon turns into an over-glorified field which they soon start to regret a career in Data Science.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers\">\n   <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/5418212-kg.jpeg\" alt=\"Avatar\">\n  <p>While I know that the majority of the time as someone working in the Data Science field is spent on cleaning and exploring the data, however, I feel that there is only so much you have to learn in this department.

The data scientists\u2019 role is not immune to the stagnancy factor. There is a brick wall you hit after a certain point of time and the feeling of wanting a new challenge is always around the corner. The Lack of Upskilling is definitely a major reason why people tend to switch jobs so often in Data Science.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers\">\n   <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/5418212-kg.jpeg\" alt=\"Avatar\">\n  <p>This totally makes sense. This seems to be a side effect of the hype behind Data Science. All the companies are so eager to be called Data driven these days and hire Data Scientists while they don't even have the culture, let alone the infrastructure to aid Data Scientists. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"containers datascience\">\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/4422823-kg.png\" alt=\"Avatar\" class=\"right\">\n    <p>Indeed. I'm not saying this to discourage you or scare you away from the Data Science field, but I merely wish that you recognize these things early on so that your love for this field does not diminish.<\/p>\n    <p>You need to understand that office politics is a major cause of dissastifaction among Data Scientists. Given the right conditions, a Data Scientist as young as you, can shine while when the culture itself is not conducive to growth, it could seriously affect one. Executives and Senior Management, often times forget that Data Science is a very iterative process. It takes months and months to create a decent enough product. It becomes incresingly necessary for management to provide a high degree of flexibility to their Data Science team to help them work at their own pace. When the management understands this and acknowledges this, synergy ensues, when they don't chaos unfolds.<\/p>","c9ffce7d":"<div class=\"containers\">\n   <img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-avatars\/images\/5418212-kg.jpeg\" alt=\"Avatar\">\n  <p>A large number of Data Scientists selected R as a language they use on a regular basis.
