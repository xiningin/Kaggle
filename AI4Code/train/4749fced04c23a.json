The lower back, which starts below the ribcage, is called the lumbar region. Pain here can be intense and is one of the top causes of missed work. Fortunately, low back pain often gets better on its own. When it doesn't, there are effective treatments.\n\n### Common symptoms experienced by people with low back pain\n* Low back pain is defined as pain and discomfort below the the costal margin and above the inferior gluteal folds, with or without referred leg pain. \n* It may be experienced as **aching, burning, stabbing, sharp or dull, well-defined, or vague with intensity ranging from mild to severe.**  \n* The pain may begin suddenly or develop gradually. Non-specific low back pain is defined as low back pain not attributed to recognisable, known **specific pathology (e.g. infection, tumour, osteoporosis, ankylosing spondylitis, fracture, inflammatory process, radicular syndrome or cauda equina syndrome).** \n\n### Causes of Lower Back Pain\n\n![](https:\/\/www.consumerhealthdigest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/causes-backpain-info.jpg)\n\n### Low back pain subtypes\n* **Chronic back pain (CLBP)** is defined as low back pain persisting for longer than 7-12 weeks, or after the period of healing or recurring back pain that intermittently affects an individual over a long period of time.\n* **Acute back pain** is defined as low back pain lasting for less than 12 weeks.\n* **Subacute pain** is defined low back pain lasting between six weeks and three months.\n\n### Visual Information\n![](http:\/\/www.aspetar.com\/journal\/upload\/images\/2015111212013.png)","a7334c1e":"## What is lumbar lordosis angle?(Column-3)\n* The mean values of lumbar lordotic angle (LLA), lumbosacral angle (LSA) and sacral inclination angle (SIA) were 33.2 +\/- 12.1 degrees, 11.4 +\/- 4.7 degrees and 26.4 +\/- 10 degrees, respectively. ...
