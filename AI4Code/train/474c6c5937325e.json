The primary forecasting algorithm used in this library is Silverkite, which automates the forecasting. LinkedIn developed GrekKite to support its team make effective decisions based on the time-series forecasting models. As the library also helps interpret outputs, it can become a go-to tool for most time-series forecasting. LinkedIn also had, last year, released a Fairness Toolkit for explainability in machine learning. \n\nOver the years, LinkedIn has been using the Greykite library to provide sufficient infrastructure to handle peak traffic, set business targets, and optimize budget decisions.\n\n![](https:\/\/analyticsdrift.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/LinkedIn-greykite-architecture-1024x481.png)\n\n","5c6cddbc":"## Model Diagnostics\nThe component plot shows how your dataset\u2019s trend, seasonality, and event \/ holiday patterns are handled in the model:","5a265f2d":"# Installation","b135a5e0":"Model summary allows inspection of individual model terms.
