Accelerations and fetal health\n**Here what we are interested in is visualising the statement that \"*accelerations in FHR are normal and healthy and thus should have negative correlation with fetal mortality or should be insignificant*.\"**","06939455":"### Let us describe the column variables:\n1. **Baseline value** : The baseline FHR is the heart rate during a 10 min segment rounded to the nearest 5 beat per min increment excluding periods of marked FHR variability, periodic or episodic changes and segments of baseline that differ by more than 25 beats per min (bpm). The minimum baseline duration must be at least 2 min. \n2. **Accelerations**: Accelerations are short-term rises in the heart rate of at least 15 beats per minute above the baseline, lasting at least 15 seconds. Accelerations are normal and healthy. They tell the doctor that the baby has an adequate oxygen supply, which is critical.\n3. **fetal_movement**: It's often called kick counting. It's done by counting the number of kicks you feel from your baby in the uterus in a certain time period.\n4. **Uterine_contractions**: Contractions are used to gauge the activity of labour. Too few contractions indicate labour is not progressing. Too many contractions can mean uterine hyperstimulation, which can lead to fetal compromise.\n\n5. **Decelerations**: Decelerations are transient episodes of decrease of FHR below the baseline of more than 15 bpm lasting at least 15 seconds\n  * **light_decelerations**:\n  * **Severe_decelerations**:\n  * **prolongued_decelerations**: Prolonged decelerations are defined as a decrease of FHR below the baseline of more than 15 bpm for longer than 90 seconds but less than 5 minutes.\n  \n6. **Short term variability (STV)**:It is the beat-to-beat variation in fetal heart rate. It is the oscillation of the FHR around the baseline in amplitude of 5 to 10 bpm.Low fetal heart rate short term variation (STV) is predictive for hypoxia during the antenatal period.\n  * **abnormal_short_term_variability**\n  * **mean_value_of_short_term_variability**\n \n7. **Long term variability**: Long-term variability is a somewhat slower oscillation in heart rate and has a frequency of three to 10 cycles per minute and an amplitude of 10 to 25 bpm.\n  * **percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability**\n  * **mean_value_of_long_term_variability**\n\nThe rest of the histogram columns (i am assuming) probably don't bear any value or significance to our data since there was no mention of them on the original source page of this data , so i will not be visualising their relationship with the target variable Fetal health in this notebook. ","e112943f":"From this we can see, that the **average\/mean accelerations for suspect and pathological cases is not 0** but the magnitude is still **very small**, and also there is a difference between the average accelerations in case of suspect and pathological cases, with that of the pathological case being higher.\n\n### let us try to see the unique values of accelerations in pathological cases as well as their value counts","0debe29f":"So, we see that maximum number of pathological cases i.e., **145 cases donot experience any accelerations**, and compared to this **only 30 cases experience small accelerations**.\n\nSo For **suspect and pathological cases** we can clearly see that they mostly experience little to no accelerations.\n\n**So, the statement that we had wanted to confirm does seem to hold value in the sense that accelerations are considered to be healthy, and the pathological cases donot experience them.**\n\nLet us also determine the correlation between accelerations in Baseline FHR and fetal health","38a3f77e":"## 5.
