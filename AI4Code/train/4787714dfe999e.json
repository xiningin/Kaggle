Also, I will try to visualize where there are many and few air pollutants at a certain time.\n\n# What is Folium\n\nSee [this kernel](1) for a description of Folium.\n\nFolium is a powerful Python library that helps you create several types of Leaflet maps. The fact that the Folium results are interactive makes this library very useful for dashboard building. \n  \nFolium was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data.\n\n[1]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mrushan3\/data-visualization-with-folium-library\/comments#722403","49e14735":"As you can see on the map above, Seoul is divided into 25 districts.  \nThe location of the measuring stations also shows that one measuring station is located in each districts.","a776aa90":"# Visualization\n\n## Check the location of the measuring station\nSeoul is divided into 25 gu(district).
