In an ensemble several individual models (for instance ResNet18 and VGG16) which were trained on the same corpus, work in tandem and during inference, their predictions are fused by a pre-defined strategy to yield a single prediction. \n\nThe use of np.log2 and np.exp may sometimes produce superior results to plain averaging. This was just an experiment to attest that assertion.\n"}}
