countries**, those that were home to vaccine makers were the first to secure large advance market commitments. They invested public funds into research and development of COVID-19 vaccines and leveraged their purchasing power to make large-scale deals across a portfolio of vaccine candidates.\n* With limited purchasing power, **middle-income countries** used other strategies to get to the front of the queue for advance market commitments. Countries with manufacturing capacity, such as **India and Brazil**, were successful in negotiating advance market commitments with leading vaccine candidates as part of manufacturing agreements.\n* Several middle-income countries, including Russia, and China, also have robust vaccine development programs and were among the first to put forward vaccine candidates and get local approvals. For countries without manufacturing or vaccine development capacity, those with the infrastructure to host clinical trials, such as **Peru**, tried to use that as leverage to negotiate purchase deals.\n* **Low-income countries** that lack manufacturing and clinical testing capacity were largely left out of the deal-making process. Multilateral coalitions help address this gap, such as a pooled procurement approach led by the **African Union** resulting in hundreds of millions of doses purchased for African countries.\n* However, with many manufacturing countries using export restrictions to ensure that doses meet domestic needs first, low-income countries are still at the back of the line for delivery and will likely be waiting until 2022 before they are able to cover even vulnerable populations.","161113c9":"## How can a country participate?\nBased on the information above, I think you can guess that there are broadly two ways of participating:\n- **Advanced Market Commitment(AMC)** : This scheme supports access to COVID-19 vaccines for lower-income economies. Combined, these make possible the participation of all countries, regardless of ability to pay. Countries participating through AMC can either be on the giving or recieving end.\n- **Self-Financing Countries** : For these countries COVAX serves as a critical insurance policy that will significantly increase their chances of securing vaccines, even if their own bilateral deals fail. And by pooling resources through the Facility, participating countries and economies are essentially helping to increase the world\u2019s chances of bringing about COVID-19 vaccines as quickly as possible.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZgGWXSK.png\">\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n## How can COVAX ensure quick vaccine procurement?\n> Normally, manufacturers are reluctant to risk making the significant investments needed to build or scale-up vaccine manufacturing facilities until they have received approval for a vaccine. But in the context of the current pandemic, which is costing the global economy US$ 375 billion every month, this would inevitably lead to significant delay and initially vaccine shortages once vaccines are licensed. To avoid this, the COVAX Facility is working with manufacturers to provide investments and incentives to ensure that manufacturers are ready to produce the doses we need as soon as a vaccine is approved. **The Facility will also use the collective purchasing power that comes from having so many countries participate in order to negotiate highly competitive prices from manufacturers that are then passed on to participants.**\n\nNow that we know about COVAX, let's see how the actual vaccine procurement process has been working out using the data collected by the [Duke Global Health Innovation Center](https:\/\/dukeghic.org\/)","b86ab2d8":"* Among high income countries, vaccines like Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech ,Moderna, Sanofi-GSK are quite popular. \n* Several Upper Middle Income Countries like Brazil,Mexico,Argentina,Malaysia, South Africa have also invested in Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech. Sinovac_Coronavac made in China is mostly bought by Brazil and Indonesia.\n* Oxford-AstraZeneca is also the main choice of Low income countries which could be because it is now manufactured in the Serum Institue of India which would have lowered it's cost for low income countries to afford. Sputnik_V made in Russia is mostly bought by Russia and India.\n* In December 2020, Janssen(J&J) [announced](https:\/\/www.jnj.com\/our-company\/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-in-principle-with-gavi-to-supply-janssens-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-to-lower-income-countries-in-2021) an aggrement with COVAX to supply vaccines to lower income countries in 2021. COVAX also has two of it's own vaccines.","3f2764bb":"## Top 20 Countries who were able to procure the most vaccines","8701094c":"## Why do we need COVAX and how does it work?\nCOVAX is necessary because without it there is a very real risk that the majority of people in the world will go unprotected against SARS-CoV-2, and this would allow the virus and its impact to continue unabated. COVAX has been created to maximise our chances of successfully developing COVID-19 vaccines and manufacture them in the quantities needed to end this crisis, and in doing so ensure that ability to pay does not become a barrier to accessing them.\n\nIt works because:\n- For **lower-income funded nations**, who would otherwise be unable to afford these vaccines, as well as a number of higher-income self-financing countries that have no bilateral deals with manufacturers, COVAX is quite literally a lifeline and the only viable way in which their citizens will get access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n-  For the **wealthiest self-financing countries**, some of which may also be negotiating bilateral deals with vaccine manufacturers, it serves as an invaluable insurance policy to protect their citizens, both directly and indirectly. On the one hand it will provide direct protection by increasing their chances of securing vaccine doses. Yet, at the same time by procuring COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX, these nations will also indirectly protect their citizens by reducing the chances of resurgence by ensuring that the rest of the world gets access to doses too.\n\n","a8c9289b":"This dataset needs a lot of cleaning!","9ee4571a":"* In 2020, many **high-income countries hedged their bets by purchasing enough doses to vaccinate their populations several times over**, even before any candidates were approved and have continued to procure more doses of approved vaccines in 2021, in an effort to receive doses as quickly as possible. \n* Because of global manufacturing constraints, the direct deals made by high-income (and some middle-income) countries mean that a smaller piece of the pie is available for low- and middle-income countries and for equity-focused partnerships like COVAX in 2021.\n* COVAX aims to provide around two billion doses by the end of 2021 to protect high-risk populations around the world. However, it is far from achieving this goal. Many high-income countries funded COVAX but also preferred to take on deals, so invested early in multiple vaccines, securing a place at the front of the production line.\n* Forced to compete with wealthy nations for the limited number of doses coming out in 2021, **COVAX has struggled to shore up sufficient supply**. COVAX deliveries began in February 2021 but, shortly after, faxed significant supply shortages, in part stemming from India's export restrictions. \n\n## How will countries with different economic status be able to vaccinate their population?","32ffa64d":"* USA and EU top the list as they made their first purchases for Oxford-Astrazenca vaccine in May 2020.These were quickly followed by a slate of purchases by high-income and some middle-income countries and, by the end of the summer 2020, the UK, EU countries, and Canada had purchased enough doses through advance market commitments to cover more than their entire populations. \n* The first purchases for low-income countries came in January 2021, through the African Union's pooled procurement approach.\n* Many countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia still have not yet been able to purchase enough vaccine to cover their populations.","f0e239c3":"> **Note that this data was last updated at 26th April 2021, so it does not contain information on procurement deals made after it.** Also, vaccine procurement numbers are not equal to the number of people that have been vaccinated.\n\nLet's take a quick look at the dataset before we start.","94437b29":"# COVAX\n\nIt is an intitative by GAVI(Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization), CEPI(Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) and WHO aimed at **equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines**.
