Before 2001, Sau Paulo used to be the biggest contributor of forest fires owing to its population boom and industrialization.","c6e07162":"# Preface\nForest fires have become a grave threat for fauna and flora of Amazon rainforests. The agriculture sector has been relentlessly pushing into the rainforests, cutting down trees and burning the forests. All this has been taking place under the nose of the ignorant Brazilian Government even after widespread international protests.\nI have done an in-depth analysis of Forest fires in Brazil from 1997 through 2018. The data is obtained from the official website of the Brazilian government.","c91302a7":"Higher number of forest fires happen in the Amazon during the dry season between July and October. They can be caused by naturally occurring events, like lightning strikes, but most are started by people for industrial and agricultural purposes.","1b40a2c8":"## END","58bf9f43":"# Conclusion\n\nForest fires in Brazil don't show any increasing or decreasing trend, but one this sure that not many measures are being taken to curb these. The fires in Amazonas turned the sky dark in city of Sao Paolo which lies 2000 miles east of Amazonas. We can only imagine the damage these fires do to the vegetation and animals living there. Amazon is a very complicated ecosystem which is suffering from deforestation and fires. We need to create awareness about the importance it has for the whole world, not only Brazil. World leaders must come together and care for the forest as if it were their own country.\n","8c1d494d":"As expected, The biggest contributor of forest fires is Mato Grosso, which lies southwest of the Amazon Rainforests. The dense forests of the state has been cut and burned down for agricultural purposes. Deforestation of the rain forest accelerated significantly with emergence of mechanised agricultural tools and farmers getting into the rich forest lands for soy plantations. <br>\nHolding the second place is the coastal state of Paraiba, which has unproportionally large number of fires with respect to its geological area.<br>\n\nStates of Paraiba, Sao Paulo, Rio, Bahia, Piau, Goias, and Minas Gerais are not part of Amazon Rainforest area. The 7 of the states with most number of fires are situated towards the east coast. This can be due to increased urbanisation and industrialisation along the coast.\n\nAs evident in the satellite photos below, In the period of only 12 years, the large portion of forest cover in Mato Grosso has vanished.<br> \nSource: https:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/images\/35891\/deforestation-in-mato-grosso-brazil\n\nSatellite Image of Mato Grosso, August 6, 1992.\n<img src=\"https:\/\/eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov\/images\/imagerecords\/35000\/35891\/matogrosso_l5_1992219_lrg.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"\/>\n\nSatellite Image of Mato Grosso, July 28, 2004.\n<img src=\"https:\/\/eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov\/images\/imagerecords\/35000\/35891\/matogrosso_ast_2006209_lrg.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"\/>"}}
