This will have a positive impact on the accuracy of our models.  <br><br>\n\n\n### Interquartile Range Method:\n<ul>\n<li> <b>Interquartile Range (IQR): <\/b> We calculate this by the difference between the 75th percentile and 25th percentile. Our aim is to create a threshold beyond the 75th and 25th percentile that in case some instance pass this threshold the instance will be deleted.  <\/li>\n<li> <b>Boxplots: <\/b> Besides easily seeing the 25th and 75th percentiles (both end of the squares) it is also easy to see extreme outliers (points beyond the lower and higher extreme). <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n### Outlier Removal Tradeoff:\nWe have to be careful as to how far do we want the threshold for removing outliers. We determine the threshold by multiplying a number (ex: 1.5) by the (Interquartile Range). The higher this threshold is, the less outliers will detect (multiplying by a higher number ex: 3), and the lower this threshold is the more outliers it will detect.  <br><br>\n\n**The Tradeoff: **\nThe lower the threshold the more outliers it will remove however, we want to focus more on \"extreme outliers\" rather than just outliers. Why? because we might run the risk of information loss which will cause our models to have a lower accuracy. You can play with this threshold and see how it affects the accuracy of our classification models.\n\n\n### Summary:\n<ul>\n<li> <b> Visualize Distributions: <\/b> We first start by visualizing the distribution of the feature we are going to use to eliminate some of the outliers. V14 is the only feature that has a Gaussian distribution compared to features V12 and V10. <\/li>\n<li><b>Determining the threshold: <\/b> After we decide which number we will use to multiply with the iqr (the lower more outliers removed), we will proceed in determining the upper and lower thresholds by substrating q25 - threshold (lower extreme threshold) and adding q75 + threshold (upper extreme threshold). <\/li>\n<li> <b>Conditional Dropping: <\/b> Lastly, we create a conditional dropping stating that if the \"threshold\" is exceeded in both extremes, the instances will be removed. <\/li>\n<li> <b> Boxplot Representation: <\/b> Visualize through the boxplot that the number of \"extreme outliers\" have been reduced to a considerable amount. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n**Note:** After implementing outlier reduction our accuracy has been improved by over 3%! Some outliers can distort the accuracy of our models but remember, we have to avoid an extreme amount of information loss or else our model runs the risk of underfitting.\n\n\n**Reference**: More information on Interquartile Range Method: <a src=\"https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/how-to-use-statistics-to-identify-outliers-in-data\/\"> How to Use Statistics to Identify Outliers in Data <\/a> by Jason Brownless (Machine Learning Mastery blog)","9cea3b69":"### Conclusion: \nImplementing SMOTE on our imbalanced dataset helped us with the imbalance of our labels (more no fraud than fraud transactions). Nevertheless, I still have to state that sometimes the neural network on the oversampled dataset predicts less correct fraud transactions than our model using the undersample dataset. However, remember that the removal of outliers was implemented only on the random undersample dataset and not on the oversampled one. Also, in our undersample data our model is unable to detect for a large number of cases non fraud transactions correctly and instead, misclassifies those non fraud transactions as fraud cases. Imagine that people that were making regular purchases got their card blocked due to the reason that our model classified that transaction as a fraud transaction, this will be a huge disadvantage for the financial institution. The number of customer complaints and customer disatisfaction will increase.  The next step of this analysis will be to do an outlier removal on our oversample dataset and see if our accuracy in the test set improves. <br><br>\n\n**Note:** One last thing, predictions and accuracies may be subjected to change since I implemented data shuffling on both types of dataframes.
