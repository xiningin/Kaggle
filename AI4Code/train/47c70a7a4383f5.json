It usually indicates recent and severe weight loss, because a person has not had enough food to eat and\/or they have had an infectious disease.\n\n### severe wasting :\nThis is characterized by a massive loss of body fat and muscle tissue. Children who are severely wasted look almost elderly and their bodies are extremely thin and skeletal.\n\n### stunting : \nStunting is when a child has a low height for their age, usually due to malnutrition, repeated infections, and\/or poor social stimulation.If stunting is a low height for a child's weight, wasting is low weight for a child's height. \n\n### Underweight : \nChildren with low weight-for-age are known as underweight.
