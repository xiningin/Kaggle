First, the technique should be defined in terms of its ability to reduce error in predicting the outcome variable. Next, it should permit direct comparison of measures within a model (that is, X1 is twice as important as X2). Finally, the technique should permit inferences concerning an attribute's direct effect (that is, when considered by itself), total effect (that is, when considered with other attributes) and partial effect (that is, when considered with various combinations of other predictors). Hence, Dominance analysis is both robust and intuitive and its interpretation is also very straightforward.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/dominance-analysis\/dominance-analysis","4dfded1c":"#<font color=\"#EC7063\">Dominance Statistics<\/font>\n\n\"A relative importance measure should be able to describe a predictor's direct, total and partial effect, therefore in the Dominance Statistics, the authors have come up with four different types of Dominance measures. These measures have been conceptualized, defined and formulated by us and are unique to this library. Below are the definitions and interpretations of the measures:\"\n\n\"Interactional Dominance - This is the incremental R2 contribution of the predictor to the complete model. Hence, the Interactional Dominance of a particular predictor 'X' will be the diffrence between the R2 of the complete model and the R2 of the model with all other predictors except the particular predictor 'X'.\nConsider a scenario when they have Y as the dependent variable and four predictors X1, X2, X3 and X4, let R2Y.X1,X2 be the R2 of the model between Y and X1, X2 ; R2Y.X1,X3 be the R2 of the model between Y and X1, X3 so on and so forth. In this case, the interactional dominance of predictor X1 will be R2Y.X1,X2,X3,X4 - R2Y.X2,X3,X4.\nHence, interactional dominance can be interpreted as the incremental impact or incremental variability explained by the predictor in presence of all other predictors.\"\n\n\"Individual Dominance - The individual dominance of a predictor is the R2 of the model between the dependent variable and the predictor. So, the individual dominance of predictor X1 will be R2Y.X1.\nHence, individual dominance can be interpreted as the variability explained by the predictor alone or the quantum of impact that a predictor will have in absence of all other predictors.\"\n\n\"Average Partial Dominance - This is average of average incremental R2 contributions of the predictor to all subset models except complete model and bi-variate (when only one predcitor is present) model.\nHence, this can be interpreted as the average impact that a predictor has when it is available in all possible combinations with other predictors except the combination when all predcitors are available.\"\n\n\"Total Dominance - The last measure of dominance summarizes the additional contributions of each predictor to all subset models by averaging all the conditional values. This consists of averaging the four averaged entries in each column.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/dominance-analysis\/dominance-analysis","56ca0f26":"#Though the file has 3 targets (Pollutant Gases).

The determination of relative importance depends on how one defines importance; Budescu (1993) and Azen and Budescu (2003) proposed using dominance analysis (DA) because it invokes a general and intuitive definition of \"relative importance\" that is based on the additional contribution of a predictor in all subset models. The purpose of determining predictor importance in the context of DA is not model selection but rather uncovering the individual contributions of the predictors.\"\n\n\"In case the target is a continuous variable, the package determines the dominance of one predictor over another by comparing their incremental R-squared contribution across all subset models. In case the target variable is binary, the package determines the dominance over another by comparing their incremental Pseudo R-Squared contribution across all subset models.\"\n\nAuthors & License\n\n\"The Dominance Analysis package is based on the concept developed by Azen and Budescu.
