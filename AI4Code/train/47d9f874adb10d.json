Once it will tak esome time and once done its realy fast to read hdf files.\n\nWhy is it so fast? When you open a memory mapped file with Vaex, there is actually no data reading going on. Vaex only reads the file metadata, such as the location of the data on disk, the data structure (number of rows, number of columns, column names and types), the file description and so on. So what if we want to inspect or interact with the data? Opening a dataset results in a standard DataFrame and inspecting it is as fast as it is trivial.","451d3c0f":"The first step is to convert the data into a memory mappable file format, such as Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, or HDF5.  Once the data is in a memory mappable format, opening it with Vaex is instant (0.052 seconds!), despite its size of over 100GB on disk:","8d358102":"## Introduction\n**Vaex** is an open-source DataFrame library for Python with an API that closely resembles that of Pandas.\n\nNowadays, it becomes increasingly more common to encounter datasets that are larger than the available RAM on a typical laptop or a desktop workstation. Vaex solves this problem rather elegantly by the use of memory mapping and lazy evaluations. As long as your data is stored in a memory mappable file format such as Apache Arrow or HDF5, Vaex will open it instantly, no matter how large it is, or how much RAM your machine has. In fact, the size of the files Vaex can read are only limited by the amount of free hard-disk space you have. If your data is not in a memory-mappable file format (e.g. CSV, JSON), you can easily convert it by using the rich Pandas I\/O in combination with Vaex. See this guide on how to do so."}}
