Education at junior grades**\n\nStudents as young as 4-6 year old, faced their own set of challenges during pandemic. Instead of having lessons in a colorful classrooms, they had to sit in front of a screen. Instead of playing with their community during breaks, they had to see their parents, busy working with their laptops. For such young children, community bonding is an essential part of their childhood and growth.\n\n6% of all the products present in the product catalogue belong to 'LC - Sites, Resources & Reference - Games & Simulations', which shows the importance given to preschool learning. Most of the products, some are well know like, PBS kids, helps preschool and school aged children in each of the four key areas of childhood development \u2013 cognitive, social, emotional and physical.   \n\n# **Observation 9 : Inequity on lines of funding and ethnicity. Linear and strong negative correlation between percentage of student from ethnic background and engagement in preschool learning product. Noticeable association with funding.**\n\nWe found evidences of inequity in lines of funding and ethnicity in this analysis.\n\n* Our analysis on 'LC - Sites, Resources & Reference - Games & Simulations' based on community percentage based participation shows **schools with higher percentage of students from ethnic backgrounds are engaging less compared to those having lesser percentage.**\n\n* **Although, we did not find any strong association of funding with this**. For example, 3 of the districts with more 80% African-American\/Hispanic students from District of Colorado have highest category of funding. **However, we cannot help but notice that, schools with funding less than 10k are far behind in terms participation in preshool products**. It amounts to almost 5x less engagement than that shown by schools with funding between 10k and 16k and almost 2x less engagement compared to that shown by schools with more than 16k funding.\n\n* Also, a look at the growth metrics in both the tables of funding and community based analysis would show, that **engagement in this segment of products has not increased in 2nd,3rd and 4th quarter, compared to what it was in the 1st quarter, when lockdown was not in effect**.\n\n* **School districts with  less than 10k funding shows that heavy decline of 97% in usage in 2nd quarter**, which indicates preschool or junior grade education took a heavy toll post lockdown and it did not show a sign of recovery even in 4th quarter. Other two categories also took a hit over 50%. However, a sign of recovery can be seen.\n\n*  When we analyse growth of usage based on percentage of ethnic students, we can see that districts with more than 80% ethnic students are showing 65% reduced engagement in 4th quarter, compared to 1st quarter. Whereas, **districts with less than 20% ethnic students are showing a recovery to the normal scales of 1st quarter**.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther explorations could be done on lines of content and simplicity of usage of these products to understand, why such disparity exists. Most of these products have an emphasis on education of math and science based subjects. Such disparity may result in difficulty of development of interest and skills in science oriented subjects.","a8691fd0":"**What does it mean?**\n\nThis means % growth in online engagement in 4th quarter compared to that in 1st quarter, when schools were operating normally, has highly positive correlation with GDP per capita income of the states. Students in wealthier states found it easier to engage in online learning.\n\n\n# **Observation 2: Linear growth of positive correlation between% growth of engagement index\/district against GDP per capita income of the states**\n\nIn last observation we saw , how this correlation was for 4th quarter. Now, let us see how it was for 2nd and 3rd one.","bc37d69f":"While it's important to ensure the teacher's development gets priority at all categories above, it's also worth looking up, if school funding has any role to play. A higher funding may result in financial assistance in obtaining certification or paid enrollment in courses or communities that helps teachers in skill development or job support.\n\nFor a better clarity on this, this we decided to categorize the funding status of school districts into 3 groups.\n\n**1. Less than 10k**\n\n**2. Between 10k and 16k**\n\n**3. Above 16k**\n\nAbove grouping ensures, we have enough districts in each category to make an acceptable inference.\n\n# **Observation 8 : strong positive correlation between funding and teachers development**\n\nAn exploration on the same Primary essential function - 'CM - Teacher Resources - Professional Learning' in lines of funding shows a strong positive correlation between funding and teachers development.\n\nDistricts with higher funding is showing substantial higher engagement in teachers development and learning related products. **Correlation here also is quite linear and positive.

States with lower GDP per capita must have had more difficulties and it likely grew more as we went towards 4th quarter or 2nd wave. So, there is no wonder that there is not only a strong positive correlation, but a correlation that grew on every passing quarter, as families and institutions started to face financial difficulties, that became worse and worse. States with higher gdp per capita were better equipped than those with lower GDP per capita.\n   \n   \n### **In terms of gdp per capita segment**\n\nWhile we look at the positive correlation, explained above, it also needs to be noted that, prior to pandemic, districts in 'medium'(Illinois) and 'low' categorized states were collectively doing better than that in'high' gdp per capita segment states.

GDP per capita values are strong indicators of affordability of the people, which influences students, as well as educators. **We assessed overall picture of engagement in different quarters of 2020, first. Then, based on product types, we analysed several factors associated with education, which are equally important, apart from regular engagement. This includes, participation in school safety programs, preschool learning\/junior grade learning, skill development of teachers etc.** \n\nWe made sure, that we capture the change in engagement level in all these aspects from quarterly basis and per district basis, for the ease of comparison.\n\nOur findings show that although the overall engagement index has increased, inequities are indeed present in all of these aspects and sometimes got aggrevated by pandemic, under strong influence of financial factors. Percentage of ethnic communities in school districts also made us see noticeable differences, such as lag in school safety and teacher's development.\n\n# **Approach**\n\n\nFinancial factors always make crucial differences in any aspect of a society and also at district level operations. Education is not an exception.\nThat's why, instead of working with all the states, we have picked only a few, based on availability of no. of school district's data available in the state and GDP per capita value of the state.\n\nThese states are\n\n**1. Connecticut**\n\n**2. Utah**\n\n**3. Illinois**\n\n**4. California**\n\n**5. Ohio**\n\n**6. New York**\n\n**7. Indiana**\n\n**8. Washington**\n\n**9. District Of Columbia**\n\n\nBelow we will explain why these states were chosen over others.\n\nBefore that, let's summarize the data selection method.\n\n\n# **Data selection summary**\n\n1. Above mentioned 9 states have been chosen.\n2. Engagement data involves data on many products, which are not present in product catalogue. We have excluded those.\n3. Districts that do not provide value for any of the features, have been dropped.\n\n","7561496a":"# **Observation 4 : Cities are showing incremental growth, but overall still behind rural and suburb districts by a small margin**\n\nCities are showing steady uptrending engagement per district. Especially, during 2nd wave, districts around cities have been able ramp-up quickly and by a good margin. However, Rural areas,Suburbs and towns struggled in 2nd and 3rd quarter. However, in 4th quarter , when the 2nd wave hit USA, the online engagement is much higher than , what it was in 1st quarter across all types of locale. But, in towns, the increment % is perhaps not good enough.","045add6d":"## **Teacher's development and assistance**\n\nTeaching as a profession possibly became one of the most stressful and difficult jobs during the pandemic. As individuals, teachers not only had to take care of their own families, but to help tons of other families with their children, many of whom arenew and not ready to participate in the mode of online learning. As teachers , it's not always even easy to take care of kids, who are unlikely to engage with proper attention in online classrooms, deprived of the feelings of togetherness. Thus, we all can agree that support to teaching community and their development is a crucial aspect to maintain a healthy education system.\n\n# **Observation 7 : Negative correlation. Districts with higher percentage of student from ethnic backgroud are lagging behind on teachers training and development.**\n\nWe explored the data under Primary essential function - 'CM - Teacher Resources - Professional Learning', as among the 'techer resources' category, this is the one that associates with skill development. Below table\/chart shows that **districts with higher percentage of student from ethnic backgroud are doing rather badly on teachers training and development.** The correlation is quite linear and positive.","1c5fc301":"## **School Safety**\n# **Observation 6 : School safety program is lagging in districts with more than 60% students from ethnic backgrounds**\n\n#### **Motivation**\n\nSchool safety is of huge concern in USA. We have come across mentally troubled children engaging in mass shootings, in recent years too many times. \n\nIn the US, as of January 2018, since 1990, at least 240 school shootings have occurred. School shootings have a 450% increase in the past 30 years, in which there were only 53 shootings.(Source : https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/School_security)\n\nWhile these are extreme events, bullying and humiliation are other aspects, that a lot of students go through. Some of the researches also report inconsistent and biased disciplinary actions taken against African-American students. One such report, by Travis Riddle and Stacey Sinclair, summarizes :\n\n\n***Black students in the United States are subject to disciplinary action at rates much higher than their white counterparts. These disciplinary actions put students at higher risk for negative life outcomes, including involvement in the criminal justice system. Using federal data covering over 32 million students at nearly 96,000 schools, our research demonstrates that the disciplinary gap between black and white students across five types of disciplinary actions is associated with county-level rates of racial bias.*** (Source: https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/116\/17\/8255)\n\n\n\n\n ![school safety 1.png](attachment:0e2c4eb8-b11d-4321-823e-45b2ba53c8d5.png)            ![school safety2.png](attachment:4794eb42-ce7c-40db-afe6-d0922b2bfaa3.png)\n\nSource: https:\/\/bjs.ojp.gov\/sites\/g\/files\/xyckuh236\/files\/media\/document\/iscs20_sum.pdf\n\n\nThis is precisely why, we chose to look at the School safety program (lp id : 48984,https:\/\/www.safeschools.com )\n\n\n#### **Findings**\n\nFor this particular matter, very naturally we used the feature 'pct_black\/hispanic' and a look in the below table will reveal that,\ndistricts with more than 60% students of ethnic background have engaged far too less than districts with less than 60%. Moreover, as this percentage goes low, the overall engagement goes higher.\n\nAlthough, this number does show that a racial factor is at play, but it's not good enough to draw any precise conclusion on the reason behind it. Additional data may help to investigate further. However, authorities should take measures to ensure a higher engagement of student in such programs.","30fd3239":"# **State data**\n\nBelow you can see the information for the selected states and sources for these informations have been mentioned as well.\nWe have gathered GDP per capita value of 2019, student population in 2021, african-american and hispanic-latino population at these states in 2019 and 2020. \nWe also have segmented these states based on gdp per capita value into 4 categories, 'very high','high','medium','low'.\n\n**Average GDP per capita of USA in 2019 was 65k.** \n\n**States having a gdp per capita value lower than this have been categories into 'Low'. Illinois having a value 70k have been categorized as 'medium' and states with value above 80k have been categorized as 'high' and 'very high'.**\n\nGDP per capita value tells us about the financial situation of the people in these states. It gives us hint on affordability, funding of the schools, possible impact of pandemic on families. States with higher GDP per capita value is more likely to sustain a tough financial situation compared to a state with low GDP per capita value.\n\nAlso most of these states have ample no. of school districts available, to draw any inference at state level. Only exception is District of Columbia, where we have data from only 3 school districts. However, given the very high GDP per capita value and a higher african-american population percentage, we have included this state.\n\n","c0c540ab":"# **Observation 1: Strong poistive correlation of .94 between GDP per capita value and % Growth on engagement index\/1k student\/district in 4th quarter** \n\nLet us begin by looking at overall engagement index, irrespective of products that students and teachers used.\n\nWe can see, there have been a huge 3 figure jump in states like Connecticut,Washington,California and District of Columbia at the end of 4th quarter.\n\n1. California has noticeably grown in engagement and in very steady manner.\n2. District of Columbia has 3.5x time gdp per capita value than that of average gdp per capita of USA. The huge increment by percentage in 3rd and 4th quarter can be assumed to have a direct correlation with it.\n3. Ohio is the only state that has shown an overall decline in engagement at the end of 2020.","d4d325c2":"# **Metric explanation**\n\nBefore we start with the analysis, let's have our understanding clear about the metrics, we are going to use overall.\nAs a goal of this competition , we have to analyse how the usage of technology and learning behaviour has changed and so, we have decided to emphasize on following factors to do this analysis.\n\n\n1. **Quarter and not month** : Instead of months, analyse based on quarters. Why? Because 1st quarter in USA, was pretty much normal and day-to-day operations were not significantly hit by the pandemic and most of the schools were cautioned, but remained open. 1st quarter data can be considered as normal usage data. 3rd quarter is all about summer break and 4th quarter in 2020 was all about massive 2nd wave of covid. Values aggregated at quarterly level also helps to reduce noise.\n\n2. **Not Engagement index but Engagement index\/district** : Since most of our analysis related to engagement index will happen in different dimensions, such as, state,gdp per capita segment or 'percentage of African-Amercian\/Hispanic', we need to calculate **page load per thousand student (engagement index)per district** to take a relevant and comparable measurement. No. of school districts are different in each of these dimensions.\n\n3. **% Growth in 2nd,3rd,4th quarter compared to 1st quarter** : Since 1st quarter shows the normal usage data, we will observe, how the usage changed over 2nd and 4th quarter especially , when student had to engage in online learning without any other option. This growth will be measured by percentage change over 1st quarter usage.\n\n    Combinedly, this is what makes up a metric like **'% Growth on engagement index\/1k student\/district in X quarter'**\n\n\n4. **Overall value for 2020** : It's important to observe the state of learning at the end of year, to see, how the financial or community factors influenced the overall performance in 2020. **'Sum of page loads\/per thousand student\/per district in 2020'** is such a metric. \n\n\n# **Summary of findings**  \n\n**1. Strong poistive correlation of .94 between GDP per capita value and % Growth on engagement index\/1k student\/district in 4th quarter**\n\n**2. From quarter to quarter, linear growth of positive correlation between% growth of engagement index\/district against GDP per capita income of the states**\n\n**3. Classroom management related products have grown the most by usage, as per expectation.**\n\n**4. Cities are showing incremental growth, but overall still behind rural and suburb districts by a small margin.**\n\n**5. Huge surge in usage of streaming services. Youtube being the favourite, as always.**\n\n**6. School safety program is lagging in districts with more than 60% students from ethnic backgrounds**\n\n**7. Negative correlation.
