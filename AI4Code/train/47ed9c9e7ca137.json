Researchers found that older women who took 4,400 steps a day had a lower risk of dying than those taking 2,700 steps a day. Death rates declined with more steps taken each day until about 7,500 steps a day, when the benefit leveled off.\n* This information can be used in adververtising to encourage people to buy our smart wearables to help them track steps and complete the daily targets to live healthy.\n* Also, our watch can have the feature notifying people at evening (most preffered time is 5pm since people are most active from 5pm to 7pm according to the analysis)to go for a walk or an exercise including sports if their step count for the day is less than 7500.\n* 12% people are either sleeping for very less hour or far more hour. This percentage grows to 21% if we consider criteria for minimum sleep hours as 5 hours instead of 4 hours.\n \n  \nThis is a significant number and these are people unable to use their full potential, as activesness is found to be very low in these people. Through advertisement people can be educated about importance of right sleep hours thereby encouraging them to buy our products for their sleep tracking. People with 6-9 hours of sleep are the found to be most active.\n\n* We can notify people with less sleep hours to atleast have 6 hours of sleep and encourage people with high sleep hours to reduce to 9-10 hours.\n* High sedentary time is also found to have bad effect on sleep quality. Lower sedentary time is always better but people may have high sedentary time due to various important reasons too. So, 6-9 hours of sleep and 7-13 hours of sedentary time is found to be best combination for high activeness. This can be our goal set in the watch to notify people if they go out of any matrix in the combination.\n \n  \n*Other useful insights and suggestion:*\n \n* From 12pm to 3pm people tend to become less active. This is most probably due to people starting to feel tired from 12pm.\nWe can send notifications around 12pm to do any simple recreational activity (eg. drink water, breathing exercise, recreational break or walk) so people get fresh.\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n**Finally:**\n \n* With the help of the analyzed data we can send users personalized notification for activities like sleep, steps and other similar things. We should market our product not just like any other smart wearable product in the market but as a trusty buddy that notify users on personalized level to complete daily quota of most of the important activities to help them stay fit and healthy.\n* All notifications can be send with a short motivational message so users get enthusiastic about the activity. These details can also be included while advertising to help build strong brand value."}}
