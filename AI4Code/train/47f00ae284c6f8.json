Includes Import and Export.\n**Importing** means buying foreign goods and services by citizens, businesses and government of a country.

A country importing more than it\u2019s export, runs a **trade deficit**. Whereas, a country importing less than it\u2019s exports, create a **trade surplus**.\n\n**Exporting** means goods and services which are produced in one country are purchased in another country. It is produced domestically and sold to someone in a foreign country. Most countries want to increase their exports as it increases the GDP of the country.\n\nIn India At the level of Central Government it is administered by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n\nPrior to the 1991 economic liberalisation,India was a closed economy due to the average tariffs exceeding 200 percent and the extensive quantitative restrictions on imports. Foreign investment was strictly restricted to only allow Indian ownership of businesses.
