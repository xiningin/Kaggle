In other words, a pneumothorax is a situation where air leaks from the lungs and the lungs become smaller (collapsed).  \n\nIn a chest radiograph of a pneumothorax, the collapsed lung is whiter than normal, and the area where the lung is gone is uniformly black.

When X-rays are irradiated to a living organism, different degrees of blackness (degree of blackness) appear on the X-ray film depending on their absorption. Bones are the whitest part of the human body on film because they absorb X-rays and do not allow them to pass through, while lung fields appear relatively black because the lungs contain a lot of air.   \n**Note that this competition image includes a black and white inverted image in addition to the standard image.**\n","4ff35c35":"# 5. Cardiomegaly\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)\n\nCardiomegaly can be caused by many conditions, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, infections, inherited disorders, and cardiomyopathies.  \n\nCardiomegaly is usually diagnosed when the ratio of the heart's width to the width of the chest is more than 50%. This diagnostic criterion may be an essential basis for this competition.  \n\n*Comment from readers*  \n**For the criterion heart-to-lung ratio > 0.5 for the diagnosis of cardiomegaly.  \nThis is only valid if the X-ray is performed while the patient is standing. If the patient is sitting or in bed, this criterion cannot be used.\nAn essential point to know it is to detect air in the stomach: if there is no air in it, the patient is not standing. **  \n","1375b329":"# 1.

Pleural thickening\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)\n\nThe pleura is the membrane that covers the lungs, and the change in the thickness of the pleura is called pleural thickening. It is often seen in the uppermost part of the lung field (the apex of the lung).  \n\n\"It typically involves the apex of the lung, which is called \u2018pulmonary apical cap\u2019. On chest X-rays, the apical cap is an irregular density located at the extreme apex and is less than 5 mm in width\".  \n*Saito, A. et al.

Pleural effusion\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)\n\nPleural effusion is the accumulation of water outside the lungs in the chest cavity. The lungs are located in the chest cavity surrounded by the chest wall. The outside of the lungs is covered by a thin membrane called the pleura. The pleura consists of two layers, one on the chest wall (parietal pleura) and the other covering the lungs (visceral pleura). The fluid that accumulates between these layers is called pleural effusion.  \n\nThe findings of pleural effusion vary widely. They also vary depending on whether the radiograph is taken in the upright or supine position.  \nThe most common findings are as follows. **Elevation of the diaphragm on one side, flattening the diaphragm, or blunting the angle between rib and diaphragm (typically more than 30 degrees)**.

ILD\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)\n\nILD stands for \"Interstitial Lung Disease.\"  \nInterstitial lung disease is a general term for many conditions in which the interstitial space is injured. The interstitial space refers to the walls of the alveoli (air sacs in the lungs) and the space around the blood vessels and small airways.\n\nChest radiographic findings include ground-glass opacities (i.e., an area of hazy opacification), linear reticular shadows, and granular shadows.  ","d1d39d04":"# 3. Atelectasis\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)\n\nAtelectasis is a condition where there is no air in part or all of the lungs. And the lungs are collapsed.
