This regularization aims to shrink the coefficients of the linear regression model therefore reducing the chance of overfitting.

Lasso is better suited for datasets that contain more features as it aims to reduce insignificant coefficients therefore reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.","45cb1e94":"### Multicollinearity\nNot all correlation problems can be detected by looking at the pairplot or correlatio matrix.

Some areas I didn't get a chance to tough on that I would have liked to in this notebook are:\n* Oulier detection and removal\n* Cross validation\n* Random Forest Regression\nAs I continue to grow my knowledge base and understanding I will come back and update this notebook. I'm always trying to learn and improve myself in this area so please feel free to leave comments and questions about this notebook!\n","7cd7094a":"Feature engineering is the process of constructing new features from features already in the dataset. There are many ways to perform feature engineering and one way is through constructing interaction terms between the features. These include current features raised to a power, current features multiplied by each other, etc. They are called interaction terms because they capture interactions within variables.","635d9c1d":"In this notebook we will take a look at Boston Housing Prices dataset on Kaggle. This dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 506 rows and 14 columns. Each row represents a home located in Boston, Massachusetts in 1978 and the 14 columns represent datapoints collected on each home. The purpose of this notebook is to use the data collected about each home to predict it's median home value.
