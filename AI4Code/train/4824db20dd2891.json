Beside it, steps are to be taken to increase the impact of the adds upon other age groups also. Another interesting thing to be considered is the gender. In each and every case we have seen that females are more productive for the organisation than that of the male customers. Hence here also the focus should be kept accordingly. Last but not the list we have found the optimum number of cluters to be 3 by Elbow method.

So it is pretty confirmed that our target audience should be the same.**","1b6c5a1a":"**Observations- Now here we get some interesting stuff. From the first graph it's pretty clear that we have more clicks from Female customers than that of the Males in each of the age groups. But in case of Impressions, we are not focusing that much on the Female customers. Which has to be taken care of. It may increase the Conversion rates also, espcially, in the age group of 30-34, from where we are getting the maximum clicks. From the 3rd graph, it is seen that in some cases we are spending more in Males that Females, which is to be completely reversed. In each and every age group, the investment should be more upon Female customers.\nWhich is most interesting here, that is the total conversion. Here we see similar trends in 30-34, 35-39 and 45-49 years age group. But in 40-44, Females are ahead. I think, if we can focus on the improvement of previously mentioned features, we will also get more conversions from more Female candidates.Clicks per Impression plot also says the same story of Female dominance.
