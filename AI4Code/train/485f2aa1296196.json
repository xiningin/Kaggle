It makes sense to convert this to *categorical* dtype. We'll fill the NA values into an 'Unknown' category. We can see above that most of the buyers have a bra-sizing of 34 or 36.\n* **bust**- We can see by looking at the values which are not null, that bust should be an integer dtype. We also need to handle a special case where bust is given as - '37-39'. We'll replace the entry of '37-39' with the mean, i.e.- 38, for analysis purposes. Now we can safely convert the dtype to int. However, considering that **roughly 86% of the bust data is missing**, eventually it was decided to remove this feature.\n* **category**- none missing; change to dtype *category*.\n* **cup size**- Change the dtype to *category* for this column. This col has around 7% missing values. Taking a look at the rows where this value is missing might hint us towards how to handle these missing values.","81826f10":"* **hips**-\nHips column has a lot of missing values ~ 32.28%! We know this data would possibly be missing because Modcloth never got this data from the user most probably. We cannot remove such a significant chunk of the data, so we need another way of handling this feature. We will bin the data- on the basis of quartiles.\n* **length**- There are only 35 missing rows in length, we'll take a look at these. We saw that most probably the customers did not leave behind the feedback or the data was corrupted in these rows. However, we should be able to impute these values using review related fields (if they are filled!). Or we could also simply choose to remove these rows. For the sake of this analysis, we will remove these rows.\n* **quality**- There are only 68 missing rows in quality, we'll took a look at these. Similarly to length, the customers did not leave behind the feedback or the data was corrupted in these rows. We will remove these rows and convert the dtype to an ordinal variable (ordered categorical).","93748218":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a>\n## Handling Outliers\n\n* **shoe_size**:\nWe can clearly see that the single maximum value of shoe size (38) is an outlier and we should ideally remove that row or handle that outlier value.
