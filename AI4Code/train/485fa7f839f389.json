regions impacted. The source of the outbreak happened in Wuhan in the Hubei province. We will see that this region has by far the highest number of cases (the color or Hubei above is saturated in the scale chosen).","a0383ddd":"# 4. What is the risk for new outbreaks? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"new_sources\"><\/a>\n\nBesides the situation in Hunan which seems to be improving, the main fear of the global community is that new outbreaks elsewhere, which could complicate the fight against the virus as some medical devices like masks are now in short supply globally. \n\nTo assess this on a data point of view, let us look at the speed at which the virus is spreading compared to the first outbreak in Hubei. To be rigorous, numbers should be normalized by the population of the regions and density should be taken into account. We neglect this for the time being and will compare the order of magnitudes only.","cb945308":"We can visualize the cases per province to highlight how the epidemic is so far a problem in Hubei only.","8b6139d1":"# 2. Situation in China <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"china\"><\/a>\n\nGeographically, the epidemic remains pretty localized to the Hubei province, which accounts for more than 80% of the total cases. The Hubei province being an industrial powerhouse of China, it is not surprising to see the region of Guangdong, China's main export hub, coming second. Notice that, at this point, we are talking of very small numbers of around a thousand infected cases (out of a polulation of more than 100 million). The neighbouring provinces of Hubei have equivalent numbers of cases to the Guangdong province. This can also be visualized in the map at the beginning of this notebook.\n\nThe mortality rate related to the coronavirus seems to have stabilized below 3% in Hubei and is much lower in any other region, suggesting that the actual rate will probably be revised to a lower value by the end of the epidemics. Such a mortality rate is rather low compared to other epidemics as SRAS or Ebola. Notice that some provinces as Zhejiang have reported no fatality so far out of 1000 cases, which is surprising. Either the cases in this province are all recent infections and we might expect some deaths in the coming days, either the data have not been transmitted yet.","1ee279a6":"# 3. Situation outside China <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"outside_china\"><\/a>\n\nThe virus has not spread outside China so far, except for a few travellers, and numbers are totally under control, including neigbouring countries like Taiwan, Japan or Thailand. It is striking to see that there are far more infected people on the Diamond Prince cruise ship than in any other region worldwide, which means that current measures have been very effective this far. ","143c606b":"As can be seen from the graphs above, the spread of the virus in the other regions is nowhere near that in Hubei. The daily rate of new infections has fallen safely below 10% in all regions. One exception is the cruise boat (visible in bold on the left side of the graph since the total number is still lower than 400), which is a very specific case that is not relevant for comparing with entire regions (it is probably very interesting for physicians to better understand the propagation mechanisms). It remains a warning that the virus can spread quickly in closed environments where people interact much with each other, and some places could be at risk (hospitals, prisons, schools, some businesses).","c49c2b64":"# Conclusions <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/a>\n\nAt this point (February 16, 2020), numbers seems to show that most of the coronavirus epidemic has remained confined to the Hubei province. This means that measures to contain the virus have been efficient or (and) that the virus does not spread as fast as initially feared.\n\nActually, we could ask ourselves whether these measures were not exaggerated. On a Chinese level, millions of people have been confined in Wuhan and its surroundings and most travel is limited within a significant part of the country. This has had a big impact on people's lives and the economy, with most businesses running in slow mode. Seen from the outside, we might wonder if the tremendous effort to fight the epidemic is a reasonable allocation of resources in a country where basic healthcare is patchy and air pollution is responsible of around 1 million deaths every year ([see here](https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/china\/science\/article\/2166542\/air-pollution-killing-1-million-people-and-costing-chinese)). It is possible that Chinese leaders have felt a weakening in their authority over the last year, among riots in Hong Kong and trade fights with USA, and are willing to pick a visible topic as the virus to show their effectiveness to the public (if we forget the first weeks of the epidemic, when doctors have been arrested under \"fake news\" accusations). It is much easier to gain credit from stopping an epidemic than from a general upscale of health and environmental conditions. This is not to minimize the current efforts though, and we should also be very grateful to doctors and leaders for measures that have prevented a global pandemic. At this point, they seem to be winning a difficult battle.\n\nOn an international level, there has clearly been some overreaction too. Many countries have stopped most of their flights even to Chinese regions that are mostly free from the virus as Beijing or Shanghai and have even repatriated their citizens. It is hard to ignore the political situation in these decisions that seem to stem from a lack of trust towards China, which has probably grown in recent years. On a positive side, scientists have collaborated globally, with Chinese groups sharing the genome of the virus from the start in order to boost research towards a vaccine. Let us hope that such collaborations show the world that humanity gains when people collaborate beyond borders and narrow-minded nationalism.\n\nComing back to the data, the next step would be to enrich the analysis by comparing with other data sources. It would be interesting to put the current epidemic in perspective with other ones (seasonal flu, SRAS, ebola). Also, the major slowdown of the Chinese activity during the last few weeks is a good opportunity to study its impact on other parameters (air pollution, travel patterns, etc.), as discussed in this interesting [article](https:\/\/www.carbonbrief.org\/analysis-coronavirus-has-temporarily-reduced-chinas-co2-emissions-by-a-quarter). ","496a7268":"# Coronavirus: is the fear justified?\n\nThis beginning of 2020 has been marked by the outbreak of a coronavirus epidemic in the industrial city of Wuhan, China. The public reaction to this news has inflated worldwide, with most flights to China cancelled, significant falls in stock markets and massive shutdowns of companies in China.\n\nI am not an epidemiologist and it is hard for me to judge whether these measures are appropiate or not. The point of this notebook is to have a naive look at the actual numbers and use them to raise new questions about the current situation.","b2d3c6a1":"## TOC:\n* [1. Global Trends](#global_trends)\n* [2. Situation in China](#china)\n* [3. Situation outside China](#outside_china)\n* [4.

Global trends <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"global_trends\"><\/a>\n\nLet's have a look at the trend on a worldwide scale. As can be seen below, there has been a pretty steep increase in the cases since the outbreak of the epidemy in the end of January. However, the situation seems to get in control from the lower graph, as the daily number of new cases has been decreasing in relative numbers (the spike on February 12 is related to a change in the methodology of defining when a patient is considered a positive case). The new daily infections has even decreased in absolute numbers in recent days."}}
