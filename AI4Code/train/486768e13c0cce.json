However, it can take a few hours and sometimes days before the molecular test results are back. By contrast, chest radiographs can be obtained in minutes. While guidelines exist to help radiologists differentiate COVID-19 from other types of infection, their assessments vary. In addition, non-radiologists could be supported with better localization of the disease, such as with a visual bounding box.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, you'll categorize the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19. You and your model will work with imaging data and annotations from a group of radiologists.\n\nIf successful, you'll help radiologists diagnose the millions of COVID-19 patients more confidently and quickly. This will also enable doctors to see the extent of the disease and help them make decisions regarding treatment. Depending upon severity, affected patients may need hospitalization, admission into an intensive care unit, or supportive therapies like mechanical ventilation. As a result of better diagnosis, more patients will quickly receive the best care for their condition, which could mitigate the most severe effects of the virus.\n(Copied from Overview Section)","1f291b15":"Here is the evaluation Metrics:\n<br>Standard PASCAL VOC 2010 mean average Precision at IoU > 0.5","10f60184":"**Before even we dive into the EDA, it's time to look at the data one step more closer. \nLet's have a quick look at the files that has been provided:**\n\n* train_study_level.csv - the train study-level metadata, with one row for each study, including correct labels.\n* train_image_level.csv - the train image-level metadata, with one row for each image, including both correct labels and any bounding boxes in a dictionary format.
