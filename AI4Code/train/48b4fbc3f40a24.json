You can, for example, add new items to a list or remove existing items.

The copy function (and slicing an entire list with [:]) creates what is known as a \"shallow copy.\" A shallow copy makes a new list where each list element refers to the object at the same position (index) in the original list. This is fine when the list is contains immutable objects like ints, floats and strings, since they cannot change. Shallow copies can however, have undesired consequences when copying lists that contain mutable container objects, such as other lists.\n\nConsider the following copy operation:","f8c649d3":"You can take a slice (sequential subset) of a list using the syntax [start:stop:step] where start and stop are the starting and ending indexes for the slice and step controls how frequently you sample values along the slice.

Thus, when we append a new value into list1, the second element of list2 and the copy, list3, both change. When you are working with nested lists, you have to make a \"deepcopy\" if you want to truly copy nested objects in the original to avoid this behavior of shallow copies.\n\nYou can make a deep copy using the deepcopy() function in the copy library:","f4e4abb0":"You can use indexing to change the values within a list or delete items in a list:","d401e9ef":"If you provide a negative number as the step, the slice steps backward:","1526e851":"Remove a matching item from a list with list.remove():","0dc2a548":"*Note: Remove deletes the first matching item only.*","f7efcb85":"# Wrap Up","7d77f31c":"Check the length, maximum, minimum and sum of a list with the len(), max(), min() and sum() functions, respectively.","c9943b1d":"If you don't provide a start or ending index, you slice of the entire list:","36955dbe":"# List Indexing and Slicing","410feb73":"You can also add a sequence to the end of an existing list with the list.extend() function:","a94d356d":"# Copying Lists","a0d425ad":"Count the occurrences of an object within a list using the list.count() function:","ae982dc6":"Lists and other Python sequences are indexed, meaning each position in the sequence has a corresponding number called the index that you can use to look up the value at that position.
