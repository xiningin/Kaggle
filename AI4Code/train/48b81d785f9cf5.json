If both\ndimensions have the same value, you can instead specify a single integer (e.g.,\n`pool_size=2`).\n\nThe `strides` argument specifies the size of the stride. Here, we set a stride\nof 2, which indicates that the subregions extracted by the filter should be\nseparated by 2 pixels in both the height and width dimensions (for a 2x2 filter,\nthis means that none of the regions extracted will overlap). If you want to set\ndifferent stride values for height and width, you can instead specify a tuple or\nlist (e.g., `stride=[3, 6]`).\n\nOur output tensor produced by `max_pooling2d()` (`pool1`) has a shape of\n<code>[<em>batch_size<\/em>, 14, 14, 32]<\/code>: the 2x2 filter reduces height and width by 50% each.","3187e696":"### Add evaluation metrics\n\nTo add accuracy metric in our model, we define `eval_metric_ops` dict in EVAL\nmode as follows:\n\n```\neval_metric_ops = {\n    \"accuracy\": tf.metrics.accuracy(\n        labels=labels, predictions=predictions[\"classes\"])\n}\nreturn tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(\n    mode=mode, loss=loss, eval_metric_ops=eval_metric_ops)\n```","36172809":"### Convolutional Layer #2 and Pooling Layer #2\n\nWe can connect a second convolutional and pooling layer to our CNN using\n`conv2d()` and `max_pooling2d()` as before.

The `activation` argument takes the activation function; again,\nwe'll use `tf.nn.relu` to add ReLU activation.\n\nTo help improve the results of our model, we also apply dropout regularization\nto our dense layer, using the `dropout` method in `layers`:\n\n```\ndropout = tf.layers.dropout(\n    inputs=dense, rate=0.4, training=mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN)\n```\n\nAgain, `inputs` specifies the input tensor, which is the output tensor from our\ndense layer (`dense`).\n\nThe `rate` argument specifies the dropout rate; here, we use `0.4`, which means\n40% of the elements will be randomly dropped out during training.\n\nThe `training` argument takes a boolean specifying whether or not the model is\ncurrently being run in training mode; dropout will only be performed if\n`training` is `True`. Here, we check if the `mode` passed to our model function\n`cnn_model_fn` is `TRAIN` mode.\n\nOur output tensor `dropout` has shape <code>[<em>batch_size<\/em>, 1024]<\/code>.","1151afbb":"We store a dict of the tensors we want to log in `tensors_to_log`.

The complete, final code can be\n[found here](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/code\/tensorflow\/examples\/tutorials\/layers\/cnn_mnist.py).\n\n## Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks\n\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-the-art model\narchitecture for image classification tasks. CNNs apply a series of filters to\nthe raw pixel data of an image to extract and learn higher-level features, which\nthe model can then use for classification. CNNs contains three components:\n\n*   **Convolutional layers**, which apply a specified number of convolution\n    filters to the image. For each subregion, the layer performs a set of\n    mathematical operations to produce a single value in the output feature map.\n    Convolutional layers then typically apply a\n    [ReLU activation function](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rectifier_\\(neural_networks\\)) to\n    the output to introduce nonlinearities into the model.\n\n*   **Pooling layers**, which\n    [downsample the image data](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convolutional_neural_network#Pooling_layer)\n    extracted by the convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality of the\n    feature map in order to decrease processing time. A commonly used pooling\n    algorithm is max pooling, which extracts subregions of the feature map\n    (e.g., 2x2-pixel tiles), keeps their maximum value, and discards all other\n    values.\n\n*   **Dense (fully connected) layers**, which perform classification on the\n    features extracted by the convolutional layers and downsampled by the\n    pooling layers. In a dense layer, every node in the layer is connected to\n    every node in the preceding layer.\n\nTypically, a CNN is composed of a stack of convolutional modules that perform\nfeature extraction. Each module consists of a convolutional layer followed by a\npooling layer. The last convolutional module is followed by one or more dense\nlayers that perform classification. The final dense layer in a CNN contains a\nsingle node for each target class in the model (all the possible classes the\nmodel may predict), with a\n[softmax](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Softmax_function) activation function to\ngenerate a value between 0\u20131 for each node (the sum of all these softmax values\nis equal to 1). We can interpret the softmax values for a given image as\nrelative measurements of how likely it is that the image falls into each target\nclass.\n\nNote: For a more comprehensive walkthrough of CNN architecture, see Stanford University's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition course material](https:\/\/cs231n.github.io\/convolutional-networks\/).","12f01541":"### Set Up a Logging Hook {#set_up_a_logging_hook}\n\nSince CNNs can take a while to train, let's set up some logging so we can track\nprogress during training.

Some hard automation tasks can be solved easily with that while this was impossible to achieve earlier with classical algorithms.\n\nMoore's Law about exponential progress rates in computer science hardware is now more affecting GPUs than CPUs because of physical limits on how tiny an atomic transistor can be. We are shifting toward parallel architectures\n[[read more](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Does-Moores-law-apply-to-GPUs-Or-only-CPUs)]. Deep learning exploits parallel architectures as such under the hood by using GPUs. On top of that, deep learning algorithms may use Quantum Computing and apply to machine-brain interfaces in the future.\n\nI find that the key of intelligence and cognition is a very interesting subject to explore and is not yet well understood. Those technologies are promising.\n\n\n<a name=\"online-classes\" \/>\n\n## Online Classes\n\n- [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/machine-learning) - Renown entry-level online class with [certificate](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/account\/accomplishments\/verify\/DXPXHYFNGKG3).

We can find the index of this\nelement using the `tf.argmax`\nfunction:\n\n```\ntf.argmax(input=logits, axis=1)\n```\n\nThe `input` argument specifies the tensor from which to extract maximum\nvalues\u2014here `logits`.

This behavior can be changed using the\n<code><em>data_format<\/em><\/code> parameter; defined as follows:\n\n*   `batch_size` \u2014Size of the subset of examples to use when performing\n    gradient descent during training.\n*   `image_height` \u2014Height of the example images.\n*   `image_width` \u2014Width of the example images.\n*   `channels` \u2014Number of color channels in the example images. For color\n    images, the number of channels is 3 (red, green, blue). For monochrome\n    images, there is just 1 channel (black).\n*   `data_format` \u2014A string, one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`.\n      `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape\n      `(batch, ..., channels)` while `channels_first` corresponds to\n      inputs with shape `(batch, channels, ...)`.\n\nHere, our MNIST dataset is composed of monochrome 28x28 pixel images, so the\ndesired shape for our input layer is <code>[<em>batch_size<\/em>, 28, 28,\n1]<\/code>.\n\nTo convert our input feature map (`features`) to this shape, we can perform the\nfollowing `reshape` operation:\n\n```\ninput_layer = tf.reshape(features[\"x\"], [-1, 28, 28, 1])\n```\n\nNote that we've indicated `-1` for batch size, which specifies that this\ndimension should be dynamically computed based on the number of input values in\n`features[\"x\"]`, holding the size of all other dimensions constant. This allows\nus to treat `batch_size` as a hyperparameter that we can tune. For example, if\nwe feed examples into our model in batches of 5, `features[\"x\"]` will contain\n3,920 values (one value for each pixel in each image), and `input_layer` will\nhave a shape of `[5, 28, 28, 1]`. Similarly, if we feed examples in batches of\n100, `features[\"x\"]` will contain 78,400 values, and `input_layer` will have a\nshape of `[100, 28, 28, 1]`.\n\n### Convolutional Layer #1\n\nIn our first convolutional layer, we want to apply 32 5x5 filters to the input\nlayer, with a ReLU activation function. We can use the `conv2d()` method in the\n`layers` module to create this layer as follows:\n\n```\nconv1 = tf.layers.conv2d(\n    inputs=input_layer,\n    filters=32,\n    kernel_size=[5, 5],\n    padding=\"same\",\n    activation=tf.nn.relu)\n```\n\nThe `inputs` argument specifies our input tensor, which must have the shape\n<code>[<em>batch_size<\/em>, <em>image_height<\/em>, <em>image_width<\/em>,\n<em>channels<\/em>]<\/code>. Here, we're connecting our first convolutional layer\nto `input_layer`, which has the shape <code>[<em>batch_size<\/em>, 28, 28,\n1]<\/code>.\n\nNote: `conv2d()` will instead accept a shape of `[<em>batch_size<\/em>, <em>channels<\/em>, <em>image_height<\/em>, <em>image_width<\/em>]` when passed the argument `data_format=channels_first`.\n\nThe `filters` argument specifies the number of filters to apply (here, 32), and\n`kernel_size` specifies the dimensions of the filters as `[<em>height<\/em>,\n<em>width<\/em>]<\/code> (here, <code>[5, 5]`).\n\n<p class=\"tip\"><b>TIP:<\/b> If filter height and width have the same value, you can instead specify a\nsingle integer for <code>kernel_size<\/code>\u2014e.g., <code>kernel_size=5<\/code>.<\/p>\n\nThe `padding` argument specifies one of two enumerated values\n(case-insensitive): `valid` (default value) or `same`. To specify that the\noutput tensor should have the same height and width values as the input tensor,\nwe set `padding=same` here, which instructs TensorFlow to add 0 values to the\nedges of the input tensor to preserve height and width of 28. (Without padding,\na 5x5 convolution over a 28x28 tensor will produce a 24x24 tensor, as there are\n24x24 locations to extract a 5x5 tile from a 28x28 grid.)\n\nThe `activation` argument specifies the activation function to apply to the\noutput of the convolution. Here, we specify ReLU activation with\n`tf.nn.relu`.\n\nOur output tensor produced by `conv2d()` has a shape of\n<code>[<em>batch_size<\/em>, 28, 28, 32]<\/code>: the same height and width\ndimensions as the input, but now with 32 channels holding the output from each\nof the filters."}}
