The specific goals include:\n> - What is the average price of each distinct brand listed?\n> - Which brands have the highest prices?\n> - Which ones have the widest distribution of prices?\n> - Is there a typical price distribution (e.g., normal) across brands or within specific brands?\n> - Correlate specific product features with changes in price.\n\nOne thing to note before we begin... This dataset includes a lot of information on products that aren't actually shoes! Items such as watches and other accessories seem to have been mistakenly included during the original data gathering process (likely due to mislabeled categories). Fully correcting for this would require a decent amount of manual work \/ advanced regex and NLP and is outside the scope of this kernel. As a result, please interpret the final outputs with a grain of salt and as not fully reflective of reality beyond this dataset. That being said, the general code and methodologies used within should still be a useful learning experience!\n\nLet's dive in!","b1029399":"Some finishing touches by adjusting the data types:","5fea6ff3":"# Imports & Settings","2ebdb17a":"### Missing Values","f3bc2675":"\n## Which ones have the widest distribution of prices?","e58d3c0e":"The distribution of all prices for brands with more than 50 observations is heavily skewed to the right. Let's takes a look at what happens when we apply a log transformation:","f55cecc2":"Much better! \n\n## Cleaning Final Dataframe\n### Prices\nThe two columns for price (`prices_amountmin` and `prices_amountmax`) caught my eye since the first five rows in the dataframe have the same value for both. To investigate this further, let's check what percentage of the rows have the same value in both columns.","3e593e70":"Starting to get somewhere, but there's still more columns to drop:","f0f45cff":"The answer to this question is up for debate depending on the interpretation of the question. \"Widest distribution\" could be defined in a number of ways including:\n- Standard deviation (nominal or as a percentage)\n- The interquratile range (IQR)\n- Difference between maximum and minimum values\n\nMost of this information can be captured by utilizing boxplots. The boxplots could be ordered in a number of ways, but using the median tends to yield a fairly orderly result.","01e9b1b7":"## Dropping Columns\nThe data is fairly messy as it currently stands. There are lots of missing values (some columns are even entirely missing) and there are various data types that need corrected. Given the limited number of questions being answered for this task, a good chunk of the available data is irrelevant. Right off the bat, let's eliminate any columns that are missing 80% or more of their values. This will help reduce the size of the data we're working with and make further cleaning processes a bit easier.","37b00105":"So it appears that the prices are log-normally distributed. We can check the distribution of an individual brand with more than 50 observations by creating a simple function.","67a5a079":"It appears that some data was incorrectly placed in the `prices_currency` column in the original dataset.
