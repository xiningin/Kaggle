","51da686a":"Interesting... I would have thought for sure that this passage would have been either significantly more or less difficult than the other passages but I guess not. \n\nAgain, the competition host says this observation is correct (i.e., not a typo) so it just goes to show that things happen when there are human raters involved. \n\nLet's move on. \n\n#### _What is the relationship between_ ```target``` _and_ ```standard_error```_?_","2d1cf91e":"#### _Median?_","c476cb8a":"#### _25th Percentile_","329ea26f":"Again, a definitive set of steps does not exist for this stage but I like to start by asking and answering the [Five W's and 1 H](https:\/\/www.workfront.com\/blog\/project-management-101-the-5-ws-and-1-h-that-should-be-asked-of-every-project)\n\n* Who\n* What\n* When\n* Where \n* Why \n* How\n\nSo, in no particular order, let's start with: \n#### _Where did the data come from?_\nFrom the [overview](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/commonlitreadabilityprize\/overview\/description) we can infer that data was produced by [CommonLit](https:\/\/www.commonlit.org\/en), a non-profit EdTech company focused on promoting literacy, in conjunction with the [Applied Linguistics and ESL Department at Georgia State University](https:\/\/alsl.gsu.edu\/). \n\n#### _How much data do we have?_","e0c3415e":"Fascinating - approximately 20% of our observations are texts rated at the elementary (aka, up to 6th grade) and high school (i.e. 9th - 12th grade) levels meaning 60% of texts were rated at the middle school level. \n\nI'd be fascinated to know if the experts who selected the passages for training purposes expected this type of distribution; it's tempting to think that books for your children and high school students are obvious whereas books for middle school students have more gradations but that may not be the case. \n\nLet's come back to this later.\n\n#### _How many duplicates do we have?_","e41916f9":"As expected, given the scope of the challenge, we have a mix of strings and floats. \n\nLet's see some examples: ","9008bdd9":"Now for the easy part: defining our scaled values.","83f2aae6":"Excellent! Next question that comes to mind is: \n\n#### _What are the key features?_ \n\nWe're fortunate that this dataset has clear variable names so we can surmise: \n\n* ```id```: unique identifier for each text sample\n* ```excerpt```: text passage to be used for modeling\n* ```target```: difficulty rating of the text\n* ```standard_error```: variance in scoring amongst the raters\n\n> _What about_ ```url_legal``` _and_ ```license```_?_ \n\nSince those variables [won't be available at test time](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/commonlitreadabilityprize\/data), they shouldn't be used for training and will subsequently be dropped. \n\n#### _Who are the raters?_\nAccording to Dr. Crossley, [teachers from the target grade ranges rated the samples, with a majority of teachers drawn from sixth through 10th grade](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/commonlitreadabilityprize\/discussion\/240423).\n\n#### _How were the teachers selected?_\nUnfortunately, that information hasn't been provided yet but [watch this space](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/commonlitreadabilityprize\/discussion\/240423#1347995). \n\n#### _How was the target computed?_\nTeachers were given a pair of passages and asked, [of these two, which is easier for a child to understand?](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/commonlitreadabilityprize\/discussion\/240423#1322910) Target scores were then computed based on the responses of the teachers. \n\n> _OK, but how were the scores computed?_\n\nThis one's complicated so, in the spirit of T.S. Eliot who wrote,[\"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal\"](https:\/\/www.uvu.edu\/arts\/applause\/posts\/stealing.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGood%20artists%20borrow%2C%20great%20artists%20steal.%E2%80%9D&text=Eliot's%20dictum%3A%20%E2%80%9CImmature%20poets%20imitate,or%20at%20least%20something%20different.), I'm going to direct you to [Shahebaz's fabulous notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/commonlitreadabilityprize\/discussion\/240886) which provides an in depth explanation and\/or read this [paper](https:\/\/www.jstatsoft.org\/article\/view\/v012i01\/v12i01.pdf) which was recommended by the competition host in this [discussion](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/commonlitreadabilityprize\/discussion\/236671#1296867).\n\n#### _How many missing values are there?_"}}
