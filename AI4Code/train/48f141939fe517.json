","3e4f0f40":"### Upon analyzing the graphs, we can come to the following deductions-\n\n- Majority of the patient population that lost their lives belonged to the 60+ age group.\n\n- Out of these, those in the age group 70-90 showed the highest mortality rate towards the virus. The reason here is the weakened immunity due to the old age of the patients. In the analysis of how age affected the spread of the disease, there too we noticed that those in age groups 60-80 caught the infection relatively easily.\n\n- On the other hand, those in the the age group 20-40 showed a comparatively much lower mortality rate. Here too, most of the patients were either immuno-compromized, or had a medical history of some kind.","7e2462b2":"##### To begin the project, let's first observe the spread of the pandemic in some countries like China, Italy, US, Spain, France and Germany that are believed to be the hotspots of the pandemic. This might give us an actual idea of how serious the outbreak is.  \n\nFor this, we will observe a plot that shows how, and at what rate the pandemic spread in these countries. \n\nBut before we do that, let us see what different types of graphs are observed in the spread of a pandemic and also what the ideal graph for a country should look like so that its healthcare services should be able to efficiently handle the pandemic.\n\n![Pandemic Spread Graph (Source: CDC)](https:\/\/media.winnipegfreepress.com\/images\/cp-coronavirus-flattening-the-curve.png)","9977f564":"### After analysing the above graph, here's what one can deduce from the visualization-\n\n* Age groups 50-59 are at most risk, followed by those in age groups 60-69.\n\n* It is observed that the number of cases in children and teenagers is relatively low. A lot of factors affect this data. Generally, younger people tend to have a stronger immunity as compared to their elders. Another major reason can be timely lockdowns and declaration of holidays for schools and universities, which significantly reduced the chance of exposure of those in age group 0-19 to the virus. Also, in the northern hemisphere, summer vacations, and in the southern hemisphere, winter vacations were a reason that confined the younger population to their homes, thus reducing the danger for them.\n\n* If we look at the data, the workforce of the population, i.e., people in age groups 20-60 were the worst affected. A major reason for this is that while lockdowns or preventive measures were being initiated, industries, supermarkets and shops were sill in operation. Governments of many countries, in the name of 'saving their economies' didn't pay much attention to the risk the adults were being exposed to. This is the main reason why this outbreak turned into a pandemic.\n\n* Now, if we observe the data for senior citizens, i.e., people in age group 60+, we see that people in age group 60-79 were exposed to the virus on a larger scale as compared to those 80+. The reason here is that people aged 60-80 are more social as compared to those 80+. Most of them retiries, spread their time with friends\/acquaintances. As a result, community spread was much more severe in case of this age group. On the contrary, people aged 80+ are usually confined to their homes\/old-age(retirement) homes. They are comparatively less social. This is the reson the number of cases in the 80+ age group is relativelty lower.  "}}
