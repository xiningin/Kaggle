Earlier people used to make huge mistakes based on rumours but, now since everyone is commected via. internet it has become easier for malicious people to spread false news for their own agenda which in turn affects a huge number of people resulting most people to go towards a specific extreme. This causes a huge disturbance in the delicate balance of this world and among peoples which in turn may result in riot, violence, war, political disturbance, etc. As have been gifted with so many powerful tools in data science and Python to perform millions of desired operaions as we want, it is our responsibility to find solutions to filter out these kind of fake news from real ones. \n\nAs, for right now I found that the PassiveAggressiveClassifier is a pretty solid algorithm to segregate the real news and the fake news. In a way LinearSVC also can perform this operation well but, for now I will stick to PassiveAggressiveClassifier since the results I am getting from it are quite promising. Below you will find all the codes I used to program this model and detect real news and false news.\n\n*Hope you will like it.*","b81ae344":" *We can see that the dataset is pretty much balanced which is very good thing because the data is not biased towards one side.*","ba8dbd48":"# FAKE NEWS DETECTOR\n# ........................................","08f19aef":"### Let us read the dataset.","c958cecf":"### Now, let us split the data into training and testing data set.","dfc7755b":"As we can see the accuracy is more than 90% which is a pretty impressive but, let us see how real and fake news this model could detect correctly.","ef47a499":"Based on the output above we can see how our data looks like.
