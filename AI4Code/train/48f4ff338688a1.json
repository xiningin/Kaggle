We all have a role to play in mitigating climate change by reducing carbon emissions. Singapore\u2019s building sector consumes up to 38% of the nation\u2019s electricity. With a focus on addressing the environmental impact caused by buildings, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) of Singapore formulates and charts green building policies to track and improve the energy efficiency of the built environment in Singapore under our Green Building Master plan. These policies have met with much success, helping to trigger a green movement in the built environment sector, not just in Singapore, but also the region.\n\n*Source: Extracted from BCA building energy benchmarking report 2014*","98241582":"# Conclusion\n\nRefer to above coding study, there are total 17 types of buildings included in the data set. \n\nOut of the 17 types of building, refer to the average energy consumption analysis, the top three highest energy consuming buildings are private hospital, retail and general hospital. This analysis data provides the useful reference for understanding of energy consumptions for different types of buildings. "}}
