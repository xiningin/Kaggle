sales, customers tend to spend more when there are discounts. An average sales transaction with discounted products is USD\\\\$233 as compared to a lower USD\\\\$227 where there are no discounts. In total, the difference amounts to a notable USD\\\\$200k increase in sales value when there are discounts.\n\n> The average price of a discounted product is USD\\\\$63 as compared to USD\\\\$59 for a non-discounted product. This is indicative that discounts are offered on more expensive products to promote affordability.\n\n> Considering both average and total sales quantities, customers tend to buy more products when there are discounts. Although the average quantity in a sales transaction that includes discounted products is 3.77 as compared to a higher 3.81 where there are no discounts, the total difference amounts to a notable 1.3k of additional products sold when there are discounts.\n\n> However, discounts will affect profits. On average, the sale of a discounted product results in a loss of USD\\\\$1 as compared to a USD\\\\$18 gain in profits for a non-discounted product, and a sales transaction that includes discounted products will result in a loss of USD\\\\$7 as compared to a USD\\\\$67 gain in profits where there are no disounts. In total, losses amount to USD\\\\$35k when there are discounts, as compared to a profit of USD\\\\$321K when there are no discounts. Despite this, the Superstore cannont escape from giving out discounts on their products, especially during festivals, end-of-season sales, and clearance sales that are necessary to make space in their warehouses for newer and more current stocks. Instead, Superstore is advised to reduce overall discount levels to minimise losses, and focus on implementing other promotional strategies to ensure increasing profitable sales and consistent future gains in long term customers.","1b21f2fc":"Thank you!","8864a123":"A state-wise analysis is carried out below.","70e64989":"> All regions have similar sales and profit.

Analysis is mostly focused on the relationship between these. \n\nmatplotlib.pyplot graphics library is imported for the visualisations of figures. It is convenient as it has good reproducibility of scientific figures, for example when regenerating a figure using updated data, appearance, latex labels and texts, and aspects such as orientation. %matplotlib inline is used to configure the output of the figures to be embedded in the Jupyter notebook file, instead of opening a new window each time.\n\nData visualisation will include suitable graphs that are descriptive and comparative to effectively communicate both abstract and concrete ideas. Histogram density plots are chosen to illustrate the overall data distribution, as well as the data distributions of Sales and Profit. Seaborn is used for a terser Application Programming Interface (API).\n\nKernel density estimate (KDE) plots, using the kde() method, will visualise the overall distribution through a continuous probability density curve. This generates two histogram density plots and their continuous probability density curves for Sales and Profit in the same figure space, and clearly differentiates them by specifying different colours in its parameters. The xlim() method restricts plot range to 0 and above for meaningful visualisations, since it is impossible for Sales to have a negative value and more interest is placed on Profits in this case study.","84a3a2c9":"A correlation heatmap is used to list all the correlation coefficients in order to identify multicollinearity, in other words high intercorrelation above an absolute value of 0.5 between the a pair of attributes. For a pair of attributes with multicollinearity, one of them will be dropped since it would be redudant to include both of them with almost mirroring values. Another reason is to prevent overfitting.\n\nThe correlation will compare and describe the linear connection and relationship between pairs of features, through the type of correlation and its strength.

As a result, average profit is lower. Another likely explanation is that Profit will increase as Quantity increases, but not on a linear scale.\n\n> Discount and Sales have little to no linear correlation.
