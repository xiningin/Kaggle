Let's also change our index to the date.","42713654":"By Eric Wilson","b7fe9f8d":"Although when the actual values are compared side by side, there is no really perceptable change, when we look at the Day Change alone, there is a surprising amount of volatility around the start of 2018, and a pretty extreme amount from late 2020 onwards.\n\n.02 as both a high and low equates to 2 cents, which is probably less than the amount of electricity it has taken to run these programs to this point. However, if a Dogecoin costed even 10 cents, that's a 20% fluctuation - if the stocks in my 401k had a daily change like that, I'd probably have nothing but gray hair.","33590571":"As of April 8th, 2021, the date which has seen the highest overall value of Dogecoin is February 8th, 2021, with the range of February 7th to February 10th being represented as second and third place among the Close, High, Average, Volume, and Impact values. \n\nInterestingly, January 29th, 2021, saw the most trades occur and represented the highest value of transactions in Dogecoin history, even though the price per unit was not at it's peak.","4ae15b6e":"In spite of Dogecoin not even reaching 25 cents in value at peak (enough for one round of Street Fighter, in an arcade, in 1998), it has still managed to see over 25 billion transactions in a single day, for a total value of money being exchanged at over 1.2 billion dollars. \n\nThough no where near the worth of Bitcoin or the blue chips, this data has definantly given me a deeper appreciation for Dogecoin, and I hope this notebook has either given you a deeper appreciation for this cryptocurrency, or, at the least, has entertained you.","4ce6c473":"As should be expected, there is essentially no perceptable difference between opening and closing values; the closing value on a Monday is the opening value on a Tuesday. If there were discrepancies, this would probably mean there is an issue within the data.\n\nNow, let's use the added Day Change column to let the computer do the work for us, to see where the real changes are.","e23d5eae":"Let's take a look at highs and lows to see if there are any \"whoa, what's happening there?\" moments for specific days (sharp peaks and \/ or troughs in relation to one another).","69754511":"### Additional Questions \/ Research","6ddf942a":"Each column has an equal amount of missing values - let's explore that further.

Some useful data would be:\n\n* The price trend of Bitcoin, to compare the most popular cryptocurrency with Dogecoin. Is Dogecoin an inferior good, that only those who can't afford to buy into Bitcoin opt for, or has the boom in price of Bitcoin led speculators to assume Dogecoin will grow in a similar way?\n\n* The price trend of the Stock Market, which is the most widely invested in and accepted investment tool in the US. Especially if ROI rates could be considered between crypto-investments and Wall Street Investments, and compared with some of the other events happening around that time (Gamestop, anyone??)\n\n* The yield of the 10 Year T Note. This is a staple of ensured investment and, honestly, if the US Gov't defaults on a bond, there's a good chance losing a few thousand dollars is going to be the least of your worries, assuming you are from the US. With rates finally climbing up following this trend, and the supply of cheap loans starting to contract, this may have led to a decline in Dogecoin attractiveness. It has been argued, however, that cheap money makes for risky investments, since stable investments aren't paying much at all. \n\n* How has Dogecoin faired since NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have risen in popularity? Have NFTs pulled any of the crypto investors away, and, if so, by how much?","b4ae80c4":"Let's check if there is any missing data.","b14c7de0":"### Dates of Record","8c50f6c1":"![](https:\/\/image.cnbcfm.com\/api\/v1\/image\/106836865-1612779436680-gettyimages-1299388491-yn_dogecoinillustration_011.jpeg?v=1612779511&w=678&h=381)","fc5e4538":"Statistically, the dots are outliers, accounting for less than half of one percent of all values.

The value that it held in early 2021 has begun to come down; there could be an additional peak or growth in the future, as there have been in the past (but, if it was truly predictable, I would probably be investing at the lows, waiting to sell off at the next peak, and not giving out any analysis freely, at the least).","51fda4bd":"Cryptocurrency - is it the precious metals of this millenium, or just another passing fad, to be traded, hoarded, and then sold off at yard sales for $1 a piece, like the beanie babies once Y2K passed? \n\nMaybe I'm late to the game, but I've heard an increasing number of people talking about Dogecoin. Let's take a look at this data, graciously available on Kaggle (thank you to Dhruvil Dave), and see how Dogecoin has evolved.","8521c737":"Let's add four values: Day Change, Day Range, Average Price, and Impact.\n\n*     Day Change will be Close minus Open, in order to show the overall change in value over the course of each day. Naturally, the higher the worth of Dogecoin, the higher the change should be expected.\n\n*     Day Range will be High minus Low, to show the volatility of Dogecoin on each day. Similar to Day Change, the higher the worth of Dogecoin, the higher volatility should be expected in terms of Day Range.\n\n*     Average Price will be a little tricky: we'll take the average of the Open, Close, High, and Low values. The term \"average\" is used loosely, due to how volatile value can be during each day.\n\n*     Impact will also be tricky; we'll multiply Average Price by the volume for the day. In theory, this will give us a standard (again using the terms \"standard\" and \"average\" loosely) value to the amount of money taking place in Dogecoin transactions in a day. "}}
