Here's your coding interview problem for today.\n\nThis problem was asked by Glassdoor.\n\nAn imminent hurricane threatens the coastal town of Codeville. If at most two people can fit in a rescue boat, and the maximum weight limit for a given boat is k, determine how many boats will be needed to save everyone.\n\nFor example, given a population with weights [100, 200, 150, 80] and a boat limit of 200, the smallest number of boats required will be three.
