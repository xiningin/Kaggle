These newly extracted variables are called Principal Components. You can refer to this article to learn more about PCA. For your quick reference, below are some of the key points you should know about PCA before proceeding further:\n\nA principal component is a linear combination of the original variables\nPrincipal components are extracted in such a way that the first principal component explains maximum variance in the dataset\nSecond principal component tries to explain the remaining variance in the dataset and is uncorrelated to the first principal component\nThird principal component tries to explain the variance which is not explained by the first two principal components and so on\n\nAs the dataset is small having less features we will use only 2 components or dimensions to see how much much variance it is covering\n","ecd9b03b":"# Reading the dataset"}}
