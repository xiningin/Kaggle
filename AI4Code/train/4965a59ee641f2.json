Consequently our raw pixel values are not given as HU units. \n* But we can transform the image to HU units by scaling with the slope and intercept.\n* Then we can see that mode is located at -1000 (HU of air).\n\nTo understand this part, the following tutorial was extremely helpful for me: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/gzuidhof\/full-preprocessing-tutorial. Thank you a lot @Guido Zuidhof. Let's try to understand the -2000 and -3000 cases of rescaled images:","1cf3a3cc":"Let's check whether this matches the number of train images we have:","d0303456":"## Target distribution <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"targets\"><\/a>","bc0d4d65":"Ok, as expected.","4246d545":"We can clearly see that we have to make several predictions for one image id:\n\n* epidural \n* subdural \n* subarachnoid \n* intraparenchymal \n* intraventricular \n* any - this one indicates that at least one subtype is present, hence it tells us if the patient has IH or not.","fb82f67d":"We need the same for our test data later:","a46dfde1":"### Insights\n\n* The first extreme case seems to be faulty. After windowing to a center of 40 and width of 150 we can't see the same nice patterns as for the min and the median cases.\n* By windowing to the same window we can't see differences between the median and the min case. But pixel values differ! ","41178ffe":"# Prepare to start <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"prepare\"><\/a>","29288117":"Now, let's setup a window that is centered at 30 and has a width of 80.
