Try to avoid engaging enemy from close quarters. Always try to shoot enemies from a distance.\n2. Try to take proper position in the battle, especially by walking, since it is stealthier and harder to detect and hence increases the chance of having to face an enemy\n3. Fight enemies only when required, do not seek out extra enemies. Kill points make no difference to the outcome but a higher kill ranking (killPlace) results in a lower probability of winning.\n4. When required, kill an enemy, just not knock them out or damage them. There is very high correlation between damage dealt, players knocked out and kills, and all three have a high correlation with win percentage. This means it is best to make sure that the enemey is dead and not just injured.\n5. It is best to take an enemy out with a headshot because it has a positive correlation with winning. Combining this point with point 1, it is understood it is best to use a sniper to take enemies down from a distance to increase chances of winning\n6. Match duration has no correlation with winning. A match may be fought both quickly or by camping and hiding and it would not have much affect on the outcome.\n7. It is extremely helpful to take repeated boosts and keeping healed all the time. Both these factors have very high corellation with win percentage and therefore recommended.\n8. It does not make a difference on how many weapons a player has acquired, it has no correlation with win percentage. An average player uses 2-5 weapons in a match.","fda76972":"##### Conclusion: It shows a positive correlation with wining, showing that players who position themselves well by moving with the help of vehicles are better off for winning the match","59170ccd":"##### Conclusion: Damage dealt has correlation with winning but it is not very prominent","e495ebd4":"## Assessing assists","9103b86f":"## Assessing killStreaks","df8680da":"# Univariate analysis","3575ef20":"### Conclusion: It is observed that the number of weapons acquired throughout the match has no particular relevance to winning a match","cbe3457b":"## Assessing rankPoints","ac480bce":"# Health moves\n\n##### In this section we shall see how making health moves affect the probabilty of winning the game","f0810b4a":"## Assessing revives","a31498e4":"# Summing up the most influential points\n### This section contains graphs of the factors that influence the chance of winning (or losing) a match the most","cc73812a":"# Function to assess discreet variables","28ac227e":"## Assessing killPlace","005c7151":"##### Conclusion: There are two peaks, which indicates that a match most commonly ends with either a quick open fight or after a long duration of camping and hiding","1d82ab26":"## Analysing the win percentage","f262a96f":"## Assessing team kills","cd5324ac":"## Assessing killPoints","7ade536a":"### Conclusion: Tactical and offensive moves generally increase the chances of winning the match greatly, but players should try to kill only as many as required as seeking to kill more enemies affect the win percentage negatively","e5509fc1":"##### Conclusion: most players do not get a revive\/need a revive\/die before they could be revived","167ddb22":"# Function to find distributions","a8a4dfe5":"# Tactical moves\n##### In this section we shall see how the various tactical moves affect the probability of winning the game","19aecf9d":"## Assessing weapons acquired","bf0fb4fd":"## Assessing winPoints","405a3229":"## Assessing match duration","060e6ab3":"##### Conclusion: Most players make it to slightly less than 50% of the game","9c186e7c":"### Concluding match types:","12d099ad":"##### Conclusion: Few players are experienced enough to have a good kill streak","606cb742":"## Assessing knockouts (DBNOs)","6c819324":"# Goal: to determine what to do and what not to do in order to win a game\n### This implies the variable we shall be comparing against shall be winPlacePerc\n### Also, only those fields which may have at least some logical relevance has been considered","aa61d35a":"## Assessing boosts","bad800ea":"# Multivariate Analysis","6e9e4cd6":"## Assessing headshot kills","29828c81":"## Assessing roadKills","9c40dfb1":"# Weapons acquired\n### This factor has not been clubbed with any other factor and we shall analyse it as a stand alone factor","9c5389a6":"## Assessing swim distance","408b4d61":"# Function to assess continuous variables","ef00ce0b":"# Concluding travelling","d07c1a42":"##### Conclusion: kill points have very weak correlation with winning a match thus does not affect it.
