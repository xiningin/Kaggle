I am confident that the distance would affect the fare a great deal. But I will visualise it.\n\nFirstly, let's check the frequency of the distances that we calculated using Haversine formula. I will do so by creating bins (0-10 kms, 10-20 kms, and so on, and check for any outliers)","fc7cde99":"Quick Googling gave me this info\n* Latitudes range from -90 to 90.\n* Longitudes range from -180 to 180.\n\nThe above describe clearly shows some outliers.
