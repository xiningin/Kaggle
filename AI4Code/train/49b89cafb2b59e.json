It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.\n\n**Some informaton about GoT**\n\n**Episode Count:** 73\n\n**No. Of Seasons:** 8\n\n**Run time:** 50\u201382 minutes\n\n**First Aired:** April 17, 2011\n\n**Last Aired:** May 19, 2019\n\n**Original Network:** HBO\n\n**The Plot**\n***Game of Thrones*** is strongly based on the storylines of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of novels by George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and neighboring continent of Essos. The series follows several simultaneous plot lines, always tied together thematically, but that ultimately converge on screen visually in the last three seasons. The first story arc follows a War of succession amongst the competing claimants, vying for succession to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms. The second, tangential arc, pertains to an exiled scion's personal, existential growth, as well as her geographic and political journey to reclaim the Iron Throne; via her army of recently freed slaves and her three fire-breathing dragons. The third chronicles the imminent threat of the White Walkers and their army of zombies known as wights who intent on killing all that live upon Westeros; as well as the preparations of the dedicated Night's Watch order, sworn to defend the Seven Kingdoms from them and any wildlings from north of the great Wall). Showrunner David Benioff jokingly suggested \"The Sopranos in Middle-earth\" as Game of Thrones' tagline, referring to its intrigue-filled plot and dark tone in a fantasy setting of magic and dragons.","90a06294":"**So, there are 9 directors who directed less than 3 episodes of Game Of Thrones.**","453372c7":"### **Data Analysis On Got Episode Data Set**","a1bc8b0c":"**Following are the director who directed less than 3 episodes.**","62a3ac08":"<img src = \"https:\/\/media1.giphy.com\/media\/dsHZLWYu5SC6k\/giphy.gif\">","e8ab4847":"**Checking first 5 and last 5 records from the datasets**"}}
