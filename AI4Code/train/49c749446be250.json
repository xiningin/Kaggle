Let's use pandas to preprocess it and visualize it.","23eb242c":"There are a few things that are interesting.\n\n- `alt.selection` means 'make named selection'\n- Inside the encoding, you can set the desired part with the `alt` method. (as `alt.condition`)\n- Use bitwise operators. ( | means horizonal add, & means vertical )\n- Graph objects are drawn in the order in which they are written. (yticks -> scatter -> xticks )\n- `mark_tick` can make tick(axis)\n\n\nBy the way, Red certainly did well in the last 2000 games.\n\n### 3-3. Who won more? (Red or Blue)\n\nThere seems to be no correlation, but the previous game shows that the Reds won more.\n\nThis may be related to the athlete's morale.
