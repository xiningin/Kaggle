Plots can give insight and information about the data that may not have been easily derived by looking at the data as a table. \nThere are two types of plotting avvailable \n\n* Univariate : single variable plotting \n* Bivariate : plot bwteen two variable, it shows relationship between two variables. \n\nIn this section we will use this sales data https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kyanyoga\/sample-sales-data ","04f672a2":"### Density plots\n---- \n\nA density plot is a representation of the distribution of a numeric variable. It uses a density estimate to show the probability density function of the variable.
