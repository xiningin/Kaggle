Univariate visualization\nUnivariate analysis looks at one feature at a time. When we analyze a feature independently, we are usually mostly interested in the distribution of its values and ignore other features in the dataset.\n\nBelow, we will consider different statistical types of features and the corresponding tools for their individual visual analysis.\n\n#### 2.1 Quantitative features\nQuantitative features take on ordered numerical values. Those values can be discrete, like intergers or continuous, like real numbers, and usually express a count or a measurement.\n#### Histograms and density plots\nThe easiest way to take a look at the distribution of a numerical variable is to plot its histogeam using the `DataFrame`'s method `hist()`.\n","f70b471c":"### 1.

The values on the X-axis: in the histogram are numerical; a bar plot can have any type of values on the X-axis: numbers, strings, booleans.\n3. The histogram's X-axis is a Cartesian coordinate axis along which values cannot be changed; the ordering of the bars is not predefined. Still, it is useful to note that the bars are often sorted by height, that is, the frequency of the values. Also, when we consider ordinal variables(like Customer service calls in our data), the bars are usually ordered by variable value.\n\nThe left chart above vividly illustrates the imbalance in our target variable. The bar plot for Customer service calls on the right gives a hint that the majority of customers resolve their problems in maximum 2-3 calls. But, as we want to be able to predict the minority class, we may be more interested in how the fewer dissatisfied customers behave. It may well be that the tail of that bar plot contains most of our churn. These are just hypotheses for now, so let's move on to some more interesting and powerful visual techniques.","685b9396":"#### Scatter plot \nThe scatter plot display values of two numerical variables as Cartesian coordinates in 2D space. Scatter plots in 3D are also possible.\n\nLet's try out the function [`scatter`](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/devdocs\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html)() from the `matplotlib` library:","a79fab4a":"Now it is clear that, for example, many dissatisfied customers who canceled their subscription are crowded together in one cluster representing the people with the international plan but no voice mail.\n\nFinally, let's note some disadvantages of t-SNE:\n\nHigh computational complexity. The [implementation](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) in `scikit-learn` is unlikely to be feasible in a real task. If you have a large number of samples, you should try [Multicore-TSNE](https:\/\/github.com\/DmitryUlyanov\/Multicore-TSNE) instead.\nThe plot can change a great deal depending on the random seed, which complicates interpretation. [Here](http:\/\/distill.pub\/2016\/misread-tsne\/) is a good tutorial on t-SNE. In general, you shouldn't make any far-reaching conclusions based on such graphs because it can equate to plain guessing. Of course, some findings in t-SNE pictures can inspire an idea and be confirmed through more thorough research down the line, but that does not happen very often.\nOccasionally, using t-SNE, you can get a really good intuition for the data. The following is a good paper that shows an example of this for handwritten digits: [Visualizing MNIST](https:\/\/colah.github.io\/posts\/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST\/).\n<img src='https:\/\/habrastorage.org\/webt\/-j\/j2\/c8\/-jj2c8zv1jwqo0sygezbmfvu8zo.png'>\n","c1700dcd":"A histogram goups values into bins of equal value range. The shape of histogram may contain clues about the underlying distibution type: Gaussian, exponential, etc. You can also spot any skewness in its shape when the distribution is nearly regular but has some anomalies. Knowing distribution of feature values becomes important when you use Machine learning methods assume a particular type (most often Gaussian).\n\n In the above plot, we see that the variable *Total day minutes* is normally distributed, while *Total Kernel Density Plots*. They can be considered a [smoothed  ](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kernel_smoother) version of the histogram. Their main advantage over the latter is that they do not depend on the size of the bins. Let's create density plot for the same two variables:","9ee7392a":"The height of the histogram bars here is normed and shows the density rather than the number of examples in each bin.","0f356bce":"### 4. Whole dataset visualizations\u00b6\n**4.1 A naive approach**\n\nWe have been looking at different facets of our dataset by guessing interesting features and selecting a small number of them at a time for visualization. We have only dealt with two to three variables at once and were easily able to observe the structure and relationships in data. But, what if we want to display all the features and still be able to interpret the resulting visualization?\n\nWe could use `hist()` or create a scatterplot matrix with `pairplot()` for the whole dataset to look at all of our features simultaneously. But, when the number of features is high enough, this kind of visual analysis quickly becomes slow and inefficient. Besides, we would still be analyzing our variables in a pairwise fashion, not all at once.\n\n**4.2 Dimensionality reduction**\nMost real-world datasets have many features, sometimes, many thousands of them. Each of them can be considered as a dimension in the space of data points. Consequently, more often than not, we deal with high-dimensional datasets, where entire visualization is quite hard.\n\nTo look at a dataset as a whole, we need to decrease the number of dimensions used in visualization without losing much information about the data. This task is called dimensionality reduction and is an example of an unsupervised learning problem because we need to derive new, low-dimensional features from the data itself, without any supervised input.\n\nOne of the well-known dimensionality reduction methods is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which we will study later in this course. Its limitation is that it is a linear algorithm that implies certain restrictions on the data.\n\nThere are also many non-linear methods, collectively called Manifold Learning. One of the best-known of them is t-SNE.\n\n**4.3 t-SNE**\nLet's create a [t-SNE](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) representation of the same churn data we have been using.\n\nThe name of the method looks complex and a bit intimidating: t-distributed Stohastic Neighbor Embedding. Its math is also impressive (we will not delve into it here, but, if you feel brave, here is the [original article](http:\/\/www.jmlr.org\/papers\/volume9\/vandermaaten08a\/vandermaaten08a.pdf) by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton from [JMLR](http:\/\/www.jmlr.org\/)). Its basic idea is simple: find a projection for a high-dimensional feature space onto a plane (or a 3D hyperplane, but it is almost always 2D) such that those points that were far apart in the initial n-dimensional space will end up far apart on the plane. Those that were originally close would remain close to each other.\n\nEssentially, neighbor embedding is a search for a new and less-dimensional data representation that preserves neighborship of examples.\n\nNow, let's do some practice. First, we need to import some additional classes:","3cd9d34b":"In the case of State, the number of distinct values is rather high: 51. We see that there are only a few data points available for each individual state \u2013 only 3 to 17 customers in each state abandoned the operator. Let's ignore that for a second and calculate the churn rate for each state, sorting it from high to low:","06085671":"Let's see how to interpet a box plot. Its components are a box (obviously, this is why it is called a box plot), the so-called *whiskers*, and a number of individual points (outliers).\n\nThe box by itselt illustrates the interquartile spread of the distribution; its lenght is determined by the ***25th(Q1)*** and ***75th(Q3)*** percentiles. The vertical line inside the box marks the median ***(50%)*** of the disribution.\n\nThe whiskers are the lines extending from the box. They represent the entire scatter of data points, specifically the points that fall within the interval ***(Q1\u22121.5\u22c5IQR,Q3+1.5\u22c5IQR)***, where ***IQR = Q3 - Q1*** is the [interquartile range](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interquartile_range).\n\nQutliers that fall outside of the range bounded by the whiskers are plotted individually as black points along the central axis.\n\nWe can see that a large number of international calls is quite rare in out data.","e2e7e1b4":"Let's color this t-SNE representation according to the churn (blue for loyal customers, and orange for those who churned).","59e25c9d":"We get an uninteresting picture of two normally distributed variables. Also, it seems that these features are uncorrelated because the ellipse-like shape is aligned with the axes.\nThere is a slightly fancier option to create a scatter plot with the `seaborn` library:","380e1369":"#### Violin Plot\nThe last type of distribution plots that we will consider is violin plot.\n\nLook at the figures below. On the left, we see the already familiar box plot. TO the right, there is violin plot with the kernel density estimate on both sides.","f42c3319":"#### Bar Plot \nThe Bar plot is a graphical representation of the frequency table. The easiest way to create it is to use the `seaborn`'s function [`countplot()`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.countplot.html). There is another function in [`seaborn`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.barplot.html) that is somewhat confusingly called `barplot()` and is mostly used for representation of some basic statistics of numerical variable grouped by a categorical feature.\n\nLet's plot the distributions for two categorical variables:","68b98738":"It seems that our small proportion of disloyal customers lean towards the top-right corner; that is, such customers tend to spend more time on the phone during both day and night. But this is not absolutely clear, and we won't make any definitive conclusions from this chart.\n\nNow, Let's create box plots to visualize the distribution statistics of the numerical variables in two disjoint groups: the loyal customers (`Churn=False`) and those who left (`Churn=True`).","92886618":"From the colored correlation matrix generated above, we can see that there are 4 variables such as *Total day* charge that have been calculated directly from the number of minutes spent on phone calls (Total day minutes).

Let's get rid of them:\n","e76584de":"We can see that customers who churned are concentrated in a few areas of the lower dimensional feature space.\n\nTo better understand the picture, we can also color it with the remaining binary features: International Plan and Voicemail.

Later, we will build models that predict this feature based on the remaining features. This is why we call it a *target*.","1fead955":"The difference between the box and violin plots is that the former illustrates certain statistics concerning individual examples in a dataset while the violin plot concentrates more on the smoothed distribution as a whole.\n\nIn our case, the violin plot does not contribute any additional information about the data as everything is clear from the box plot alone.\n\n#### Describe()\nIn addition to graphical tools, in order to get the exact numerical statistics of the distribution, we can use the method `[describe()](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html)` of a `DataFrame`","53894158":"**An observation:** the churn rate increases significantly after 4 or more calls to customer service.\n\nNow, let's look at the relationship between `Churn` and the binary features, *International plan* and *Voice mail plan*.","bc8d3814":"It is also posible to plot a distribution of observations with `seaborn`'s `disptplot()`.

We will try to gain new insights for churn prediction from the interactions between the numerical and categorical features.\n\nMore specifically, let's see how the input variables are related to the target variable Churn.\n\nPreviously, you learned about scatter plots. Additionally, their points can be color or size coded so that the values of a third categorical variable are also presented in the same figure. We can achieve this with the `scatter()` function seen above, but, let's try a new function called [`lmplot`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.lmplot.html)() and use the parameter `hue` to indicate our categorical feature of interest:","2354b2ac":"In this case, the violin plot does not contribute any additional information about our data as everything is clear from the box plot alone: disloyal customers tend to talk on the phone more.\n\n**An interesting observation**: on average, customers that discontinue their contracts are more active users of communication services. Perhaps they are unhappy with the tariffs, so a possible measure to prevent churn could be a reduction in call rates. The company will need to undertake additional economic analysis to find out whether such measures would be benefical.\n\nWhen we want to analyze a quantitative variable in two categorical dimensions at once, there is a suitable function for this in the `seaborn` library called [`catplot()`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.factorplot.html). For example, let's visualize the interaction between *Total day minutes* and two categorical variables in the same plot:","00d12f46":"#### Box plot\nAnother useful type of visualization is a *box plot*. `seaborn` does a great job here:","ad4e0141":"By defaut, the entries in the output are sorted from the most to the least frequently-occurring values.\n\nIn our case, the data is not *balanced*; that is, out target classes, loyal and disloyal customers, are not represented equally in the dataset. Only a small part of the clients canceled their subscription to the telecom service. As we will see in the following articles, this fact may imply some restrictions on measuring the classification performance, and, in the future, we may want to additionally penalize our model errors in predicting the minority \"Chrun\" class.","b6f4cdd3":"From this, we could conclude that, starting with 4 calls, *Total day minutes* may no longer be the main factor for customer churn. Perhaps, in addition to our perivous guess about the tariffs, there are customers that are dissatisfied with the service due to other problems, which might lead to fewer number of day minutes spent on calls.\n\n**3.3 Categorical vs. Categorical**\nAs we saw earlier in this article, the variable *Customer service calls* has few unique values and, thus, can be considered either numerical or ordinal. We have already seen its distribution with *count plot*. Now, we are interested in the relationship between this ordinal feature and the target variable Churn.\n\nLet's look at the distribution of the number of calls to customer service, again using a count plot. This time, let's also pass the parameter `hue=Churn` that adds a categorical dimension to the plot:","09ee567b":"## Visualization: from Simple Distributions to Dimensionality Reduction","fd0ad11b":"To get to know our data, let's look at the first 5 entries using `head()`:","9956755b":"The function [jointplot](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.jointplot.html)(). plot two histograms that may be useful in some cases.\n\nUsing the same function, we can also get a smoothed version of our bivariate distribution:","687f09fb":"In the field of Machine Learning, data visualization is not just making fancy graphics for reports; it is used extensively in day-to-day work for all phases of a project.\n\nTo start with, visual exploration of data is the first thing one tends to do when dealing with new task.

It is much more convenient for us, humans, to grasp the main points this way than by reading many lines of raw data. It is amazing how much insight can be gained form seemingly simple charts created with available visualization tools.\n\nNext, when we analyze the performance of a model or report results, we also often use charts and images. Sometimes, for interpreting a complex model, we need to project hight-dimensional spaces onto more visually intelligible 2D or 3D figures.\n\nAll in all, visualization is relatively fast way to learn something new about your data. Thus, it is vital to learn its most useful techniques and make them part of your everday ML toolbox\n\nIn this article, we are going to get hands-on experience with visual exploration of data using popular libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.\n","f77487a5":"We will leave out the *State* and *Churn* features and convert the values \"Yes\"\/\"No\" of the binary features into numerical values using [pandas.Series.map()](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.Series.map.html)","fd4db515":"Sometimes, such a visualization may help draw conclusions about data; but, in this case, everything is pretty clear with no suprises.","5443cb0c":"This is basically a bivariate version of kernel Density Plot discussed earlier.\n\n#### Scatterplot matrix\nIn some cases, we may want to plot a scatterplot matrix such as the one shown below. its diagonal contains the distributions of the corresponding variables, and the scatter plots for each pair of variables fill the rest of the matrix.\n","9db1c3e6":"From this chart, we can see that the greatest discrepancy in distribution between the two groups is for three variables: Total day minutes, Customer service calls, and Number vmail messages. Later in this course, we will learn how to determine feature importance in classification using Random Forest or Gradient Boosting; there, we will see that the first two features are indeed very important for churn prediction.\n\nLet's look at the distribution of day minutes spoken for the loyal and disloyal customers separately. We will create box and violin plots for Total day minutes grouped by the target variable.","2af0c86c":"\n**An observation**: when International Plan is enabled, the churn rate is much higher; the usage of the international plan by the customer is a strong feature. We do not observe the same effect with Voice mail plan.\n\n**Contingency table**\n\nIn addition to using graphical means for categorical analysis, there is a traditional tool from statistics: a contingency table, also called a cross tabulation. It shows a multivariate frequency distribution of categorical variables in tabular form. In particular, it allows us to see the distribution of one variable conditional on the other by looking along a column or row.\n\nLet's try to see how Churn is related to the categorical variable State by creating a cross tabulation:","08f74a90":"#### 2.2 Categorical and binary features\nCategorical features take on a fixed number of values. Each of these values assigns an observation to a corresponding group, known as a category, which reflects some qualitative property of this example. Binary variables are an important special case of categorical variables when the number of possible values is exactly 2. If the values of categorical variable are ordered, it is called ordinal.\n\n#### Frequency table\nLet's check the class balance in out dataset by looking at the distribution of the target variable: the churn rate. First, we will get a frequency table, which shows how frequent each value of the categorical variable is. For this, we will use the [value_counts()](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.Series.value_counts.html) method:","81dcbc3d":"and plot it:","9972bcab":"### 3. Multivariate visualization\nMultivariate plots allow us to see relationships between two and more different variables, all in one figure. Just as in the case of univariate plots, the specific type of visualization will depend on the types of the variables being analyzed.\n\n#### 3.1 Quantitative vs Qualitative\n\n#### Correlation matrix\n\nLet's look at the correlations among the numerical variables in our dataset. This information is important to know as there are Machine learning algorithms (for example, linear and logistic regression) that do not handle highly correlated input variables well.\n\nFirst, we will use the method [`corr`](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html)() on `DataFrame` that calculates between each pair of features. Then, we pass the resulting correlation matrix to [`heatmap`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.heatmap.html)() from `seaborn`, which renders a color-coded matrix for the provided values:\n","032784fd":"In the first article, we looked at the data on customer churn for telecom operator.
