This dataset contains ~1M answers collected online by [Open Psychometrics](https:\/\/openpsychometrics.org\/tests\/IPIP-BFFM). I'm interested in this dataset because it also labels the country in which the respondant is located. We can use this dataset to get country-level aggregate data on personality traits, and then see if those traits map onto the COVID-19 outcomes that we're seeing.","d9e4b644":"## Scoring the Big Five Personality Test items\n\nThe Big 5 personality inventory contains 5 factors. Like most personality scales, the Big 5 has a mix of items that positively and negatively load onto these personality factors. For example, the factor Extraversion describes someone who is outgoing, energetic, talkative, and enjoys human interaction. The first Extraversion item [`EXT1`] is \"I am the life of the party.\", a positively-keyed item; whereas the second item [`EXT2`] is \"I don't talk a lot.\", a negatively-keyed item.\n\nTo find out which items are positively or negatively keyed, we can look at the scale documentation on the IPIP website: https:\/\/ipip.ori.org\/newBigFive5broadKey.htm\n\n## Reverse-coding\n\nBefore analyzing the data from a personality test, a psychologist will generally \"reverse-code\" the items that are negatively-keyed. This results in a dataset where the item values all have a common direction and interpretetion (i.e., a higher value corresponds with more of that trait). Mathematically, it allows you to then compute sums and averages for each of the factors. For example, after scoring the test items, we could compute an individual's average for Extraversion items to get their Extraversion score.\n\nThis version of the Big 5 scale asks individuals to rate their level of agreement from 1 to 5, where 1 is strong disagreement and 5 is strong agreement. Reverse-coding is as simple as subtracting 6 from every reverse-keyed item.\n\nThe code below will accomplish this task.","e1ec7922":"What\/how many countries does that leave us with?","d7f09182":"First, we should eliminate any country that doesn't have very many observations. Somewhat arbitrarily, we'll draw a line at N = 1000.","c3081a18":"# COVID-19 and the Big 5 Personality Test\n\nFor this analysis, I pose the following question: \n\n> Does the growth in COVID-19 cases have anything to do with Big 5 Personality traits?\n\nTo answer this question, I will need country-level aggregates on the Big 5 test, and a country-level aggregate that represents for \"growth\" over time in coronavirus cases.\n\nHere's how I operationalize it: I take all the countries that reached at least 50 \"confirmed cases\" of the coronavirus, using data that's up to date as of March 20, 2020. Then I take the number of cases those countries had 14-days after reaching 50 confirmed cases. This gives an estimate of growth within a country that can be compared across countries, because it puts them all on a level playing-field.\n\nNext, I compute country-level averages on the Big 5 Personality Test using data from the Open Source Psychometrics Project, and I only include countries with at least 1000 observations. \n\nFinally, I look at the correlation between Confirmed Cases at Day 14 and average scores on each of the Big 5 personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism [a.k.a. emotional stability]).","df273279":"There are 58 countries with at least 1000 observations.
