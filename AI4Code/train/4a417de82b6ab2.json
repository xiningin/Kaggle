Making a Time Series Stationary\n\nNow that we are familiar with the concept of stationarity and its different types, we can finally move on to actually making our series stationary. Always keep in mind that in order to use time series forecasting models, it is necessary to convert any non-stationary series to a stationary series first.\n\n \n\nDifferencing\n\nIn this method, we compute the difference of consecutive terms in the series. Differencing is typically performed to get rid of the varying mean. Mathematically, differencing can be written as:\n\nyt\u2018 = yt \u2013 y(t-1)\n\nwhere yt is the value at a time t\n\nApplying differencing on our series and plotting the results:\n\n","b7a4ba01":" The idea beneath seasonal decomposition is to state that any series can be decomposed in a sum (or a product) of 3 components: a trend, a seasonal component, and residuals."}}
