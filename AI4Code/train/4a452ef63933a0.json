In baseball, the number of innings pitched, or IP, is a way of expressing the number of outs a pitcher records. There are three outs in one complete inning.

If a pitcher only records 8 outs, then he is credited with 2 2\/3 or 2.67 IP. \n\n    In this dataset, we are given the number of outs each pitcher has recorded. Please create a new column called `IP` that shows the innings pitched for each pitcher. To calculate `IP`, select the `IPouts` column and divide by 3.\n    \n    After we calculate `IP`, we no longer need the `IPouts` column, so delete it from the dataset.\n    \n    Display the first five rows of the updated dataset.","b942bf81":"4.
