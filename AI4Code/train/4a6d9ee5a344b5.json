I was creating this Notebook as practice and thought it could be useful to some others \n### Who is this for\nThis Notebook is for people that learn from examples. Forget the boring lectures and follow along for some fun\/instructive time :)\n### What can I learn here\nYou learn all the basics needed to create a rudimentary sentiment analyzer using NLTK library and reddit API. I go over a multitude of steps with explanations. Hopefully with these building blocks,you can go ahead and build much more complex models.\n\n### Things to remember\n+ Please Upvote\/Like the Notebook so other people can learn from it\n+ Feel free to give any recommendations\/changes. \n+ I will be continuously updating the notebook. Look forward to many more upcoming changes in the future.","8d79e0c9":"# Create DataFrame from Records\nWe have recorded each headline and its respective scores as a dictionary in a list named results. Results containts multiple dicts representing each headline\/post. We use the `from_records()` method to create a DataFrame from a list of dicts.","06742085":"# Post-Process Results\nHere we create a new column `label` which will rather contain a 1 if the sentiment is postive or a -1 if the sentiment is negative.

We are just interested to know if the post is positive or negative.","be507319":"# Overview of Results\nThis allows us to have a quick overview of how much percentage of posts were positive and negative. We use `pandas` `value_counts()` method which gives us the amount of pos. and neg. values in the `label` column. We added the `normalize` argument and multiplied the output by 100 to obtain the percentage amount of pos. and neg. headlines.","e0d433af":"# Analyze sentiment\nWe analyze the sentiment of each headline using the `ntlk` library and the `SIA()` class.

We then proceed to save the results in a csv file that I can use in the future. For example, I might use these results as additional feature to a time-series prediction algorithm for CryptoCurrency. \n\n**Needless to say, if I succeed on making it... This will be the last time you see me on Kaggle :)**","16d320a2":"# Reddit API Instance\nYou will have to create your own oAuth token to create an instance of the Reddit class.

We only keep posts that have more than 500 upvotes."}}
