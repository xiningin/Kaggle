mentioned above, games in the action, casual, strategy,arcade, sports categories are getting considerably more ratings than, games in the educational, music categories.\n- Same is true even for the

float data type. But as data type, it is an object data type. It is good to take of note of it \n","9379ddd6":"- Almost all of the games (except 7 out of 1730) in this dataset are free games","aa2fb6bf":"- Thanks for the dataset contibutor for this data. I really enjoyed working on it.","c76b2772":"- We have rightly skewed distribution with possible outliers.\n- Candy Crush Saga with  1 Billion install and Clash of Clans with 500 Million installs shown in the box plot.\n- it would be good idea to always check with dataset, in the dataset we have 2 count of 1 Billion install and 12 count of 500 Million installs. And boxplot shows us one example from this number of installs.\n- Size of the outliers definitely affect  mean value and distributions.\n- Difference between mean value and median value is really  huge (mean = 29.1M,median= 10M)\n- As mentioned above, it would be a good idea to use median based approach.","13fc4ce4":"- Recently I got a lot of feedback from my dear friends who just change or about the change their career towards to Data Analysis\/ Data Science and Machine Learning areas about the lack of material between beginning the analysis journey and the advanced techniques.\n\n- They are looking for detailed but at the same time beginner friendly, not so much complicated (with different regression, normalization techniques, etc.) explained Explanatory Data Analysis examples, which show them how to start and most importantly how to read the descriptive statistics and graphs.\n\n- After getting these feedbacks, I have decided to make some kind of series of EDA\u2019s from different datasets, without making so complicated for the people at their first steps of DS\/ML journey.\n\n### This notebook is part of the 9 Beginner Friendly EDAs. If these EDAs would be helpful to anyone, I would be more than happy.\n\n\n","40be3093":"- Nope, growth in 60 days for the games in the casino, adventure, role playing categories are significantly lower than their growth in 30 days. \n- With given dataset, we can only speculate something, but we can not make an analytical assumptions based on the  given data.

So for further analysis it would be good to remember that.\n- In these kinds of situations, it would be a good idea to look for the median based approach.\n- Median value, instead of mean value, should be used for to get some insights from the distributions.","d984629e":"### Number of Game Installations by Game Category","cba198ef":"### Number of Game Install","7e69ccb4":"### Total Ratings by Category","1e8b9b52":"- We have almost same size categories.","bcfa81b2":"- We have 1730 games and 15 different variables to work on.","72ac9e80":"Before going further, let's summarize what we have got from the dataset.\n\n- Our dataset has games from different categories, different ratings and different number of installs.  \n- 'installs' variable has a good numerical info to use. It would be a good idea to make adjustments on it to use it as a numerical variable\n- There is no missing value, which is very good during the data preparation stage.\n- 'Category' column is categorical variable, it would be good to see whether any significant differences among the categories of the games.\n-  Numerical variables deserves special attention for further analysis.\n- 'Paid' and 'Price' seems to have a lot on common. Needs to look in detail and if necessary drop one of them for simplicity.","a1a43468":"- Games in the action, casual, strategy,arcade categories also get more 5 star ratings than the games in the educational, music categories.","804a4b28":"## This notebook is a part of the 9 Beginner Friendly EDAs\n## If you like this one, you can also check out other notebooks in the Beginner Friendly EDAs series!\n\n* [Data Analyst Jobs - EDA](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaanboke\/plotly-data-analyst-jobs)\n* [Hollywood Top Movies- EDA](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaanboke\/plotly-beginner-friendly-top-movies)\n* [UDEMY Courses EDA](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaanboke\/plotly-beginner-friendly-udemy)\n* [World Happiness Report - EDA](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaanboke\/plotly-beginner-friendly-eda)\n* [Countries Life Expectancy](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaanboke\/plotly-beginner-friendly)\n* [Netflix Movies- EDA](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaanboke\/plotly-beginner-friendly-netflix)\n* [Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books EDA](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaanboke\/plotly-beginner-friendly-amazon)\n* [London bike Sharing EDA](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaanboke\/plotly-beginner-friendly-london-bike)\n","1ef90c1b":"- It was a quite pleasure to share with you this detailed, beginner friendly EDA.
