Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan\nStatistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. The attributes are defined as follows (taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository):\n1. CRIM: per capita crime rate by town\n2. ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n3. INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town\n4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n5. NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling\n7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n8. DIS: weighted distances to \fve Boston employment centers\n9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways\n10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per USD 10,000\n11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town\n12. B: 1000(Bk - 0:63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town\n13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population\n14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in USD 1000s\n\nWe can see that the input attributes have a mixture of units.\n\nWe will perform the following steps:\n2. Load the Dataset (Import libraries and load dataset)\n3. Analyze Data (Descriptive Statistics)\n4. Data Visualizations (Unimodal and Multimodal, Summary of Ideas)\n5. Validation Dataset\n6. Evaluate Algorithms: Baseline\n7. Evaluate Algorithms: Standardization\n8. Improve Results with Tuning\n9. Ensemble Methods\n10. Tune Ensemble Methods\n11. Finalize Model\n12. Summary\n13.

Evaluate Algorithms: Baseline\n\nWe have no idea what algorithms will do well on this problem. Gut feel suggests regression algorithms like Linear Regression and ElasticNet may do well. It is also possible that decision trees and even SVM may do well. We have no idea. Let's design our test harness. We will use 10-fold cross validation. The dataset is not too small and this is a good standard test harness configuration. We will evaluate algorithms using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. MSE will give a gross idea of how wrong all predictions are (0 is perfect).","f7996821":"<u>Inference<\/u>: \n* The yellow color shows positive correlation whereas the purple color shows negative correlation. \n* We can also see some yellow and purple that suggest candidates for removal to better improve accuracy of models later on.\n\n## 4.3 Summary of Ideas\n\nThere is a lot of structure in this dataset. We need to think about transforms that we could use later to better expose the structure which in turn may improve modeling accuracy. So far it would be worth trying:\n* Feature selection and removing the most correlated attributes.\n* Normalizing the dataset to reduce the effect of differing scales.\n* Standardizing the dataset to reduce the effects of differing distributions.\n\nWith lots of additional time we would also explore the possibility of binning (discretization) of the data. This can often improve accuracy for decision tree algorithms.\n\n# 5. Validation Dataset\n\nIt is a good idea to use a validation hold-out set. This is a sample of the data that we hold back from our analysis and modeling. We use it right at the end of our project to confirm the\naccuracy of our final model. It is a smoke test that we can use to see if we messed up and to give us confidence on our estimates of accuracy on unseen data. We will use 80% of the dataset for modeling and hold back 20% for validation.","ffa05be9":"<u>Inference<\/u>: We can see similar distributions for the regression algorithms and perhaps a tighter distribution of scores for CART.\n\nThe differing scales of the data is probably hurting the skill of all of the algorithms and perhaps more so for SVR and KNN. In the next section we will look at running the same algorithms using a standardized copy of the data.\n\n# 7. Evaluate Algorithms: Standardization\n\nWe suspect that the differing scales of the raw data may be negatively impacting the skill of some of the algorithms. Let's evaluate the same algorithms with a standardized copy of the dataset. This is where the data is transformed such that each attribute has a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of 1. We also need to avoid data leakage when we transform the data. A good way to avoid leakage is to use pipelines that standardize the data and build the model for each fold in the cross validation test harness. That way we can get a fair estimation of how each model with standardized data might perform on unseen data.","1eaa2788":"Let's create a baseline of performance on this problem and spot-check a number of different algorithms. We will select a suite of different algorithms capable of working on this regression problem. The six algorithms selected include:\n* Linear Algorithms: Linear Regression (LR), Lasso Regression (LASSO) and ElasticNet (EN).\n* Nonlinear Algorithms: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).","20e6f104":"We can see that the estimated mean squared error is 11.8, close to our estimate of -9.3.\n\n# 12. Summary\n\nWe performed the following steps:\n\n* Loading the Dataset.\n* Analyze Data (some skewed distributions and correlated attributes).\n* Evaluate Algorithms (Linear Regression looked good).\n* Evaluate Algorithms with Standardization (KNN looked good).\n* Algorithm Tuning (K=3 for KNN was best).\n* Ensemble Methods (Bagging and Boosting, Gradient Boosting looked good).\n* Tuning Ensemble Methods (getting the most from Gradient Boosting).\n* Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset).","26d5f332":"<u>Inference<\/u>:\n* We can see that some attributes may have an exponential distribution, such as CRIM, ZN, AGE and B. \n* We can see that others may have a bimodal distribution such as RAD and TAX.\n\nLet's look at the same distributions using density plots that smooth them out a bit.","b77100cf":"<u>Inference<\/u>:\n* We can see that KNN has both a tight distribution of error and has the lowest score.\n\n# 8. Improve Results With Tuning\n\nWe know from the results in the previous section that KNN achieves good results on a scaled version of the dataset. But can it do better? The default value for the number of neighbors in KNN is 7. We can use a grid search to try a set of different numbers of neighbors and see if we can improve the score. The below example tries odd k values from 1 to 21, an arbitrary range covering a known good value of 7. Each k value (n neighbors) is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation on a standardized copy of the training dataset.","4fa613ce":"<u>Inference<\/u>:\n* This perhaps adds more evidence to our suspicion about possible exponential and bimodal distributions. \n* It also looks like NOX, RM and LSTAT may be skewed Gaussian distributions, which might be helpful later with transforms.\n\nLet's look at the data with box and whisker plots of each attribute.","8b336c6c":"# 3.

In the next section we will look at tuning the Gradient Boosting to further lift the performance.\n\n# 10. Tune Ensemble Methods\n\nThe default number of boosting stages to perform (n_estimators) is 100. This is a good candidate parameter of Gradient Boosting to tune. Often, the larger the number of boosting stages, the better the performance but the longer the training time. In this section we will look at tuning the number of stages for gradient boosting. Below we define a parameter grid n_estimators values from 50 to 400 in increments of 50. Each setting is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation.","6d9c3ad8":"# 13.
