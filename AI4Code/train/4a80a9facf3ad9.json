This help answer the question, 'who were the top and bottom countries in year X?'. \n- Bottom up: If you have certain countries or regions in mind, you can select them and compare their annual trends. This can be based on something you already know, or based on the top charts, you might want to explore more.","cf8891ba":"# Migration and Population Density by Country and Region - WorldBank Data\nThis dataset contains annual data per country for: \n- **Population:** the number of inhabitants of each country for a given year\n- **Net migration:** the net migration to\/from that country in absolute terms\n- **Net migration** (as a percentage of population)\n- **Population density:** the number of inhabitants per kilometer square. Although this is a very useful metric on how crowded a country is, it is also very misleading, as there are many uninhabitable areas in many countries showing a low density, and distorting the usefulness of the metric, so keep this in mind.\n- **Meta data:** the region the country belongs to, ISO codes of the country, latitude and longitude, and income level.\n\nThe data was gathered from the WorldBank, using `pandas_datareader`.  \nThree datasets were imported and merged into one, using the script file included in this dataset separately.
