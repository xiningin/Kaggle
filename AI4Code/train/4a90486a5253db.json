The country has made major changes and progresses in its policies and systems in health care. Lack of the healthcare workers had its direct impact on the child mortality, which can be seen clearly with the increasing mortality curve.\n>>>* From 1975 onward, the Algerian government introduced a free national health care system. Hospital treatment, medications, and outpatient care became free to all citizens of Algeria. The national medical insurance scheme covers 90% of the entire population. This was like life line to deteriorating  healthcare facilities of Algeria. Impact of the same was clearly reflecting the reduction in mortality rate of the child.  On the other hand it also  increased the lifespan of the individual which can be seen clearly in the population curve i.e increase in total population.\n>>>* The Algerian government decided to invest in government run expansive health care centres and clinics instead of investing in expensive hospitals. The health care facilities and medical equipment varies in size depending on the size of local population. Remote areas tend to get more rudimentary medical services.\n>>>* The Algerian government had a 4-year plan from 2010\u201314, which was expected to spend \u20ac5.7bn in health care which a majority of the fund directed in the establishment of over 1,500 health care facilities all over Algeria. This led to the stability in the healthcare services to Algerians.\n>>>* By 2015 the Algerian government had allocated \u20ac4.85bn to build 10 hospital and renovate old ones. The Algerian government is investing in human resources by creating 58,000 jobs in nursing, doctors and health care assistants. The Algerian government is dedicating increased funds into increasing the amount of resources that the health care sector needs to develop their new facilities. This funding will go into new medical equipment and improved hospital capacity capabilities.\n\n*Reference :\n* \"THE PROBLEMS OF FUNDING THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN ALGERIA\". www.academia.edu.
