For this model we have to setup the Expectation-Maximization learning and we have to show that this model works much better.\n* First of all we should test our model on new, unseen data to see if it can also work with them correctly. As the input of new features is a saturating procedure, there will be less common products in the future and perhaps more specials. In addition you can use the app from all-over the world. Consequently the data is time- and space- dependent. For this reason a good strategy for refitting and validation is needed. This could include user feedbacks as well to make sure that predicted anomalies are really anomalies or if an uncertain product could be placed into another cluster. \n* To make our model stronger we could include more features like the ingredients list or the product names we always had peeked at. This could mean to introduce a further clustering based on these features or to build a model that deals with all features at once each update step.\n* Luckily gaussian mixture can be split into parallel working data chunks.

Your task is to find some grouping in this data. Your intuition and experience tell you that the structure you are looking for depends on other things like the kind of product and ingredients. Even though this information is not available for your task you have this in mind and you will try to group products asking yourself: \"Could this be cheese?\". This way you are dealing with a **hidden, so called latent information**. Their information is not given as a feature in your data but you are assuming that it somehow causes your patterns and structures. \n\nIn the case of **mixture models it's assumed that there exist some latent variables that generate the distribution of data you observe**. In our case we hope that these latent variables walk along with product types and categories that fit to our experience of daily life. As a first attempt we thought about how many categories we may find, for example: pasta and grain products, bread, vegetables, fruits, meat, candies, oils, milk and milk products, beans. For this first try we had in mind the nurition pyramide. \n\nNow the gaussian mixture model descripes the following: **Each of our latent variable, each of these product categories, causes one multivariate gaussian**, this is a normal distribution over more than one dimension. We have least these features: carbohydrates, sugars, fat, proteins, energy and salt. Consequently our feature dimension is equally (or with feature engineering) higher than 6 and the gaussians are located in this > 6 dimensional room. In 3 dimensions you can think of foggy ellipsoids with different densities, locations and extentions. These gaussians try to cover the data structure and you take as many gaussians as you assume product categories. \n\nThen our distribution $p(x)$ of data we observe is said to be generated by these gaussians:\n\n$$ p(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot N(x|\\mu_{k}, \\Sigma_{k}) $$\n\n\nThen each gaussian is somehow responsible that a single data spot is placed where it is. **One gaussian may be more responsible than the others but they are all working in a mixture to explain your data**. During learning all of these ellipsoid clusters are moving in space and varying their shape trying to match perfactly the distributed data $p(x)$. **The learning procedure for models with latent variables is the expectation maximization**. This algorithm works in two consequtive steps that are repeated until all gaussians only have found their place and would only show slight changes in further steps. \n\n#### E-Step (expectation):  \n\nAt the start of the model are gaussians are placed and shaped randomly (or pretrained by k-means locations). Then for each gaussian, that represents one cluster, the model calculates how responsible the cluster $z_{k}$ is for one data spot $x_{n}$.\n\n$$\\gamma_{nk}  = \\frac {\\pi_{k} \\cdot N(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}, \\Sigma_{k})} {\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\pi_{j} \\cdot N(x_{n}|\\mu_{j}, \\Sigma_{j})}$$\n\nThese responsibilities sum up to 1 over all clusters for one data spot. Here we can read out the winner at the end of the learning procedure that is assigned as the predicted cluster for that data spot $x_{n}$. \n\n#### M-Step (maximization):\n\nDuring the maximization step, all parameters of the gaussians, the locations given by the cluster center and the shapes covered by the covariance matrices are updated:\n\n$$\\mu_{k} = \\frac{1}{N_{k}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\gamma_{nk} x_{n} $$\n\n$$\\Sigma_{k} =  \\frac{1}{N_{k}}  \\sum_{n=1}^{N}  \\gamma_{nk} (x_{n} - \\mu_{k}) (x_{n} - \\mu_{k})^{T}$$ \n\nYou can see that we obtain each cluster location $\\mu_{k}$ by looking and summing over all data spots. This is a big difference between K-Means and GMM as the further only calculates the cluster centers using cluster members. But in our case, as already told, each gaussian is responsibile for all data points. Hence the new location is calculated by using them all, but weighting with the responsibility. Thisway points that could be well explained by this cluster contribute much more to the new location (mean) than the other data points. The same holds for the cluster shapes aka covariances.  \n\nOhOhOh! What do we see there? :-)\n\nWe have to be very careful with outliers as our training procedure depends on the features $x_{n}$ themselves!! High outlier values shift the means and covariances of clusters to higher values as well! That motivates extensive data preprocessing for training data!\n","c8fcab91":"### Take-Away\n* The clusters differ a lot in their densities\n* Cluster 5 has the highest desity, which makes sense when we look at the produkt-types - beverages.  Products of this group all have in common that they contain almost no fat, proteins and salt. Only the sugar component differs due to sweet drinks like soda and unsweetened drinks like water. For this reason the sugar component has the lowest density.\n* Cluster 6 hast the lowest density. That makes sense as cluster 6 contains the most outlier products. For this reason it's the most mixed cluster of all - the product-types differ a lot and so do their nutritions.\n* There are also some other clusters with a quite high or low density:\n    * Cluster 12 has low density in carbohydrates, sugars, non-sugar-carbohydrates, salt and the g_sum.

We can see that the detection of anomalies worked well for its cluster members.

That's what we want to have!\n* Cluster 12 in contrast sits with his back on the zero-zero-plane of fats and proteins. All data spots in this cluster have zero fat and zero proteins. For all other features the cluster spreads widely into the space like cluster 6 does. **Now your alarm bells should ring** ... Why are both clusters that different in anomaly detection? Why went something wrong with cluster 12? We still expect to detect errors of energy discrepancies as anomalies.\n* **BOOM** Here it comes out very clear - our model assumptions don't fit to our data!

Our Gaussian Mixture Model is a probabilistic model that can tell us, how certain it was during its cluster assignments. Intuitively one would say: \"Let's take a look at $\\pi_{k} N(\\mu_{k}, \\Sigma_{k})$ per cluster component. But as we want a probability, we need to normalize over all components of our model. Looking at the E-Step, we can see that this are our converged responsibilities! :-) During the E-Step our model calculates how responsible some cluster $k$ is for some data spot $n$. Consequently we can try to understand for which kind of products or model is not certain about in its cluster assignment. This is a great advantage of Gaussian Mixture compared to non-probabilistic models like K-Means.","a70b023f":"# Feature scaling and transformation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"preprocessing\"><\/a>\n\nAfter these steps our dataset is cleaned and optimized for our analysis, but because we want to use the Gaussian Mixture Model we still have to scale and transform the data a bit. Looking closer on how our model learns, we can see two problems in the M-Step:\n\n$$\\mu_{k} = \\frac{1}{N_{k}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\gamma_{nk} x_{n} $$\n\n$$\\Sigma_{k} =  \\frac{1}{N_{k}}  \\sum_{n=1}^{N}  \\gamma_{nk} (x_{n} - \\mu_{k}) (x_{n} - \\mu_{k})^{T}$$ \n\n### Why should we transform features?\n\nThe cluster center $\\mu_{k}$ and the covariance matrices $\\Sigma_{k}$ are influenced by the feature values $x_{n}$ themselves. As we have skewed feature distributions with high outliers the cluster center are shifted towards higher values during each update step. This is caused by the weighted mean. Even though the responsibilities as weights are able to soften the effect of outliers, they can still contribute very much. In this case our model builds clusters during learning that try to match the structure of outliers. The cluster center would not explain the majority of its cluster members and could be even located in regions with no data spots at all. To solve this problem we transform our features using boxcox transformation. Doing so we like to expand the majority of data points to uncover hidden substructures and compress the outliers.\n\nEven this sounds easy, this is the most toughest part of all! \n\n### Why should we scale them?\nEven with transformed features there is still a problem left: So far all our features have positive values and the responsibilities are positive as well as they are probabilities between 0 and 1.  This will still cause a shift in the center and covariance updates as the assignments will be lead by the higher values. To correct this we want to shift our transformed feature distributions such that it is evenly distributed around 0. For this purpose we subtract the mean and scale to unit variance. \n\n### How does to boxcox knead our features?\nUsing the boxcox transformation we are able to knead the feature distributions as we like them to be. But with this this great power comes also great responsibility ;-) . Consequently we should try to understand what boxcox can do with our values!","c89afbe1":"# Conclusion <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/a>\n\n* The Gaussian Mixture Model is able to cluster the data in a useful way depending on their nutrition-tables. We have found various type of clusters that hold differnt product categories.\n* The model can even tell us how certain it is about the clustering assignment. \n* The probabilistic nature of the model can tell us something about competing clusters as well. Competitors could be a good choice for some products. Sometimes the competitors are neighborhood clusters but additionally we found some attractions towards a mixed outlier clusters.\n* We can also find anomalies (both rare and wrong entries).\n* There is also an anomaly-cluster - that holds many outliers, wrong entries and seldom products.\n* We found that there is a strong need to build a model that takes into account the discrete nature of zero-entries like zero fat or zero proteins. This would probably have a huge impact to the quality of clustering results, certainty and anomaly detection!\n* Besides these benefits the model needs much predatory work (cleaning, transforming, scaling the data)\n* It is also really depending on the decisions we make (e.g. the transformation-features, the number of components (cluster), the threshold we set to define an anomaly). Consequently hyperparameter selection is the most crucial part.\n* But the model seems to be worth this work! It has much more to offer than a bunch of other clustering algorithms like K-Means for example.","5d4d80c7":"## How dense are our clusters?","26d3305d":"**Peek at the data**","9ecdfb83":"### Take-away\n\n* Every cluser belongs to a component that has its own covariance matrice.

In these cases we are curious if the model is centrain about its cluster assignment or if it detected those points as anomalies. \n* If you compare the scattered data of original and transformed features you can see that our preprocessing was able to expand the room the data occupies. This way we uncovered substructures that would have been hidden using the skewed original feature distributions. \n* We can find a cluster that somehow looks like protective shield.

First of all we want to add some more features that could be helpful for clustering our data.\n\nTherefore we add the feature **g_sum** which represents the **rounded sum of the fat-, carbohydrates-, proteins- and salt-values** in our data. By doing that we can easily see if there are some products with false entries.\n\nFurthermore we add the feature **other_carbs**  which includes the value of **all carbs that are not sugars**. Because of that our model can see the correlation between carbohydrates and sugars.\n\nThe last feature we want to add is **reconstructed_engery**. It calculates the energy value of a product **based on energy values of the features fat, carbohydrates and proteins**. We can compare this feature to the amount of energy that is given in our dataset to see if there possibly are some wrong entries.","7cc60997":"# Anomaly detection <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"anomalies\"><\/a>\n\nThe last and perhaps the most important part of the app is anomaly detection. But first of all, what is meant by an anomaly in the view of a gaussian mixture model? Before we start, we should be certain about the answer. Let's recap the formulation of the Gaussian Mixture Model:\n\n$$ p(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot N(x|\\mu_{k}, \\Sigma_{k})$$\n\nThis sum yields a so called probability density function. If you are not very familiar with measure theory you are in good company. If we assume that all data spots are drawn randomly from that density distribution and finally take the natural log, we would end up with the following formula:\n\n$$ \\ln p(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} ln \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot N(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}, \\Sigma_{k}) $$\n\nThe stuff we need to score each data spot is now given by:\n\n$$ \\ln p_{n}(x) = \\ln \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot N(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}, \\Sigma_{k}) $$\n\nThis is what we obtain by calling score samples of scikit-learns gaussian mixture model. But what does it tell us? We think that it is a measure how dense the region is where data spot $x_{n}$ is located. Consequently in low dense regions of our probability density function this would yield a low number. Let's go further - what can be detected as anomaly in low dense regions?\n\n* outliers that could be errors\n* seldom products\n\nWe should keep in mind that there is one kind of error we will not detect as anomaly: Imagine a user typed in nutrition table information that contains flips between features or a wrong product name. This kind of data spot can be located in dense regions and perfectly match with some cluster. Consequently we would not detect it as an anomaly and we can't find it as an error! ","9dd31f91":"## What can we tell about the anomaly cluster 6 and its counterpart 12 ?\n\nWe have found one special cluster that holds many high outlier products.

This is the second difficult part of our analysis. If we would chose to less components we would obtain clusters of mixed product types and far too broad ranged features per gaussian. For example, it does not make sense for one cluster to occupy the whole span from 0 to 100g of carbohydrates. In contrast if we choose too many components, we may find some fine-grained, special clusters of seldom products but we may also find separate clusters of the same product type. To understand what a more theoretical approach would advice us we ran GMM for different amount of components and took a look at three criteria: \n\n* The log-likelihood on the test data \n* The Bayesian Information Criterion (penalizes the log-likelihood with model complexity and number of data)\n* The Akaike Information Criterion (only penailizes the log-likelihood with model complexity)\n","4d159015":"### Take-Away\n\n* Comparing two clusters of our choice we can obtain an deeper understanding why similar clusters are still different. They are often very close in all features in the transformed feature space, sometimes the feature distributions overlap. But even if they are very close together small and tiny shifts in some features make the difference. \n* In the case of the pasta and grain cluster we can see that pasta has a little lower fat and higher protein than the whole grain cluster. In contrast, the grain cluster holds more products with various amounts of sugars and salt.\n* Looking at the mixed type cluster 6 we can see that it covers outliers of each feature distribution. You might wonder and ask yourself why we still see broad distributions on low values as well but this can be explained when you keep in mind, that an outlier might only occur in one or few features per product whereas all others behave normal. \n* Comparing cluster 6 and 12 we can observe that they are very similar as well. They both cover varios products over all feature ranges. They only differ in the amount of fat, proteins and carbohydrates. Whereas cluster 12 holds products with zero fat and zero proteins, but a borad range from 0 to 100 g carbohydrates (& sugars), cluster 6 expands the whole feature space. Consequently cluster 12 touches the 0-fat-0-protein plane whereas cluster 6 is a crowd more in the middle of the room.\n* These difference of cluster 6 and 12 somehow reflects the problem that we have many discrete 0-entries for proteins, fat and carbohydrates. In our opinion it does not make sense to have two outlier-clusters that are nearly the same. We will come to this problem in our outlook again and give a deeper explanation of this problem.","04f6b06c":"### Take-Away\n\n* Cool! That's great! Data spots of high certainty are even closer in the product name\/type. \n* In contrast those with less certainty are often different in the product type. \n* The pasta and grain clusters for example show some overlaps in the uncertain data spots. There are some cereals in the pasta cluster that our model is uncertain about that are maybe under the hood of the grain cluster as well with a second peak of resposibility there. These would be products \"inbetween\". \n\nWe should gain a deeper understanding of competing clusters by looking at the second highest responsibility per data spot and cluster.

During this program she studied what is meant by machine learning and how can a model find pattern in data. To obtain a realistic impression of the power and difficulties of this hot field of our time we decided to chose a powerful model - namely the Gaussian Mixture Model - and real (& dirty) data of openfoodfacts.  During this kernel we discovered the various applications and the structure of Gaussian Mixture like clustering with clusters of different densities and sizes, anomaly detection and uncertainty analysis. We examined the importance of feature preprocessing like scaling and transformation and the difficulty of setting hyperparameters like the number of clusters\/components of our model.\n\nWe collaborated equally on this notebook and if you like our analysis, you can make us very happy with an upvote! :-)\nIf you have further questions, feedback or ideas, don't hesitate to leave a comment.\n\n\n## Can we cluster products of the same type? \n\nIn this Kernel we want have a closer look at the OpenFoodFacts data. Everyone who already used the OpenFoodFacts app knows that it is complicated to type in all queried information and you also have to put high effort into this procedure as well. This leads to wrong entries, regardless of whether it happened on purpose or just because someone made a mistake. By using the app you can also realise that there is no check or test for the user inputs. For example you can even type in negative amounts of fat if you want to. Because of these circumstances we can assume that there are a lot of mistakes in the OpenFoodFacts data.\n\nThese mistakes are not advantageous for the app if it wants to tell its users the important information about a product easily and fast, what definetly is one of the aims of the app. So it seems like a huge problem that the app is full of these mistakes and can't prevent them.\n\nWe now want to look closer at the given data and analyze possible false data. Besides the obvious mistakes like negative or too high entries we also want to use the Gaussian Mixture Model to find anomalies depending on the natural structure of the given data. \n\nIn addition to that we will also use the Gaussian Mixture Model to see if there are any natural structures in our data. This would be really helpful to classify products without entering lots of different categories like you have to do now while adding a product to the database. The app could also control itself by suggesting a category out of the given entries and then asking the user if the product really belongs to this category. \n\nAfter this analysis is done we will also discuss why the Gaussian Mixture Model was used and evaluate our results.
