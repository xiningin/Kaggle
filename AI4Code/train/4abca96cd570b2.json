When working on the answer this question and the several of the ones that follow, keep the following \"gotcha\" described in the [reference](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/indexing-selecting-assigning-reference) for this tutorial section:\n\n> `iloc` uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `reviews.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `reviews.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `reviews.iloc[0:1001]`.","50fb5da3":"## 9.\n\nCreate a DataFrame `top_oceania_wines` containing all reviews with at least 95 points (out of 100) for wines from Australia or New Zealand.","6c7f94bb":"# Exercises","014ef3c0":"## 3. \n\nSelect the first row of data (the first record) from `reviews`, assigning it to the variable `first_row`.\n\nHint: from this exercise onwards I strongly recommend using `loc` or `iloc`.","ec5673ee":"# Set Up\n\nRun the following cell to load your data and some utility functions (including code to check your answers)","20578f6c":"## 4.\n\nSelect the first 10 values from the `description` column in `reviews`, assigning the result to variable `first_descriptions`.\n\nHint: format your output as a `pandas` `Series`."}}
