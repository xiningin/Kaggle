I am pretty sure that there are some companies such as healthcare facilities that has more patients admitted, but does not necessaily leads to more demand in their stocks.","225e2c34":"# Set up","bdd5fddb":"As can be seen that the mean price of the companies listed in the NASDAQ plummet at around match 2020. It went from around $42.5 to $30 within a month, approximately 28% decrease. This could be a coincidence but there is a really high chance that it is in fact influenced by the pandemic. However, I wonder why it happends so late. I thought it should happen around january since the first case appeared at that time. My initial guess is that people there are still careless about it.","bb85be41":"# The impact of COVID-19 on business in the United States based on NASDAQ index.","b7ab2db9":"# Data Import and Cleaning\nFirst of all, this dataset provides the info of stock prices from Januray 1995 to April 2020.\nWe probably won't need the data from 1995, instead we will look at the beginning of 2019 and see the trend of the stock price.","de83b154":"### REGN: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is doing really well. \nApparently, it is a pharmaceutical company. According to its website, Regeneron is applying our 30 years of scientific and technology expertise to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The industries that faced the least negative impact (in terms of percentage, not the absolute price) were consumer discretionary and communication services. It was surprising for consumer discretionary because I think people would buy less extravagant products. For communication services, my hypothesis was correct since people would still need to communicate no matter what.\n\n### Inside Healthcare Industry\nThe company that experiences the biggest negative impact was Energy industry. This is again surprising for me, since I thought people would spend a lot of energy at home. Howerver, not what I think about it, maybe it makes sense since, eventhough househodls spend more, companies do spend less. And overall consumption should be negative since buildings really use a lot of energy. But this doesn't mean the the prices of stock should behave the same trend.","848df6e1":"Now that we know that most companies experience negative impacts, let us look at each industry to see the degree of impact each industry faced.","d1726339":"## Hypothesis\n\nBefore we look at the analysis, I want to make some predictions first so it is more interesting when seeing the data. I think that obviously the overall trend of the whole industry would go down due to people's lack of trust in firms. Some of these might not directly hurt due to their servcies but stock market always work this way. It is how people feel and anticipate what could possible happen.\n\n\n### 1. The overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in the United States.\nIt is pretty obvious that the impact will be negative. But how negative will it be is a more intersting questions. I would guess that the impact should be pretty massive but it is also really difficult to logically come up with an exact number since a stock price moves pretty randomly according to demnd, supply, and people's believes. And I do not have any prior experience in trading stocks.  \n\n### 2. More specifically, it will explore what the extent of the impact each industry is facing. \nThe industries in the NASDAQ index are Industrials, Information Technology, Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Consumer Staples, Real Estate, Materials, Utilities, Energy, Communication Services\n\nMy hypothesis based on my limited knowledge is the followings. \n1. Industrials\nThis industry would have a mildly negative impact overall due to the slump in business activity. However, it should not last long and come back as soon as the pandemic is weakening. \n2. Information Technology\nThis sector would have overall mildly negative impacts. People would have spend more time on internet as well as working. For example, people spend more time using Zoom and Google Hangouts. However, these are a few companies that make products that fit the needs. However, most of the companies do not provide such products. \n3. Financials\nThis sector would hurt a lot due to \n4. Consumer Discretionary\nHonestly, I did not know what this is. However, according to investopedia, Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. By definition, this sector sounds like it would hurt a lot since people would not spend money on this luxurious product during this tough situation. They would spend most of the time on food, healthcare products, as well as some savings for emergency in case they are infected.\n5. Health Care\nI feel like this sector would have a mil benefits, and maybe in a long term. However, there are many sub sectors in this industry and not all of them would be compatible with the current situation. Companies that product vaccines and hospitals would be directly influces positively. However, companies that make unrelated products might be unaffected or even negatively effected. \n6. Consumer Staples\ni feel like this industry would benefit in a short term since people would store a lot of food due to the lockdown and quarantine. However, this would not last long.\n7. Real Estate\nReal estate would have a short term negative impact because people just panick about the situation. Hotels and accommodations like AirBNB would directly affected since people cannot travel anymore. Real estate like houses and aprtments would also affected since people probably don't think about buying or renting places at that time. People might have more savings but I don't think people would \n8. Materials\nI think that this Materials sector would directly be affected since many projects would have been ceased. For example, Tokyo Olypic is postponed. However, this is an example in Japan. We are talking about the US markets. But the point is many projects in the US would be stopped and people would again, get panicked sell these stocks\n9. Utilities\nMy first thought about this sector is \"what is Utilities sector \"lol. According to Google, The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas.In this case, it sounds like people would still need these services no matter what. People would use even more electricity and water at homes since they spend more time there. The only reason the stock prices here would go down would be again panic.\n10. Energy\nThis sector would \n11. Communication Services\nThis industry would not affect much since people are locked down and still have to communicate more using their services. I did not expect people to spend more money on this sector because we already spent a lot here and there is no need to spend even more.\n\nConsumers would spend less due to the lockdown as well as lower income, they would be discouraged to spend mt\n### 3. It will look more in detail in the healthcare industry as well since it is directly related with the pandemic\n\nThe sub sectors in the healthcare industry are the followings. Managed Health Care, Health Care Equipment, Life Sciences Tools & Services, Biotechnology, Health Care Supplies, Health Care Facilities, Pharmaceuticals, Health Care Services, Health Care Technology, Health Care Distributors\n\n1. Managed Health Care\nAccording to Wikipedia, the term managed care or managed healthcare is used in the United States to describe a group of activities intended to reduce the cost of providing for-profit health care and providing American health insurance while improving the quality of that care. \nFrom this definition, I think that this sector would not be directly influenced by the pandemic. That is why I think it should not have a positive impact. Howerver, it could have a negative impact due to the overall trend of the whole market, which is negative, bot not too negative.\n2. Health Care Equipment\nEventhough, it is true that hospitals might need more equipments for more patients who are infected, I think that the stock price woud not go up since it is not a long term thing.\n3. Life Sciences Tools & Services\nAccording to wikipedia, The Life Sciences Tools and Services Industry in the Health Care Sector includes companies involved in drug discovery, development, and production continuum by providing analytical tools, instruments, consumables and supplies, clinical trial services, and contract research services. I think that this sector would not have a direct effect as well. But again, could have a negative short-term impact.\n4. Biotechnology\nThis is an intersting sector. Biotechnology could be applied to so many fields such as food and drugs etc. I am not sure whether it produces vaccines which will be relevant in this case. If it does, the companies involved should experience a positive effect from this pandemic.\n5. Health Care Supplies\nThis sector soulds like it should have more demand over its products. Howerver, this does not mean that theie stocks would have more demand since it is a short term thing.\n6. Health Care Facilities\nThis is similar to the healthcare supplies; more demand of the services but not necessarily more demand in their stocks.\n7. Pharmaceuticals\nThis one is tricky. I am not sure whether people drink more medicine to provent or recover from COVID-19 or not. If it does, it should have an increzse in stock price.\n8. Health Care Services\nThis is similar to the healthcare supplies and healthcare facilities; more demand of the services but not necessarily more demand in their stocks.\n9. Health Care Technology\nI think this one is pretty irrelevant to COVID-19, meaning it could experience a decreae in its stock prices.\/\n10. Health Care Distributors\nThis is similar to the healthcare supplies, healthcare facilities, and healthcare services; more demand of the services but not necessarily more demand in their stocks.\n\n\n","e3e6dc28":"Let's have a look more at each stock one by one in the NASDAQ index to better understand what is really happening behind the mean price.","562eb0da":"# Conclusion\n\n","8c41b1dd":"It looks like biotechnology is the only sub sector in the healthcare industry that has benefits overall. This is really usrprising for me. I thought that other sub sectors such as Healthcare facilities, Healthcare supplies, and Pharmaceuticals would also gain some benefits. I am not sure why but my guess would be that the people are not sure when the pandemic will stop and have no gaurantee whether it is a good idea to buy the stocks or not. They could buy it and realized that the pandemic will stop soon and that there won't be demand for it anymore.
