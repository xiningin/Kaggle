Supportive treatment in hospital is therefore mainly to increase blood oxygen.\n\nPneumonia\nThe lungs resemble a sponge with each hole representing an air sac (alveolus) and material delicately holding the air sacs and the blood vessels together. The virus enters the lungs in droplets and infects cells lining the air sacs where it multiplies. This directly damages those cells, but also triggers a response from the immune cells nearby, which is called inflammation. Fluid collects in the lung tissue causing pneumonia. This impairs the transfer of oxygen between air sacs and blood, often causing the patient to experience shortness of breath as the body tries to compensate for the inefficient gas transfer by breathing faster. \n\nIntubation is a procedure that's used when you can't breathe on your own. Your doctor puts a tube down your throat and into your windpipe to make it easier to get air into and out of your lungs. A machine called a ventilator pumps in air with extra oxygen. Then it helps you breathe out air that\u2019s full of carbon dioxide (CO2). This is called mechanical ventilation. It helps keep your oxygen and CO2 at healthy levels.\n\n<font size=\"+1\" color=\"blue\">Asthma and COVID <\/font>\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/need-extra-precautions\/asthma.html\n\nPeople with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.
