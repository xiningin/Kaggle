One thing we might want to do with this type is overload the comparison operators like `>` and `<=` so that we could use them to check whether one hand beats another. e.g. it'd be cool if we could do this:\n\n```python\n>>> hand1 = BlackjackHand(['K', 'A'])\n>>> hand2 = BlackjackHand(['7', '10', 'A'])\n>>> hand1 > hand2\nTrue\n```\n\nWell, we're not going to do all that in this question (defining custom classes was a bit too advanced to make the cut for the Learn Python Challenge), but the code we're asking you to write in the function below is very similar to what we'd have to write if we were defining our own `BlackjackHand` class. (We'd put it in the `__gt__` magic method to define our custom behaviour for `>`.)\n\nFill in the body of the `blackjack_hand_greater_than` function according to the docstring.","1e4702c7":"Welcome to the exercises for day 7 (to go along with the day 7 tutorial notebook on [imports and objects](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/colinmorris\/learn-python-challenge-day-7))\n\nThere are only four problems today, but they're all pretty tricky, so be on guard!

You wrote a function `conditional_roulette_probs` which returned a dictionary with counts of how often the wheel landed on `x` then `y` for each value of `x` and `y`.\n\nAfter analyzing the output of your function, you've come to the following conclusion: for each wheel in the casino, there is exactly one pair of numbers `a` and `b`, such that, after the wheel lands on `a`, it's significantly more likely to land on `b` than any other number. If the last spin landed on anything other than `a`, then it acts like a normal roulette wheel, with equal probability of landing on any of the 11 numbers (* the casino's wheels are unusually small - they only have the numbers from 0 to 10 inclusive).\n\nIt's time to exploit this quirk for fun and profit. You'll be writing a roulette-playing agent to beat the house. When called, your agent will have an opportunity to sit down at one of the casino's wheels for 100 spins. You don't need to bet on every spin. For example, the agent below bets on a random number unless the last spin landed on 4 (in which case it just watches).","501ab7b6":"As you might have guessed, our random\/superstitious agent bleeds money. Can you write an agent that beats the house? (i.e. can you make \"Average gain per simulation\" positive?)\n\nFor more information on the type of object your agent will be passed, try calling `help(roulette.RouletteSession)`. You can also call `help(roulette.evaluate_roulette_strategy)` to see some optional parameters you can change regarding the conditions under which we test your  agent.\n\nHINT: it might help to go back to your [day 6 exercise notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/962743) and review your code for `conditional_roulette_probs` for inspiration.","39ddb089":"## The end\n\nYou've finished the Learn Python Challenge.
