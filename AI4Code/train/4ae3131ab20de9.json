A project can have only 1 backer (sounds extreme, but why not), but he\/she can contribute $1,000,000 dollar to a project and the goal can still be easily met. I know this example sounds unrealistic, but I hope you get my point.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNext, we will be looking into the median amount of money that each backer put to fund a project.

Project owners who have invested a large amount of money into building the product will suffer from a huge loss if the goal is not met. Backers who have contributed the projects may end up not receiving the products that they expected to get.\n\nIn the analysis above, we did a comparison of several success metrics of a project (e.g. number of backers, amount pledged) across different categories & project duration. The aim is to help backers & project owners to be more discerning of the different factors that affect a project success.\n\nHere is the summary of our findings:\n\n_Riskiest Category_\n\n- The riskiest category is 'Technology'. Not only does it require a lot of funds in the first place, but it also has the lowest success rate across all main categories.\n- 'Journalism' & 'Crafts' also have low success rates even though the amount of funds required to build the project is relatively low. When these projects failed, the amount of loss tends to be a lot lesser than the loss of Technology projects.\n- From the initial analysis, 'Design' seems to be pretty popular among backers and it has the highest median amount pledged. However, the goal that is set for Design projects tends to be high, which makes it more challenging for it to be successful.\n\n_Safest Category_\n\n- The safest category to go for is 'Dance', followed by 'Theater' and 'Comics'.\n- These projects do not require a lot of fixed costs to start and have the highest success rates.\n- If product owners can reduce the cost associated with Design projects significantly, then it can be a good category to launch your product.\n\n_Ideal Duration_\n\n- Duration does not seem to affect the success of a project much. Setting a longer duration does not necessarily increase the amount pledged and the number of backers.\n- Based on the analysis, the ideal duration is around 30\u201360 days, where it can attract the highest number of backers & generated a good amount of money pledged.","625591c9":"## Note\n\nI'm using median instead of mean here as the distribution of the quantitative variables are very skewed, as we can see in the table at the beginning of this notebook. Median is a measure of central tendency that is more robust to outliers.","7379787e":"**Interpretation**\n\nTop 3 main categories with the highest median amount pledged:\n\n1. Design\n2. Dance\n3.

Photography\n\nWow, Design didn't only have a lot of backers but it also does have the highest median amount pledged!\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLet's also take a look at the median amount of goal set for each category. It doesn't matter if a project has a relatively high total pledged amount or number of backers but it still far away from the goal. On the other hand, a project can only have a few backers and little amount of money pledged, but if the goal set is relatively low, then there is still chance for it to be successful.","acb81934":"**Interpretation**\n\nIt is interesting to see that there are a lot of variance between the median (50% percentile) and the maximum values of the quantitative variables...","ed965548":"## Conclusion"}}
