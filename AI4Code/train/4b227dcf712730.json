Explanations on key functionalities can be found on Medium \/ TowardsDataScience in the examples section or on YouTube (Data Professor).\n\nThe K in KLib stands for kernel because these functions might have been provided and consumed at that level. In any case, the furnished functionality has no obligation to library concepts of thread binding, context, and ownership. KLib interfaces act only upon input parameters and, when making use of global or other data not passed in through the interface, treat such data as read-only. Consequently, KLib interfaces are completely reentrant and thread-safe. They are well-suited to drivers, stacks, libraries, and other low-level code. KLib provides them at this lower level for consumption by low-level code as well as applications.\n\nhttps:\/\/support.novell.com\/techcenter\/articles\/ana20000812.html\n\nhttps:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/klib\/","2a968bdf":"#Attention, Klib clean the column headers in a pythonic way e.g lower case and underscores.","e1fc6b9d":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSpOmeiC-mCPAqS1yfK_8OXTAXOyg5Z3sB0feGnKbvKnV2MDHxNLFAXgn5eMK_fvN9e3i8&usqp=CAU)youtube.com","4f6ae281":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:#001f3f;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:orange; padding:10px\">References<\/span><\/h1><br>\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sripaadsrinivasan\/speed-up-your-data-science-projects-using-klib\/comments\n\nhttps:\/\/klib.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/\n\nhttps:\/\/reposhub.com\/python\/science-and-data-analysis\/akanz1-klib.html\n\nhttps:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/speed-up-your-data-cleaning-and-preprocessing-with-klib-97191d320f80\n\nhttps:\/\/deepnote.com\/@jose-luis-marrugo-madrid\/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Klib-rgxeSZ0SQAKi03W6s9awew","5c5d0a38":"#Open engagement again, since with products we are not able to plot correlations."}}
