A biased estimator is one that makes incorrect assumptions on the model level about the dataset. For example, suppose that we use a linear regression model on a cubic function. This model will be biased: it will structurally underestimate the true values in the dataset, always, no matter how many points we use.\n\nGiven points  x , a true value  f(x) , and a model  f^(x) , bias can be expressed mathematically as:\n\nBias[f^(x)]=E[f^(x)\u2212f(x)]\n \nWhere  E[\u22c5]  is the expected value function (e.g. the mean value).\n\nThe key to understanding bias is to understand that, given enough \"perfect\" data points sampled from a compatible distribution which has no errors or variance in it (such as a line, in the case of linear regression), an unbiased model will fit every point exactly correctly.\n\nBias is also known as underfitting. Once we've selected a model bias becomes something that we want to, within reason, reduce.","a929fe38":"**Sigmoid Function** : \nA = 1\/(1+e^-x)","60b43988":"**Feed forward Neural Network** :\nA feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the nodes do not form a cycle.\n\nThe feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes.
