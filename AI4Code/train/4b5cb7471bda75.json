This was mainly due to frustration with the pysal API and prior work on modelling COVID-19 fatalities. This always allows us to more directly compare the effects of controlling for spatial correlation in our model between neighbouring countries. ","5d292c45":"In order to model the spatial correlation between countries, we critically need to find an approach to compute the distances between these nations.  For simplicity, we have opted to fall back on geopandas default projection and use the euclidean distances between the midpoints of the countries in order to esimate their distances.  For sparse countries, it may be more faithful to use the shortest distance between borders or between capital cities, but this appeared computationally intensive and may be grounds for future work.  ","e7640c5d":"I opted to reproject the coefficients from our Spatial PCR model into the original space of our data in order to analyze them further. ","56229e50":"When analyzing Variance Inflation Factor, explored in a previous notebook, I became interested in how our parameter estimates might change if we apply a Principle Component Regression Approach.  Using this approach, we chose to apply a power transform to our continuous features before standard scaling and computing our principle components. The number of principle components were chosen based using the ELBO rule, based on the varianced explained.  I opted to reintroduce the country indicator variables into the model after computing the principle components, in order to avoid conflating the distributional assumptions across our different types of data in scaling and to ease interprettation. ","38665f20":"I chose to draw on a number of data sources on not only COVID cases but country indicators on GDP, infant mortality, etc., as well as data on population estimates and land size.  In order to better control for the variance in Fatalities and Confirmed Cases as a result of country sizes, I opted to look at Fatalities and Confirmed Cases per Capita.  As, at this stage in the virus, the pandemic is still dominated by the exponential growth in new cases, I opted to analyze the relationship between the percent change in Fatalities or Confirmed Cases per Capita, against percent changes in our factors.  Two interesting exceptions to this were variables representing the weeks since the first case in the country and the first case death, where I included both the log of the weeks since this event, to represent percent change, and the original value. This is used to model any effects relating to the logarithmic flattening of the curve late in the infection in a given country.

For economist investigating the covariates which drive housing prices, controlling for spatial correlation in our models allows us to better control for neighbourhood effects. These neighbourhood effects may be as a result of the willingness of a buyer to pay more for a house near other nice houses or as the results of unobserved variables in the data which capture the distance to schools, shops and restaurants.  \n  \nIn analyzing the spread and impact of the COVID-19 disease, I have been fascinated by whether we observed uncontrolled spatial correlation in infections or fatalities between neighbouring countries.  This may be as the results of trade or migrations between neighbouring countries or as the results of other properties of the weather or geography which are difficult to account for in the model. \n\nIn this notebook, we are interested in identifying whether controlling for this autocorrelation provides for more stable estimates to our model, as we as whether the physical distances between countries reflect honest notions of similarity between nations which may otherwise be better captured by the total number of flights or migration between countries or trade.
