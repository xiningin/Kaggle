The objective is to make these medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available faster to address the emergency. The assessment essentially weighs the threat posed by the emergency against the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product based on a robust body of evidence.\n\nThe EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of phase II and phase III clinical trial data as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy and manufacturing quality. These data are reviewed by independent experts who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and the plans for further studies.\nhttps:\/\/www.who.int\/news\/item\/13-11-2020-first-ever-vaccine-listed-under-who-emergency-use","9ec54218":"#Would there be enough Vaccine for everyone?\n\n\"When FDA first authorizes or approves the use of one or more COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, there may be a limited supply.

A wait. Another shot: Two-dose coronavirus vaccine regimens will make it harder to inoculate America\nBy Frances Stead Sellers - November 27, 2020 \n\nAs the nation gears up to vaccinate tens of millions of Americans against the novel coronavirus, public health officials like her are facing novel dilemmas, driven by the urgency of the pandemic, the fact that only a small minority may have immunity from prior exposure and by the vaccine available at each site, with the differing intervals between shots depending on the manufacturer.\n\nA two- or three-dose dose regimen is routine for building immunity against many illnesses, but it is unprecedented in a pandemic when the public health goal is to vaccinate 60 to 70 percent of the population within months to reach herd immunity and stop the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThis is the only time we\u2019ve faced a serious, immediate threat to the entire population that requires a two-dose vaccine.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for a vaccine to require re-upping in order to provoke the immune system to respond more effectively. The classic schedule for vaccines that target proteins like the spike protein on the surface of this coronavirus, Moore said, is three shots \u2014 \u201cprime, prime, boost\u201d \u2014 with the second and third shots coming one and six months after the first injection. Each of the first two shots primes the immune system and is typically followed by a modest drop-off in antibodies. The third shot, usually at least six months after the first one, can give long-term protection by boosting the immune system\u2019s memory cells, which by that point have matured and are ready to respond.\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/health\/two-shots-covid-vaccine\/2020\/11\/27\/b852a19a-2f24-11eb-bae0-50bb17126614_story.html","b7031a5d":"#Over US 2 billion raised to support equitable access to COVID vaccines with additional US 5 billion needed in 2021\n\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance welcomes latest pledges in support of the Gavi COVAX AMC, a financing mechanism that will support 92 low- and middle-income economies\u2019 access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. The approximately US 360 million in commitments include US350m announced at the Paris Peace Forum by the European Commission, France, Spain and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as an earlier pledge of US 10 million made by the Republic of Korea. \n\nThis means that over US 2 billion has been raised for the Gavi COVAX AMC so far, thanks to contributions from other sovereign donors, the private sector, and philanthropic sources. This funding will allow COVAX AMC to reserve and access 1 billion doses for AMC-eligible economies, with at least US 5 billion needed in 2021 to procure doses as they come through the portfolio.\n\nThe announcements come as 94 higher-income economies have officially joined the COVAX Facility, a global effort to ensure rapid and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the most vulnerable groups across the world. These 94 self-financing participants in the COVAX Facility will join the 92 low- and middle-income economies eligible to have their participation in the Facility supported by the Gavi COVAX AMC.\n\nThe COVAX Facility is part of COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, civil society organisations and others.
