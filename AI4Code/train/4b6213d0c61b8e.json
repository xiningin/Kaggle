As you can see in the trend below, how the data for counties is getting doubled each 2nd day or 4th day. Japan is the only country which is having doubling rate near about to week. Week later USA was doubling it count in 4 Days. This week i.e. as of 8th April ,the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. surpassed 426,000 on Wednesday, according to figures provided by NBC, with 12,864 fatalities nationwide.Just one week back they were having around 213,000 cases. India is also doubling its figures every 4th-5th consecutive day now. India was having 3082 cases on 4th April and on 8th April it have been doubled to 5916. You can refer to image below as per doubling rate for different counties. As per the graph we can easily see the growth for Spain, Italy and Germany have started to steep down.
