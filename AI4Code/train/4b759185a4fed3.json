presence in Inida. As compared to past few years India has seen a tremendous growth in AI, from healthcare, agriculture, IT sectors etc. As a part of this there has been a remarkable initiation from Indian government also towrds increasing the presence of AI in India. Since the early 90s, the IT and ITeS services sector in India has been of tremendous importance to its economy eventually growing to account for 7.7% of India\u2019s GDP in 2016. In an attempt to capitalize on this foundation, the current Indian administration announced in February 2018 that the government think-tank, National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, will spearhead a national programme on AI focusing on research. Apart from this goverment is inducting Python language in the CBSE curriculum which has sparked an keen interest of teenagers in AI. The result of this initiation can be seen as people of the age group 18-29 being the most population working in AI fields. Not only male but the female ratio has also seen a comfortable growth. Apart from government's initiation, the AI startups have seen a significant rise in the past 2-3 years. Few top AI startups are Hotstar, Grammner etc. The usage of AI and ML in India can also be seen in Indian politics, with political consulting firms like I-PAC using AI and ML extensively during election campaignings.\nJust as Google, Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon are battling to serve the cloud computing and machine learning needs of the US government, the next three to five years may lead to a similar dynamic within India. As the Indian government pushes for digitization and enacts more AI initiatives, private firms will flock to win big contracts \u2013 adding to the pool of funds to develop new technologies and spin out new AI and data science-related startups.\nAlthough AI attention is considerably smaller in India than in China or the USA, the increased AI interest in India has manifested itself in the following ways:\n1.Industries have started working to skill their manpower to enable themselves to compete with other global players.\n2.Educational institutions have started working on their curricula to include courses on machine learning and other relevant areas.\n3.Individuals and professionals have started acquiring these skills and are comfortable investing in upgrading their own skills.","99cef64b":"India is the seventh largest country with second largest population, a leader in providing the technical education and one of the fastest growing economy in the world.

","8c17ff35":"#### Gender Distribution","4dd5407a":"- Kaggle is Data Science Ecosystem but most of the respondents prefer Coursera where they start learning Machine Learning. - Coursera is famous for its qualities like its top quality education from the best schools around the world in wide range of subjects which allow people to select the subject of their interest and unmatched learning experience.\n- Coursera has provided indians opportunity to access courses from the bes universities around the world.\n- Lack of machine learning and data science structure in the indian universities has encouraged more indians to opt for coursera, coursera also provides free video lectures gives access to underprivilaged individuals to learn new things.\n","73195490":"##  Data Prepration","03665d69":"## Conclusion","bf23647d":"#### Notebooks And Tools","8ac48617":"- As Indusry is moving towards machine learning and artificial intelligence and with the steps of government to pace up the growth of AI in India, the students of Bachelor's and Master's degree also have become more enhusiastic in opting as Data Science and machine learning as their career path.\n\n- With about $480$ $million$ $dollars$ budget allocated in 2018 for AI and government collabrations with colleges to promote machine learning is also creating awareness in students  ","48e61b44":"## Analysis","116106f7":"#### Learning Platforms from which Indian starts their journey","15360f7c":"- We see people in between $18-29$ which comprises of $students$ and $young$ $working$ $professionals$ are cumulatively high than middle age and old age individuals. \n\n- In the last few years Data Science biggest buzzword in the job market. With various reports suggesting that machine learning and data science are the fastest growing jobs in the world, it is easy to see why there is gold rush for data science in India at this point of time where studies shows there are about $90,000$ vacancies per year\n\n- Success stories of many data science learners are further driving others to opt for machine learning and data science as a career path. \n\n- For the country in which most of the technical graduates are finding difficult to get a job, data science and machine learning is working as a catyalist to bridge the gap between industry requirements and education. ","68279e6d":"- As expected, Jupyter is the most used notebook which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, exploratory text in a single document. \n- Followed by Kaggle notebooks and Google Colab neck to neck at around 10%.\n- As we can see, there are number of notebooks available online or on cloud.\n- Jupyter gain popularity in recent years because of its architecture that allows the notebook to speak dozens of programming languages.\n- One analysis of the code-sharing site GitHub counted more than 2.5 million public Jupyter notebooks in September 2018, up from 200,000 or so in 2015.\n\n\n- Python stands at top when respondents talk about programming language used in ML followed by SQL an R respectively. \n- Python offers concise and readable code. It is loosely coupled language.\n- Since it is open source language, it has access to libraries and frameworks for ML like Numpy, Pandas, SciKit, SciPi, Seaborn to name a few. It also offers flexibility and platform independence.\n- Another reason for python being most used programming language among Indians is because replacement of C++ with python in highschool curriculum.\n","326e4ab9":"#### Current Role on Profile ","6341d040":"- Gender distribution does not show promising figures in India, less number of Females is cause of many social and cultural factors.

There are many factors such as deep rooted gender norms and social norms that hinders the education of many girls. \n- On the other hand we see the female responders in India are more than that of United States of America, China and Japan. This shows that females in India are adapting to change in technology.  ","878493fd":"AS observed, ML is gaining popularity among students with 32% respondents followed by Data Scientists and Software Engineer at 16% and 15% respectively.\nIn current scenario, Data science is highly paid job since there is huge gap in supply and demand.\nPeople in past have used Excel, SPSS, STATA for decision making, but now we have tools like Google Analytics, Tableau, Sisense and programming languages such as R and Python which let users perform complicated analyis with couple of lines of code.\n\n- In India students are started realising that just a graduate degree no more garuntee of continued progress in one's career. So, students and professionals with different domains are coming forward and opting for machine learning and data science.\n- India has large startup ecosystem and new graduates and students are coming up with new ideas to start a venture based on machine learning and data science.","200171d2":"# Artificial Intelligence and Data Science In India ","a2e2afce":"#### Education","353dbee4":"#### Favourite Media Source ","cc0bdf19":"#### Age Groups","07837310":"- Kaggle tops the list where most of the respondents favoring it as the best media source for ML\/AI topics,Blogs and YouTube follows with 19% and 18% respectively. All other media sources like Course Forums, Journal publications etc share a litlle percentage of all media sources. Kaggle is more popular because of its largest and diverse community that not only shares their ideas but also help people in every aspect. \n-  Large availabilty of all kinds of data whether it is image data or text data for experimenting with machine learning algorithms are another driving factor of kaggle which makes it famous among Indians. \n- Indians are quite competitive when it comes to showcase and test there skills so competitions on kaggle is huge opportunity  for them to test there skills and compete with others around the world which lead to steep increase in learning.","8085ad70":"## Biblography\n- https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/small-biz\/startups\/features\/in-the-race-for-ai-supremacy-has-india-missed-the-bus\/articleshow\/69836362.cms?from=mdr\n- https:\/\/women-s.net\/womens-education-in-india\/\n- https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/chennai\/python-replaces-c-java-in-new-cbse-curriculum\/articleshow\/63421271.cms"}}
