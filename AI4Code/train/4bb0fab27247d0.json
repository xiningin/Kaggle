Every PUBG player will agree to the immense, unparalleled happiness washing through on winning a victory(a 'Chicken dinner', in PUBG lingo). As much as it is relaxing, it is addictive too. So in this notebook, I have derived conclusions on some of the most important factors affecting victory in a PUBG match.\n\nA. WHAT NOT TO DO AT PUBG ?\n\n*  Never opt for Squad-FPP matches unless very sure of your communication skills. Analysis shows that Squad-FPP players tend to lose more games. A major reason behind them could be miscommunication, as Squad FPPs form random teams with players across the globe.\n*  Never opt for a duo match, as analysis shows none of the players under observation won in a duo match.\n*  Never stop at just one kill. Analytics shows that players with less than 2 kills got gunned down.\n*  Never hide from the very beginning of the game. Analaysis shows that people with zero walking distance lose more.\n*  Never take a ride, as you are in risk of a road kill. Also, avoid swimming too. Analysis shows they contribiute very feebly to victory.\n*  Never pick on a battle with a stronger opponent. The number of opponents you kill is not much related to winning.\n\nB. WHAT TO DO AT PUBG TO WIN ?\n*  Opt for Squad matches. Analysis shows they are the 3rd most popular match type, yet guarantee more victory than Squad-FPP. This is because, in squad matches, you get to form or choose your own team and communication is thus easier if you are playing with your friends.\n*  Opt for Duo-FPP matches, as analysis says that they offer the highest victory rate.\n*  Kill as many people as you can without getting gunned down. Analysis shows that number of kills and win percentages are moderately correlated.  If you feel the situation is safe, kill strategically. Like, if you have a shotgun, fight someone with a shotgun and not a higher level weapon. And the more you kill, the more vests and weapons you collect ;)\n*  As long as you are not in danger, analysis shows that inflicting more damage showcases a player's skills and usually ensures a good score.\n*  Prefer walking or running than swimming or riding. Data tells us that the peak of victory comes with moderately high walking distance.\n*  Indulge in picking up more boosts and healing items, as both are strongly correlated to victory.\n*  Pick battles wisely. Fight enemies you are sure you can gun down.\n\nTHANK YOU :)","02f93b6b":"##### CONCLUSIONS :\nWe observe :\n*  Maximum matches were lost when walkingDistance = 0. This can mean two things :\n    -  The player got killed even before he\/she could leave.\n    -  The player was probably trying to hide instead of venturing out and got killed.\n*  Clearly, maximum wins were recorded for walking distances greater than a threshold(walkingDistance > 2000) and of course, GREATER THAN ZERO.\n*  The data goes hand in hand. The wins start peaking where the losses fade out. So, as walking distance increases :\n    -  Possibility of winning increases.\n    -  Possibility of losing a match is lesser.\n\n### So, we can conclude that walking distance is a good measure of determining wins. Above a certain threshold (> 2000) chances of winning a game increases. Staying idle\/hidden from the very beginning of the game is not a good strategy and makes a player vulnerable to getting knocked down.","0974884c":"##### THE DATASET SEEMS WELL-MADE, SINCE IT SHOWS NO NULL VALUES EXCEPT FOR IN winPlacePerc.","5d9d3eb1":"##### CONCLUSION :\n*  As expected swimDistance and winPlacePerc have poor correlation, justifying heatmap data(0.15).\n\n##### FURTHER STATISTICS\n##### DEFINE :\nWhat percentage of players won their games even after zero walkDistance, rideDistance and awimDistance ?

Though it is not a vital factor affecting vcitory, but an existent one.\n*  DBNOs has a low correlation with winning. Probably because some battles are against stronger opponents.\n","fb10b4d3":"##### CONCLUSION :\n*  winPlacePerc and walkDistance are highly correlated. Hence information gained from the heatmap(0.81) is justified.\n*  In order to win it is absolutely necessary to move and walk\/run in order to take part in killing, damage and upgrade weapons and vests from fallen enemies.\n*  Players are more prone to losing a game if they do not take a step or walk short distances(very close to zero).\n\n##### RIDING\/DRIVING\n##### DEFINE :\nFind riding distribution for victory and loss.\n##### CODE","bea7b476":"##### UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS","715f7e37":"##### CONCLUSIONS :\n*  Most wins are recorded when walk distance > 0 (99.2%)\n*  Almost half of match losses are recorded when ride distance = 0 (49.5%)\n*  A considerate amount of losses are recorded when swim distance = 0 (15.1%)\n*  So the best strategy is to walk > swim >> ride a vehicle\n\n##### DEFINE :\n##### HOW DOES BOOSTS AND HEALS AFFECT WIN PERCENTAGE ?\n##### CODE","b604b34d":"##### DEFINE :\n##### COMPARISON BETWEEN RUNNING, DRIVING AND SWIMMING : DOES MODE OF TRAVEL\/TRANSPORT AFFECT WIN PROBABILITY ?

This is expected because :\n        (a) There's the risk of roadKills from the oponent's perspective. So riding a vehicle is far more dangerous than walking.\n       So the reson for such an abnormal surge in zero rideDistance is due to players not opting for riding any vehicle.\n       \n### So, we can conclude that riding distance is not a good measure of determining wins.
