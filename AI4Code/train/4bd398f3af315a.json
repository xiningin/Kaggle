Is this ratio the same in the private test set? The answer to this question would give us some clues about how much difference there is between the public test set and the private test set. In this kernel, inspired by [this discussion](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/aptos2019-blindness-detection\/discussion\/97652#latest-596913) and [this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/private-lb-probing-0-950), the image size distribution of public + private test set will be probed.\n\n# Approach\nLet's assume that we have N-(submission.csv, public LB score) pairs from already submitted kernels. By changing the submission file according to the desired information about the private test set, we can get log(N) bits information from one submission. Here \"change submission\" means to copy the targets of the public test set from the known submissions and insert arbitrary dummy targets to the remaining private test set. By doing so, we can control the public LB score according to what we want to know.\n\n# Answer\nThe answer is no. While the ratio of 640x480 images in the public test set is 72.770%, the ratio of 640x480 images in the public + private test set is 30-40%. There are some differences between the public test set and the private test set. I hope this information would be useful in choosing the final submission(s).","14371435":"I have ten submissions with known public LB scores. Let's select a submission file according to `target_ratio_code` and copy the targets to the submission of this kernel.","31e5f926":"Alright, what is the public LB score? I got the score of 0.711, which indicates that `target_ratio_code` of the public + private test set is 3; the ratio is 30-40%. This is a little bit different from that of the public test set. How do you think this?"}}
