Directly plotting it using seaborn gives us the below graph. As seen, as the calories increase, the category of the recipe moves towards '1' i.e. its a dessert. ","f2c4ad53":"The dataset contains recipes and their details. For this problem, lets use Logistic Regression to classify whether a recipe is a dessert or no, based on the calories it has.

We also will clean the data by dropping rows which have null values.","e82844fe":"The shaded area is our error in prediction. Since we've not set or created a model but used the inbuilt regression, we can see that the error is less when the calories are low. As calories increase, our error increases too.
