In these countries, fertility rates are higher due to the lack of access to contraceptives and generally lower levels of female education. You can read more about it here. On the other hand, developed countries tend to have a lower fertility rate due to lifestyle choices associated with economic affluence where mortality rates are low, birth control is easily accessible and children often can become an economic drain caused by housing, education cost and other cost involved in bringing up children.
