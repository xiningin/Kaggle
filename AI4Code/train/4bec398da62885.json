I will be doing a more intensive exploratory data analysis soon, but this is just a simple bare bones kernel with processed pandas profiling reports of each of the datasets.  \n\nThese can take a very long time to process, so having them handy is very useful.\n\nAfter checking out the data here, feel free to check out me [my EDA kernel here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tpmeli\/seasonal-decomposition-question-based-eda-of-m5)\n\n### Use the 'toggle details' to see more.
