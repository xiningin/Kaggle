Churn by Total Charges**: It seems that there is higer churn when the total charges are lower.","c85d949a":"1. Lets first look at the churn rate in our data","b03ebced":"In our data, 74% of the customers do not churn. Clearly the data is skewed as we would expect a large majority of the customers to not churn. This is important to keep in mind for our modelling as skeweness could lead to a lot of false negatives. We will see in the modelling section on how to avoid skewness in the data.","e90b47a4":"Interestingly most of the monthly contracts last for 1-2 months, while the 2 year contracts tend to last for about 70 months. This shows that the customers taking a longer contract are more loyal to the company and tend to stay with it for a longer period of time. \n\nThis is also what we saw in the earlier chart on correlation with the churn rate.

Additionally, there is no difference in senior citizen status by gender.","8a531e99":"Churn is a one of the biggest problem in  the telecom industry.

Churn by Seniority**: Senior Citizens have almost double the churn rate than younger population.","ce38d5c4":"Month to month contracts, absence of online security and tech support seem to be positively correlated with churn. While, tenure, two year contracts seem to be negatively correlated with churn. \n\nInterestingly, services such as Online security, streaming TV, online backup, tech support, etc. without internet connection seem to be negatively related to churn.\n\nWe will explore the patterns for the above correlations below before we delve into modelling and identifying the important variables.","fc6e6de2":"**What would be interesting is to look at the % of customers, who have partners, also have dependents.

Tenure:**  After looking at the below histogram we can see that a lot of customers have been with the telecom company for just a month, while quite a many are there for about 72 months. This could be potentially because different customers have different contracts. Thus based on the contract they are into it could be more\/less easier for the customers to stay\/leave the telecom company.","90f15f2e":"## After going through the above EDA we will develop some predictive models and compare them.\n\nWe will develop Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, ADA Boost and XG Boost","c9c0a38e":"Below we will understand the tenure of customers based on their contract type.","000acdcb":"Interestingly,  among the customers who have a partner, only about half of them also have a dependent, while other half do not have any independents. \nAdditionally, as expected, among the customers who do not have any partner, a majority (80%) of them do not have any dependents .","c312373b":"### B.) **Customer Account Information**:  Let u now look at the tenure, contract","1ebc3f15":"**Observations**\n\nWe can see that some variables have a negative relation to our predicted variable (Churn), while some have positive relation. Negative relation means that likeliness of churn decreases with that variable. Let us summarize some of the interesting features below:\n* As we saw in our EDA, having a 2 month contract reduces chances of churn. 2 month contract along with tenure have the most negative relation with Churn as predicted by logistic regressions\n* Having DSL internet service also reduces the proability of Churn\n* Lastly, total charges, monthly contracts, fibre optic internet services and seniority can lead to higher churn rates. This is interesting because although fibre optic services are faster, customers are  likely to churn because of it. I think we need to explore more to better understad why this is happening. \n\nAny hypothesis on the above would be really helpful!
