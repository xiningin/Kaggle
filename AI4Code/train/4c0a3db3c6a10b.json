We do this by assigning a score to all sentences in the corpus. The score reflects the similarity of the sentence with respect to the query. We also assign score to each individual research paper as the maximum relevance score of a sentence in the paper. Our tool also displays context surrounding the high scoring sentence as it might contain relevant information as well. Next, we briefly describe how we score each sentence with respect to a given query.\n\n## Scoring sentences using BioSentVec\n\nThe score of each sentence is computed as the inner product between the sentence and the query vector. We create vector representation of each sentence using a pre-trained [BioSentVec model](https:\/\/github.com\/ncbi-nlp\/BioSentVec). The BioSentVec model is a [sent2vec model](https:\/\/github.com\/epfml\/sent2vec) which has been trained on the pubmed corpus and outputs a sentence embedding by averaging the embeddings of the words in them. Although simple, sent2vec has shown to be effective for many downstream applications. We compute all sentences vectors and store them offline. Given a query, we first compute its distributed representation and then find the K-nearest sentence vectors (i.e. the top-K scoring sentences) from the corpus. As mentioned before, we score a document as the maximum score of any sentence within it. The figure below summarizes our system.\n\n![KNN](http:\/\/kdcovid.nl\/fig2.jpg)\n\n## Generating Sentence Embeddings\n\nThe following code can be used to generate sentence embeddings:\n","1d62a47d":"## Search Tool\n\nYou can set up a search tool object that runs the server using:","2b8c0551":"In this example, we've used cached results to provide the same results available on [http:\/\/kdcovid.nl\/](http:\/\/kdcovid.nl\/), remove the ```cached_result_file``` parameter if using the SearchTool for live search.","85dcb84e":"## Document Preprocessing\n\nWe first preprocess the corpus by collecting the full texts of papers into a single pickle file: \n\n![Step1](http:\/\/kdcovid.nl\/fig1.jpg)\n\nIn our [github repo](https:\/\/github.com\/nmonath\/kdcovid\/) we have provided scripts that are set up to run on the entire CORD19 corpus.\n\nIn this nodebook, we provide a demo of the code, which runs on a subset of documents.","83c66d7e":"The below loads the text of the documents. `max_files_processed` restricts this to only load 100 documents to keep this demo running quickly.

It retrieves papers by measuring similarity between queries and sentences in the full text of papers in CORD19 corpus. We also extract the bio-medical entities (diseases, genes) and link them to various ontologies. Lastly we also display various gene-disease association between the retrieved entities. This tool is a work-in-progress and below we provide a simple description of different components of our system.\n\nOur code is available on Github here: https:\/\/github.com\/nmonath\/kdcovid\/ The github repo contains scripts to reproduce all data that is used to run the website: [kdcovid.nl](http:\/\/kdcovid.nl\/). In this demo, we will run on small subsets of data for demonstration only.\n\nThe first step to use KDCOVID is to install this code:","17a748aa":"# Pros \/ Cons\n\n## Pros:\n\n1. We present a simple and easy to use knowledge discovery tool to help bio-medical researchers that uses distributed representation of query and sentences to find relevant snippets from full text of research papers.\n2. We also extract several biological entities such as genes and diseases, link them to existing large high quality (human curated) knowledge bases and show relevant gene-disease associations. Traversing the links (from the nodes) would help bio-medical researchers to browse and gather more information that is not just restricted to the findings of the retrieved papers\n3. We also present an easy to use web-interface and knowledge base search tool for researchers\n\n## Cons:\n\n1. Our tool retrieves relevant papers for a specific query and highlights relevant spans of text. However, it does not summarize the results from all the retrieved papers nor does it provide aggregate level trends or directions which would be beneficial for a researcher using the tool.\n2. Use of contextual embeddings: Contextual embeddings such as BERT, RoBERTa have proven to be more effective than models that use fixed vector representation of words. We are currently working on getting sentence representation using aforementioned models and hope to update our web-interface soon\n3. Tagging chemical nodes: Even though we tagged genes and diseases, we haven\u2019t yet tagged entities which represent chemical compounds. We plan to fix this soon as well.\n4. Reasoning using evidence from text and knowledge graphs: This is a part of the larger research we plan to pursue. Using the retrieved evidence (both text and KG), one could \u201creason\u201d and predict new associations between drugs and diseases or find out if a drug could be re-purposed to treat a new disease (drug-repurposing). We believe our tool gives a good starting point for doing such research.\n5. Its a tool after all: We built this tool to aid bio-medical researchers to browse and find relevant information. We don\u2019t intend to predict cure or treatment time. We would like our tool to help researchers come to an answer for several pressing questions that the world is facing in this crisis.","d8616d56":"## Extracting Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from the evidence\nThe main aim for building this tool is to help bio-medical researchers find relevant information. However, it is unlikely that all the answers that they are looking for would be answered by our initial set of retrieved papers. Often times, the initial retrieved evidence provides a good starting point for retrieving more evidence (e.g. think about those instances where you click an anchor link in a wikipedia page to go into another wiki page). We hypothesize that the bio-medical entities (viruses, genes, drugs etc) which are mentioned in the retrieved research papers would be useful for the researchers. Therefore, we identify the entities present in the papers, and link them to knowledge bases from which the researchers can browse further information. We also display relationship edges between the entities (e.g. associations between genes and diseases). Below we briefly summarize each component\n\n## Identifying entities in text\nThe first step is to identify the entities that are present in the retrieved papers. We use a simple approach of fuzzy string matching to match to a dictionary containing various entity names and their aliases. The dictionary is derived from the BeFree system. After finding the entities, we link the genes to the UniProt and diseases to the MedGen ontologies. We are also adding entity linking drugs to Drugbank soon.\n\n## Finding relations between entities\nThere are several knowledge bases (KBs) that capture relation between entities. These KBs are either manually curated from the findings of several research papers over many years or have been automatically inferred from text using various relation extraction approaches. Finding and displaying these relations in our tool will allow researchers to get insights about findings that are not restricted to the retrieved paper. For our tool, we use the gene-disease association present in DisGenet. We are working on adding relations between genes, diseases and drugs as well. \n\n## Entity Linking Code\n\nWe use a modified version of the [BeFree](http:\/\/ibi.imim.es\/befree\/) package to do entity linking.
