It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories\n\n## Content\n\nThis dataset includes important attributes of the garment manufacturing process and the productivity of the employees which had been collected manually and also been validated by the industry experts.\n\nAcknowledgements\nRelevant Papers:\n\n[1] Imran, A.

[Web Link]\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThis dataset can be used for regression purpose by predicting the productivity range (0-1) or for classification purpose by transforming the productivity range (0-1) into different classes.\n\n## Task Details\n\nIt is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories.\n\n","17ca695c":"There are mising values in wip column","1d0bd1d9":"## 9 No_of_workers","c466d0e1":"Quarter5 contains 2 days as 29th and 31th of January.
