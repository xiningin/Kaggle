(This section is kind of diving into the weeds, not required reading)\n\n__df_train__ and __df_test__ First note that if we want we can pass two different pandas dataframe sets to automunge, such as might be beneficial if we have one set with labels (a \"train\" set) and one set without (a \"test\" set). Note that the normalization parameters are all derived just from the train set, and applied for consistent processing of any test set if included. Again a prerequisite is that any train and test set must have consistently labeled columns and consistent formated data, with the exception of any designated \"ID\" columns or \"label\" columns which will be carved out and consistenlty shuffled and partitioned. Note too that we can pass these sets with non-integer-range index or even multi column indexes, such that such index columns will be carved out and returned as part of the ID sets, consistently shuffled and partitioned. If we only want to process a train set we can pass the test set as \"False\".\n\n__labels_column__ is intended for passing string identifiers of a column that will be treated as labels. Note that some of the methods require the inclusion of labels, such as feature importance evaluation or label frequency levelizer (for oversampling rows with lower frequency labels).\n\n__trainID_column__ and testID_column are intended for passing strings or lists of strings identifying columns that will be carved out before processing and consistently shuffled and partitioned. \n\n__valpercent1__ and __valpercent2__ parameters are intended as floats between 0-1 that indicate the ratio of the sets that will be carved out for the two validation sets. If shuffle train is activated then the sets will be carved out randomly, else they will be taken from the bottom sequnetial rows of the train set and randomly partitioned between the two validaiton sets. Note that these values default to 0.\n\n__shuffletrain__ parameter indicates whether the train set will be (can you guess?) yep you were right the answer is shuffled.\n\n__TrainLabelFreqLevel__ parameter indicates whether the train set will have the oversampling method applied where rows with lower frequency labels are copied for more equal distribution of labels, such as might be beneficial for oversampling in the training operation.\n\n__powertransform__ parameter indicates whether default numerical coloumn evluation will include an inference of distribution properties to assign between z-score normalization, min-max scaling, or box-cox power law trasnformation. Note this one is still somewhat rough around the edges and we will continue to refine mewthods going forward.\n\n__binstransform__ indicates whether defauilt z-score normalizaiton applicaiton will include the develoipment of bins sets identifying a point's placement with respect to number of standard deviations from the mean.\n\n__MLinfill__ indicates whether default infill methods will predict infill for missing points using machine learning models trained on the rest of the set in generalizaed and automated fashion. Note that this method benefits from increased scale of data in teh train set, and mmodels derbvied from the train set are used for consistent prediction methods for the test set.\n\n__infilliterate__ indicates whether the predictive methods for MLinfill will be iterated by this integer such as may be beneficial for particularily messy data.\n\n__randomseed__ seed for randomness for all of the random seeded methods such as predcitive algorithms for ML infill, feature importance, PCA, shuffling, etc\n\n__numbercategoryheuristic__ an integer indicating for categorical sets the threshold between processing with one-hot-encoding vs ordinal methods\n\n__pandasoutput__ quite simply True means returned sets are pandas dataframes, False means Numpy arrays (defaults to Numpy arrays)\n\n__NArw_marker__ indicates whether returned columns will include a derived column indicating rows that were subject to infill (can be identified with the suffix \"NArw\")\n\n__featureselection__ indicated whether a feature importance evlauation will be performed (using then shuffle permeation method), note this requires the inclusion of a designated loabels column in the train set. Results are presented in the returned object \"featureimportance\"\n\n__featurepct__ if feature selection performed and featuremethod == 'pct', indicates what percent of columns will be retained from the feature importance dimensionality reduction (columns are ranked by importance and the low percent are trimmed). Note that a value of 1.0 means no trimming will be done.\n\n__featuremetric__ if feature selection performed and featuremethod == 'metric', indicates what threshold of importance metric will be required for retained columns from the feature importance dimensionality reduction (columns feature importance metrics are derived and those below this threshold are trimmed). Note that a value of 0.0 means no trimming will be done.\n\n__feteaturemethod__ accepts values of 'pct' or 'metric' indicates method used for any feature importance dimensionality reduction\n\n__PCAn_components__ Triggers PCA dimensionality reduction when != None. Can be a float indicating percent of columns to retain in PCA or an integer indicated number of columns to retain. The tool evaluates whether set is suitable for kernel PCA, sparse PCA, or PCA. Alternatively, a user can assign a desired PCA method in the ML-cmnd['PCA_type']. Note that a value of None means no PCA dimensionality reduction will be performed unless the scale of data is below a heuristic based on the number of features. (A user can also just turn off default PCA with ML-cmnd['PCA_type'])\n\n__PCAexcl__ a list of any columns to be excluded from PCA trasnformations\n\n__ML_cmnd__ allows a user to pass parameters to the predictive algorithms used in ML infill, feature importance, and PCA (I won't go into full detail here, although note one handy feature is we can tell the algorithm to exlcude boolean columns form PCA which is useful)\n\n__assigncat__ allows a user to assign distinct columns to different processing methods, for those columns that they don't want to defer to default automated processing. For example a user could designate columns for min-max scaling instead of z-score, or box-cox power law trasnform, or you know we've got a whole library of methods that we're continueing to build out. These are defined in our READ ME. Simply pass the column header string identifier to the list associated with any of these root categories.\n\n__assigninfill__ allows a user to assign disinct columns to different infill methods for missing or improperly formatted data, for those columns that they don't want to defer to default automated infill whi ch could be either standard infill (mean to numerical sets, most common to binary, and boolean identifier to categorical), or ML infill if it was selected. \n\n__transformdict__ and __processdict__ allows a user to design custom trees or trasnformations or even custom processing functions such as documented in our essays that no one reads. Once defined a column can be assigned to these methods in the assigncat.\n\n__printstatus__ You know, like, prints the status during operation. Self-explanatory!\n\n\nNow we'll demonstrate a few.","efff176e":"# Introduction","4df28ccb":"Upon inspection:\n- addr2, card4, and ProductCD both have a series of suffixes which represent the different categories derived from a one-hot-encoding of a categorical set\n- each of TransactionDT, TransactionAmt, card1, card2, card3, card5, addr1, addr2, dist1 have the suffix 'nmbr' which represents a z-score normalization\n- card6 has the suffix 'bnry' which represents a binary (0\/1) encoding\n- P_emaildomain has the suffix 'ordl' which represents an ordinal (integer) encoding","d69e091c":"# transformdict and processdict","83a65e1e":"# TrainLabelFreqLevel","07bd2fed":"Well at the risk of overwhelming the reader I'm just going to throw out a full application.

","bcfbda77":"Hi there! I'm kind of new to Kaggle but would like to use this competition as an opportunity to demonstrate the Automunge tool for automated data-wrangling. This entry is possibly in the realm of Automated ML Tool territory, but to be fair Automunge isn't really a turnkey machine learning replacement, it's intended use is primarily for the preparation of tabular data for machine learning (basically performing the data preparation pipelines in the steps immediately preceding training a machine learning model or the subsequent consistent processing to prepare data to generate predictions), and the application of predictive algorithms are intended to be conducted seperately. That being said, the tool does make use of some predictive algorithms along the way, including the optional use of machine learning to predict infill to missing or improperly formatted data, what we call ML infill (more on that later).\n\nIn short, Automunge prepares tabular data intended for training a machine learning model, and enables consistent processing of subsequently available data for generating predictions from that same model. Through preparation, numerical data is normalized, categorical data is encoded, and time-series data is also encoded. A user may defer to automated methods where the tool infers properties of each column to assign a processing method, or alternately assign custom processign methods to distinct columns from our library of feature engineering transformations. \n\nA user may also consider automunge a platform for data wrangling, and may pass their own processing functions incorproating simple data structures such that through the incorproation of their trasnforms into the tool they can make use of extremely useful methods such as machine learning derived infill to missing or improperly formatted data (ML infill), feature importance evaluation, automated dimensionality reduction via feature importance results or Principle Components Analysis (PCA), and perthaps most importantly the simplest means for consistent processing of subsequently available data with just the simplest of function calls.

In fact, good practice is that we should always save externally any postprocess_dict returned from the application of automunge whose output was used to train a machine learning model. Why? Well using this postprocess_dict object, we can then pass any subsequently available \"test\" data that we want to use to generate predictions from that machine learning model giving fully consistent processing and encoding. Let's demonstrate. \n\nWhen we performed a train_test_split above to derive the \"tiny_train\" set, we also ended up with a bigger set called \"tiny_train_bigger\".
