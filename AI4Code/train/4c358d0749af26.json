First, in RadiusNeighborsClassifier we need to specify the radius of the fixed area used to determine if an observation is a neighbor using radius. Unless there is some substantive reason for setting radius to some value, it is best to treat it like any other hyperparameter and tune it during model selection. The second useful parameter is outlier_label, which indicates what label to give an observation that has no observations within the radius - which itself can often be a useful tool for identifying outliers.\n","8e67f5c4":"<a id=\"4\"><\/a> <br>\n## 4- Estimator","279972eb":"Given a scikit-learn estimator object named **model**, the following methods are available:\n\n#### Available in all Estimators\n\n**model.fit()** : fit training data. For supervised learning applications, this accepts two arguments: the data X and the labels y (e.g. model.fit(X, y)). For unsupervised learning applications, this accepts only a single argument, the data X (e.g. model.fit(X)).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Available in supervised estimators\n\n**model.predict()** : given a trained model, predict the label of a new set of data. This method accepts one argument, the new data X_new (e.g. model.predict(X_new)), and returns the learned label for each object in the array.\n\n**model.predict_proba()** : For classification problems, some estimators also provide this method, which returns the probability that a new observation has each categorical label. In this case, the label with the highest probability is returned by model.predict().\n**model.score()** : for classification or regression problems, most (all?) estimators implement a score method. Scores are between 0 and 1, with a larger score indicating a better fit.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n#### Available in unsupervised estimators\n\n**model.predict()** : predict labels in clustering algorithms.\n**model.transform()** : given an unsupervised model, transform new data into the new basis.

In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, a naive Bayes classifier would consider all of these properties to independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple.","3bc7e4d1":"####  **I hope you find this kernel helpful and some <font color=\"red\"><b>UPVOTES<\/b><\/font> would be very much appreciated**","dc555d06":"<a id=\"24\"><\/a> <br>\n## 8-16  Gradient Boosting Classifier\n\nGBM is a boosting algorithm used when we deal with plenty of data to make a prediction with high prediction power.
