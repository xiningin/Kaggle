Conclusion\n\nPrices are not normally distributed according to category ids. That is why non-parametric A\/B Testing was performed. As a result of A\/B Testing, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the price averages of 201436, 361254, 675201, 874521 category ids and these category ids were accepted as a single category in some calculations. It was observed that the averages of 326584, 489756 category ids were statistically different from the others. These two category ids were evaluated as two seperate groups.\n\nBecause the data were not normally distributed, the median values of each category were examined. In order to provide price flexibility, calculations were made according to the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval and the average values of the lower and upper limits.\n\nWhat should be the price of the item? The price is determined by four different methods.\n* To determine the median value of all prices in whole dataset as price without distinction between categories.\n* To determine the median value of the prices of similar categories as price.\n* To determine the median value of the prices outside the category id 326584 as price.\n* To determine the median value of the prices outside the category id 489756 as price.\n\nWhen the median value of the prices other than the 489756 category id is considered as the item price; the item price was 34.21 units, and the total income reached its highest value with 67754.14 units.\n\nWhat should be the price flexibility? The income distribution was examined by determining the lower and upper limit of confidence interval values and the average of the lower and upper limit values of each 4 different methods as price. When the confidence interval of prices outside the category id of 489756 is 39.88 units, which is the average of the lower and upper limit, it has been observed that the income is 37687.13 units and reaches the highest value.\n\nIt has been observed that the price range is between 38.74 and 44.96 units, and a graph of the income obtained according to the relevant prices has been created. As analyzed on the graph it is seen when the unit price increases, the income decreases.\n \nIn the analyzed dataset; a single price was applied to all categories because there are no concepts such as cost, category features, flexibility of transition between categories. However, incase of having detailed information about the relevant situations, the pricing specific to each category can be examined in detail.\n\n","1b231621":"> **Defining functions for taking a quick look to dataset**","d17950c8":"# Confidence Intervals","477efaee":"> **\"Normal Distribution\" hypothesis is declined for all category ids.
