How big is Bitcoin compared with the rest of the cryptocurrencies?\n<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is under serious competition from other projects, but it is still dominant in market capitalization.

So hot right now.\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https:\/\/newfronttest.bitcoin.com\/bitcoin.pdf\">launch of Bitcoin in 2008<\/a>, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in the Internet slang). Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may have the potential to become extremely valuable in the future<sup>1<\/sup>.

What is going on?! Volatility in cryptocurrencies\n<p>The cryptocurrencies market has been spectacularly volatile since the first exchange opened.

Making the plot easier to read and more informative\n<p>While the plot above is informative enough, it can be improved. Bitcoin is too big, and the other coins are hard to distinguish because of this. Instead of the percentage, let's use a log<sup>10<\/sup> scale of the \"raw\" capitalization. Plus, let's use color to group similar coins and make the plot more informative<sup>1<\/sup>. <\/p>\n<p>For the colors rationale: bitcoin-cash and bitcoin-gold are forks of the bitcoin <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blockchain\">blockchain<\/a><sup>2<\/sup>.

How small is small?\n<p>The names of the cryptocurrencies above are quite unknown, and there is a considerable fluctuation between the 1 and 7 days percentage changes. As with stocks, and many other financial products, the smaller the capitalization, the bigger the risk and reward. Smaller cryptocurrencies are less stable projects in general, and therefore even riskier investments than the bigger ones<sup>1<\/sup>.
