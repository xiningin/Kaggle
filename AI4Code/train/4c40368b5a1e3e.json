There were multiple choice questions and some forms for open answers. Survey received 23,859 usable respondents from 147 countries and territories. As a result we have a big dataset with rich information on data scientists using Kaggle.\n\nIn this kernel I'll try to analyze this data and provide various insights. Main tools for this will be Python and seaborn + plotly.\n\n***Scroll down to find new interactive visualizations where you can choose any country and the graph will be shown for it***\n\n![](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/static\/images\/host-home\/host-home-business.png)\n\n### Main idea: comparing countries\n\nWhile there are many ways to analyse the data, I have decided to perform the analysis based on the country of the responders.

I suppose that a lot of young people try to take part in competitions to get experience or medals\/prizes, which should boost their career;\n* It is worth noticing that India has a different trend - while in Russia, USA and other countries kagglers are 25-29 years old, in India most of responders are 18-21.
