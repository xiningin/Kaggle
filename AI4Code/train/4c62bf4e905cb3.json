Therefore, the time and money for each phase is not invested until the prior phase is complete and has demonstrated the desired safety and efficacy.\n\nIn the case of COVID-19, we have been fortunate to see sufficient investment that has enabled planning for all phases of clinical trials to take place at the beginning, allowing the next phase of clinical trials to commence quickly, so as soon as the data from the previous phase supports it. This has meant that we are seeing vaccine development happen at a rate much faster than ever before without compromising at all on any of the usual processes required to be certain about the vaccine's safety, as well as how well it is likely to work.https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2020-08-vaccine-clinical-trial-phases.html","c8903b8e":"#Phase III and IV\n\nPhase III trials are usually conducted in a double- or single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized manner and in hundreds to thousands of individuals at risk for acquiring the infection or disease. Because of the lengthy observation period that may be required, the longer-term safety of the vaccine can also be assessed in a large number of subjects. Such trials are expensive, require a well-developed health infrastructure and large study groups (sometimes in non-U.S. populations), and, as with all stages of clinical investigation, demand experienced personnel and laboratory capacity for surveillance. Additional expenses are incurred if testing of live attenuated or live recombinant vaccines requires isolation facilities for phase I and II trials. Study design, data collection, and analysis are all of critical importance for ensuring the quality of trial results for licensing a candidate vaccine.\n\nPhase IV trials may be conducted after a product is licensed, as part of postmarketing surveillance. They provide information about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in the general population, usually under normal (nonstudy) conditions.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","8818c081":"#Pilot Production\n\nPilot production, which occurs at or near the end of the applied research phase, is a critical stage in vaccine development. It is during the pilot manufacturing stage that vaccine is produced for use in safety and immunogenicity tests. Pilot vaccine manufacturing should be performed by using current Good Manufacturing Practices and, ideally, should be done on a scale sufficiently large to closely simulate the scale that will be used in commercial manufacturing. This is important if technical problems during scaleup are to be avoided, to ensure that the vaccine lots used in human efficacy studies will be similar to those produced commercially, and to facilitate the transfer of vaccine technology to commercial vaccine manufacturers in the United States and\/or to manufacturers in developing countries.\n\nOnly a handful of small privately held firms in the United States can make peptides according to current Good Manufacturing Practices, and even fewer have filling and bottling capabilities, with the consequence that filling and bottling must be completed elsewhere. Many private companies, most particularly start-up biotechnology companies, are reluctant to contract pilot production to others for fear of losing proprietary technology and know-how. The end result of the shortage of vaccine pilot production facilities is considerable delay (sometimes years) in producing pilot batches of required vaccines.\n\nThe lack of pilot production facilities is a major bottleneck in the development of vaccines in general, and CVI vaccines in particular. https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","e47e9f83":"#Immunization Status\n\nFrom the standpoint of disease control, making vaccines available is only the first step in ensuring adequate levels of immunization. For example, to receive the full benefit of vaccines, children must be immunized at specific times throughout infancy and into early adolescence. In a perfect world, every parent would keep track (or be notified by a health-care worker) of his or her child's immunization status and would make sure that the child received the needed vaccinations on time. This frequently does not happen in practice, however; indeed, many children in the United States under age 2 are underimmunized.\n\nComputerized tracking systems are likely to require large investments in new equipment and training and considerable behavioral changes among private health-care providers and the public at large.\n\n#Monitoring Effectiveness of Vaccines\n\nFor reasons that are not fully understood, vaccines that are very effective in preventing disease among infants in the industrialized world appear to be less efficacious in infants in different epidemiological settings.\n\nUnder conditions of poverty, inadequate housing and sanitation, malnutrition, and concurrent infection, vaccines may not be as effective. On the basis of these and other experiences, scientists and public health experts must anticipate potential differences in vaccine efficacy when these vaccines are introduced in developing-world conditions. Appropriate and close monitoring of clinical trials under field conditions will be critical to the development and introduction of CVI (Clinical and Vaccine Immunology) vaccines.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","15d78d37":"#Adverse Reactions\n\nThere is always a risk that a vaccine will have unwanted and possibly serious side effects. In November 1990, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), implemented jointly by CDC and FDA, became operational. VAERS receives reports and monitors vaccine safety by examining the frequency of reported adverse events. Operated by a private contractor, VAERS obtains reports of adverse events from many different parties, including manufacturers, health-care professionals, state health coordinators, patients, and parents. VAERS is currently the only comprehensive vaccine safety surveillance system in the United States.\n\nThe importance of long-term monitoring of adverse vaccine reactions was highlighted in late 1991 and early 1992. During that period, it was determined in follow-up studies that children who received the high-titer Edmonston-Zagreb strain of measles vaccine in certain locations in Africa and Haiti that are highly endemic for measles experienced high mortality rates compared with the mortality rates in those who received the standard Schwarz strain 6 to 10 months after being vaccinated. Furthermore, and for reasons that are unclear to the scientific community, the mortality rate appeared to be higher in girls than in boys. Because of these findings, WHO suspended the use of the high-titer measles vaccine in October 1992 while the mechanism of this adverse effect is under study. \nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","2c8555bd":"#Priorities for Vaccine Use and New Vaccines\n\nA good surveillance system can lead to a realignment of priorities for vaccine development. Surveillance is also the principal way that the frequency of established diseases is monitored and outbreaks of new diseases are detected. A good surveillance program can identify clusters of disease, track the demographic and geographic trends of an outbreak, and permit health-care professionals to assess and evaluate priorities for vaccine development. Without the data obtained through surveillance, it is impossible to know where disease control efforts should be targeted or to evaluate the impact of ongoing intervention efforts. Inadequate disease surveillance leaves policymakers and public health professionals with no framework for generating and executing policies to prevent or contain the spread of infectious disease.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","a7c8a6cc":"#Clinical Evaluation\n\nGood vaccines must meet basic criteria of safety, purity, potency, and efficacy. When a product has completed preclinical studies (usually involving animal models) and the sponsor is considering clinical trials in humans, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application is submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The IND application contains information on the vaccine's safety, purity, potency, and efficacy. These parameters are then evaluated in clinical trials, which are usually carried out in four phases. \n\n#Four Phases\n\nPhase I trials are short-term studies involving a small number of subjects and are designed primarily to evaluate the safety of the candidate vaccine, its ability to induce an immune response (immunogenicity), the optimal dose range, and the preferred route of administration to achieve the most effective immune response. Studies are usually conducted in individuals at low risk of acquiring natural infection in order to avoid confusing results.\n\n#Double Blind Studies, Placebo Control Group, Randomized Manner\n\nFollowing the successful completion of phase I trials, phase II trials are conducted; these may involve up to hundreds of subjects. Phase II trials are usually double-blind studies with a placebo-control group; phase II trials expand the evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine and may include the responses of individuals at risk of acquiring the infection. For a treatable pathogen, trials can be conducted in susceptible adults under controlled conditions to assess the ability of the vaccine to confer protection against experimental challenge. The results of these pilot studies can provide the information necessary to proceed with phase III studies.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","b0bd1215":"#Vaccine development\n\nBook: \"The Children's Vaccine Initiative: Achieving the Vision\"\n\nAuthors: Violaine S.

Work conducted in the basic research laboratory forms the scientific foundation for all subsequent investigation. Applied R&D then moves to the clinical research setting, and from there to pilot production and full-scale manufacture. The vaccine must then be purchased, distributed, and used. Finally, a surveillance system is established to monitor immunization coverage, efficacy, and any adverse health effects related to vaccine administration. The surveillance system also may detect fluctuations in disease incidence or new disease entities requiring a realignment of public health priorities.\n\nIn reality, the stages of vaccine development are not so neatly divided. For instance, although basic research is the starting point, it does not end when applied R&D begins; basic research findings continue to inform the process of vaccine development, even during clinical testing. Likewise, findings at the applied and clinical levels feed observations and questions back to the basic research laboratory.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","8d10f1a2":"#ScaleUp and Full-Scale Manufacture\n\nManufacturers confront one of the most difficult, complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive aspects of vaccine development when the decision is made to take a vaccine produced in small amounts in a pilot facility and to scaleup production to commercial levels.\n\nIt's not simply a matter of increasing the size of the reaction vessel. The behavior of the microorganisms, biochemical and physiological interactions, and the rate of yield are among a number of variables that must be validated at each point in the scaleup process to ensure that the product is equivalent to that developed on the small scale.\n\nManufacturing high-quality and consistently potent vaccines on a large scale (500 liters or more) is a challenging process, even for well-established pharmaceutical firms. For example, the recent scaleup of a Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib-CV) and a Hib-CV-diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP) combination was more difficult than anticipated. Several manufacturers of single-component Hib-CV noted reductions in the immunogenicities of their vaccines that appeared to coincide with the scaleup process itself. In these recent cases, sophisticated physical and biochemical characterizations of the vaccines and animal testing did not predict the reduced immunogenicity.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","5acd1375":"![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/230099_8416ba0822844a159981448dd878f674~mv2.png\/v1\/fill\/w_1000,h_500,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01\/230099_8416ba0822844a159981448dd878f674~mv2.png)eara.eu","9b333110":"#Market and Feasibility\n\nMarket potential and technical feasibility, both of which influence the decision to invest in the development of new or improved vaccines. After this decision to invest in a vaccine is taken, vaccine manufacturers are then frequently faced with a range of impediments as a product moves through the successive steps of development.\n\nThe various phases of vaccine development and a number of obstacles that can arise in this process. These barriers can discourage initial investment or prevent the vaccine from advancing beyond a certain stage. At every step, commercial manufacturers weigh the likelihood of product success against its market potential.\n\nThe decision-making process for the development and production of vaccines should be guided by an assessment of critical public health needs. Priorities should be established and the desired vaccine characteristics should be defined. In this way, the vast resources of the U.S. and international public and private sectors can be directed to a set of common and complementary goals.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","e5c7dc9b":"#Vaccine Production in Developing Countries\n\nThe production of children's vaccines in developing countries is widespread and is likely to increase. Indeed, there is an increasing desire on the part of many nations to be self-sufficient vaccine producers. More than 80 percent of the children in the world are born in a country that produces one or more vaccines used in the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI).\n\nRecommendations to include new vaccines in the immunization schedule in the United States are made only after a vaccine has been licensed by the FDA. \n\nBecause manufacturers can never be certain whether a licensed vaccine will be included among recommended immunizations, there have been suggestions that the ACIP(Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) and AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics)  make recommendations for use while the vaccines are in clinical trials. This would effectively commit the federal government to large-scale purchases of vaccine relatively early in the clinical testing phase and might give vaccine manufacturers the confidence to proceed with development.\n\nThere are several problems with this approach, however. First, most manufacturers need to assess the \npotential market for a product well before it reaches the clinical trial stage. Second, there are problems in recommending a vaccine for use when data concerning the target group are not available. Third, it is not possible to predict the outcomes of clinical trials, particularly in specific target groups tested in the later stages of a trial. Finally, FDA licensure and recommendations concerning an incompletely tested product cannot be predicted, nor expected. https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","65841c3d":"#Distribution and Delivery\n\nOrganizing effective and efficient vaccine distribution and delivery systems and communicating the importance of routine immunization to parents and health professionals are critical to ensuring adequate immunization coverage in the United States and around the globe. In much of the developing world, vaccines are distributed by ministries of health through EPI (The Expanded Programme on Immunization) and by various nongovernmental organizations.\n\n#Surveillance\n\nSurveillance is key to monitoring important characteristics in a population in which a vaccine is introduced. These aspects include the immunization rates attained in the targeted group, the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing the disease, the frequency and attributes of vaccine-related adverse reactions, and the recognition of new infectious disease problems that require public health attention. Likewise, surveillance will be a fundamental component in monitoring the efficacies of CVI (Clinical and Vaccine Immunology) vaccines and any adverse reactions and contributing to the establishment of new vaccine development priorities.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","58ff337d":"#The ultimate decision it's up to Commercial manufacturers\n\nWhatever priorities are set by the public sector, the ultimate decision to develop and manufacture a vaccine for general use in the United States rests entirely with the commercial vaccine manufacturers.

In this regard,it urges all groups involved in vaccine R&D for international public health applications to focus on a common and complementary set of vaccine priorities.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","6fde793c":"#Basic Research\n\nThe fundamental scientific advances that make vaccine development possible arise from basic research. The full implications and ultimate applications of discoveries made in the basic research laboratory may be unanticipated, even by the investigators involved. Basic research relevant to vaccine development includes such things as the identification and isolation of the protective antigens of a specific pathogen, methods for DNA cloning, the creation of new vector systems, and the development and immunologic evaluation of new adjuvant systems.\n\nBasic research is conducted primarily by federally funded academic and government scientists. Once a basic scientific finding is thought to have significant and practical applications, the research moves on to applied R&D (the exploratory development phase). Much applied research and almost all product-development activity are conducted by private industry. Both biotechnology firms and vaccine manufacturers invest in developing new technologies to deliver and enhance the quality and efficacy of vaccines. Unfortunately, some CVI-specific vaccine technologies (e.g., heat stabilization of viral vaccines) are unlikely to be pursued by U.S. firms, because such technologies would have little comparative advantage in the domestic market. Additional incentives can be provided to university-based researchers, commercial vaccine manufacturers, and biotechnology companies to stimulate the development of such technologies and their subsequent handoff from basic research to the product-development stages.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","35b28aec":"#Clinical and Vaccine Immunology (CVI) \n\nClinical trials are time-consuming (sometimes taking years), complex, and costly. Clinical trials for CVI vaccines, which are targeted for infants and young children, will be more challenging and time-consuming than those for vaccines designed for adults and older children. The safety and immunogenicity of many CVI vaccines will need to be demonstrated in trials successful can CVI vaccines be tested in young seronegative infants. Given in adult volunteers and then in older children. Only if those studies prove safely and ethical considerations, efficacy studies in infants may not permit challenge with the naturally virulent organism, but may require documentation of the prevention of natural infection compared with that in a placebo-controlled group. This progression of trials through younger age groups can be a lengthier process than that for strictly adult trials.\n\nCVI vaccines will probably have to be tested in international field sites, since many of these vaccines are intended to prevent diseases from which children in the United States do not suffer. Ethical principles applicable to research with children would argue against subjecting healthy children to the risks of investigational vaccines that, even if proved effective, will be of no benefit to them or even to children in the same population. In addition, a CVI vaccine tested in healthy children in the industrialized, world may not perform adequately under certain conditions of sanitation, malnutrition, and concurrent infection that exist in the developing world. To the committee's knowledge, there are very few field sites equipped to evaluate vaccines definitively in infants. Such sites require an epidemiologically well-characterized population, adequate clinical and laboratory infrastructures, political commitment, local expertise, and on-going epidemiological field studies.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/","af80d90c":"#UNICEF, PAHO purchasers of vaccines for use in the developing world\n\nWorldwide, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) are the largest purchasers of vaccines for use in the developing world. More than two-thirds of the vaccines supplied to UNICEF and PAHO are produced by European manufacturers; none are made by U.S. manufacturers.\n\nThe federal government is the largest purchaser of childhood vaccines in the United States. The public sector, through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the states, procures more than half of the vaccines used in this country (USA), and the Army buys all of the vaccines used by the U.S. military. The private sector, through hospitals, clinics, and pediatricians, procures vaccines directly from the manufacturers. CDC's fiscal year 1992 vaccine purchases amounted to 154 million; the Army buys between 10 million and  30 million worth of vaccines annually.\n\n#United States: sole purchaser of all pediatric vaccines?\n\nThere is some concern that if the U.S. government emerged to be the sole purchaser of all pediatric vaccines, the little competition that exists among vaccine manufacturers in the United States would diminish even further. In addition, industry representatives have indicated that companies may be reluctant to invest in costly R&D if the government were to be the sole buyer.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK236428\/"}}
