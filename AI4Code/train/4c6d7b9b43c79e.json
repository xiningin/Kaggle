Thus $.75^m H$ remains after m steps mining, and $(1-0.75^m) H$ is mined by the ship.  Note: since the halite increases by 2% each square, this can be modified to account for that; it is a small adjustment and we will ignore it for the time being.\n$$ \\text{Total Mined}=(1-.75^m) H $$\n\n\n## PROBLEM 2 \nA ship can travel to a square in $n_1$ steps, mine the halite there (at 25% each step) and then return to a shipyard that is $n_2$ steps from the halite cell.  What is the correct number of steps to mine in order to maximize the overall halite per step?

Since we can't mine for fractional steps, we just round off to the nearest integer.  The matrix output above can be used by looking up in it matrix[].","8b4af725":"A more advanced algorithm takes into account carried halite","bfce834f":"We can use scipy.optimize to calculate the maximum point on this graph for various travel distances.  A couple of things to note: \n1. Only the total travel distance $n_1+n_2$ matters, not the individual distances.\n1. The amount of halite in the cell does not affect the optimal number of steps, only the resulting average halite per step\n\nTherefore, for each total number of travel steps, we can compute the optimal number of steps, using the scipy.optimize function:\n","75ed7e40":"Note that because of the wrap around nature of the game board, the farthest away a cell can be is 10 steps vertically and 10 steps horizontally for a total of 20 steps maximum (by the manhattan distance)."}}
