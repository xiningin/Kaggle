But, when we divide beneficiaries into two groups as smokers and nonsmokers, the correlation between medical costs and bmi of smokers goes up to 0.8. Then, bmi needs to be considered in the following stages. \n### Age has less than 0.5 correlation coefficient scores but it is still noteworthy to consider it during the following stages of the analysis, as the graphs show that people tend to pay higher costs as they get older. \n### There are 3 layers of medical insurance costs; 0-10K, 10-30K and >30K. Smoking (and partly age and bmi) explains the split between 0-10K and >30K but the 10-30K level is rather mixed. There may be other factors at this level besides the variables provided in this data. \n### Medical costs are not normally distributed and there are some outliers. These issues need to be handled in the next stage before working on the regression model.","97927457":"### When we look at the descriptive statistics, at first glance the medical costs have a relatively large std. deviation and outliers as well.
