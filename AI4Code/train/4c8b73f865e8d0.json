The 'Survival_Status_After_5_Years' column is of type int and hence it needs to be converted to categorical type with meaningful values.\n3. The 'Survival_Status_After_5_Years' shows the dataset is imbalanced since it has 225 datapoints(73.53%) belonging to patients who survived 5 years or longer and only 81 datapoints(26.47%) belonging to patients who died within 5 years.\n","db6a22b9":"#### **Observations:**\n\nAbove Box plots and violin plots strengthen the previously above mentioned observations.","dc4986c8":"### **Pair-Plot and Scatter Plots**","65691722":"#### **Observations:**\n\nMost of the patients(~80%) had less than 10 positive axillary nodes."}}
