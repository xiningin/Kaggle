Therefore, it is to classify patients as belonging to one of two categories: Normal (100 patients) or Abnormal (210 patients).\n","0e2d1a03":"In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric machine learning method first developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 1951, and later expanded by Thomas Cover. It is used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\n- In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n- In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.  \n\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation. Since this algorithm relies on distance for classification, if the features represent different physical units or come in vastly different scales then normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically.","5308e143":"## Visualization","85256637":"## Normalization","c397aa79":"## KNN Model","3eb805d6":"## Libraries and Utilities"}}
