For example: `word = 'rock', a1 = ['stone','earth',..] ` . Value would be like : rock --> stone = 0.67 and rock -->earth = 0.30. Selection of a new word would be done across maximum similar value. Hence, Rock would be replaced by world stone. \n\nI have been using only 2 Types of POS - Noun, and Verb.  POS takes in input as `'n' or 'v'` where n stands for noun and v for verbs. Noun and Verb are sorted out in the early stage of the process using Spacy. If the output of `wup_similarity` is NULL then it passes on to Spacy for comparison of words. \n\n```nlp = en_core_web_sm.load()\nfor i in a1:\n            j=i.replace(' ', '')\n            tokens = nlp(u''+j)\n            token_main = nlp(u''+word_str)\n  ``` \n  Above function allows us to process with the word similarity in different way due to returning of NIL value from wordnet processing. Repeating the same process for finding out the best replacement from the context is done by finding out the max value using `token1.similarity(tokens)` which yeilds out float value.\n\n#### Main aim of this function is to return the most similar word to the given input word.\n  ","d44505e8":"# Importing Libraries.","a35f23cc":"# Output\n\n- 50 % of Nouns or Verb Augumentation. \n\n![Output](https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dykavvkou\/image\/upload\/v1551444587\/Screen_Shot_2019-03-01_at_6.18.22_PM_h0qvaa.png)","53a95ea6":"# Introduction to Data Augmentation in NLP\n\nThis Notebook includes a brief Introduction to Text Augmentation with Nouns and Verbs.
