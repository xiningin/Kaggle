Cordial is\n    an API that allows developers to easily run recommender systems.\n    The library currently has 3 systems:\n    1. BasicRecommender, this is the fastest but least accurate as it's quite\n    primitive and uses linear kernels and matrix similarity\n    2. LDARecommendeer, this uses linear discriminant analysis and euclidean \n    distance\n    3. GraphRecommender, this uses complex graph networks to build a \n    recommender using networkx\n\n    For this example, I have decided to use the GraphRecommender to demo the\n    library","15f81c80":"    As you can see, it takes the file path of the file as input on initialisation. Then,\n    you call the recommend function, passing in the name of the movie you would like to\n    get recommendations from ,and there you have it!"}}
