Organic users prefer  jaggery over sugar.\nIn south dished like pongal are made of jaggery.\n\nRice and coconut are most preferred main ingredients along with which these sweet making supplements are consumed.","3a4ba553":"Popular Spice ingredients are Garam Masala, curry leaves, mustard seeds, ginger, Chana, peas, chillis.\nRice, coconut(chutney), urad dal are the main food items along with which these spicy supplements are consumed.","1c1c4167":"We got here six different regions and four different types of flavors.\nLets see geographic distribution of flavors region-wise.","d7237519":"Next we can use word cloud method to get idea, on frequency of raw materials used","9c843ea3":"The top dishes spicy and sweet  have comparable cook_times (No issues here).\nPreparation time for sweet dishes is lot lesser (just more than half of spicy), this feature can be advertised more as it is early to deliver.\n","d57380e2":"Abvoe table is an important observation, \nSpicy and Sweet are the most sought dishes.\nAs an Indian charcteristic 'spicy' tops the chart.","45122fda":"There is a null value in Region column.\nThe corresponding value in State is 'Uttar Pradesh' hence we can impute it as 'North'","00e4f404":"Lets examine the above charts.\n1)Western part of India (Maharashtra, Gujarat) have a versatile taste for the cuisines.

As much as 45% of population is concentrated around Ganga-river basin.\nPopulation pressure may deter '**affordability**'\n\n\n3)North East has lower percentages in all of its charts, this again because of lower population density and also thick forestry.\nTribal population may not have a taste of Urban cuisines.\n\n4)Sweet dishes are very popular in Eastern region. This so because of states like Bihar and West Bengal where sweet dishes like rasogolla, rasmalai are much sought.\n\n5)Sugarcance is the most sought sweetener. In the West it is Maharashtra, in the North is Uttar Pradesh which can also cater to eastern region as well.
