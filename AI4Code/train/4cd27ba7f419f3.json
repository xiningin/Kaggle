Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress and general health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.<\/p>\n\n<p>After conducting analysis on FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, I discovered few interesting trends and patterns that would help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy.<\/p>\n\n##### <b>Target Audience<\/b>\n<p>Women who work full-time jobs have been observed to spend most of their time on the computer(according to sedentary time data and hourly intensity data).These women do some light activity to stay healthy(according to activity intensity analysis). In order to develop healthy habits and motivation to keep going,they might need some knowledge on how to improve their everyday activity.<\/p>\n\n##### <b>Ideas for the Bellabeat app paired with smart devices<\/b>\n<p><b>Bellabeat App<\/b>: It <b>Bact as a guide<\/b> almost like a friend <b>that empowers and nurtures women<\/b> to balance personal and professional life and <b>develop healthly habits and routines by educating and motivating them through daily recommendations<\/b>.<\/p>\n\n1. Average total steps per day are 7638 which is little less than recommended daily 10,000 steps according to CDC research, they found that taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality and taking 12000 steps per dat was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps. **Bellabeat can encourage its users to take atleast 8,000 steps per day explaining the benefits for the health via its app and track with help of wellness watch or leaf accessories**.\n\n2. 50% of the participants are overweight and 12.5% are Obese. For these group of users in order to loose weight in healthly manner, **Bellabeat can control daily consumption where the app can suggest filling low-calorie meals**.\n\n3. Participants sleep 1 time for about 7 hours or 419.2 mins on average. **Bellabeat can send notification through its app to go to bed and reduce exporsure to blue light and motivate users to atleast get 8 hours of quality sleep**.\n\n4. Since participants are most active between 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. - assuming people go to the gym or for a walk after finishing work, **Bellabeat can use this insight to remind and motivate users to either go for walk or workout through its app**.\n\n5. As most of the participants have most active Tuesday, Bellabeat could notify its users to conduct very active intensity movement. On the other hand, during least active Sunday's, **Bellabeat could notify its users to reduce sedentary minutes and atleast conduct light active movement**.","004ec92c":"### Prepare\n##### <b>About the dataset<\/b>\n<p><b>FitBit Fitness Tracker Dataset(CC0: Public Domain) made available through Mobius<\/b>. These datasets were generated by respondents to a <b>distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 2016-03-12 to 2016-05-12<\/b>. This Kaggle dataset contains personal fitness tracker from thirty Fitbit users.  Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps and heart rate that can be used to explore user\u2019s habits.<\/p>\n\n##### <b>How is the data organized?<\/b>\n<p>FitBit Fitness Tracker Dataset is organized in wide format.<\/p>\n\n##### <b>Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data?
