learning is one of the most critical steps during the pre-processing of data before creating a machine learning model.

Normalization is used when we want to bound our values between two numbers, typically, between [0,1] or [-1,1]. While Standardization transforms the data to have zero mean and a variance of 1, they make our data unitless.

These choices are dependent both on our expertise and on the computational cost needed to train the models. \n* Secondly, a predictor was learned for all the possible combinations of hyper-parameters and its out-of-sample performance was estimated using 5-fold Cross Validation (CV), i.e. \nWe trained the model with 70% of the total training set size and validated its performance in the remaining 30%. \n\n**GridSearch** exhaustively searches through all possible combinations of hyperparameters during training the phase.
