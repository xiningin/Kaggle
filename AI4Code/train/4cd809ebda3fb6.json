Its atomic number is 13. It is one of the most abundant metals on earth. It is capable of conducting electricity and heat. Aluminum is made from the ore bauxite. Its chemical code is Al. \\ NAluminum is described as the metal of the poor and silver as the clay. Clay and brick all contain about 270 aluminum compounds, such as aluminum silicate. [1] People have been using all these materials for a long time without knowing that it is an aluminum alloy. The most important mineral of aluminum is bauxite. It contains iron oxide, titanium and silicon as an alternative. Aluminum can be obtained by electrolysis by purifying bauxite and obtaining alumina, also known as Al2O3. Aluminum is the third most abundant element on earth with a value of 8.1. Other minerals in aluminum are gypsum, diaspor, and felspar cryosite. Among the Navratnas, aluminum is added as an additive in emeralds, comets, sapphires and green sapphires. Gold and silver are not found in nature as a single element. Potash alum is a potassium aluminum sulphate. But they do not know that aluminum is a metal and its benefits and properties. [2] An example of this is Ki. The equipment used by humans living in the Middle East from before 5300 BC was very durable. This is because the materials they used contained aluminum. [2] Aluminum was used by the Greeks and Romans in ancient times as an antidote to diarrhea and as a laxative in dye workshops. [3] The salt source is called alumini. In 1787 Lavoisier called it the oxide of a metal unknown until then. In 1827, the German chemist Friedrick Wohler became the first person to extract pure aluminum from it. [4] Although aluminum was extracted by Oersted two years ago, [5] it was still very impure. Pierre Perthier then extracted aluminum from bauxite ore. [6] Humphrey Davy originally named it Aluminuam. [7] It was later renamed Aluminum. \"[8] [9] \\ n Extraction \\ n \\ nAluminum can not be extracted from clay due to its economical strength, so aluminum must be extracted by its method of extracting aluminum, then by extruding aluminum. Bayer method was discovered.The Bayer method is widely used nowadays to extract aluminum from bauxite by extracting aluminum by electrolysis and then by electrolysis. 933 K Boiling point 2740 K, atomic number 13, atomic mass 26.98.Aluminum can be beaten and stretched into a thin wire like aluminum.Aluminum is a good conductor and conducts heat and electricity easily.Aluminum is the next step after gold and silver. Ranam is the free electrons in it. Aluminum has twice the conductivity of copper of the same weight. Of these, aluminum has the highest self-heating at 904 joules \/ kg \/ k. Self-heating is the process of evaluating the heat capacity of an object. Since the heat energy required to raise the temperature of a kilogram of material by 1 degree C is the material's self-heating, high-temperature aluminum stores high temperatures with low temperature change. [12] Aluminum has a heat capacity of 2.35 times that of copper, 3.86 times that of silver and 6.85 times that of gold. \\ NAllium is stable outside in dry and humid air. Its luster, however, fades as it forms a thin oxide film on its surface. It acts as a shield and protects the atmosphere from active oxygen and liquids. When aluminum powder is heated to a sufficient temperature, it combines with oxygen to emit a bright white light. Then a large amount of heat is released. Combines directly with aluminum, nitrogen and sulfur. Aluminum tends to act as a powerful reducing agent because of its dependence on oxygen.","73ff0cf9":"## <span style=\"color: orange; font-family: Segoe UI; font-size: 1.9em; font-weight: 300;\">EDA<\/span>","967673b2":"### Translate to English\nWhat is the name of Jwala Gutta's mother?","3a470d3a":"### Translate to English\n'What is the atomic number of aluminum?'\nadd Codeadd Markdown","88855d3e":"### Tamil language\ntext so long","f27ec45c":"### You are given questions in Tamil\/Hindi about some Wikipedia articles, and you have to generate the answers for those questions using your model.","23ec8333":"### Translate to English\n'How many bones are there in the human body?'","aedf1db4":"### this is so hard.","638f4b81":"## Hindi language ","3174a68b":"### Translate to English\nThe skeleton of a normal adult human contains the following 206 (208 if the sternum is considered to be divided into three parts).
