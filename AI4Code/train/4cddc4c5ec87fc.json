If you look at HN's traffic on similarweb.com: HN hadn't skyrocketed like all other media outlets bc of COVID. My interpretation is that HN users are to HN addicted despite lockdown or not, it doesn't make a difference. Moreover, I dropped also submission which didn't hit the front page (coments<10). So the increase it not related to any traffic increase.***\n\n\n"}}
