The marketing team is working on a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. To elaborate this initiative, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. As part of the marketing team, I was asked to produce a report with the following deliverables:\n\n","3e768c1e":"**1. A clear statement of the business task**\n\nThe business task is to analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. \n\n**2. A description of all data sources used** \n\nThe data was made available to the public by Motivate International Inc and was stored in Amazons AWS Data Cloud. To protect users\u2019 privacy, the datasets did not include riders\u2019 personally identifiable information. \n\n**3.Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data**\n\nThe datasets were provided in twelve CSV files each containing one month of previous trip data. After the files were downloaded, the data was prepared as described in the steps below:","f85d8892":"**5.Key findings**\n\nThe difference between casual and member riders is significant:\n\n1. On average,a casual rider trip was about 2 times as long as a member trip. However, total rides were slightly higher for members. \n2. Member rides remained steady during all days of the week while casual riders rode more heavily during the weekends.\n3. Both casual and member riders were more active during the Summer and the Fall. However, casual rides decreased rapidly after August while member rides stayed consistent in the Summer and the Fall.\n4.  Time when most trips started for casual riders was between 11am and 8pm. Members rides started mostly from 7am to 8pm.\n","e99d583f":"3.1.1 The original files were stored in a subfolder named Cyclistic_Trip_Data_CSV.\n\n3.1.2 Each file was opened in Excel and saved as an Excel Workbook file in a subfolder named Cyclistic_Trip_Data_XLSX. \n\n3.1.3 The files were comprised of a total of 5,595,075 rows.\n\n3.1.4 The data included the following fields: Ride Id, Bike Type, Ride Start Datetime, Ride End Datetime, Start Station Name, Start Station ID, End Station Name, End Station ID, Start Latitude, Start Longitude, End Latitude, End Longitude and Rider Type.\n\n3.1.5 A ride length column was added to all files by subtracting start datetime from the end datetime. The ride length column was formatted as hh:mm:ss.\n\n3.1.6 A day of the week column was added to show the day of the week when each ride started. This was completed using the WEEKDAY function with the Start Datetime field which return a number between 1-7 representing the day of the week. The integer was then converted to its corresponding day name using the IFs function.\n\n3.1.7 Each file was ingested into BigQuery to continue the cleaning process. The SQL queries listed below were used.\n","ca02d8f2":"3.1.8 Starting and Ending Station ID and Starting and Ending Station Name were missing from approximately 11% of the rows. Longitude and Latitude fields were incomplete for those rows (two out of four decimal points were missing). Therefore, those two fields could not be used to map the missing station data to the data in rows with the same longitude and latitude. ","9b6e45d5":"**4.Supporting visualizations**\n\nThe data was uploaded to Tableau Public for analysis at https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/app\/profile\/frameirys\/viz\/CyclisticBikeShareAnalysis_16423059501830\/Dashboard1\n","e3575964":"**6.Your top recommendations based on your analysis**\n\nThe data used for this analysis has several limitations. However, it provided key insights that should be further explored;\n1.\tThe data suggests that a significant percentage of casual riders might be either visitors or tourists exploring the city. Users\u2019 zip-code data should be collected to answer these questions and help focus the marketing campaign on riders from zip-codes in the area.\n2.\tA unique user id field should be assigned to both members and casual riders. An id field is needed for analyzing rides per user. This data would help to target users who ride more often. \n3.\tThe marketing team should investigate the reason why station name and id are not populating for all rides. This data is essential in order to appropriately allocate resources between the busiest and least frequented stations.  \n\nIn conclusion, additional data is needed to better understand how members and casual riders differ and which casual riders have the highest probability of conversion to members.\n"}}
