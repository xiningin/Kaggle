It is the error rate between the oberved labels and the predicted ones. We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the \"categorical_crossentropy\".\n\nThe most important function is the optimizer. This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss.\n\nI choosed RMSprop (with default values), it is a very effective optimizer. The RMSProp update adjusts the Adagrad method in a very simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate. We could also have used Stochastic Gradient Descent ('sgd') optimizer, but it is slower than RMSprop.\n\nThe metric function \"accuracy\" is used is to evaluate the performance our model. This metric function is similar to the loss function, except that the results from the metric evaluation are not used when training the model (only for evaluation).","e8e46b6d":"I used the Keras Sequential API, where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\n* ### Convolution Layer\n\nThe first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer.

The higher LR, the bigger are the steps and the quicker is the convergence. However the sampling is very poor with an high LR and the optimizer could probably fall into a local minima.\n\nIts better to have a decreasing learning rate during the training to reach efficiently the global minimum of the loss function.\n\nTo keep the advantage of the fast computation time with a high LR, i decreased the LR dynamically every X steps (epochs) depending if it is necessary (when accuracy is not improved).\n\nWith the ReduceLROnPlateau function from Keras.callbacks, i choose to reduce the LR by half if the accuracy is not improved after 3 epochs.","bddd53ad":"## 2.3 Normalization","90ee060e":"* ### Same Padding\nAs we keep applying conv layers, the size of the volume will decrease faster than we would like.

The idea is to alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations occuring when someone is writing a digit.\n\nFor example, the number is not centered The scale is not the same (some who write with big\/small numbers) The image is rotated...\n\nApproaches that alter the training data in ways that change the array representation while keeping the label the same are known as data augmentation techniques. Some popular augmentations people use are grayscales, horizontal flips, vertical flips, random crops, color jitters, translations, rotations, and much more.\n\nBy applying just a couple of these transformations to our training data, we can easily double or triple the number of training examples and create a very robust model.","b6386b4c":"Confusion matrix can be very helpfull to see your model drawbacks.\n\nI plot the confusion matrix of the validation results.","48e444f6":"* ### Max Pooling\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important.","8a3b6953":"Here we can see that our CNN performs very well on all digits with few errors considering the size of the validation set (4200 images).\n\nHowever, it seems that our CNN has some little troubles with the 4 digits, hey are misclassified as 9.
