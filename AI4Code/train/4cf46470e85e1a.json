","4537a651":"# Fayetteville North Carolina School System\n\nLiving in North carolina and having little kids, you have to always be worried about the quality of education your kids recieve and which public school is the best for their future. In this notebook, I have evaluated the pubblic schools in Fayetteville, North carolina (Cumberland County) and looking for trends affecting quality of education and therefore percentage of passing end of grade tests in different schools in my city. Then I compared Fayetteville school system to other schoos in North carolina.\n\n## DataSets \n\nIn this project I have used 2 dataset: \n- ..\/input\/north-carolina-schools-performance\/north-carolina-school-performance-data_1.csv\n- ..\/input\/north-carolina-schools-performance\/north-carolina-school-performance-data-QueryResult.csv\n\nBoth these data sets have been downloaded from data.world website:\n\nhttps:\/\/data.world\/durhamnc\/north-carolina-school-performance-data\/workspace\/file?filename=north-carolina-school-performance-data_1.csv\n\n## Cleaning Data\nSome simple cleanings needed to be done on raw datasets. And from the name of schools, I needed to categorize schools into 'Elementary', 'Middle' and 'High' school cathegories.\n","19820e2b":"#### Key takeaways\nFrom the above Diagrams, the following colclusions can be infered.\n1- We can trust on school score, as higher school score is related to higher percentage of students that pass end of grade tests. \n2- In school where more students use free or reduced cost meal, more student are unable to pass the end of grade tests.
