Instead, all nodes hold a copy of it and reach a consensus on its contents.\n\n## Anyone who wants to secure their data\n\nEverything in the Tangle is immutable and transparent. Through cryptography, you can prove that data has not changed.\n\n\n## Anyone who values security\n\nIOTA uses quantum-robust signatures to protect the network against the next generation of computing power.\n\n\n## Anyone who wants the freedom to transact\n\nIOTA is free to use. You don't need to pay a subscription, sign a contract, or have any form of official identification.

These devices are in fact able to exchange small amounts of money with each other, in an immediate and possible way without forcing the manufacturers to compromise in design and hardware equipment.
