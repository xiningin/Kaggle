However, GDP per capita has strong positive relationship with the happiness score\n - Qatar has the hgihest GDP per capita with 28th rank in the World happiness report\n - GDP per capita, Social support and Healthy life expectancy has strong positive relationship with happiness score meaning, these factors together make people in a country happy\n - Freedom to make life choices has weak relationship with happiness score. Therefore, we can see some third world countries having higher rates of Freedom to make life choices\n - Generosity and Perceptions of corruption have no relationship with happiness score hence we see Syria with Overall happiness rank of 148 being among the top generous countries","c3877d49":"now lets look at the least happy countries\n","4c698dfd":"lets look at the variables that have srong positive impact on happiness score","ffe03a07":"We have imported the libraries and loaded the data.
