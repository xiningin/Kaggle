Otherwise, use a t test.\n* Data points should be independent from each other. In other words, one data point isn\u2019t related or doesn\u2019t affect another data point.\n* Your data should be normally distributed. However, for large sample sizes (over 30) this doesn\u2019t always matter.\n* Your data should be randomly selected from a population, where each item has an equal chance of being selected.\n* Sample sizes should be equal if at all possible. ","51366c14":"### a. One sample t-test\nThe One Sample t Test determines whether the sample mean is statistically different from a known or hypothesised population mean. The One Sample t Test is a parametric test.\n\nExample: checking whether the average length of Petal is 1.3. So I set $H_{0}$: the average length of petal is 1.3 and $H_1$: the average length of petal is not 1.3.","a1fc4f39":"**According to the testing result, there is not sufficiently confident to conclude that the mean length of them is zero.**","37ef970f":"## Chi-Square Test\nThe test is applicable when you have two **categorical** variables from a single population.

Two sampled t-test\nThe Independent Samples t Test or 2-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups in order to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the associated population means are significantly different. The Independent Samples t Test is a parametric test. This test is also known as: Independent t Test.\n\nExample: check is there any association between the length of petal and sepal. \n\n$H_0$: There is an association between them;\n\n$H_1$: There is no association between them.","4c3503ca":"**According to the testing result, there is not sufficiently confident to conclude that the Sepal length of these three species is the same.**","a7eab869":"## T- Test\nA t-test is a type of inferential statistic which is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups which may be related in certain features. It is mostly used when the data sets, like the set of data recorded as outcome from flipping a coin a 100 times, would follow a normal distribution and may have unknown variances. T test is used as a hypothesis testing tool, which allows testing of an assumption applicable to a population.","c7f189e6":"# Hypothesis Testing Practice\n---\nIn this notebook I am going to practice some hypothesis testing skills with Python on the well-known Iris dataset (and probably some other dataset).\n\n**In case you can not see the results in the notebook, please view this [link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anzhemeng\/python-x-hypo-testing).**","ed36f6cb":"**According to the testing result, there is not sufficiently confident to conclude that these two features are correalted with each other.**","68a1d7b6":"**According to the testing result, there is not sufficiently confident to conclude that the two categorical features are correlated.**","07d9de7a":"### a. one sample test\nThe example here is the same one in the section of one sample t-test.","eaed669e":"**According to the testing result, there is not sufficiently confident to conclude that these two features are different.**","53b5ab98":"**According to the testing result, there is not sufficiently confident to conclude that the length of petal is averagedly 1.3 cm.**","4e8fe9c9":"## ANOVA (F-TEST)\nWe could carry out a separate t-test for each pair of groups, but when you conduct many tests you increase the chances of false positives.

Two-sample Z test\nThe example here is checking two independent data groups and deciding whether sample mean of two group is equal or not.\n\n$H_0$: the mean of the length of petal and sepal is 0;\n\n$H_1$: the mean of the length of petal and sepal is not 0.","2e552198":"## Paired sampled t-test\nThe paired sample t-test is also called dependent sample t-test.
