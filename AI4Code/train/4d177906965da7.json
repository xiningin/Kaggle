Given the correlations we saw in the exploratory data analysis, we should expect that the most important features are the `EXT_SOURCE` and the `DAYS_BIRTH`. We may use these feature importances as a method of dimensionality reduction in future work.","687f91ee":"The target == 1 curve skews towards the younger end of the range. Although this is not a significant correlation (-0.07 correlation coefficient), this variable is likely going to be useful in a machine learning model because it does affect the target. Let's look at this relationship in another way: average failure to repay loans by age bracket. \n\nTo make this graph, first we `cut` the age category into bins of 5 years each. Then, for each bin, we calculate the average value of the target, which tells us the ratio of loans that were not repaid in each age category.","2516de5d":"## Polynomial Features\n\nOne simple feature construction method is called [polynomial features](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html). In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` and `EXT_SOURCE_2^2` and also variables such as `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` x   `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called [interaction terms](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interaction_(statistics) because they  capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves  may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. [Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models](https:\/\/www.theanalysisfactor.com\/interpreting-interactions-in-regression\/) to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. \n\nJake VanderPlas writes about [polynomial features in his excellent book Python for Data Science](https:\/\/jakevdp.github.io\/PythonDataScienceHandbook\/05.04-feature-engineering.html) for those who want more information.\n\nIn the following code, we create polynomial features using the `EXT_SOURCE` variables and the `DAYS_BIRTH` variable. [Scikit-Learn has a useful class called `PolynomialFeatures`](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into [problems with overfitting](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/model_selection\/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py)). ","49334d74":"### Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding","b22db1df":"### Aligning Training and Testing Data\n\nThere need to be the same features (columns) in both the training and testing data. One-hot encoding has created more columns in the training data because there were some categorical variables with categories not represented in the testing data. To remove the columns in the training data that are not in the testing data, we need to `align` the dataframes. First we extract the target column from the training data (because this is not in the testing data but we need to keep this information). When we do the align, we must make sure to set `axis = 1` to align the dataframes based on the columns and not on the rows!","dbc08ccd":"Now that the model has been trained, we can use it to make predictions. We want to predict the probabilities of not paying a loan, so we use the model `predict.proba` method. This returns an m x 2 array where m is the number of observations. The first column is the probability of the target being 0 and the second column is the probability of the target being 1 (so for a single row, the two columns must sum to 1). We want the probability the loan is not repaid, so we will select the second column.\n\nThe following code makes the predictions and selects the correct column.","11fe18f7":"### Make Predictions using Engineered Features\n\nThe only way to see if the Polynomial Features and Domain knowledge improved the model is to train a test a model on these features!

This will get us slightly better results than the default `LogisticRegression`, but it still will set a low bar for any future models.\n\nHere we use the familiar Scikit-Learn modeling syntax: we first create the model, then we train the model using `.fit` and then we make predictions on the testing data using `.predict_proba` (remember that we want probabilities and not a 0 or 1).","122b1d4d":"This creates a considerable number of new features.

Therefore, we will keep all of the columns for now.","237b0c38":"### Correlations\n\nNow that we have dealt with the categorical variables and the outliers, let's continue with the EDA.

","2f8ab0c9":"Well that is extremely interesting! It turns out that the anomalies have a lower rate of default. \n\nHandling the anomalies depends on the exact situation, with no set rules. One of the safest approaches is just to set the anomalies to a missing value and then have them filled in (using Imputation) before machine learning. In this case, since all the anomalies have the exact same value, we want to fill them in with the same value in case all of these loans share something in common. The anomalous values seem to have some importance, so we want to tell the machine learning model if we did in fact fill in these values. As a solution, we will fill in the anomalous values with not a number (`np.nan`) and then create a new boolean column indicating whether or not the value was anomalous.\n\n","7987b7c4":"The training data has 307511 observations (each one a separate loan) and 122 features (variables) including the `TARGET` (the label we want to predict).","26f47952":"# Just for Fun: Light Gradient Boosting Machine\n\nNow (if you want, this part is entirely optional) we can step off the deep end and use a real machine learning model: the [gradient boosting machine](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/gentle-introduction-gradient-boosting-algorithm-machine-learning\/) using the [LightGBM library](http:\/\/lightgbm.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/Quick-Start.html)!

There are many techniques we can use to both create features and select features.\n\nWe will do a lot of feature engineering when we start using the other data sources, but in this notebook we will try only two simple feature construction methods: \n\n* Polynomial features\n* Domain knowledge features\n","671e059f":"Let's take a look at some of more significant correlations: the `DAYS_BIRTH` is the most positive correlation. (except for `TARGET` because the correlation of a variable with itself is always 1!) Looking at the documentation, `DAYS_BIRTH` is the age in days of the client at the time of the loan in negative days (for whatever reason!). The correlation is positive, but the value of this feature is actually negative, meaning that as the client gets older, they are less likely to default on their loan (ie the target == 0). That's a little confusing, so we will take the absolute value of the feature and then the correlation will be negative.","fd7f9337":"That doesn't look right! The maximum value (besides being positive) is about 1000 years! ","bd576ced":"This submission should score about 0.735 on the leaderboard. We will certainly best that in future work! ","cf3cb765":"The training and testing datasets now have the same features which is required for machine learning. The number of features has grown significantly due to one-hot encoding. At some point we probably will want to try [dimensionality reduction (removing features that are not relevant)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dimensionality_reduction) to reduce the size of the datasets.","f0f197ba":"## Pairs Plot\n\nAs a final exploratory plot, we can make a pairs plot of the `EXT_SOURCE` variables and the `DAYS_BIRTH` variable. The [Pairs Plot](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/visualizing-data-with-pair-plots-in-python-f228cf529166) is a great exploration tool because it lets us see relationships between multiple pairs of variables as well as distributions of single variables. Here we are using the seaborn visualization library and the PairGrid function to create a Pairs Plot with scatterplots on the upper triangle, histograms on the diagonal, and 2D kernel density plots and correlation coefficients on the lower triangle.\n\nIf you don't understand this code, that's all right! Plotting in Python can be overly complex, and for anything beyond the simplest graphs, I usually find an existing implementation and adapt the code (don't repeat yourself)! ","24340c76":"Several of the new variables have a greater (in terms of absolute magnitude) correlation with the target than the original features. When we build machine learning models, we can try with and without these features to determine if they actually help the model learn. \n\nWe will add these features to a copy of the training and testing data and then evaluate models with and without the features. Many times in machine learning, the only way to know if an approach will work is to try it out! ","4b50dfd6":"## Imports\n\nWe are using a typical data science stack: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`. ","ec731399":"## Examine Missing Values\n\nNext we can look at the number and percentage of missing values in each column. ","e1ef3bb5":"# Baseline\n\nFor a naive baseline, we could guess the same value for all examples on the testing set.  We are asked to predict the probability of not repaying the loan, so if we are entirely unsure, we would guess 0.5 for all observations on the test set. This  will get us a Reciever Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (AUC ROC) of 0.5 in the competition ([random guessing on a classification task will score a 0.5](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/266387\/can-auc-roc-be-between-0-0-5)).\n\nSince we already know what score we are going to get, we don't really need to make a naive baseline guess. Let's use a slightly more sophisticated model for our actual baseline: Logistic Regression.\n\n## Logistic Regression Implementation\n\nHere I will focus on implementing the model rather than explaining the details, but for those who want to learn more about the theory of machine learning algorithms, I recommend both [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http:\/\/www-bcf.usc.edu\/~gareth\/ISL\/) and [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http:\/\/shop.oreilly.com\/product\/0636920052289.do). Both of these books present the theory and also the code needed to make the models (in R and Python respectively). They both teach with the mindset that the best way to learn is by doing, and they are very effective! \n\nTo get a baseline, we will use all of the features after encoding the categorical variables. We will preprocess the data by filling in the missing values (imputation) and normalizing the range of the features (feature scaling). The following code performs both of these preprocessing steps.","6bb7e060":"# Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an open-ended process where we calculate statistics and make figures to find trends, anomalies, patterns, or relationships within the data. The goal of EDA is to learn what our data can tell us. It generally starts out with a high level overview, then narrows in to specific areas as we find intriguing areas of the data. The findings may be interesting in their own right, or they can be used to inform our modeling choices, such as by helping us decide which features to use.","8caa106a":"The submission has now been saved to the virtual environment in which our notebook is running. To access the submission, at the end of the notebook, we will hit the blue Commit & Run button at the upper right of the kernel. This runs the entire notebook and then lets us download any files that are created during the run. \n\nOnce we run the notebook, the files created are available in the Versions tab under the Output sub-tab. From here, the submission files can be submitted to the competition or downloaded. Since there are several models in this notebook, there will be multiple output files. \n\n__The logistic regression baseline should score around 0.671 when submitted.__","824f1461":"## Column Types\n\nLet's look at the number of columns of each data type. `int64` and `float64` are numeric variables ([which can be either discrete or continuous](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/206\/what-is-the-difference-between-discrete-data-and-continuous-data)). `object` columns contain strings and are  [categorical features.](http:\/\/support.minitab.com\/en-us\/minitab-express\/1\/help-and-how-to\/modeling-statistics\/regression\/supporting-topics\/basics\/what-are-categorical-discrete-and-continuous-variables\/) . ","9450b455":"By itself, the distribution of age does not tell us much other than that there are no outliers as all the ages are reasonable. To visualize the effect of the age on the target, we will next make a [kernel density estimation plot](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kernel_density_estimation) (KDE) colored by the value of the target. A [kernel density estimate plot shows the distribution of a single variable](https:\/\/chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com\/2013\/06\/09\/exploratory-data-analysis-kernel-density-estimation-in-r-on-ozone-pollution-data-in-new-york-and-ozonopolis\/) and can be thought of as a smoothed histogram (it is created by computing a kernel, usually a Gaussian, at each data point and then averaging all the individual kernels to develop a single smooth curve). We will use the seaborn `kdeplot` for this graph.","c871487e":"# Conclusions\n\nIn this notebook, we saw how to get started with a Kaggle machine learning competition. We first made sure to understand the data, our task, and the metric by which our submissions will be judged. Then, we performed a fairly simple EDA to try and identify relationships, trends, or anomalies that may help our modeling. Along the way, we performed necessary preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and scaling features to a range. Then, we constructed new features out of the existing data to see if doing so could help our model. \n\nOnce the data exploration, data preparation, and feature engineering was complete, we implemented a baseline model upon which we hope to improve. Then we built a second slightly more complicated model to beat our first score. We also carried out an experiment to determine the effect of adding the engineering variables. \n\nWe followed the general outline of a [machine learning project](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/a-complete-machine-learning-walk-through-in-python-part-one-c62152f39420): \n\n1.  Understand the problem and the data\n2. Data cleaning and formatting (this was mostly done for us)\n3. Exploratory Data Analysis\n4. Baseline model\n5.  Improved model\n6. Model interpretation (just a little)\n\nMachine learning competitions do differ slightly from typical data science problems in that we are concerned only with achieving the best performance on a single metric and do not care about the interpretation. However, by attempting to understand how our models make decisions, we can try to improve them or examine the mistakes in order to correct the errors. In future notebooks we will look at incorporating more sources of data, building more complex models (by following the code of others), and improving our scores. \n\nI hope this notebook was able to get you up and running in this machine learning competition and that you are now ready to go out on your own - with help from the community - and start working on some great problems! \n\n__Running the notebook__: now that we are at the end of the notebook, you can hit the blue Commit & Run button to execute all the code at once. After the run is complete (this should take about 10 minutes), you can then access the files that were created by going to the versions tab and then the output sub-tab. The submission files can be directly submitted to the competition from this tab or they can be downloaded to a local machine and saved. The final part is to share the share the notebook: go to the settings tab and change the visibility to Public. This allows the entire world to see your work! \n\n### Follow-up Notebooks\n\nFor those looking to keep working on this problem, I have a series of follow-up notebooks:\n\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part One](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering)\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part Two](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering-p2)\n* [Introduction to Automated Feature Engineering](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/automated-feature-engineering-basics)\n* [Advanced Automated Feature Engineering](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/tuning-automated-feature-engineering-exploratory)\n* [Feature Selection](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/introduction-to-feature-selection)\n* [Intro to Model Tuning: Grid and Random Search](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/intro-to-model-tuning-grid-and-random-search)\n\nAs always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

In this frame of mind, we can make a couple features that attempt to capture what we think may be important for telling whether a client will default on a loan. Here I'm going to use five features that were inspired by [this script](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jsaguiar\/updated-0-792-lb-lightgbm-with-simple-features) by Aguiar:\n\n* `CREDIT_INCOME_PERCENT`: the percentage of the credit amount relative to a client's income\n* `ANNUITY_INCOME_PERCENT`: the percentage of the loan annuity relative to a client's income\n* `CREDIT_TERM`:  the length of the payment in months (since the annuity is the monthly amount due\n* `DAYS_EMPLOYED_PERCENT`: the percentage of the days employed relative to the client's age\n\nAgain, thanks to Aguiar and [his great script](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jsaguiar\/updated-0-792-lb-lightgbm-with-simple-features) for exploring these features.\n\n","134628bf":"There is a clear trend: younger applicants are more likely to not repay the loan! The rate of failure to repay is above 10% for the youngest three age groups and beolow 5% for the oldest age group.\n\nThis is information that could be directly used by the bank: because younger clients are less likely to repay the loan, maybe they should be provided with more guidance or financial planning tips. This does not mean the bank should discriminate against younger clients, but it would be smart to take precautionary measures to help younger clients pay on time.","7ff7d346":"The distribution looks to be much more in line with what we would expect, and we also have created a new column to tell the model that these values were originally anomalous (becuase we will have to fill in the nans with some value, probably the median of the column). The other columns with `DAYS` in the dataframe look to be about what we expect with no obvious outliers. \n\nAs an extremely important note, anything we do to the training data we also have to do to the testing data. Let's make sure to create the new column and fill in the existing column with `np.nan` in the testing data.","0c84c4f5":"## Back to Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n### Anomalies\n\nOne problem we always want to be on the lookout for when doing EDA is anomalies within the data. These may be due to mis-typed numbers, errors in measuring equipment, or they could be valid but extreme measurements. One way to support anomalies quantitatively is by looking at the statistics of a column using the `describe` method. The numbers in the `DAYS_BIRTH` column are negative because they are recorded relative to the current loan application. To see these stats in years, we can mutliple by -1 and divide by the number of days in a year:\n\n","1f79aad9":"## Examine the Distribution of the Target Column\n\nThe target is what we are asked to predict: either a 0 for the loan was repaid on time, or a 1 indicating the client had payment difficulties. We can first examine the number of loans falling into each category."}}
