The most common datasets used for machine translation are from [WMT](http:\/\/www.statmt.org\/).  However, that will take a long time to train a neural network on.  We'll be using a dataset we created for this project that contains a small vocabulary.  You'll be able to train your model in a reasonable time with this dataset.\n### Load Data\nThe data is located in `data\/small_vocab_en` and `data\/small_vocab_fr`.

Load the English and French data from these files from running the cell below.","6cf12f9d":"### Padding (IMPLEMENTATION)\nWhen batching the sequence of word ids together, each sequence needs to be the same length.  Since sentences are dynamic in length, we can add padding to the end of the sequences to make them the same length.\n\nMake sure all the English sequences have the same length and all the French sequences have the same length by adding padding to the **end** of each sequence using Keras's [`pad_sequences`](https:\/\/keras.io\/preprocessing\/sequence\/#pad_sequences) function.","bcc7ada6":"For comparison, _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ contains 2,766 unique words of a total of 15,500 words.\n## Preprocess\nFor this project, you won't use text data as input to your model. Instead, you'll convert the text into sequences of integers using the following preprocess methods:\n1. Tokenize the words into ids\n2. Add padding to make all the sequences the same length.\n\nTime to start preprocessing the data...\n### Tokenize (IMPLEMENTATION)\nFor a neural network to predict on text data, it first has to be turned into data it can understand. Text data like \"dog\" is a sequence of ASCII character encodings.  Since a neural network is a series of multiplication and addition operations, the input data needs to be number(s).\n\nWe can turn each character into a number or each word into a number.  These are called character and word ids, respectively.  Character ids are used for character level models that generate text predictions for each character.  A word level model uses word ids that generate text predictions for each word.  Word level models tend to learn better, since they are lower in complexity, so we'll use those.\n\nTurn each sentence into a sequence of words ids using Keras's [`Tokenizer`](https:\/\/keras.io\/preprocessing\/text\/#tokenizer) function. Use this function to tokenize `english_sentences` and `french_sentences` in the cell below.\n\nRunning the cell will run `tokenize` on sample data and show output for debugging.","c7928b86":"### Model 3: Bidirectional RNNs (IMPLEMENTATION)\n![RNN](images\/bidirectional.png)\nOne restriction of a RNN is that it can't see the future input, only the past.

We want the French translation.  The function `logits_to_text` will bridge the gab between the logits from the neural network to the French translation.

A more complex vocabulary is a more complex problem.  Let's look at the complexity of the dataset we'll be working with."}}
