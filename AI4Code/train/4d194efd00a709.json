And how certain can your model be?\n\nContent\nThis dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like \"leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.\n\nTime period: Donated to UCI ML 27 April 1987\nInspiration\nWhat types of machine learning models perform best on this dataset?\n\nWhich features are most indicative of a poisonous mushroom?\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis dataset was originally donated to the UCI Machine Learning repository.
