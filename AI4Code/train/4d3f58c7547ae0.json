Here we can see that Catboost worked the best in terms of MAE, MSE, RMSE and R2. But the time taken is the largest. So if any user wants to train a slightly inferior but fast model, he\/she will have the ability to do that and the user will understand everything just by looking at this leaderboard! Let\u2019s go with the Catboost for now.\n\nDuring the leaderboard generation, the model took a subset of the dataset, trained the ML models and did K-Fold cross validation. Now once the user finalizes a model and hits the **\u201cTrain model\u201d** button, it will take the full dataset and train the model on top of that. It will also tune the hyperparameters to find the best version of the selected model. But the user will also have the ability to provide the hyperparameters manually with the second button i.e. **\u201cTune Hyperparameters\u201d**.

We have now generated the same plot with some click of the mouse!","2f8fb90e":"# Introducing CyberDeck - A free one click platform to perform end to end Data Science Pipeline\n\n\nData Science is one of the most beautiful things out there. The sheer ability to extract meaningful information out of nothing is a wonder by itself. But being a data scientist comes with its own kinks. One of the major challenges of data science is code writing. One often writes hundreds of lines of codes to achive the feat of extracting valuable information from data. But then also, this is not scalable. As the data changes, the code changes. As a result, we have to write hundreds of lines of codes again even though the processes\/pipelines remain the same. But what if we could make a one stop platform for doing our regular data science work at the click of a mouse - Starting from data processing, EDA all the way to modelling?\n\nTo answer this ever growing problem, we are developing a **FREE** one stop community platform for Data Scientists named **\"CyberDeck\"**. Every similar platform we have seen costs a lot of money. But not this. This is not out for release yet. But if we get a positive feedback from this gold mine of a community, we will make that a reality soon tentatively by the end of this year!\n\nTo demonstrate the capability of CyberDeck, we are choosing the COVID India dataset. We will do a side by side comparison of coding vs using CyberDeck for a variety of processes. We will perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis and then do machine learning to predict the number of total cases. After that, we will demonstrate our Explainable AI section to understand what features impact the chances of COVID the most and do a \"WHAT-IF\" analysis to see some interesting turn of events that would have happened if some feature values were changed.\n\nIn our previous kernel (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sagarnildass\/convert-your-data-science-hours-to-minutes), we gave more attention to the EDA section of CyberDeck. This time, we will explore the Dashboard section more thoroughly.\n\nAs we plan to give this product for free, we really need to understand if there will be a need for this among the data scientists. So we couldn't think of a better place than Kaggle. So do let us know if you need this product!\n\nAs a final note, if you like this demo and want to be a contributor, contact us at sagarnil.das@cyberdeck.in\n\n**You can sign up for the Pre-release here:** https:\/\/cyberdeck.in\/\n\nYou need it?

K-modes clustering\n3. Affinity propagation clustering\n4. Mean shift clustering\n5. Spectral clustering\n6. Agglomerative clustering\n7. Density based spatial clustering\n8. OPTICS clustering\n9.
