[Classification, Decision Trees and k Nearest Neighbors](https:\/\/nbviewer.jupyter.org\/github\/Yorko\/mlcourse_open\/blob\/master\/jupyter_english\/topic03_decision_trees_kNN\/topic3_decision_trees_kNN.ipynb?flush_cache=true), the same as an interactive web-based [Kaggle Kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/topic-3-decision-trees-and-knn) \n 2. Ensembles:\n  - [Bagging](https:\/\/nbviewer.jupyter.org\/github\/Yorko\/mlcourse_open\/blob\/master\/jupyter_english\/topic05_ensembles_random_forests\/topic5_part1_bagging.ipynb?flush_cache=true), the same as a [Kaggle Kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/topic-5-ensembles-part-1-bagging)\n  - [Random Forest](https:\/\/nbviewer.jupyter.org\/github\/Yorko\/mlcourse_open\/blob\/master\/jupyter_english\/topic05_ensembles_random_forests\/topic5_part2_random_forest.ipynb?flush_cache=true), the same as a [Kaggle Kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/topic-5-ensembles-part-2-random-forest)\n  - [Feature Importance](https:\/\/nbviewer.jupyter.org\/github\/Yorko\/mlcourse_open\/blob\/master\/jupyter_english\/topic05_ensembles_random_forests\/topic5_part3_feature_importance.ipynb?flush_cache=true), the same as a [Kaggle Kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/topic-5-ensembles-part-3-feature-importance)\n 3. - [Gradient boosting](https:\/\/nbviewer.jupyter.org\/github\/Yorko\/mlcourse_open\/blob\/master\/jupyter_english\/topic10_boosting\/topic10_gradient_boosting.ipynb?flush_cache=true), the same as a [Kaggle Kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/topic-10-gradient-boosting) \n   - Logistic regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM in the \"Kaggle Forest Cover Type Prediction\" competition: [Kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/topic-10-practice-with-logit-rf-and-lightgbm) \n 4. You can also practice with demo assignments, which are simpler and already shared with solutions:\n  - \"Decision trees with a toy task and the UCI Adult dataset\": [assignment](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/a3-demo-decision-trees) + [solution](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/a3-demo-decision-trees-solution)\n  - \"Logistic Regression and Random Forest in the credit scoring problem\": [assignment](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/assignment-5-logit-and-rf-for-credit-scoring) + [solution](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/a5-demo-logit-and-rf-for-credit-scoring-sol)\n 5.
