Even the United States and EU countries are lagging behind. \n\nAnother interesting approach to analyse vaccination rates is to see how the number of immunized people grow over time. The next sub-chapter explores COVID-19 vaccination tempo in Bulgaria.","60518596":"The relevant to Bulgaria data were extracted from the main table and stored in `vaccinations_bulgaria`.","c4a0d9f8":"It would be interesting for one to see which vaccines were used mostly.

Duplicates (see above) and missing values (see below) were not identified.","d6689a8f":"Missing values were intentionally left in the dataset.\n\nInitially, due to the lack of vaccines, daily vaccination rates were well below 2000. As from the end of January 2021, for some 20 days, the country recorded around 3000 shots per day. Thereafter, figures rose to more than 10000 daily.","4a0c3ec8":"The information was collected from 170 countries (as of 8th of April). These are listed below.","160c2e6c":"### 4.
