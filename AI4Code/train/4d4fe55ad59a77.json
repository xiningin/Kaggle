All of this aside, let me plan on what do on my next notebook for the competition:\n\n1. Add a Photometric Interpretation column to the dataframe.\n2. Convert all dicom to a single PI.\n3. Instead of using RCNN or other masking techniques, Use gradients to make bounding box.\n4. [optinal] Crop lungs out as much as possible.\n\nFor the time being I will first focus on predictions, then on bounding boxes.","d8d0037a":"I don't know about the error what pillow_handler shows, however the program works! It might be possible that some dicom may seem as blank image, in my experience, to overcome these images we could normalize image array first.","c07a3714":"# Checking Data Out\n\nIn this notebook I just want to check the data out and want to get back at my rusty skills.","196655d8":"Now let's check first DICOM file.

We might have to note this down to convert all dicoms to a single PI."}}
