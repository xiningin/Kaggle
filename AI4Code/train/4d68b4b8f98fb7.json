Lable Encoding\n\nOne of the simplest and most common solutions advertised to transform categorical variables is Label Encoding. __It consists of substituting each group with a corresponding number and keeping such numbering consistent throughout the feature__.This solution makes the models run, and it is one of the most commonly used by aspiring Data Scientists. However, its simplicity comes with many issues.\nNumbers hold relationships. \nWell, that\u2019s not exactly right\u2026\nThis is especially an issue for algorithms, such as K-Means, where a distance measure is calculated when running the model.\n\n### 2. One-Hot Encoding\n\n__One-Hot Encoding__ is the most common, correct way to deal with __non-ordinal categorical data__. It consists of creating an additional feature for each group of the categorical feature and mark each observation belonging (__Value=1__) or not (__Value=0__) to that group.This approach is able to encode categorical features properly, despite some minor drawbacks. Specifically, the presence of a high number of binary values is not ideal for distance-based algorithms, such as Clustering models. In addition, __the high number of additionally generated features introduces the curse of dimensionality.__ This means that due to the now high dimensionality of the dataset, the dataset becomes much more sparse. In other words, in Machine Learning problems, you\u2019d need at least a few samples per each feature combination. Increasing the number of features means that we might encounter cases of not having enough observations for each feature combination.\n\n### 3. Target Encoding\n\nA lesser known, but very effective way of handling categorical variables, is __Target Encoding__. It consists of substituting each group in a categorical feature with the __average response__ in the target variable.The process to obtain the Target Encoding is relatively straightforward and it can be summarised as:\n1. Group the data by category\n2. Calculate the average of the target variable per each group\n3. Assign the average to each observation belonging to that group","c35a9d49":"## Handling categorical variables (Part 2)\n\n"}}
