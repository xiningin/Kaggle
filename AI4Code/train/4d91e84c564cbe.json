Let's check the documentation by calling `help(planets.append)`.\n\n> **Aside:** `append` is a method carried around by *all* objects of type list, not just `planets`, so we also could have called `help(list.append)`. However, if we try to call `help(append)`, Python will complain that no variable exists called \"append\". The \"append\" name only exists within lists - it doesn't exist as a standalone name like builtin functions such as `max` or `len`.","9eca2639":"Tuples are often used for functions that have multiple return values.\n\nFor example, the ``as_integer_ratio()`` method of float objects returns a numerator and a denominator in the form of a tuple:","c1d23e75":"<!-- TODO:\ndir?\nA useful builtin method for interacting with objects is `dir`. `dir` asks: what are the names of all the things (methods, and attributes) that this object is carrying around?\nhelp(x)?\n-->\n\nThe examples above were utterly obscure. None of the types of objects we've looked at so far (numbers, functions, booleans) have attributes or methods you're likely ever to use.\n\nBut it turns out that lists have several methods which you'll use all the time.","8b7ae0cb":"To actually call it, we add parentheses:","292d9542":"What's the next closest planet?","722874a3":"## Slicing\n\nWhat are the first three planets?

In the exercise notebooks `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, etc. are all objects which have methods called `check`, `hint`, and `solution`.\n\nIn the same way that we can pass functions to the `help` function (e.g. `help(max)`), we can also pass in methods:","0c59f976":"## Interlude: objects\n\nI've used the term 'object' a lot so far - you may have even read that *everything* in Python is an object. What does that mean?\n\nIn short, objects carry some things around with them. You access that stuff using Python's dot syntax.\n\nFor example, numbers in Python carry around an associated variable called `imag` representing their imaginary part. (You'll probably never need to use this unless you're doing some very weird math.)","5f6f6adf":"## Changing lists\n\nLists are \"mutable\", meaning they can be modified \"in place\".\n\nOne way to modify a list is to assign to an index or slice expression.\n\nFor example, let's say we want to rename Mars:","f2dc2c0d":"# Lists\n\nLists in Python represent ordered sequences of values.

Lists have lots of methods with weird-looking names like `__eq__` and `__iadd__`. Don't worry too much about these for now. (You'll probably never call such methods directly. But they get called behind the scenes when we use syntax like indexing or comparison operators.) The most interesting methods are toward the bottom of the list (`append`, `clear`, `copy`, etc.).","96c009f8":"`list.pop` removes and returns the last element of a list:","abcac8ad":"The things an object carries around can also include functions. A function attached to an object is called a **method**. (Non-function things attached to an object, such as `imag`, are called *attributes*).\n\nFor example, numbers have a method called `bit_length`. Again, we access it using dot syntax:","516265ef":"## Tuples\n\nTuples are almost exactly the same as lists. They differ in just two ways.\n\n**1:** The syntax for creating them uses parentheses instead of square brackets","e2b850f8":"i.e. the expression above means \"give me all the planets from index 3 onward\".\n\nWe can also use negative indices when slicing:","b0283b2c":"`list.append` modifies a list by adding an item to the end:","e142dd71":"The `-> None` part is telling us that `list.append` doesn't return anything.
