If successful, solutions will be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and rescuers around the world to improve the appeal of their pet profiles, automatically enhancing photo quality and recommending composition improvements. As a result, stray dogs and cats can find families much faster, and these tools will help improve animal welfare.\n\nIn this notebook, I will present a quick 'n dirty EDA and a (image-only, for now) fastai starter. \n\n**EDIT (12\/18): This new version fixes a major bug that was present before for the metric calculation. Before, the metric was calculated per batch and averaged across all batches which is incorrect for the RMSE metric. Please make sure that you are not making this error too.**\n\n**As of 10\/26, it's currently the best-scoring notebook for the competition, beating 10-fold ensemble models that are bigger while only using a single and smaller model.**","c172e891":"Now, **WE ARE DONE!**\n\nIf you enjoyed this notebook, please give it an upvote. \n\nStay tuned for improvements to this notebook, potentially including a version that uses the metadata as well.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please leave a comment!","a67d7a90":"## A look at the data\nLet's start out by setting up our environment by importing the required modules and setting a random seed:","69eb4243":"Let's now fine-tune the model with the desired learning rate of 2e-5.
