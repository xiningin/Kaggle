Therefore, significant attention has to be paid to comparison of the results from different cells (sequencing libraries). The main sources of discrepancy between the libraries are:\n\n- Amplification (up to 1 million fold)\n- Gene 'dropouts' in which a gene is observed at a moderate expression level in one cell but is not detected in another cell (Kharchenko, 2014).\n","15e5ceb0":"Overall, experimental scRNA-seq protocols are similar to the methods used for bulk RNA-seq.","e26f06fa":"## Computational Analysis \nThis notebook is concerned with the computational analysis of the data obtained from scRNA-seq experiments. \n- The first steps (yellow) are general for any highthroughput sequencing data. \n- Later steps (orange) require a mix of existing RNASeq analysis methods and novel methods to address the technical difference of scRNASeq. \n- Finally the biological interpretation (blue) should be analyzed with methods specifically developed for scRNASeq."}}
