You saw the [model overview](#model_overview) above. The first layer is Embedding. Embedding layer by Keras is a flexible layer that can be used also without any pre-trained weights. In that case, the Embedding layer is initialized with random weights and will learn an embedding for all of the words in the training dataset. In this exercise, we will set the weights of the Embedding layer to the embedding matrix from GloVe pre-trained vectors.This is a tranfer learning. \n\nAnother parameter in Embedding layer is \"trainable\" which can be set to True in case you want to fine-tune the word embedding or if you don't want the embedding weights to be updated you can set it to False. Here, we set it to False.<br>\n\nAfter the Embedding layer, we have a layer of LSTM or GRU and then a Dropout layer for regularization. \n\nThen we have a Dense layer with Sigmoid activation which transforms the output of previous layers to 0 or 1 (real or fake). \n","5100b588":"## GRU","4b99ce4a":"# Loading data and visualizing","0093c5b4":"## Tokenization\n\n \nThere are two distinct steps in tokenizing in this way:\n1. fit_on_texts: We'll fit the tokenizer on our training data to create the word indices\n2. texts_to_sequences: using the word index dictionary from step above, we take this step to transform both train and test data. \n\nHere, we set num_words to a limit such as 10000 words. num_words is a parameter that defines the maximum number of words to keep, based on the word frequency. Keras actually keeps (num_words-1) words.
