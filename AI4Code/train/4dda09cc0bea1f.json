This means they first develop in animals before developing in humans.For the virus to pass from animal to humans, a person has to come into close contact with an animal that carries the infection.Once the virus develops in people, coronaviruses can be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. This is a technical name for the wet stuff that moves through the air when you cough or sneeze.The viral material hangs out in these droplets and can be breathed into the respiratory tract (your windpipe and lungs), where the virus can then lead to an infection.The 2019 coronavirus hasn\u2019t been definitively linked to a specific animal.Researchers believe that the virus may have been passed from bats to another animal \u2014 either snakes or pangolins \u2014 and then transmitted to humans. This transmission likely occurred in the open food market in Wuhan, China. <br>\n###  What are the symptoms of Coronavirus? <br>\nThe COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways.  COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring special treatment.People who have underlying medical conditions and those over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death.\n#### Common symptoms include:\n* fever\n* tiredness\n* dry cough. \n* shortness of breath\n* aches and pains\n* sore throat\n* very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose. <br>\n\n\n###  What are the preventions for Coronavirus? <br>\n\nTo prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: <br>\n\n* Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.\n* Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.\n* Avoid touching your face.\n* Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.\n* Stay home if you feel unwell.\n* Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.\n* Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.\n\n","40319bbe":"<h1 style=\"text-align:center;font-size:200%;;\">Transmission Stages<\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.jagranimages.com\/images\/2020\/mar\/graph1584679164245.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" align=\"center\"\/> \n<br>\n### Within a week the governments and authorities of respective Countries and states should identify the travellers from infected countries and needed to be isolated.Else it will become a life threatening disease.","4acbfcc4":"## 1.

We can see a pattern from above made analysis that within first 5-7 weeks the government and higher authorities should identify all the travellers and passengers who travelled and who came to their countries and states and needed to be isolated. <br>\n3. The main reason why we should be very careful is that till now there was no appropiate vaccine for coronavirus. This is main cause of many deaths. <br>\n4. Also in many countries the lockdown was partial which lead to mass gatherings and rapid spread of Virus. <br>\n5. Hospital capabilities of many countries was very less which lead to great loss of lives. <br>\n6. After the first encountring of covid case the government should completely lock down the places where he\/she travelled. Many governments have failed to do this.Which is the another cause of rapid growth of Corona. <br>\n7. Many people in their countries have not followed their government rules and regulations.
