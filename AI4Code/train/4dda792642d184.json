The data files were downloaded from the UCI ML data repository. The data set goes back to 1987.\n\nEach mushroom species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility. The class of mushrooms with unknown edibility are combined with the poisonous class in the data set. There is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom.\n\nThe data is in a comma-separated format. There are 8124 observations, with 23 columns. The first column value is 'p' or 'e' (p: poisonous, e: edible), this is the target value. Missing values are flagged with '?'.\n\nThe objective of this analysis is to create a classifier which predicts whether a given sample represents an edible or a poisonous mushroom.
