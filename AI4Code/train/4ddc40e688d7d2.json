However, this is mostly due to the fact that the majority of movies on the catalogue were clearly released after the 1990s. It also makes sense from a business standpoint that Netflix would bring only the highest-rated old movies on the platform, as many users probably wouldn't \"waste\" their time with old movies that are not that well-known and beloved.","0cdf3c44":"## Adding the IMDb scores\nThere are several ways to go about this. The easiest and arguably most flawed one would be to read the official IMDb dataset directly and match the Netflix title of each production with the IMDb title, and then adding the score. However, the IMDb dataset contains every production ever released (well, perhaps not the too obscure ones), and many of them have essentially the same titles. They have unique IDs though, which in this scenario are not very useful as we can't match them against anything.<br><br>Well, what if we also match by year in addition to the title? This won't work as intended for TV shows, because IMDb has the year that the show finished airing, and Netflix only has the year of the last season that is available on Netflix. And those two don't always match! Another reason for concern is that IMDb has a separate page for every episode of a given TV show, and they usually span across multiple years.<br><br>The alternative approach I chose is far from perfect but it does a pretty decent job. We're going to use an unofficial API from [RapidAPI](https:\/\/rapidapi.com) to perform a search using the title of each production and then retrieve the unique IMDb ID (also called \"tconst\") associated with that title. The way the search function works, we're likely to get the most popular title and not a random one. For example, when we search for the TV show \"Friends\", we'll get exactly that and not one of the presumably hundreds of other productions with that name. We will also get the page for the entire show and not for a random episode.<br><br>The search function most likely takes the popularity of the production into account, which is why it works so well. We don't need to be worried about accidentally fetching a very obscure show that has a zero chance of actually being on Netflix.<br><br>Of course, this approach is error-prone, so we will need to make sure afterwards that those are the true titles.","f41034dc":"# Netflix content and IMDb scores: what are users watching?\nFor this project, I used this [Kaggle dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/shivamb\/netflix-shows). It has information on all movies and TV shows that were available on Netflix US as of 2019. The data was apparently retrieved from [Flixable](https:\/\/flixable.com). I also used a couple of the official [IMDb datasets](https:\/\/datasets.imdbws.com) that have the IMDb score for each production (retrieved on 31\/08\/2020).\n\nThe main goal of the project is to retrieve the IMDb score for each title (a value from 1 to 10), and then explore how the scores differ depending on the content's type (movie or TV show), country of production, age rating etc.\n### Here is what we're going to do:\n1. Reading the dataset into pandas and cleaning it.<br><i>Libraries used: pandas. NumPy.<\/i>\n2. Retrieving IMDb title IDs from an external API and matching them for each movie\/show in the dataset.<br><i>Libraries used: requests, time, json.<\/i>\n3. Extracting the IMDb scores for each title.\n4. Generating a world map showing the countries with the most productions and their scores.<br><i>Libraries used: Matplotlib, Toolkits.<\/i>\n5. Exploring and visualising scores across several different variables.<br><i>Libraries used: Seaborn.<\/i>","4aed395e":"Now, we're finally ready to add the actual IMDb scores to the dataframe.","22ae73d7":"There seems to be no association between the IMDb scores and the movie length.","175454f6":"Only TV shows get an IMDb score above 7. TV movies perform the worst, although the difference to cinema movies and all productions is by no means dramatic. 6.24\u20137.16 is not a huge range, and it's pretty similar to what we observed with the countries.\n\n## IMDb score: correlation with other variables\nFinally, let's plot the relationship between the IMDb scores and the continuous variables: year, duration and age rating. (The age rating is not exactly continuous but we'll treat it that way, that's why we converted the ratings to integers.) We will also calculate the correlations.","6260fef1":"We can see that more than 2\/3 of Netflix's catalogue consists of movies.","876738da":"It's looking good. However, we still need to perform some extra checks to make sure that we've matched the titles correctly. We will compare the Netflix year with the IMDB year (but only for the movies, I explained above why this is not a good idea for the TV shows). We'll also check if the Netflix title matches with the IMDB title.","16c7f63b":"Again, very small correlations. TV shows and cinema movies seem to be better rated if they're for grown-ups rather than for kids. For the TV movies, it's the opposite. Again, this association is very small, so it's best not to read into it.\n## Summary and conclusion\nWe started with a dataset of all titles on the US Netlfix in 2019 and we matched them with their respective IMDb scores, losing less than 20% of the data in the process. The mean IMDb score for all remaining shows was 6.55. TV shows had the highest average of 7.16. US was the country with most productions, with an average IMDb score of 6.53. The associations between the IMDb scores and movie release year, movie length and age rating were either small or non-existent.<br><br>Now that the IMDb scores have been matched, there are other possibilities to work with the dataset! For example, one can also utilise the categories, descriptions and cast members of the titles (they were available in the original Netflix dataset but I dropped them because they weren't relevant to the task at hand). Or one could also used some of the many other variables from the IMDb datasets. Let me know if you need need access to the matched dataset.","5c2070d5":"Let's visualise the mean IMDb scores for each of the three types of productions.","acff8f73":"This is how the dataset looks after we've cleaned it.","6b42fe14":"Turns out some of the movies are actually TV movies (their age rating starts with \"TV\"). Let's update the <i>type<\/i> column to reflect that. We'll also deal with the <i>duration<\/i> column after that.","58d2c045":"The list is intact for the most part, which is yet another indication that our sample is representative. This is good.\n## Average IMDB scores\nWe can now start aggregating and visualising the IMDb scores. Let's first take the original TOP 10 countries list and create a map. To do that, we will need to import the coordinates for each country from an external dataset.","0c715020":"We can see that from the initial 6234 productions, 5127 are left, which is only about 18% of data lost! But why did we lose data at all? Possible reasons are: titles not yet released (they don't have IMDb scores but could still appear on Netflix as future releases), foreign titles that don't have an English name on IMDb; the <i>percentage_match<\/i> function is also not too generous, so we might have actually lost some titles that were correctly matched.\n\nHowever, the proportions of movies and TV shows are almost intact, which means that our current sample is probably representative enough!. Just to make sure, let's also look at the current TOP 10 countries with the most productions.","0cf6e3ad":"Now that we have the IMDb IDs, it's time that we matched them with the IMDb titles, years and eventually the scores.","a1219078":"Now that we've cleaned up the Netflix and IMDb titles, they're finally ready to be compared. We will first isolate all titles, for which the match is not 1:1, and see if any of them could be salvaged. To do that, we'll calculate the number of words that are the same in both titles, and then divide that by the total number of words contained in the shorter of the two titles. The number we'll get will tell us how much the words in the shorter title are words that are also included in the longer title.<br><br>\nAs an example: if the shorter title is \"care bears cousins\" and the longer title is \"care bears and cousins\", then that's three identical words divided by three (the length of the shorter title), which equals 1. This is as good as a perfect match (and those titles are obviously the same)! We'll set the threshold at .75, everything less than that will be dropped from the dataset.","92f816e5":"Looks like the overwhelming majority of productions come from the US.","e8bdc8b0":"Apparently, Japan has the highest-rated content, while Canada the lowest. However, 6.19\u20137.35 is not a huge range.<br><br>We need to perform some more data manipulation before aggregating the IMDb scores. We have a <i>rating<\/i> column that contains the age ratings for each production. And even though they're different for movies and TV shows, they're still ordered from lowest (e.g. suitable for kids) to highest (e.g. adults only). Let's convert them to numbers."}}
