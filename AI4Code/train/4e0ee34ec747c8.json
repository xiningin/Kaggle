There is value in looking outside of the common statistics, and at something that may not be intuitive. \n\nThe connection between men's and women's team performance may not even make sense at first. Afterall, how could these two be connected? The games are so different. But there is value in a factor even if we cannot fully explain it. This Two-Team Factor is predictive of success in the NCAA Tournament, and if we think about it, it starts to make sense. Schools large enough to have two successful programs attract great players and coaches, and must have a great athletic department. But then we turn to the seemingly unquantifiable: school passion that results from competing in the tournament. These schools have not just one, but two teams competing in the NCAA Tournament.

Of those wins, nearly 70% of the champions did not have the highest PPG in the tournament, some even had extremely low ppg. \n\n* The overall trend is that the higher the PPG, the more likely a team makes it to later rounds. But in the later rounds, this relationship does not have the same strength. \n\n* The one factor that does, however, show a relationship with late round performance is whether that program has two teams participating in the tournament.

Fans are able to root for their favorite teams in a single elimination tournament that crowns the champion of College Basketball. We have two opportunities to watch our favorite teams because both the Men's and Women's NCAA Tournaments happen in March. Some lucky fans even get the opportunity to cheer for both teams at the same time. But this isn't the only reason they are lucky. When a school's men's and women's teams are competing in the tournament, they're actually more likely to win.\n\n**We start with a simple hypothesis:** NCAA Division I Basketball programs that have both a Women and Men's team participating in the NCAA Tournament in the same season, perform better than teams that do not. \n\n**The Goal** is to show that there is evidence in the historical data to suggest this phenomenon exists, and this \"Two-team\" factor can be used in predicting the outcome of future tournament games.\n\n**The Data:** We will be using tournament and regular season data from both the women's and men's data files in this competition.","056b61bb":"In the Women's NCAA Tournament:\n\nThe outperformance of Two-Team programs holds true in nearly all of the conferences.

To get a better idea of the effect of PPG and the Two-Team factor on performance in each round we create the graph below: \n\n**Note:** The **RED** dots represent Two-Team programs (Both=1), and the **BLUE** dots represent Single Team programs (Both=0).","2ae91aa7":"### The purpose of this notebook is to explore the connection between Men and Women's NCAA Basketball. \n","ac3afe4d":"The graphs below visualize the win percentages of both Two-Team and Single Team programs in each round of the tournament.

For factors like these, those predictions are elusive.\n\nOne thing we can determine from our analysis is that, in later rounds, the \"Two-Team\" Facotr is not highly correlated to PPG, but is predictive of outcomes.

There are multiple rounds where the Two-Team programs win 60% or more of the matchups against Single Team programs, including the Championship Game. \n\nThe only exception is the final four, where the win percentage of the Two-Team programs dropped. We have attributed this drop to the fact that so few Single-Team programs made it to the final four, and even fewer competed against Two-Team programs.

This eventually results in 60% or more of the teams in the final rounds of the tournament being comprised of Two-Team programs. This type of growth in the ratio of Two-Team programs per round would suggest that the programs with two teams are winning at higher rate than single team programs each round.\n\nIn the next section we investigate this relationship by looking at the win percentages of each type of program in every round.","a371ee1f":"Loading the libraries and data:","72b81900":"A few takeaways from the graphs:\n* The same 5 or 6 conferences make up the most of the teams competing for both types of programs\n* Even though it is the same conferences, there is clear differnce in which conferences make up each type of program\n* In the Women's Tournament, the \"Two-team\" programs have the most teams from the Big 12 and ACC.

Most of the teams in the later rounds have higher PPG, but some of the teams in the lower rounds also have higher PPG. We see a stronger correlation between PPG and wins in the Women's bracket, and a much more subtle correlation in the Men's.

However, programs that have two teams participating in the tournament appear to be much more competitive than programs that only have one. In tournament play, we see Two-Team Programs win at a much higher rate, and as a result, consistently make it futher in the tournamnet than Single team programs. We think this phenomenon makes sense both empirically and logically . If one team at a school (men or women) becomes dominant it is likely this attracts more fans, increases ticket sales, and eventually impacts other sports programs at the university, creating a kind of loop where if one basketball team is good the other one builds off of this. \n\n","f9df1152":"### Women Teams","353199a5":"However, our concern is not on predicting the seed of a team, but whether that team will perform well in the tournament. \n\nWe know, from anecdotal evidence of watching games, that higher seeds usually make it further in the tournament.

But in games where the two teams have similar Seeds, the predictive value of the higher Seed breaks down. We proposition that the Two-Team factor can be of use in these scenarios.\n\nLet's take a look at the distribution of Seeds for each type of program:","408a2e15":"As we can see above, in the games where a program that has both a women's and men's team in the tournament faces a program without two teams in the tournament, the program with both teams in the tournament wins a significantly higher percentage of the games. \n* For the women's tournaments, Two-Team programs win that matchup over 64% of the time. \n* In the men's tournament, Two-Team programs win 63% of the time. ","0ca92eff":"Now we are going to review the winning percentage of the two types of programs in each round of the tournament. \n\nFrom our above analysis, we know that the percentage of programs with two teams in the tournament increases as the tournament progresses. The most logical explanation for this is that these programs are winning at a higher rate than programs with only one team particpating in the tournament.

We use the name Both because this feature tells us whether or not a program has both teams participating. Both will equal **1** if there are two teams and **0** if there is only a Women's Team.","87b43df9":"This section of the notebook will comprise our initial analysis of Two-Team and Single Team program performance in the tournament. We will begin by looking at the number (or percentage) of Two-Team programs in each round. Then we will look at the two types of programs' historical win percentages at each stage of the tournament and how that correlates with the types of programs competing in each round. Finally, we will explore the results of head-to-head matchups between Two-Team programs and Single Team programs. ","81c274d8":"We now know that the Two-Team Programs win more games on average than Single Team Programs. \n\nHowever, we want to dig further to see if this phenomenon holds true year over year, or if the numbers are skewed because of a few outlier seasons where Two-Team programs did exceptionally well. To do this we create a joyplot (or ridgeline plot) showing the distribution of wins in the tournament for both programs in each season. \n\nThe distribution of tournament wins in each season are visualized below:\n\nTwo-Team Programs = Green\n\nSingle Team Programs = Red","2eb78bba":"The purpose of this section is to first get an idea of the types of teams that make up the tourament. \n\nEach tournament starts with 64 teams, and we want to know what the breakdown is between Two-Team programs and single team programs. We will do an anlysis of the programs involved in both the Men and Women's NCAA Tournament. Our graphs will show what percentage of each round, on average, is made up of \"Two-Team\" programs.","f5d34cf1":"Takeaways:\n* Programs with only one team participating in the tournament have a higher density of teams with 0 or 1 win. This reinforces our earlier conclusion that most of the teams entering the tournament are Single Team programs, many of which lose in the first two rounds.\n* The Two-Team Programs have a flatter curve and more teams in the 3-5 win range, indicating that there are less Two-Team programs competing, but on average they make it futher in the tournament. \n* This holds true for nearly all of the seasons plotted above, and shows that the phenomenon is consistent year over year. ","63e996da":"We conclude from the plots that there is no significant difference in most of the PPGs represented above. In the Women's Tournament, the PPG of Single Team programs was actually higher in later rounds. This means the Two-team programs that won most of the games had a lower PPG on average. In the Men's Tournament, we do see that Two-Team programs have higher PPGs in most rounds above. However, we do not think this is a significant enough difference to explain all of the outperformance by the \"Two-Team\" programs, especially considering the the trend in overall PPG of the teams per round is nearly flat. ","88584253":"Women's NCAA Tournament","99f42319":"We conclude that Two-Team programs perform better in the NCAA Tournament than Single Team programs. Some observations that make this point include:\n1. Tournament Champions\n    * a. 73% of Women's Tournament Champions are Two-Team Programs\n    * b. 59% of Men's Tournament Champions are Two-Team Programs\n2. Both Men's and Women's Two-Team Programs have an average win rate of over 50%\n3. Two-Team Programs on average make it further in the tournament\n4. In Games where Two-Team programs play Single Team programs:\n    * a. Women's Two-Team programs win 64% of the time\n    * b. Men's Two-Team programs win 63% of the time\n5. The Outperformance by Two-Team Programs persists over nearly every:\n    * a. Round\n    * b. Season\n    * c. Seed\n    * d. Conference\n\n\nAfter pouring over the data, I have concluded that the real beauty of this factor is that it appears to stay strong when other factors fall apart. When two teams that have high PPG or high Seeds face each other, it becomes extremely difficult to predict the outcome, but this factor can make that prediction.","cd7ddb41":"Men's NCAA Tournament","d9f5ec99":"Women","c13d5068":"Though it seems these Two-Team Programs have an advantage in games, this could just be the result of many early round wins, where highly ranked Two-Teamed programs beat lower ranked Single Team programs. To determine if this phenomenon holds true in games that are harder to predict, we look at the outcome of these matchups in each round.","71eec611":"# 3.

Normally a few conferences dominate the tournament, filling most of the spots and winning most of the championships. These are, not surprisingly, the conferences with the largest schools. This is an important feature to look at because if there is a huge difference between the conferences the Two-Team programs come from and the conferences the Single team programs come from, this factor could be easily explained by that difference. So, in this section we will explore which conferences each type of program comes from, and whether the Two-Team advantage exists across conferences.
