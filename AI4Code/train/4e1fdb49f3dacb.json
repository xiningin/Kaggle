That's why the name DieTanic. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget.\n\nIt took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.\n\n\u064ce will use the classic titanic data set. This dataset contains information about **11 different variables**:\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s9.picofile.com\/file\/8340453092\/Titanic_feature.png\" height=\"500\" width=\"500\">\n\n1. Survival\n1.

Now we cannot sort or give any ordering to such variables. They are also known as Nominal Variables.\n\n1. **Categorical Features in the dataset: Sex,Embarked.**\n<a id=\"3312\"><\/a> <br>\n### 3-3-1-2 Ordinal\nAn ordinal variable is similar to categorical values, but the difference between them is that we can have relative ordering or sorting between the values. For eg: If we have a feature like Height with values Tall, Medium, Short, then Height is a ordinal variable. Here we can have a relative sort in the variable.\n\n1. **Ordinal Features in the dataset: PClass**\n<a id=\"3313\"><\/a> <br>\n### 3-3-1-3 Continous:\nA feature is said to be continous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the features column.\n\n1. **Continous Features in the dataset: Age**\n\n**<< Note >>**\n> You must answer the following question:\nHow does your company expact to use and benfit from your model.\n<br>\n###### [Go to top](#top)","7e50c413":"<a id=\"331\"><\/a> \n<br>\n### 3-3-1 Why am I  using Titanic dataset\n\n1- This is a good project because it is so well understood.\n\n2- Attributes are numeric and categorical so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.\n\n3- It is a ML problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\n\n4- we can define problem as clustering(unsupervised algorithm) project too.\n\n5- because we love   **Kaggle** :-) .\n\n<a id=\"32\"><\/a> <br>\n### 3-2 Aim\nIt is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.

While it has been the focus of many researchers for several years, individual problems have been addressed separately.

Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known simply as \"accuracy\u201d.\n\n1. **precision** : \n\n    1. In pattern recognition, information retrieval and binary classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, \n1. **recall** : \n\n    1. recall is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. \n1. **F-score** :\n\n    1. the F1 score is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\n\n1. **What is the difference between accuracy and precision?**\n    1. \"Accuracy\" and \"precision\" are general terms throughout science. A good way to internalize the difference are the common \"bullseye diagrams\". In machine learning\/statistics as a whole, accuracy vs. precision is analogous to bias vs. variance.","c818a735":"to check out how many null info are on the dataset, we can use **isnull().sum()","47afe975":"### 6-2-12 Conclusion\nwe have used Python to apply data visualization tools to the Iris dataset.
