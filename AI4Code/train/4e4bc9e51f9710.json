This thickened, stiff tissue makes it more difficult for your lungs to work properly. As pulmonary fibrosis worsens, you become progressively more short of breath.\n\nThe scarring associated with pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by a multitude of factors. But in most cases, doctors can't pinpoint what's causing the problem. When a cause can't be found, the condition is termed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nThe lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis can't be repaired, but medications and therapies can sometimes help ease symptoms and improve quality of life. For some people, a lung transplant might be appropriate.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n<!-- <br\/><br\/> -->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/glassboxmedicine.files.wordpress.com\/2020\/03\/ct-gif.gif?w=616\" alt=\"Drawing\" align=\"right\" width=300 height=200\/>\n\n\n## Symptoms of Pulmonary fibrosis\n\nSigns and symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may include:\n* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)\n* A dry cough\n* Fatigue\n* Unexplained weight loss\n* Aching muscles and joints\n* Widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes (clubbing)\n\nThe course of pulmonary fibrosis \u2014 and the severity of symptoms \u2014 can vary considerably from person to person. Some people become ill very quickly with severe disease. Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly, over months or years.\n\nSome people may experience a rapid worsening of their symptoms (acute exacerbation), such as severe shortness of breath, that may last for several days to weeks. People who have acute exacerbations may be placed on a mechanical ventilator.\n[Source](https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/pulmonary-fibrosis\/symptoms-causes\/syc-20353690#:~:text=Pulmonary%20fibrosis%20is%20a%20lung,progressively%20more%20short%20of%20breath.)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n<!-- <br\/><br\/> -->\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.lungsandyou.com\/static\/images\/content\/possible-ipf-risk-factors.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" align=\"right\" width=400 height=300\/>\n\n## Risk factors in pulmonary fibrosis \n\n* **Age:** Although pulmonary fibrosis has been diagnosed in children and infants, the disorder is much more likely to affect middle-aged and older adults.\n* **Sex:** Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is more likely to affect men than women.\n* **Smoking:** Far more smokers and former smokers develop pulmonary fibrosis than do people who have never smoked. Pulmonary fibrosis can occur in patients with emphysema.\n* **Certain occupations:** You have an increased risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis if you work in mining, farming or construction or if you're exposed to pollutants known to damage your lungs.\n* **Cancer treatments:** Having radiation treatments to your chest or using certain chemotherapy drugs can increase your risk of pulmonary fibrosis.\n* **Genetic factors:** Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, and genetic factors may be a component.\n[source](https:\/\/www.lungsandyou.com\/facts\/ipf-risk-factors)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n<!-- <br\/><br\/> -->\n## Complications\n\n* **High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension):** Unlike systemic high blood pressure, this condition affects only the arteries in your lungs. It begins when the smallest arteries and capillaries are compressed by scar tissue, causing increased resistance to blood flow in your lungs.This in turn raises pressure within the pulmonary arteries and the lower right heart chamber (right ventricle). Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious illnesses that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal.\n\n* **Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale):** This serious condition occurs when your heart's lower right chamber (ventricle) has to pump harder than usual to move blood through partially blocked pulmonary arteries.\n* **Respiratory failure:** This is often the last stage of chronic lung disease. It occurs when blood oxygen levels fall dangerously low.\n* **Lung cancer:** Long-standing pulmonary fibrosis also increases your risk of developing lung cancer.\n* **Lung complications:** As pulmonary fibrosis progresses, it may lead to complications such as blood clots in the lungs, a collapsed lung or lung infections.\n","2b9dbd2f":"## Observations\nIt seems that different patients have different parameters setup in their image capturing device, specially image position and pixel spacing.

","23ebde16":"## Read DICOM Files\n### What is a DICOM file?\nA DICOM file is an image saved in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. It contains an image from a medical scan, such as an ultrasound or MRI. DICOM files may also include identification data for patients so that the image is linked to a specific individual. The DICOM format was developed by the NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association). It was designed for the exchanging and viewing of medical images, such as CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound images.\n","13456ae4":"# I am not an specialist in Pulmonary Fibrosis.

Months later you were finally diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a disorder with no known cause and no known cure, created by scarring of the lungs. If that happened to you, you would want to know your prognosis. That\u2019s where a troubling disease becomes frightening for the patient: outcomes can range from long-term stability to rapid deterioration, but doctors aren\u2019t easily able to tell where an individual may fall on that spectrum. Your help, and data science, may be able to aid in this prediction, which would dramatically help both patients and clinicians.\n\n\n\n[Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC)](https:\/\/www.osicild.org\/) is a **not-for-profit, co-operative effort between academia, industry and philanthropy**. The group enables rapid advances in the fight against **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)**, **fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs)**, and other respiratory diseases, including emphysematous conditions. Its mission is to bring together radiologists, clinicians and computational scientists from around the world to improve imaging-based treatments.\n\n&nbsp;\n<!-- <br\/><br\/> -->\n\n**Common difficulties in treating lung diseases**\n* Even with access to a CT-scan it is difficult to identify lung disease.\n* Varied prognosis to different lung diseases create additional difficulties in clinical treatment. \n* Patients become anxious with fibrosis-related symptoms as it is often unclear what is causing problem in the first place. \n\n**In this competition, you\u2019ll:**\n* Predict a patient\u2019s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs.\n* Determine lung function based on output from a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled;\n* Challenge to use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.\n\n**Goals:**\n* Patients and their families would better understand their prognosis when they are first diagnosed with this incurable lung disease;\n* improved severity detection would positively impact treatment trial design and accelerate the clinical development of novel treatments.\n\nBefore diving into the competition, let's have a look at pulmonary fibrosis, its causes, symptoms and complications and other non cs stuffs. Though I am not a medical specialist, I collected bits and pieces from here and there and put together in this notebook. If something is not right, please comment so that all are benifitted from that knowledge.  "}}
