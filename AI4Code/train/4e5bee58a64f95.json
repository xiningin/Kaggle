Next, however, we'll turn to a real-world application where this process is necessary.","340ac7f7":"## Bettencourt & Ribeiro's Approach\n\nEvery day, we learn how many more people have COVID-19. This new case count gives us a clue about the current value of $R_t$. We also, figure that the value of $R_t$ today is related to the value of $R_{t-1}$ (yesterday's value) and every previous value of $R_{t-m}$ for that matter.\n\nWith these insights, the authors use [Bayes' rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bayes%27_theorem) to update their beliefs about the true value of $R_t$ based on how many new cases have been reported each day.\n\nThis is Bayes' Theorem as we'll use it:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k)=\\frac{P(k|R_t)\\cdot P(R_t)}{P(k)} $$\n\nThis says that, having seen $k$ new cases, we believe the distribution of $R_t$ is equal to:\n\n- The __likelihood__ of seeing $k$ new cases given $R_t$ times ...\n- The __prior__ beliefs of the value of $P(R_t)$ without the data ...\n- divided by the probability of seeing this many cases in general.\n\nThis is for a single day. To make it iterative: every day that passes, we use yesterday's prior $P(R_{t-1})$ to estimate today's prior $P(R_t)$. We will assume an uncorrelated Gaussian process, so $P(R_t|R_{t-1})=\\mathcal{N}(R_{t-1}, \\sigma)$, where $\\sigma$ is a hyperparameter (see below on how we estimate $\\sigma$). So on day one:\n\n$$ P(R_1|k) \\propto P(R_0)\\cdot P(k_1|R_1)$$\n\nOn day two:\n\n$$ P(R_2|k) \\propto P(R_0)\\cdot P(k_2|R_2)\\cdot P(k_1|R_1) $$\n\netc.\n\n### Choosing a Likelihood Function $P\\left(k_t|R_t\\right)$\n\nA likelihood function function says how likely we are to see $k$ new cases, given a value of $R_t$.\n\nAny time you need to model 'arrivals' over some time period of time, statisticians like to use the [Poisson Distribution](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poisson_distribution).

The goal is to combine the information we have about previous days with the current day. To do this, we use Bayes' theorem.\n\n### Performing the Bayesian Update\n\nTo perform the Bayesian update, we need to multiply the likelihood by the prior (which is just the previous day's likelihood without our Gaussian process) to get the posteriors. Let's do that using the cumulative product of each successive day:","a6645ef2":"The Poisson distribution says that if you think you're going to have $\\lambda$ cases per day, you'll probably get that many, plus or minus some variation based on chance.\n\nBut in our case, we know there have been $k$ cases and we need to know what value of $\\lambda$ is most likely. In order to do this, we fix $k$ in place while varying $\\lambda$. __This is called the likelihood function.__\n\nFor example, imagine we observe $k=20$ new cases, and we want to know how likely each $\\lambda$ is:","4898966c":"Notice how on Day 1, our posterior matches Day 1's likelihood from above? That's because we have no information other than that day. However, when we update the prior using Day 2's information, you can see the curve has moved left, but not nearly as left as the likelihood for Day 2 from above. This is because Bayesian updating uses information from both days and effectively averages the two. Since Day 3's likelihood is in between the other two, you see a small shift to the right, but more importantly: a narrower distribution. We're becoming __more__ confident in our believes of the true value of $R_t$.\n\nFrom these posteriors, we can answer important questions such as \"What is the most likely value of $R_t$ each day?\"","828070ee":"# Estimating COVID-19's $R_t$ in Real-Time\nUpdate from Hendratno: \n* August 4, 2020: Regarding the use of this Rt, it is necessary to pay attention to the press statement from Prof. Wiku Adisasmito, Spokesperson of the COVID-19 Handling Task Force (Jubir Satgas Penanganan COVID-19), on August 4, 2020 ( https:\/\/twitter.com\/BNPB_Indonesia\/status\/1290544238392819712 ), with the following quote: \"We would like to say that in the zoning map using estimations of Rt or effective reproduction number cannot be used at this time in Indonesia due to imperfections of the data obtained to date. Rt can only be used if the laboratory examination results can be reported ideally 1 x 24 hours.

Then other factors due to the recording of data and the onset of symptoms - for the medical language \u2013 which are not reported, as well as different calculation methods, result in Rt not being reliable or used.

It's the number of people who become infected per infectious person at time $t$. The most well-known version of this number is the basic reproduction number: $R_0$ when $t=0$. However, $R_0$ is a single measure that does not adapt with changes in behavior and restrictions.\n\nAs a pandemic evolves, increasing restrictions (or potential releasing of restrictions) changes $R_t$. Knowing the current $R_t$ is essential. When $R\\gg1$, the pandemic will spread through a large part of the population. If $R_t<1$, the pandemic will slow quickly before it has a chance to infect many people. The lower the $R_t$: the more manageable the situation. In general, any $R_t<1$ means things are under control.\n\nThe value of $R_t$ helps us in two ways. (1) It helps us understand how effective our measures have been controlling an outbreak and (2) it gives us vital information about whether we should increase or reduce restrictions based on our competing goals of economic prosperity and human safety. [Well-respected epidemiologists argue](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/06\/opinion\/coronavirus-end-social-distancing.html) that tracking $R_t$ is the only way to manage through this crisis.\n\nYet, today, we don't yet use $R_t$ in this way. In fact, the only real-time measure I've seen has been for [Hong Kong](https:\/\/covid19.sph.hku.hk\/dashboard). More importantly, it is not useful to understand $R_t$ at a national level. Instead, to manage this crisis effectively, we need a local (state, county and\/or city) granularity of $R_t$.\n\nWhat follows is a solution to this problem at the US State level. It's a modified version of a solution created by [Bettencourt & Ribeiro 2008](https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0002185) to estimate real-time $R_t$ using a Bayesian approach. While this paper estimates a static $R$ value, here we introduce a process model with Gaussian noise to estimate a time-varying $R_t$.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or improvments feel free to get in touch: [hello@systrom.com](mailto:hello@systrom.com). And if it's not entirely clear, I'm not an epidemiologist. At the same time, data is data, and statistics are statistics and this is based on work by well-known epidemiologists so you can calibrate your beliefs as you wish. In the meantime, I hope you can learn something new as I did by reading through this example. Feel free to take this work and apply it elsewhere \u2013 internationally or to counties in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, a huge thanks to [Frank Dellaert](http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/fdellaert\/) who suggested the addition of the Gaussian process and to [Adam Lerer](http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/adamlerer\/) who implemented the changes. Not only did I learn something new, it made the model much more responsive.","9b72ffda":"### The Result\n\nBelow you can see every day (row) of the posterior distribution plotted simultaneously. The posteriors start without much confidence (wide) and become progressively more confident (narrower) about the true value of $R_t$","e4cb32ed":"# Real-World Application to IDN Data\n\n### Setup\n\nLoad IDN state case data from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hendratno\/covid19-indonesia#covid_19_indonesia_time_series_all.csv dataset","b99df189":"### Running the Algorithm\n\n#### Choosing $\\sigma$ for the Gaussian Process\n\n> Note: you can safely skip this section if you trust that we chose the right value of $\\sigma$ for the gaussian process below. Otherwise, read on.\n\nThe original approach simply selects yesterday's posterior as today's prior. While intuitive, doing so doesn't allow for our belief that the value of $R_t$ has likely changed from yesterday. To allow for that change, we apply Gaussian noise to the prior distribution with some standard deviation $\\sigma$. The higher $\\sigma$ the more noise and the more we will expect the value of $R_t$ to drift each day. Interestingly, applying noise on noise iteratively means that there will be a natural decay of distant posteriors. This approach has the same effect of windowing, but is more robust and doesn't arbitrarily forget posteriors after a certain time like my previous approach.\n\nHowever, there's still an arbitrary choice: what should $\\sigma$ be? Adam Lerer pointed out that we can use the process of maximum likelihood to inform our choice. Here's how it works:\n\nMaximum likelihood says that we'd like to choose a $\\sigma$ that maximizes the likelihood of seeing our data $k$: $P(k|\\sigma)$. Since $\\sigma$ is a fixed value, let's leave it out of the notation, so we're trying to maximize $P(k)$ over all choices of $\\sigma$.\n\nSince $P(k)=P(k_0,k_1,\\ldots,k_t)=P(k_0)P(k_1)\\ldots P(k_t)$ we need to define $P(k_t)$. It turns out this is the denominator of Bayes rule:\n\n$$P(R_t|k_t) = \\frac{P(k_t|R_t)P(R_t)}{P(k_t)}$$\n\nTo calculate it, we notice that the numerator is actually just the joint distribution of $k$ and $R$:\n\n$$ P(k_t,R_t) =  P(k_t|R_t)P(R_t) $$\n\nWe can marginalize the distribution over $R_t$ to get $P(k_t)$:\n\n$$ P(k_t) = \\sum_{R_{t}}{P(k_t|R_t)P(R_t)} $$\n\nSo, if we sum the distribution of the numerator over all values of $R_t$, we get $P(k_t)$. And since we're calculating that anyway as we're calculating the posterior, we'll just keep track of it separately.\n\nSince we're looking for the value of $\\sigma$ that maximizes $P(k)$ overall, we actually want to maximize: \n\n$$\\prod_{t,i}{p(k_{ti})}$$\n\nwhere $t$ are all times and $i$ is each state.\n\nSince we're multiplying lots of tiny probabilities together, it can be easier (and less error-prone) to take the $\\log$ of the values and add them together. Remember that $\\log{ab}=\\log{a}+\\log{b}$. And since logarithms are monotonically increasing, maximizing the sum of the $\\log$ of the probabilities is the same as maximizing the product of the non-logarithmic probabilities for any choice of $\\sigma$.\n\n### Function for Calculating the Posteriors\n\nTo calculate the posteriors we follow these steps:\n1. Calculate $\\lambda$ - the expected arrival rate for every day's poisson process\n2. Calculate each day's likelihood distribution over all possible values of $R_t$\n3. Calculate the Gaussian process matrix based on the value of $\\sigma$ we discussed above\n4. Calculate our initial prior because our first day does not have a previous day from which to take the posterior\n  - Based on [info from the cdc](https:\/\/wwwnc.cdc.gov\/eid\/article\/26\/7\/20-0282_article) we will choose a Gamma with mean 4.\n5. Loop from day 1 to the end, doing the following:\n  - Calculate the prior by applying the Gaussian to yesterday's prior.\n  - Apply Bayes' rule by multiplying this prior and the likelihood we calculated in step 2.\n  - Divide by the probability of the data (also Bayes' rule)"}}
