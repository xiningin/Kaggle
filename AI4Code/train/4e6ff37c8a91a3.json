Vulnerable groups such as older people, children and adolescents, particularly girls, LGBTI people, persons with disabilities, are hardest hit with the effects of the pandemic and their access to preventative measures and treatment for COVID-19 and other essential health services is more difficult.https:\/\/www.who.int\/health-cluster\/news-and-events\/news\/GHRP-revision-july-2020\/en\/","f25aa999":"Data fields:\n\nADM1_PCODE: Administrative level 1 (various types) P-code\n\nADM0_PCODE: Administrative level 0 (country or territory) P-code\n\nalpha_3: ISO 3166-1 Alpha 3 country or territory identifier\n\nADM0_REF: Administrative level 0 (country or territory) reference name (Latin script without special characters)\n\nADM1_REF: Administrative level 1 (various types) reference name (Latin script without special characters)\n\nPopulation: Most recent available total population.","f01dca0d":"#The Global Health Cluster\n\nThe Global Health Cluster has contributed to the revision of the GHRP, advocating for the needs of affected people and implementing partners across the 28 country and 2 regional Health Clusters.
