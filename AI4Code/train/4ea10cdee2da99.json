He wants to tweet this along with some choice emojis, but, as it looks right now, his followers will probably find it confusing. He's asked if you can help him make the following changes:\n\n1. Add the title \"Results of 500 slot machine pulls\"\n2. Make the y-axis start at 0. \n3. Add the label \"Balance\" to the y-axis\n\nAfter calling `type(graph)` you see that Jimmy's graph is of type `matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot`. Hm, that's a new one.

One thing we might want to do with this type is overload the comparison operators like `>` and `<=` so that we could use them to check whether one hand beats another. e.g. it'd be cool if we could do this:\n\n```python\n>>> hand1 = BlackjackHand(['K', 'A'])\n>>> hand2 = BlackjackHand(['7', '10', 'A'])\n>>> hand1 > hand2\nTrue\n```\n\nWell, we're not going to do all that in this question (defining custom classes is a bit beyond the scope of these lessons), but the code we're asking you to write in the function below is very similar to what we'd have to write if we were defining our own `BlackjackHand` class.
