Kills : Perhaps the most important part of the game","63479574":"Now that the data's loaded, let's take a moment to explore it. Here are a few thoughts before exploring the data.\n\n* The final place prediction is pretty obviously related to the **no of people killed**. \n* Next, we can also take a look at **no of assists**, and various **killing techniques** (DBNOs, damages, headshots, etc). Although, they ought to be less important than the plain no of kills\n* The **distance** a player has covered. Well, if they are able to travel here and there without getting themselves killed, then that's some skill! Walking + Driving + *Swimmimg*\n*  **Boosts**, **heals** and **revivals**. Only on Duo and Squad modes.\n* The game is played in three modes. Solo, Duo, Squad (upto 4). And what matches are played in which mode.\n* Weapons maybe.","c01edcd8":"Okay, the more the killings, the more damage is caused by the player.

Thus, kills are strongly related to winning.","5a3be70c":"Thus, more assists tend to favour the chances of a better rank, but this relation is not quite as prominent.\n\n### 2.3 DBNOs (Down But Not Outs)\nDBNOs are different from Assists.
