So let's set up our figure.","515cb261":"Oooohh, that was easy. In just a few lines of code we created a decent looking visualisation. And maybe some of you already noticed, it already contains a little interaction, just click on the figure and move around.\n\n**Now I want more!** I like to see more information, especially if we had a true heart disease. This is as easy as the previous example ;)\n\nLet's start with a new prepare data, set-up figure, connect to and draw the data circle.\nThis time, we distinguish between actual appearance of a heart disease and a false positive.\n\nJust to show, that pandas DataFrames work to, I neglect to create ColumnDataSources for now.","90d3243f":"So far we set-up our figure and connected our data to draw it.

Never the less, Bokeh comes with its own data format called **ColumnDataSource**. To unleash Bokeh's full interaction superpowers the input data needs to be of type ColumnDataSource. So in my opinion it is a good habit to work with ColumnDataSource right away, even for simple visualizations.","23bd34a5":"As we just saw, things can get hard to see when we add information to our visualizations. Interactions are a nice way to filter the information on what we are interested.\n\nAdding simple interactions in Bokeh is easy and needs just a little alteration to our previous code.\n\nAgain, we start over with our prepare data, set up figure, connect and draw data circle. ","fe0061b1":"The first step is to load all libraries we are going to use in the sections following. Without data, there won't be anything to visualize and interact, so we will import the usual suspects *Numpy* and *Pandas*.\n\nEvery visualization more or less contains the same steps, which are also reflected in the bokeh modules shown here. \n1. First of all, the figure needs to be set up: \n    * from bokeh.plotting import figure\n2. The data needs to be connected and drawn to the figure: \n    * from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, HoverTool\n3. Orchestrate the way you want to layout your figure(s). This is important if you create more than one figure\n    * from bokeh.layouts import row, column, gridplot\n4.

Like muting points, this is also really easy to do with Bokeh. The key point is the above mentioned ColumnDataSource. In creating a ColumnDataSource out of our pandas DataFrame, we can share information between different figures. We also add tools which provide a simple way to get interactions like selection, pan or zoom.","1aa741c1":"# 2.
