Another involves the generator and discriminator oscillating during training,rather than converging to a fixed point. In addition, if one agent becomes much more powerful than the other, the learning signal to the other agent becomes useless, and the system does not learn.\nTo train GANs many tricks must be employed,one such method is using Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks as discussed in a research paper published in 2016 (link in the references).\n\n\n","6a94a175":"noise generated using np.random.normal is given to as input to the generator.

Rather the network is trained in two different phases,the first phase is for training the discriminator and updating the weights appropriately and in the next step the generator is trained while the discriminator training is disabled.\n\n**Phase 1**\nDuring phase one of training the generator is fed random data(in the form of a distribution) as noise. The generator creates some random images which are given to the discriminator. The discriminator also takes input from dataset of real images. \nThe discriminator learns to distinguish the real data from the fake ones by learning or assessing features from it's inputs. The discriminator outputs some probability and difference between the predicted results and the actual results are backpropagated through the network and the weights of the discriminator is updated. \nRemember during this phase, the backpropagation stops at the end of the discriminator and the generator is not trained or updated.\n\n\n**Phase 2**\nIn this phase, the generator produced batch of images are directly given as input to the discriminator. The real images are not given this time to the discriminator. The generator learns by tricking the discriminator into it outputting false positives. The discriminator outputs probabilities which are assessed against the actual results and the weights of of the generator are updated through backpropagation.\nRemember here during backpropagation, the discriminator weights should not be updated and kept as they were before.\n\n![Train1_t82vgL9KcDVpT4JqCb9Q4Q.png](attachment:Train1_t82vgL9KcDVpT4JqCb9Q4Q.png)","5559ee35":"**NOTE**  after normalizing it is multiplied with 2 and substracted from 1 such that it ranges from (-1,1) because in DCGANs the last layer generative model activation is tanh which range is (-1,1) unlike sigmoid ranging (0,1) .","b1df4628":"# **Generative Adverserial Networks**\n\n\nGenerative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other (thus the \u201cadversarial\u201d) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation.\n\n\n![Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Framework.png](attachment:Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Framework.png)\n\n\n\nWhile most deep generative models are trained by maximizing log likelihood or a lower bound on log likelihood, GANs take a radically different approach that does not require inference or explicit calculation of the data likelihood. Instead, two models are used to solve a minimax game: a generator which samples data, and a discriminator which classifies the data as real or generated.In theory these models are capable of modeling an arbitrarily complex probability distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","cd99d56a":"# **Objective**\n\nThe objective of this notebook is to introduce beginners to the underlying concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the most intuitive way possible. The aim is to describe the working of such network without delving deep into the complex mathematics associated and in a more practical way such that the viewer can develop his own simple GAN. \n\nA simple GAN is first constructed here with only hidden dense layers and tries to output meaningful images. The output is analysed discovering one particular issue which is commonplace in simple GANs.

So discriminative algorithms map features to labels. They are concerned solely with that correlation.One the other way,loosely speaking,generative algorithms do the opposite. Instead of predicting a label given certain features, they attempt to predict features given a certain label.\n\nWhile training they both start together from scratch and the generator learn to shape the random distribition through the training epochs.","17887d00":"# **Working Principle**\n\n**Generative** network is fed noise may be in the form a random distribution and generates fake data from the noise. The fake data from the generator is input to the discriminator. Once the training is complete, the generator should be able to generate real like data from the noises.\n\nThe interesting fact here is that the generator learns to produce meaningful images without even actually looking at the image.\n\n![1_CkMMefLPqcEKPuuPLZY2_Agg.png](attachment:1_CkMMefLPqcEKPuuPLZY2_Agg.png)\n\n**Discriminator** or the adversarial network works as the opponent to the generator. It is basically a  classifier or discriminator whose function is to distinguish between two different classes of data. Here the classes are real data (labelled as 1) and the fake data the generator produces (labelled as 0).\n\n","06a71719":"# **Loading and Preprocessing the data**","9277e7e3":"# **Let's begin**","15400630":"**Generator producing images from noise**"}}
