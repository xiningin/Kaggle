It should be stressed that both must be estimated on **the training set**, otherwise it will cause data leakage and poor generalization. Luckily, pipelines ensure this, even when performing cross validation.  \n\nAlso be sure to include the indicator for missing values, as it adds some information for the algorithm in cases, where the chosen imputation strategy was not entirely appropriate. For example, `PoolQC` has the most frequent value `Gd`, which will replaces NA values with strategy set to `most_frequent`, but that is obviously wrong, as most houses don't have a pool!
