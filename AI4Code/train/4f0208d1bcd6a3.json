It seems like there is a peak of total incidents during the summer, however, due to the fluctuation in the output, it is hard to notice. I did a rolling average with n = 100 (100 days) to make a more clear and smooth line that shows the pattern. Though the peaks might make it look like most crimes happen in the fall, remember, this line is a rolling average with n = 100. The peak is caused by the high values in the previous periods, thus caused by the high values during the summer.\n\nAlso, the number of incidents seems to stay consistent over time, however, there also looks like a small increasing trend in the data, in which I will create a quick linear regression line to visualize the trend.","86b29c70":"From what can be seen above, most crime incidents are traffic accidents.
