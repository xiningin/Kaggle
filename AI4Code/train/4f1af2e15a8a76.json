If we take for example a 5-fold stacking , we first split the training data into 5 folds. Then we will do 5 iterations. In each iteration,  we train every base model on 4 folds and predict on the remaining fold (holdout fold). \n\nSo, we will be sure, after 5 iterations , that the entire data is used to get out-of-folds predictions that we will then use as \nnew feature to train our meta-model in the step 4.\n\nFor the prediction part , We average the predictions of  all base models on the test data  and used them as **meta-features**  on which, the final prediction is done with the meta-model.\n","201c5698":"**Averaged base models score**","8a936b56":"- **Electrical** : It has one NA value.
