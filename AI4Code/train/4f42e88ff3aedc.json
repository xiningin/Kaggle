We learned about Bokeh and how we can create dashboards using it, Bokeh is highly interactive and visually appealing. We can use this knowledge to create our own dashboards and visualize it.\n\nFor learning more about bokeh which is a library for Visualization other than Matplotlib, seaborn visit this [link](https:\/\/docs.bokeh.org\/en\/latest\/index.html) which is the documentation of Bokeh.","81ccfec9":"Next we will design the Layout and show these images in a single dashboard","03433467":"In this Kernel we will discuss:\n\n1.
