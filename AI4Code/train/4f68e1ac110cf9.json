It was first identified in 1936 in Tanzania, and has spread to other coastal areas of East Africa, from Kenya to Mozambique. Recently, it was found that two distinct viruses are responsible for the disease: cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV).\n\n**Symptoms:**\n\n* CBSD is characterized by severe chlorosis and necrosis on infected leaves, giving them a yellowish, mottled appearance.\n* Chlorosis may be associated with the veins, spanning from the mid vein, secondary and tertiary veins, or rather in blotches unconnected to veins.\n* Leaf symptoms vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. \n* The growing conditions (i.e. altitude, rainfall quantity), plant age, and the virus species account for these differences. \n* Brown streaks may appear on the stems of the cassava plant. Also, a dry brown-black necrotic rot of the cassava tuber exists, which may progress from a small lesion to the whole root. \n* Finally, the roots can become constricted due to the tuber rot, stunting growth","94c9f012":"### Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) Samples","daef1f0d":"### Healty Samples ","ff8b7ceb":"<img alt=\"Profit-making idea: Industrialisation of cassava one of Africa's biggest  opportunities\" class=\"n3VNCb\" src=\"https:\/\/www.howwemadeitinafrica.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/PMI-Philafrica-cassava-1200x630-1.jpg\" data-noaft=\"1\" jsname=\"HiaYvf\" jsaction=\"load:XAeZkd;\" style=\"width: 1024px; height: 2040; margin: 0px;\">","806ad2f2":"# Converting from BGR to RGB","f13b2db5":"As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields.\n\nExisting methods of disease detection require farmers to solicit the help of government-funded agricultural experts to visually inspect and diagnose the plants. This suffers from being labor-intensive, low-supply and costly. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints, since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth.\n\nSo, in this competition through the training set we have, we will try to classify which disease type cassava caught with the help of image processing techniques and AI.\n","45424bc4":"### Cassava Green Mottle (CGM) Samples","82208f6a":"### Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) Samples","9b28ffe8":"# Let's look at the types of diseases:","8c208fa2":"# What is Cassava ?
