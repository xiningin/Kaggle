Jupyter notebooks can be worked on in non-linear fashion and this is one of its main strengths. However, this non-linearity can also cause inconsistent notebooks if the author is not careful. According to a recent study by [Datalore, 36% of jupyter notebooks on Github are inconsistent](https:\/\/blog.jetbrains.com\/datalore\/2020\/12\/17\/we-downloaded-10-000-000-jupyter-notebooks-from-github-this-is-what-we-learned\/).\n\n\nThere are so many different IDE's mentioned. Some IDEs are better than others with regards to the task at hand. So, is there a difference in how many IDEs a respondent uses on a regular basis w.r.t to the IRU21 vs non-IRU21 distinction?

Though realized *officially* only within this decade, data science has been delivering impact for a very long time, of course in less glamorous forms than the cloak it wears today. It is a well-propagated idea that this discipline holds the key to how the world will function in the future (Davenport and Patil, 2012). In fact, every field known to mankind from medicine to education and from crime to conservation will be recipients of the high-impact delivering skills of being able to make decisions with data(many of them already do so). \n\nHowever, I believe that the most important component required to realize this dream of a data-driven future, would not be *the discipline itself*. The future of data science, like any other growing field is dependent on *those that work in it* in the future. Or in other words, those that currently refer to themselves as *data science aspirants* currrently hold the key to furthering this field. \n\nOn those grounds, it then becomes important to understand the current state of these aspirants.\n\nIn this report, I present an attempt to explore the Kaggle survey responses of **young data science aspirants from India** and to understand their current state in data science by dissecting my finds across multiple themes.\n\n> \"We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build the youth for the future\" - Franklin D.

So, the question is what is this goal?\n\nA reasonable hypothesis based on the context of this notebook would be that the *IRU21 respondent's goal is to become a data scientist*. However, owing to the fact that a data scientist is not a universally well-defined term (Donoho, 2017), let us assume that the actual goal is to work in a *position where the principles of data science and machine learning are used regularly*. As per the figure above, 8 roles(excluding Student) qualify for this condition. \n\nFor the purpose of more reliable analysis, I have chosen 5 roles from the original 8 as aspirational employment positions for an IRU21 respondent(these are depicted in red). Thus, **I am making an assumption here that it is highly likely that a typical IRU21 respondent will want to become one of the 5 roles in red.**\n\nSo, this section now essentially will take on a form of comparison between the trends of respondents working in any of these 5 roles and the trends of IRU21 respondents. This could help identify key differences between the two groups and thus identify ways in which IRU21 respondents can become more like the former. \n\n\ud83d\udcdd **Note**  \nFor the sake of analysis, **Non-IRU21 respondents have now further been filtered into only those respondents whose most recent employment at the time of the respective survey was one of Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Research Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer or Business Analyst.**","739e31d5":"\ud83d\udca1 **Insights**\n\n- Python still wins (duh!).

While this seems odd at first, there could be a logical explanation to this. C++ is what IRU21 respondents generally study as a part of their curriculum in undergraduate programming courses. But this is again open to debate. Also, the difference between the counts of those choosing either language are not too large, contrary to the non-IRU21 community.\n  \nThe above two graphs only talk about recommendations.
