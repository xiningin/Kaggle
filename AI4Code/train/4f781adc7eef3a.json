These thoughts will guide our data cleanup and feature engineering.\n\n|Column name | Description | Proposed plan|\n|---|---|---|\n|**PassengerId** | Numeric values are 100% unique and vary from 1 to 891.| Use as **index** column. |\n|**Pclass** | Passengers are each assigned a numeric class: first (1), second (2), or third (3) class.  There are no missing values.  Allocation to classes is 55% in 3rd, 21% in 2nd, and 24% in 1st.| **Use as a feature**, could be a powerful proxy for socio-economic class and\/or cabin location.  Watch out for class imbalance.|\n|**Name** | Passenger names, 100% unique.  One could consider some derived features based on names. | **Not promising** as a first area of focus, ignore for now. |\n|**Sex** | Categorical variable with values 'male' and 'female'.  There are no missing values.  Allocation to genders is 65% male and 35% female. | **Transform to boolean column is_male and use as feature**.  Watch out for class imbalance. |\n| **Age** | Numeric values varying from 0.42 (a baby under one year old) to 80 (a senior).  There are 177 missing values (20% missing). | **Fill missing values** and **test as a feature** given potential that age could be a strong predictor of survival. |\n|**Ticket** | Categorial variable, no missing values, 76% of ticket numbers are unique.  Ticket numbers vary from 3 to 18 characters in length with a mean length of about 7.  Values can include characters and digits (e.g. 'CA 2144'), just digits (e.g. '382652'), and probably many other forms. | **Not promising** as a first area of focus, ignore for now. |\n|**Fare** | Numeric value from 0 to 512 with a mean of 32; no missing values, though 15 values are zero.  Stronger density at low fares, long tail at higher fares (exponential distribution appearance). Could be a potential proxy for socio-economic class (along with Pclass) or proximity to exits (assuming perhaps lower socio-economic class passengers might be placed at lower decks \/ further from exits).| **1. Investigate 15 passengers with zero fares and 2. Test fare as a feature**. |\n|**Cabin** | Categorical variable, 77% of cabin numbers are missing and there are 148 unique cabin numbers amongst the remainder.  Value is usually a letter followed by a number (e.g. 'E101', 'G6', 'B22'), though sometimes two or more cabins are listed for a given passenger (e.g. 'B96 B98', 'C23 C25 C27').  One might glean something about the passenger survivorship from this data (e.g. the deck number as an indicator of proximity to exits \/ life boats). | Given the large number of missing values, ** not promising** as a first area of focus, ignore for now. |\n|**Embarked** | Categorical variable giving the port of embarkation ('C' for Cherbourg, 'Q' for Queenstown, 'S' for Southampton).  72% of values are 'S', 19% are 'C', 9% are 'Q', and 0.2% are missing (2 missing values). | Worth **evaluating as a feature**, after filling missing values with S (the most common value).

Category includes brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, husband, and\/or wife.  None are missing, mean value is 0.52, and values range from 0 to 8.  68% of passengers have 0, 24% have 1, 3% have 2, and decreasing numbers have from 3 to 8. | **Reduce to binary has_sibsp variable and test as a feature**, be aware of poor class balance even after reducing categories. |\n|**Parch** | Numeric value giving the number of parents and\/or children aboard.  Category includes mother, father, daughter, son, stepdaughter, and stepson.  0% are missing, mean value is 0.38, and values range from 0 to 6.  76% have 0, 13% have 1, 9% have 2, 0.6% have 3, and decreasing numbers have from 4 to 6. | **Reduce to binary has_parch variable and test as a feature**, be aware of poor class balance even after reducing categories.|","01c6c795":"This notebook explores the [Kaggle Titanic](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic) disaster survival dataset and evaluates which features may be most useful in a predictive model of survival.\n\nThe test dataset test.csv is maintained as a hold-out set for final validation and is not used for any other purpose, including filling missing values in the training data.","021104d4":"Figure: In general, there's not an obvious relationship between Fare paid and survivorship for most Pclass categories for either gender.
