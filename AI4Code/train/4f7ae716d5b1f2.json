These interactions are Views, Shares, Likes, and Comments. Data is included for these countries with up to 200 listed trending videos per day: Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, India, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and United States\n\nThis notebook focuses on analyzing interaction trends between videos of different categories and countries. Observations of patterns are noted below each graph. Some of the guiding questions were:\n\n* What are trends among video categories?\n* How are Likes and Comments related to Views? \n* How do trending lists differ between countries?\n* What are some popular tags?\n\nBelow is the source link to the Tableau graphs featured:\nhttps:\/\/public.tableau.com\/profile\/brandon.li4427#!\/vizhome\/YoutubeTrends_16164760836470\/CategoryLikesViews\n\nData source is from a Kaggle dataset called Trending YouTube Video Statistics:\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasnaek\/youtube-new\n\nData preprocessing was done in R, script is also posted on my GitHub page:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/bli725\/YoutubeTrends","1bd67f7a":"Our final visual displays the top tags for each country based on an interaction type.\n\nEnglish is still the default language for many countries except for Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Russia where tags in a different language.\n\nTags that are popular are typically generic and therefore applicable to many different types of videos. In English speaking countries, popular tags are 2018, 2017, funny, comedy, and Pop just to name a few.\n\n* India has a higher count of TV related tags but still have Funny\/Comedy as leading in other metrics like the other English nations\n* Japan and Korea both have BTS related tags(e.g. BIGHIT or \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) leading in Views, Likes, and Comments. BTS tags still maintain a large share of the top interaction ranks in all countries and holds the #5 and #6 rank for tags overall. For example, BTS tags hold the top 6 ranks for Comments in France.\n* However when grouping by Video Count, Japan and Korea feature more generic tags: Japan's highest count tags are 'cuisine' , 'cat', and 'news'; Korea is similar but more political with their top tags by count being \u2018eating room\u2019, \u2018Moon Jae-in\u2019(current president), \u2018news\u2019, \u2018Kim Jong-un\u2019, and \u2018Trump'","1cf34947":"Our first chart is a Pie Chart that shows the breakdown of how each category is represented per country when comparing Views, Likes, and Comments. Some trends are:\n* The Dominant categories are Music and Entertainment, which take around 50-70% of the Likes and Views. Other Categories tended to take less than 10% each.\n* Great Britain's Music category is sucessful in Views, representing 73.08% of the country's Views, but not as sucessful in Comments where Music only represented 52.90%.\n* Japan and Korea have the inverse: while Views for Music are only 20.57% and 24.24% respectfully of each nation's total Views, Likes and Comments took larger proportions of the country's pie for both countries. \n* Russia's Pie Chart is much more balanced than other countries since their Music and Entertainment sections are less than 50% combined for Views, Likes, and Comments. The People & Blogs and Comedy categories showed a larger share in Russia, about 10-15% based the interaction type.\n* Science & Technology category in India had a much higher proportion of Comments than in other countries, it accounted for 13.85% while overall the category held 4.86% of all Comments. However, this popularity of the Science & Technology category in India only exists for Comments; Likes and Views are not above average.","13e4f6b4":"This chart we see the interaction statistics separated by category and filtered by country. Some trends are:\n* Likes per View is often around 3.0% to 5.0% while Comments per View is often around 0.5% to 1.0%\n* Mexico and Russia have an overall above average amount of interaction across the board. Almost all categories appear to have at least 20-30% more Likes per View and Comments per View.\n* United States and Great Britain were overall very low in their interaction numbers.\n* JP and KR had very low interaction rates for almost every category except for Music, which had about 20% more Likes and Comments per View.\n* While Comments per View were extremely low in Korea overall, Gaming videos were the exception and had about 3x as many Comments per View compared to Korea's other categories.\n* India had two dominant categories for interaction ratios, Pets & Animals and Science & Technology. Science & Technology had the best Comment per View stat for any category in any country at 2.28%.\n* Movies, Shows and Trailers categories displayed low interaction ratios across all countries.","9850cd15":"# Conclusions\n\n\n> **Category Distribution**\n\nYoutube's trending list attempts variety but a large proportion of video interaction are of Music and Entertainment videos. These two categories will typically account for at least 50% of a country's Views, Likes, Comments, and video count on the trending list while other categories will be under 10%. Some categories are also very underrepresented such as the News & Politics or Shows category only take less than 2% of overall interactions.\n\n> **Interaction Ratios**\n\nVideos generally receive many more Views than Likes or Comments, videos on average receive 41 Views for each Like and 140 Views for each Comment. These interaction ratios vary across country and category and while common video categories tend to have interaction ratios close to average, less popular categories often had interaction ratios that varied widely.\n\nAn example of this is the Science & Technology category in India, which has the highest Comment to View ratio of any category in any country. The most promient Youtuber in this category is Technology Guruji, his high Comment to View ratio skewed the interaction ratio for all of India since this category in India didn't have many videos featured to begin with. We see a similar trend happen for a few other categories that don't feature too many trending videos such as Nonprofit & Activism or Gaming.\n\n> **Popular Tags**\n\nWhile English is the most popular language for video tags, countries like Mexico, Japan, Korea, and Russia featured tags in the native language of the country. The tags that had the most interactions were often generic tags such as 'funny' or '2018'.\n\nAn important observation is that tags related to the Korea Pop group BTS were popular across the world. BTS related tags receive among the highest amount of Likes and Comments in many countries outside of Korea such as France or the United States.","a308a9e4":"This graph models a linear relationship of Likes per Views and Comments per View. Trending videos average 1 Like for every 41 Views and 1 Comment every 140 Views.\n\nMusic videos appeared to be the biggest contributor of top interaction videos(high Views, Likes, or Comments)\n\nSome videos in a category had one of the highest amount of interaction for multiple countries. An example is in News & Politics: the video titled \"LOGAN PAUL RETURNS \ud83d\udcf0 PEW NEWS\ud83d\udcf0\"  had the highest amount of Comments in CA, GB, DE, IN, and RU\n\n* Music videos overall averaged 49 Views per Like but Japan and Korea showed a much lower rate, averaging 11 and 15. \n* Videos by BTS(a Korean Pop group) are likely to appear on the bottom right-hand side of the graph, indicating that these videos receive the most Comments but not the most Views.\n* Gaming videos receive 41 Views per Comment overall while Korea has 7.5 Views per Comment meaning that viewers are almost 6 times more likely to comment in Korea. Bogyeom TV is the top Youtuber for comments in this category.\n* Nonprofits and Activism overall has a strong interaction ratio, averaging 12 Views per Like and 38 Views per Comment.\n* Alexey Navalny videos have the highest interaction numbers in Nonprofits & Activism, his videos are even popular in other countries like CA and DE\n* India's Science & Technology is very high in interactions as well: 3 Comments per View is the best ratio out of any category subgroup; 9.6 for Likes is also very good. Technical Guruji is leading in this category\n* Indian sports featured Dude Perfect's channel as having the most interactions, the top 10 in this category were all comprised of videos from this channel.","138c4a3a":"Our next graph displays the amount of Likes and Comments is average for each category across different countries.\n\nOverall Mexico and Russia are above average in interaction rates while India, Japan, and Korea show lower interaction rates.\n\nAutos & Vehicles, Entertainment, Film & Animation, News & Politics, Shows, and Sports categories generally have below average interaction rates.\n\nShows, Movies, and Trailers categories were underrepresented in the data. Some countries do not have any videos in these categories.\n\nComedy, Education, and Gaming showed high Likes per View but had lower than average Comments per View.\n* Mexico and Russia show a high amount of Likes per View for Autos & Vehicles videos\n* News & Politics in GB have very high numbers of Comments per View, almost double the national average.\n* Music also showed similar patterns with the noticable exception of Japan and Korea which were also above average with their Comments per View.\n* Korea also stood out in its Gaming category, where the the amount of Comments was triple what the national average was.\n* Nonprofits & Activism has very high interaction rates outside of Asia. Likes per View were about 2x as high as national average in countries such as Canada, Denmark, and the US. Comments per View in this category were closer to 6-8x higher in those countries. This category pulled the highest average interaction rate by far in Western countries.\n* Pets & Animals interaction rates are extremely high in India while mostly average everywhere else.\n* Science & Technology is average in most countries except for India and Russia"}}
