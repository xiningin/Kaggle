Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n\nThe best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it\u2019s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).\n\nAt this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.\n\nStay informed:\n\nProtect yourself: advice for the public Myth busters Questions and answers Situation reports All information on the COVID-19 outbreak","c21dc011":"## Import Data","5db340f3":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","8cfdc46e":"# Introduction","33c27751":"Random Forest Failed miserably and got less score there by i used XGboost which boosted my score to 0.00006 \nHere is my notebook on XGboost please refer it and boost your score \nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/eswarchandt\/covid-19-forecasting-xgboost","88866601":"For EDA of covid-19 (week-3) please refer my another notebook https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/eswarchandt\/eda-covid-19-week-3\n\nFor Timeseries Forecasting of Covid-19 (week-3) ARIMA refer my another notebook https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/eswarchandt\/timeseries-forecasting-of-covid-19-week-3-arima\n\nFor Timeseries Forecasting of Covid-19(week-3) Using Prophet refer my another notebook https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/eswarchandt\/timeseries-forecasting-of-covid-19-week-3-prophet\n\nFor day to day track and geospatial analysis of Covid-19 refer my another notebook https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/eswarchandt\/geospatial-analysis-on-covid-19-day-to-day-track\n\nIf you like these notebooks please up vote and keep me motivated","5a857a96":"### Train Confirmed Cases Tree","ca41ef7c":"# MODEL BUILDING"}}
