\n\nRecently open-sourced by Facebook research. It's a very promising tool, that is often a very handy and quick solution to the frustrating **flatline** :P\n\n![FLATLINE](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/fWzyX.jpg)\n\nSure, one could argue that with proper pre-processing and carefully tuning the parameters the above graph would not happen. \n\nBut the truth is that most of us don't either have the patience or the expertise to make it happen.\n\nAlso, there is the fact that in most practical scenarios- there is often a lot of time-series that needs to be predicted.\nEg: This competition. It requires us to predict the next month sales for the **Store - item level combinations** which could be in the thousands.(ie) predict 1000s of parameters!\n\nAnother neat functionality is that it follows the typical **sklearn** syntax.\n\nAt its core, the Prophet procedure is an additive regression model with four main components:\n* A piecewise linear or logistic growth curve trend. Prophet automatically detects changes in trends by selecting changepoints from the data.\n* A yearly seasonal component modeled using Fourier series.\n* A weekly seasonal component using dummy variables.\n* A user-provided list of important holidays.\n\n**Resources for learning more about prophet:**\n* https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=95-HMzxsghY\n* https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/prophet\/docs\/quick_start.html#python-api\n* https:\/\/research.fb.com\/prophet-forecasting-at-scale\/\n* https:\/\/blog.exploratory.io\/is-prophet-better-than-arima-for-forecasting-time-series-fa9ae08a5851","40b2c6fe":"~16s for 10 predictions.

The trend and seasonality from Prophet look similar to the ones that we had earlier using the traditional methods.\n\n## UCM:\n\nUnobserved Components Model. The intuition here is similar to that of the prophet. The model breaks down the time-series into its components, trend, seasonal, cycle and regresses them and then predicts the next point for the components and then combines them.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not find a good package\/code that can perform this model in Python :( \n\nR version of UCM: https:\/\/bicorner.com\/2015\/12\/28\/unobserved-component-models-in-r\/\n\n# Hierarchical time series:\n\nThe [Forecasting: principles and practice](https:\/\/www.otexts.org\/fpp\/9\/4) , is the ultimate reference book for forecasting by Rob J Hyndman.\n\nHe lays out the fundamentals of dealing with grouped or Hierarchical forecasts. Consider the following simple scenario.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.otexts.org\/sites\/default\/files\/resize\/fpp\/images\/hts1-550x274.png)\n\nHyndman proposes the following methods to estimate the points in this hierarchy. I've tried to simplify the language to make it more intuitve.\n\n### Bottom up approach:\n* Predict all the base level series using any method, and then just aggregate it to the top.\n* Advantages: Simple , No information is lost due to aggregation.\n* Dis-advantages: Lower levels can be noisy\n\n### Top down approach:\n* Predict the top level first. (Eg: predict total sales first)\n* Then calculate **weights** that denote the proportion of the total sales that needs to be given to the base level forecast(Eg:) the contribution of the item's sales to the total sales \n* There are different ways of arriving at the \"weights\". \n    * **Average Historical Proportions** - Simple average of the item's contribution to sales in the past months\n    * **Proportion of historical averages** - Weight is the ratio of average value of bottom series by the average value of total series (Eg: Weight(item1)= mean(item1)\/mean(total_sales))\n    * **Forecasted Proportions** - Predict the proportion in the future using changes in the past proportions\n* Use these weights to calcuate the base -forecasts and other levels\n\n### Middle out:\n* Use both bottom up and top down together.\n* Eg: Consider our problem of predicting store-item level forecasts.\n    * Take the middle level(Stores) and find forecasts for the stores\n    * Use bottoms up approach to find overall sales\n    * Dis-integrate store sales using proportions to find the item-level sales using a top-down approach\n    \n### Optimal combination approach:\n* Predict for all the layers independently\n* Since, all the layers are independent, they might not be consistent with hierarchy\n    * Eg: Since the items are forecasted independently, the sum of the items sold in the store might not be equal to the forecasted sale of store  or as Hyndman puts it \u201caggregate consistent\u201d\n* Then some matrix calculations and adjustments happen to provide ad-hoc adjustments to the forecast to make them consistent with the hierarchy\n\n\n### Enough with the theory. Lets start making forecasts! :P\nThe problem at hand here, has 22170 items and 60 stores . This indicates that there can be around a **million** individual time-series(item-store combinations) that we need to predict!\n\nConfiguring each of them would be nearly impossible. Let's use Prophet which does it for us.\n\nStarting off with the bottoms up approach.\n\nThere are some other points to consider here: \n* Not all stores sell all items\n* What happens when a new product is introduced? \n* What if a product is removed off the shelves?","16ee03d1":"\ubcf4\ub2e4\uc2dc\ud53c p-value \uac00 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc791\uc544\uc84c\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 non-stationary \ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\uc124\uc744   \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.","461ab78d":"## AR(1) process -- has ACF tailing out and PACF cutting off at lag=1","3de8fca1":"## AR(2) process -- has ACF tailing out and PACF cutting off at lag=2","c7168659":"## MA(1) process -- has ACF cut off at lag=1","7c66f076":"## Now things get a little hazy.
