The list `dimensions` has the number of neurons in each layer specified in it.

","fe43ce43":"### initialize_parameters\nCreating a function **`initialize_parameters`** which initializes the weights and biases of the various layers. One way to initialise is to set all the parameters to 0. This is not a considered a good strategy as all the neurons will behave the same way and it'll defeat the purpose of deep networks. Hence, we initialize the weights randomly to very small values but not zeros. The biases are initialized to 0. Note that the **`initialize_parameters`** function initializes the parameters for all the layers in one `for` loop. \n\nThe inputs to this function is a list named `dimensions`. The length of the list is the number layers in the network + 1 (the plus one is for the input layer, rest are hidden + output). The first element of this list is the dimensionality or length of the input (784 for the MNIST dataset). The rest of the list contains the number of neurons in the corresponding (hidden and output) layers.\n\nFor example `dimensions = [784, 3, 7, 10]` specifies a network for the MNIST dataset with two hidden layers and a 10-dimensional softmax output.\n\nAlso, notice that the parameters are returned in a dictionary.
