A *Chat*ting Ro*bot*. Building a chatbot is one of the popular tasks in Natural Language Processing.\n\n### Are all chatbots the same?\n>##### Chatbots fall under three common categories:\n>##### 1. Rule-based chatbots\n>##### 2. Retrieval-based chatbots\n>##### 3. Intelligent chatbots\n\n### Rule-based chatbots\n>##### These bots respond to users' inputs based on certain pre-specified rules. For instance, these rules can be defined as if-elif-else statements. While writing rules for these chatbots, it is important to expect all possible user inputs, else the bot may fail to answer properly. Hence, rule-based chatbots do not possess any cognitive skills.\n\n### Retrieval-based chatbots\n>##### These bots respond to users' inputs by retrieving the most relevant information from the given text document. The most relevant information can be determined by Natural Language Processing with a scoring system such as cosine-similarity-score. Though these bots use NLP to do conversations, they lack cognitive skills to match a real human chatting companion.\n\n### Intelligent AI chatbots\n>##### These bots respond to users' inputs after understanding the inputs, as humans do. These bots are trained with a Machine Learning Model on a large training dataset of human conversations. These bots are cognitive to match a human in conversing. Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri fall under this category. Further, most of these bots can make conversations based on the preceding chat texts.\n\n### In this Article?\n>##### This article describes building an intelligent AI chatbot based on the famous transformer architecture - Microsoft's DialoGPT. According to [Hugging Face's model card](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/microsoft\/DialoGPT-medium), DialoGPT is a State-Of-The-Art large-scale pretrained dialogue response generation model for multiturn conversations. The human evaluation results indicate that the response generated from DialoGPT is comparable to human response quality under a single-turn conversation Turing test. The model is trained on 147M multi-turn dialogue from Reddit discussion thread.\n","6a44e11b":"# A ChatBot class","9f262645":"# Download Microsoft's DialoGPT model and tokenizer\n\n##### The Hugging Face checkpoint for the model and its tokenizer is `\"microsoft\/DialoGPT-medium\"`","64b5cc12":"##### Thank you for your valuable time!\nFind this notebook on Kaggle here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rajkumarl\/conversational-ai-chatbot"}}
