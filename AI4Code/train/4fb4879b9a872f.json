For instance, some words like \"man\" might appear many times in the description of a lot of shows and their large counts will not be very meaningful in the encoded vectors. \n\n- Term Frequency: This summarizes how often a given word appears within a document.\n\n- Inverse Document Frequency: This downscales words that appear a lot across documents.\n\nWe use cosine similarity as our metric to measure the degree of similarity between two shows in terms of their text-based features: content, rating, genres and directors. The larger the cosine similarity is, the closer the vector representation of their text-based features are.

The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. The data can be downloaded from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/shivamb\/netflix-shows.","c79b47df":"One of Netflix's core business is to offer personalized recommendations of shows to the audience. This article [here](https:\/\/help.netflix.com\/en\/node\/100639) explains how Netflix's recommendation system works on a very high level, and lists a number of factors that Netflix uses to develop their recommendation system. \n\n- **Viewers-level factors**: viewing history, rating of other shows given by the viewers, the time of day they interact with Netflix, duration of each active session, what device they use to watch shows on and other Netflix viewers with similar tastes and preferences. \n\n- **Text-based features of the shows**: content, genre, categories, actors, release year. \n \nApparently, the dataset does not include any views-level factors so we will mainly focus on the text-based features to build our recommendation system. **The goal** here is to recommend 5 shows based on a list of shows that the audience has already watched previously, using the following features: \n\n- `director`\n- `description`\n- `listed in`\n- `rating`","7ce13dea":"Currently Netflix is available in 113 countries and regions.

In the real-world application, companies usually use A\/B testing to determine which recommendation systems are better at recommending viewers what they like and improving users engagement of the platform. ","41f8631c":"In addition to that, we also want to take a look at the language of shows on Netflix by looking at the what genres they are listed in. We found that there're two tags particularly referencing to the language of the shows: `Spanish-Language TV Shows` and `Korean TV Shows`. \n\nThe pie chart below shows that the primary language of most of the content on Netflix are English, 10.1% are Korean and 8.9% are Spanish.
