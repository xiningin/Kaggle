It abstracts multiple modelling libraries and provides a simple, unified API for building machine learning models. EvalML supports a wide range of supervised learning problems such as regression, binary classification and multiclass classification. \n\nThe pipelines created by EvalML\u2019s AutoMLSearch includes preprocessing and featuring engineering out of the box. The user has to identify the target attribute; AutoML runs a search algorithm to train and score several models for the problem type. This enables the user to select one of the models based on their scores and then use it to generate predictions or do analysis. It also supports custom problem-specific objective functions, enabling users to specify exactly what makes a model valuable for their use case. \n\nNot only do these custom objectives help steer the AutoML search towards models with higher impact, but they are also used to tune the classification thresholds of binary classification models. You can find an example of a custom objective function created for the task credit card fraud detection here. Additionally, EvalML has a collection of models and tools for model understanding. It currently supports feature importance and permutation importance, partial dependence, precision-recall, confusion matrices, ROC curves, prediction explanations, and binary classifier threshold optimization.\n\nFurthermore, EvalML provides data checks that can be used to catch common problems with data before modelling. This helps prevent model quality problems, ambiguous bugs and stack traces. Currently EvalML includes the following data checks:\n\nAn approach for detecting target leakage by providing the model with information during training that won\u2019t be available at prediction-time\nDetection of invalid datatypes \nChecking for class imbalance\nLooking for redundant features like highly null columns, constant columns, and columns which are probably an ID and not useful for modelling.","4dca959c":"# Run the search for the best classification model.","3c5e25e3":"# Print model rankings and get the best pipeline.","d181f847":"# Logistic Regression is the best model for the binary log-loss objective.
