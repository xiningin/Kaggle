Two tables have been scraped from the website. The main table with a description of all columns is shown below. The second table stores comments that were made on each post. Comments can be linked back to their original posts in the main table through the `title` column.\n\nIn this project, the data from both datasets will be cleaned by converting columns to their most appropriate data type, removing unwanted characters from strings and by dealing with missing values. Some of the nan records can be substituted through information found in the title or url. \n\nIf you don't want to bother with data wrangling and start analyzing, I included the final cleaned version as a download (`rfd_main_cleaned`).\n\n|Column name|Description|\n|---|---|\n|'title'| Title of post|\n|'votes'| Sum of up-, and down-votes|\n|'source'| Name of retailer offering the sale|\n|'creation_date'| Date of initial post|\n|'last_reply'| Date of most recent reply|\n|'author'| User name of post author|\n|'replies'| Number of replies|\n|'views'| Number of views|\n|'price'| Price of product on sale|\n|'saving'| Associated saving|\n|'expiry'| Expiry date of sale|\n|'url'| Link to deal|\n"}}
