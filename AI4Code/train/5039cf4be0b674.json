In the eastern U.S., fire season lasts from March through May, while the West sees most of its fire activity from June through October. <\/p>\n\n\nFires are an important and necessary part of the lifecycle for many different kinds of ecosystems. For as long as forests and grasslands have grown on earth, fires have burned them. In fact, some tree species, like lodgepole pines and aspens, need fire to stimulate their growth.\n\nFires have also been used by people as a way to manage lands, whether to clear land for farming, get rid of unwanted pests, or to restore nutrients to the soil.\n\n\n--- \n\nHere are some more information about forst fires.\n\n- [The Facts About Fire](https:\/\/mylandplan.org\/content\/facts-about-fire)\n- [KNIME Applications Forest Fire](https:\/\/www.knime.com\/knime-applications\/forest-fire-prediction)\n\n---\n\n![Forest Fires](https:\/\/fee.org\/media\/38322\/forest-fire-3782544_1280.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&height=656&widthratio=2.1341463414634146341463414634&rnd=132451547710000000)\n\n---\n\n\n# Agenda for this Notebook\n\n- In this notebook, We are doing some analysis for the Forest Fire (Montesinho park fire) using below steps.\n\n1.
