Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent as well as concealing the contents of the message. (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Steganography) This notebook will use least significant bit steganography to hide 100s of KB to several MB of data in an image without perceptibly changing the image. This notebook completes 3 tasks using this method:\n\n**Part 1: Encode all 3 of the original Star Wars scripts into an image of the Death Star.**\n\n**Part 2: Encode an image of R2D2 with an image of the Death Star Plans.**\n\n**Part 3: Encode a series of encoded images within encoded images and end with the script for A New Hope (Death Star => X-Wing => R2D2 => Death Star Plans => New Hope Script).**\n\n\nThis is my attempt to duplicate the method without looking up tutorials or code samples on least significant bit steganography. My only knowledge going into this is a basic description of the method. \n\n# Least Significant Bit Image Steganography Explained\n\nHere is a quick rundown of how this works. Each pixel in a color image has a value for each of it's 3 color channel. These values are between 0 and 255 corresponding to how red, green, or blue that pixel is. These values can be converted to an 8 bit binary value (255 = 11111111, ect.). While changing the left-most bits can mean a lot of change to the value, the rightmost bits mean very little. We are going use the rightmost 2 bits for our encoding. Changing these 2 bits will change the value for that one color channel on that one pixel by *at most* 3 points but more likely less or not at all. The result is a difference in the final image that is imperceptible to the human eye. If we are willing to replace these 2 bits of the 8 bit value, we can use up to 1\/4th of the image's total space for whatever else we want! If we convert our scripts to 8 bit binary as well, there is more than enough space in a single color image to replace the last 2 bits of each color channel with our scripts.\n\n(Even more bits could be used for encoding. This allows for using more of the image's total space but runs the risk of making the changes more visible. The last 2 bits is plenty for this notebook and most encodings. )\n\n\n# Imports","4cbbf5ad":"Now lets double check that the whole series will fit before moving on.","39161093":"# Get and Examane the Death Star Image\nNow we will read in and examine our first image.","6b470024":"# Check for Space\nIn part 2, I checked if the images would fit by calculator and photoshop. No reason to do, that outside of math practice, when we have these nice methods already.\n","bfc96184":"# Wrapping up\nThis was a fun and interesting project to engage in. I hope it introduces people to Steganography techniques. This notebook should function like the invisible ink toy equivalent to Steganography. I encourage people to play around with image Steganography and see what they can do. Naturally, if we were really trying to hide messages in images, we would at least add layers of encryption to our messages and not use public images. Regardless, Image Steganography is most often used for adding hidden watermarks to images and videos for copyright purposes. Let's leave with one last quick method to scramble the last 2 bits of an image to delete any least significant bit encoding from an image.\n","5f232fa8":"Looking good so far, now onto the finale.\n\n# Decode the Series","fa19beab":"# Check the Images\nSame as last time, they are the same as last time.","8555c2a6":"# Image to String of Bits\n\nNow we need a method to convert the image into a nice string of bits. We are going to expand the tag at the begining to 20 spaces and add more information like data type for our decoder.","e58f99f5":"# Rescale the X-Wing\nLooks like the X-wing will not *quite* fit in our wallpaper. Unlike last time, I will adjust the image within this notebook.","dcfa6261":"Wow, even though we are only using the last 2-bits of data for our encoding, we still have over 235KB to work with in a modest color image. The ~167KB for all the Star Wars scripts checks outs since, if you add up their .txt file sizes it is pretty close at 177KB. (The only reason for the difference in size is the cleaning done earlier, removing the quotes and line numbering)"}}
