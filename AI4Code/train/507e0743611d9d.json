for all services\" - (too much variability in charges?)\n4. etc..\n\nAnother way of finding good features would be to project them into a lower dimensional space using PCA. PCA creates components which are a linear combination of the features. This then allows you to select components which explain the highest amount of variance.\n\nLets try to project the data onto 2D space and plot. **Note:** you can try TSNE, which is another dimensionality reduction approach as well.

Can simply replace missing values directly with a constant value such as 0\n2. In certain cases you may want to replace it with the average value for each column respectively\n3. For timeseries data, you may consider using linear or spline interplolation between a set of points, if you have data available for some of the months, and missing for the others.\n4.

Problem statement\n\nIn the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.\n\nFor many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business\ngoal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn, and identify the main indicators of churn.\n\nIn this competition, your goal is *to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.*\n\n**Customer behaviour during churn:**\n\nCustomers usually do not decide to switch to another competitor instantly, but rather over a\nperiod of time (this is especially applicable to high-value customers). In churn prediction, we\nassume that there are three phases of customer lifecycle :\n\n1. <u>The \u2018good\u2019 phase:<\/u> In this phase, the customer is happy with the service and behaves as usual.\n\n2. <u>The \u2018action\u2019 phase:<\/u> The customer experience starts to sore in this phase, for e.g. he\/she gets a compelling offer from a competitor, faces unjust charges, becomes unhappy with service quality etc. In this phase, the customer usually shows different behaviour than the \u2018good\u2019 months. It is crucial to identify high-churn-risk customers in this phase, since some corrective actions can be taken at this point (such as matching the competitor\u2019s offer\/improving the service quality etc.)\n\n3. <u>The \u2018churn\u2019 phase:<\/u> In this phase, the customer is said to have churned. In this case, since you are working over a four-month window, the first two months are the \u2018good\u2019 phase, the third month is the \u2018action\u2019 phase, while the fourth month (September) is the \u2018churn\u2019 phase.","b2931fce":"Let's also summarize the features using the df.describe method:"}}
