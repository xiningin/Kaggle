In fact, the words to do this are: ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``.\n\nWith these, we can make our `can_run_for_president` function more accurate.","7eb8da09":"The ``if`` and ``else`` keywords are often used in other languages; its more unique keyword is ``elif``, a contraction of \"else if\".\nIn these conditional clauses, ``elif`` and ``else`` blocks are optional; additionally, you can include as many ``elif`` statements as you would like.\n\nNote especially the use of colons (``:``) and whitespace to denote separate blocks of code. This is similar to what happens when we define a function - the function header ends with `:`, and the following line is indented with 4 spaces. All subsequent indented lines belong to the body of the function, until we encounter an unindented line, ending the function definition.","73372c7b":"## Boolean conversion\n\nWe've seen `int()`, which turns things into ints, and `float()`, which turns things into floats, so you might not be surprised to hear that Python has a `bool()` function which turns things into bools.","4e098e39":"Quick, can you guess the value of this expression?","5855f20d":"(Click the \"output\" button to see the answer)\n\nTo answer this, you'd need to figure out the order of operations. \n\nFor example, `and` is evaluated before `or`. That's why the first expression above is `True`. If we evaluated it from left to right, we would have calculated `True or True` first (which is `True`), and then taken the `and` of that result with `False`, giving a final value of `False`.\n\nYou could try to [memorize the order of precedence](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/reference\/expressions.html#operator-precedence), but a safer bet is to just use liberal parentheses. Not only does this help prevent bugs, it makes your intentions clearer to anyone who reads your code. \n\nFor example, consider the following expression:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or rain_level < 5 and have_hood or not rain_level > 0 and is_workday\n```\n\nI'm trying to say that I'm safe from today's weather....\n- if I have an umbrella...\n- or if the rain isn't too heavy and I have a hood...\n- otherwise, I'm still fine unless it's raining *and* it's a workday\n\nBut not only is my Python code hard to read, it has a bug. We can address both problems by adding some parentheses:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or (rain_level < 5 and have_hood) or not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday)\n```\n\nYou can add even more parentheses if you think it helps readability:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))\n```\n\nWe can also split it over multiple lines to emphasize the 3-part structure described above:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = (\n    have_umbrella \n    or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) \n    or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))\n)\n```","b2af08f1":"# Booleans\n\nPython has a type of variable called `bool`. It has two possible values: `True` and `False`.","b338726f":"# Conditionals\n\nBooleans are most useful when combined with *conditional statements*, using the keywords ``if``, ``elif``, and ``else``.\n\nConditional statements, often referred to as *if-then* statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition.\nHere's an example:","3512db83":"We can use non-boolean objects in `if` conditions and other places where a boolean would be expected.
