Considering proportionally, resort hotels seem to be a little closer to city hotels in summer.\n\nAn important interpretation can be made by examining three graphics together. Fewer customers come in the winter months, so when we look at the cancellation rates, it is quite normal that it appears less in the winter months. The point to be noted on these months is that the cancellation rates of city hotels are almost equal to other months even in winter. The fact that the total cancellation rates of the winter months are low is that the cancellation rates of the resort hotels are low in these months.\nIn short, the possibility of cancellation of resort hotels in winter is very low. This information can be a very important factor when predicting 'is_canceled'.","405db7ac":"# Preprocessing \n### (Missing Values, Feature Engineering and Standardization)","e46e1ec2":"### Gaussian Naive Bayes Model","853aa867":"It can be seen that most of the groups are normal distributed, some of them have high skewness.\nLooking at the distribution, most people do not seem to prefer to stay at the hotel for more than 1 week. But it seems normal to stay in resort hotels for up to 12-13 days. Although this changes according to the segments, staying longer than 15 days certainly creates outliers for each segment. If the total time feature was created by summing up the weekend and week nights, this would be clearer, but it can be clearly seen when looking at the two visualizations together.\n\nAs it turns out, customers from Aviation Segment do not seem to be staying at the resort hotels and have a relatively lower day average. Apart from that, the weekends and weekdays averages are roughly equal. Customers in the Aviation Segment are likely to arrive shortly due to business. Also probably most airports are a bit away from sea and its most likely to be closer to city hotels.\n\nIt is obvious that when people go to resort hotels, they prefer to stay more.","4ec8b288":"### Decision Tree Model (reservation_status included)","69134aca":"### Handling Features","b8762156":"### Logistic Regression Model","76beed51":"**Since we have decided what to do with features and missing values, we can work on first data.**","c33d9776":"- As we can see from the summary table, the best algorithm is random forest for this data set. \n- 0 values are uncalculated ones.\n- We do not count decision tree with reservatiton status which is broken. All algorithms would give 100% accuracy scores while reservation status is included.\n- Tuning for XGBoost would be a good challenge too.","263e90f5":"### Correlation","0623154d":"Looking at Offline TA\/TO and Groups, the situations where the deposit was received were only in the scenarios where the groups came. It is quite logical to apply a deposit for a large number of customers who will fill important amount of the hotel capacity.\n\nAs a first thought, I expected the cancellation rate in the market segments where a deposit is applied to be lower than the other segments where no deposit applied. But when we look at the cancellations according to the segments in the other visualization, it seems that this is not the case. \n\n- Groups segment has cancellation rate more than 50%.\n- Offline TA\/TO (Travel Agents\/Tour Operators) and Online TA has cancellation rate more than 33%.\n- Direct segment has cancellation rate less than 20%.\n\nIt is surprising that the cancellation rate in these segments is high despite the application of a deposit. The fact that cancellations are made collectively like reservations may explain this situation a bit.\n\nCancellation rates for online reservations are as expected in a dynamic environment where the circulation is high.\n\nAnother situation that took my attention is that the cancellation rate in the direct segment is so low. At this point, I think that a mutual trust relationship has been established in case people are communicating one to one. I will not dwell on this much, but I think there is a psychological factor here.","9577bb9f":"### Random Forest Model Tuning","3876b770":"### Summary Table of the Models","90bce55f":"While lead time is more than roughly 60, people tend to cancel their reservations (cancellation rate is higher after this point). \nAlso people want their holiday or work plans resulted in 100 days which equals to half of the data.","5960a330":"As we can see in the sorted list, reservation_status seems to be most impactful feature. With that information accuracy rate should be really high. It can be better to drop reservation_status column to see how other features can predict.

It has nice importance on predicting cancellation but since the missing values are equal to 13% of the total data it is better to drop that column. It has a lot of class inside of it otherwise we could try predicting missing values but they may misguide the predictions.","8fdc185c":"After correlation we will decide what to do about country, agent and total_nights.","f16b5e62":"### Boxplot Distribution of Nights Spent at Hotels by Market Segment and Hotel Type ","751833a2":"In the correlation part, we have seen the impact of reservation status.

Therefore we do not have enough values to fill the rows of company column by predicting, filling by mean etc. It seems that the best option is dropping company column.\n\n13.68% of agent column are missing values, there is no need to drop agent column. But also we should not drop the rows because 13.68% of data is really huge amount and those rows have the chance to have crucial information. There are 333 unique agent, since there are too many agents they may not be predictable. \nAlso NA values can be the agents that are not listed in present 333 agents. We can't predict agents and since missing values are 13% of all data we can't drop them too.
