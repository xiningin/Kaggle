SHAP Values\n\nSHAP which stands for **SH**apley **A**dditive ex**P**lanation, helps to break down a prediction to show the impact of each feature.

Normally, getting the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability just right can be a difficult balancing act but SHAP values can deliver both.\n\nSHAP values interpret the impact of having a certain value for a given feature in comparison to the prediction we\u2019d make if that feature  took  some baseline value.\n\nShap values show how much a given feature changed our prediction (compared to if we made that prediction at some baseline value of that feature). Let\u2019s say we wanted to know what was the prediction when the insulin level was 150 instead of some fixed baseline no. If we are able to answer this, we could perform the same steps for other features as follows:\n\n`sum(SHAP values for all features) = pred_for_team - pred_for_baseline_values`","acb82f76":"# 5.

In our dataset there are a lot of features like Glucose, BLood Pressure, Age etc. We start by considering a single row. \n\nWe proceed by fitting our model and calculating the probability of a person having diabetes which is our target variable. Next, we would choose a variable and continuously alter its value. For instance, we will calculate the outcome if the person's insulin level is 50,100,150 and so on. All these values are then plotted and we get a graph of predicted  vs actual outcome.(https:\/\/pdpbox.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/)","cffcad60":"# Extracting human understandable insights from any Machine Learning model\n\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/639\/1*tX9jrdkCZm3jPqG0rWXwOQ.png)\n[Source: interpretable-ml-book](https:\/\/christophm.github.io\/interpretable-ml-book\/terminology.html)\n\nIn his book [\u2018Interpretable Machine Learning\u2019](https:\/\/christophm.github.io\/interpretable-ml-book\/), Christoph Molnar beautifully encapsulates the essence of ML interpretability through this example: Imagine you are a Data Scientist and in your free time you try to predict where your friends will go on vacation in the summer based on their facebook and twitter data you have. Now, if the predictions turn out to be accurate, your friends might be impressed and could consider you to be a magician who could see the future.\n\n\nIf the predictions are wrong, it would still bring no harm to anyone except to your reputation of being a \u201cData Scientist\u201d. Now let\u2019s say it wasn\u2019t a fun project and there were investments involved. Say, you wanted to invest in properties where your friends were likely to holiday. What would happen if the model\u2019s predictions went awry?You would lose money. As long as the model is having no significant impact, it\u2019s interpretability doesn\u2019t matter so much but when there are implications involved based on a model\u2019s prediction, be it financial or social, interpretability becomes relevant.\n\n\n## Importance of interpretability\n\nThe question that some of the people often ask is why aren\u2019t we just content with the results of the model and why are we so hell-bent on knowing why a particular decision was made? A lot of this has to do with the impact that a model might have in the real world. For models which are merely meant to recommend movies will have a far less impact than the ones created to predict the outcome of a drug.\n\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1000\/0*IWLWbvl2xUJLD-va.png)\n\n[The big picture of explainable machine learning.](https:\/\/christophm.github.io\/interpretable-ml-book\/agnostic.html)","956cc76d":"# 2. Partial Dependence Plots\n\nThe partial dependence plot (short PDP or PD plot) shows the marginal effect one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model( [J. H. Friedman 2001](https:\/\/statweb.stanford.edu\/~jhf\/ftp\/trebst.pdf)). PDPs show how a feature affects predictions. PDP can show the relationship between the target and the selected features via 1D or 2D plots.\n\n","7103c5f9":"# 1. Permutation Importance using ELI5 library\n\nWhat features does a model think are important?  Which features might have a greater impact on the model predictions than the others?  This concept is called feature importance and **Permutation** **Importance** is a technique used widely for calculating feature importance.  It helps us to see when our model produces  counterintuitive  results, and it helps to show the others when our model is working as we\u2019d hope.\n\nPermutation Importance works for many scikit-learn estimators. The idea is simple: Randomly permutate or shuffle a single column in the validation dataset leaving all the other columns intact.  A feature is considered \u201cimportant\u201d if the model\u2019s accuracy drops a lot and causes an increase in error. On the other hand, a feature is considered \u2018unimportant\u2019 if shuffling its values don\u2019t affect the model\u2019s accuracy.\n\n* Permutation importance is useful useful for debugging, understanding your model, and communicating a high-level overview from your model.\n\n* Permutation  importance is calculated  after a model has been fitted. So, let\u2019s train and fit a  **RandomForestClassifier**  model denoted as  **my_model**  on the training data.\n\n* * Permutation Importance is calculated using the **ELI5 library**.  [**ELI5**](https:\/\/github.com\/TeamHG-Memex\/eli5) is a Python library which allows to visualize and debug various Machine Learning models using unified API. It has built-in support for several ML frameworks and provides a way to explain black-box models.\n","1a46ff4e":"**We can also visualize the partial dependence of two features at once using 2D Partial plots.**","5845865a":"**Interpretation**\n\nThe above explanation shows features each contributing to push the model output from the base value (the average model output over the training dataset we passed) to the model output.
