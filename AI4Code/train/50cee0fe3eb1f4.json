I was a digital circuit designer, did coding in VHDL, verilog Hardware description language, and a student in Engineering schools for a long time and an educator.

If we compare the first (18-21) and second (22-25) groups, we can tell the Master's degree group becomes much taller. I would answer YES for the question. Then, I carefully say Master's degree is the most popular level of education. ","d617afd7":"It seems people are active on Kaggle around the time when they achieve their degrees. For Master and Doctoral degrees groups, the peaks of the plots are shifted to older groups. For Doctoral degree and Professional doctorate groups, the percentages of women are a little higher, but still near 20%. I had a question at this point. Do I really need to separate by gender? The imbalance exists for all age groups and there can be a variety of reasons, which are hard to explain from this dataset. Moreover, for each age group, the distributions of men and women are very similar. It may be better to focus less on gender."}}
