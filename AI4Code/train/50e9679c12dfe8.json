This amount is large probably because it is the mean, and it is influenced by outliers large and small. We also note that the standard deviation is 41282.54, which is incredibly large, so the values in the data set are further away from the mean. Thus we can see that the mean is not a very good estimate of the AOV. \n\nWe can also look at the other statistics provided. At the 3rd quartile, 75% of the data points fall under 390. This is much smaller than the AOV of 3145.13. On the other hand, the max value is 704000, which is way larger than the 3rd quartile. So it seems we do indeed have some outliers conrtibuting to the large AOV of 3145.13 that was calculated naively.\n\nA better way to evaluate the data would be to use the **median** as the AOV. Since it is the middle value of the sorted values, it is a central value but large and small outliers do not skew the median as much as the mean.","e71fe3be":"### 1a) Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation.
