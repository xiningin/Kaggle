The goal of CMS experiment is to investigate a wide range of physics, including the search for the Higgs boson, extra dimensions, and particles that could make up dark matter read more.\n\nThis open data is released under the Creative Commons CC0 waiver. Neither CMS nor CERN endorse any works, scientific or otherwise, produced using these data.\n\n## This data has been already prepare and contains only event where two (2) muons have been detected.\n\nMuons are elementary particles from the family of the Leptons, they have greater mass than their electric charge which is \u22121 e and a spin of 1\/2, their mass is actually 200 times heavier than electrons. Because muons can pass through several metres of matter without interacting, they are not stopped by any of the calorimeters on CMS. So chambers to detect muons are placed at the very edge of the detector, where muons are the only particles likely to register a signal [2](https:\/\/home.cern\/about\/updates\/2013\/09\/watch-engineers-install-muon-detector-cms)."}}
