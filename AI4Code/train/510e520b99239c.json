Customers across the world using fintech platforms demand lightning fast services. Hence automating the hits with machine learning and reducing the false positive hits is our aim. But not at the cost of leaving out the false negatives.

Hence it is flagged when there is a receiver who receives money for more than 20 times.\n>4. **Merchant indicator:** The customer ids in receiver starts with 'M' which means that they are merchants and they obviously will have a lot of receiving transactions.
