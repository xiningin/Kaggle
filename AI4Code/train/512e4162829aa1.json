These two parameters would give a structure to the view whereas the information to be populated would be from the data that is being used to create pivot. The information can also be selectively populated by using values parameter.","e817d367":"I like to think of reshaping functions in two types. First type of functions simple reform the existing dataframe. For example, they change columns to rows and rows to columns. The second type of functions would aggregate the information along with reforming them.
