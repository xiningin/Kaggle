Which locations\/regions are more affected by the virus, and in which places are new cases likely to be appear? What areas should healthcare professionals focus their resources and efforts on? \n\nVisualizing this data in an intuitive way provides clearer insights on transmission behavior and patterns. In this project, we used data from Allegheny County, PA. We wanted to focus our efforts on creating a local-level tool at a finer resolution to track coronavirus spread, and using official county data was an excellent way to gather the specific data we needed. Another reason we chose Allegheny County in particular was because we were collaborating with the local county health department and UPMC Emergency Medical Services to better coordinate COVID-19 response.\n\nTraditional methods of viewing geographic data, such as a choropleth map, are often not specific or visually effective enough for county-level data. Additionally, simply showing one map for each day makes it hard to reason about patterns over time, but animating it also introduces the problem of sudden jumps in color or distribution between frames, since human vision is particularly wired to understand continuous motion. Altering the traditional choropleth, we performed a series of interpolations to more effectively bring out patterns and trends. The result is a cognitively-engaging visualization that makes it ergonomically efficient for humans to observe dynamic patterns in data.","223a066b":"![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kagglesdsdata\/datasets\/591876\/1085258\/alleghenyT.gif?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587272665&Signature=dM2dbhSjcZ5r0jwu%2BywOJHodrMkQB1TzPFJ19CcaFK55%2BTcU3Ps8K3jtCwKn%2BEZ4fZ2xaEA6Z2ophmqlVy9eJHP%2B4KjbeIDLnBVsKHT%2FuDO7zPgZv4GmPNGkpeVHnn8zyKKhuLEJCdN%2BTgARwMLaOdzr1qQl07w9QsL7VpwXBCwy%2FCQPYP7%2FykCOln4rwXw%2FyLRxTPRCwJNlYDzAwPgU8aQoOcbocoHenH%2F40PGN%2BRB36Aarx9R6okSl6iF3Hs5c5GAi4HE1fPDHfZogXHh2nIbNbqVckt%2FV8KUybauak3BkC5kA%2Fwl8AwB%2BTC7WFtOmvk3PYq6%2B2B91UBwDbC6zcA%3D%3D)","d0f3001a":"# Spacial interpolation\nOne way of visualizing our temporally interpolated data on a map is to use choropleths, but as mentioned before the stark color change between boundaries makes patterns hard to detect, especially since Allegheny County is composed of rather large municipalities. A dot map doesn't provide many benefits either since our data only contains information about each municipality, so all the dots would be clustered in predictable locations. A heat map is closer to what we want to achieve, but since it is only based on the raw distribution of the points, also has the problem of the color change being too abrupt and introduces potential bias from the clustering of the municipalities. We find that projecting a bivariate kernel density plot onto the map yields desriable results.\n\nAt a high level, our goal was to take the categorical information on the left, and merge it with the geographic information on the right:","f13f51be":"# Loading\/Preprocessing Data\nWe gathered daily data about cases in each municipality by referencing publicly posted data from Allegheny County's official website: https:\/\/www.alleghenycounty.us\/Health-Department\/Resources\/COVID-19\/COVID-19.aspx","3173c54d":"# Conclusion\nGiven a set of data on COVID-19 cases in a specific U.S. county, we needed a way to display the data in both an informative and digestible format. We found that ordinary methods of visualizing geographic data were not effective, as Allegheny County didn't have the level of geographic detail that higher level maps such as the United States have, which made it difficult to pinpoint where cases were occuring. By utilizing interpolations, we were able to make our data much more apparent in the final result, allowing for smoother and more detailed visualizations that are tailored for humans to understand.\n\nLooking to the future, we plan on making this and our other available COVID-19 work with Allegheny County open-source by publishing it on GitHub. We also plan on further developing the radial graph mentioned here, adding more detail and animation to visualize transmission on a global scale.\n\nWe hope that our efforts in developing this type of map make it easier in the future to better understand and predict where COVID-19 transmission and cases are most prevalent, as well as better coordinate healthcare response by providing geographic information.
