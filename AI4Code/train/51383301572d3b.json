Encode the Categorical data\n\nCategorical data are variables that contain label values rather than numeric values.\nSome algorithms can work with categorical data directly.\n\nFor example, a decision tree can be learned directly from categorical data with no data transform required (this depends on the specific implementation).\n\nMany machine learning algorithms cannot operate on label data directly. They require all input variables and output variables to be numeric.\n\nThis means that categorical data must be converted to a numerical form.","fad25f73":"#### Dummy Encoding\n\n    * The above encoding will result in a problem.\n    * The label encoding transforms the data as shown in the table above.\n    * The Machine learning algorithm will assume that China>India>Sri Lanka.\n    * But this is not the case.

Handle Missing Data\n\nThere are few missing data in the Age and salary columns (NaN values).\n\n#### i. Deleting Rows:\n*      We cannot remove the rows with the missing data as it will affect the output of the  machine learning algorithm.\n*      However we can delete a particular row if it has a null value for a particular feature and a particular column if it has more than 70-75% of missing values.\n      \n\n#### ii. Replacing With Mean\/Median\/Mode:\n*      This strategy can be applied on a feature which has numeric data like the age of a person.\n*      We can calculate the mean, median or mode of the feature and replace it with the missing values.    \n*     The loss of the data can be negated by this method which yields better results compared to removal of rows and  \n*       columns.\n*      Replacing with the above three approximations are a statistical approach of handling the missing values. \n*     This method is also called as leaking the data while training. \n*     Another way is to approximate it with the deviation of neighbouring values. \n*     This works better if the data is linear.\n"}}
