The data is skewed in that it shows a greater number of more recent years, due to multiple types of botulism and multiple types of toxins being reported.

Could a more current understanding of health and disease be able to more accurately label it as botulsim?","5c6a3dab":"As hypothesized, the number of times a year appears accounts for an additional state reporting in that year; of the top 20 years reported, the earliest year was 1984 (33 years from 2017, the most recent year). If a state does not report for a year, it means no deaths due to botulism were reported, but not necessarily that no deaths happened. \n\nLet's take a look at the average number of deaths per year - this should help adjust for the increased number of states.","d087aded":"Cases of botulism have increased over the range of years present in the dataset; the two initial reasons for this may be an increase in population, and a better understanding (and, therefore, reporting) of botulism and cause of death.

There is a chance that a certain bacteria lives in honey, which, after about one year of age, a human's body becomes able to process it. Having read about this prior to finding this dataset, it was one of the initial things that drew me to it. Let's look at the number of infant botulism cases over time.","a7d03032":"In contrast to California, Massachusetts has five years in the data set, without multiple types of botulism or toxins reported: 1912, 1913, 1916, 1938, and 1962. Next, let's look at Alaska, which has a less population than either California or Massachusetts, but a greater number of cases than Massachusetts.","2659118e":"Botulism is a rare illness caused by eating food that has spoiled, with few cases occuring per year in the United States. It is believed to be the illness that killed Buddha, and, although uncommon, still exists and is often fatal.\n\nThe data set used in this notebook is from the CDC's open data portal.\n\nWith the available data, we will seek to explore these questions: \n- Which types of botulism are most common?\n- In which years have botulism deaths spiked? \n- In which States are botulism deaths most and least common?\n","4741a101":"This data shows a trend of a relatively average number of deaths per year due to botulism, over the past 80 years, roughly. However, the US population has increased drastically, which doesn't change how many have died, but it changes what percent of the population has or does. \n\nQuestions and additional data to compliment this notebook would include:\n\n- How has the US population changed over the course of years listed in the botulism data set?\n- What is the per capita rate of botulism death in the US during this year range? \n- Are there any external factors that could influence botulism deaths in certain years?
