There are multitudes of machine learning models available but for the purpose of this project, we decided to use RandomForestRegressor as a start. \n\nBefore we carry out the actual training on the full data set to predict the sales price of hosues in test.csv, we conduct a test phase to calculate the mean absolute error of the RandomForestRegressor model. This can be done by spliting the training data set into (1) a subset of data for training the RandomForestRegressor model and (2) another subset of data to verify and compare the predicted sales price against the actual sales price to calculate the mean absolute error.   \n\nWe can use the follow code chunck to identify the features (X) sufficiently meaningful to training the RandomTreeRegressor model to improve\/reduce the mean absolute error for better result.
