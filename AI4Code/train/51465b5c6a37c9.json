The most influential variables that impact the decision of a punt returner are totalYardline, kickLength, and hangTime (not in a specific order). To further polish our model, there were variables that could have been removed to focus more squarely on the factors that impact the decision of the returner. We were happy to close with a model that has shown success in predicting the outcome of a given punt.","205927da":"We found that kickReturnYardage and playResult have high, negative correlation and that playResult and penaltyYards have a significant correlation.

We removed unnecessary variables to make the data more manageable and allow for our model to run cleanly later. The variables that we decided to continue studying heavily focused on the punt\u2019s context rather than the actions of the players. To restate, the purpose of our model is to predict whether a punt will be returned based on game factors including the quarter in which the play is occurring, the yardline from which the ball is punted, the length of the kick, and other variables.\n\nThis lead us to our final data frame of punt plays.","300a0f7d":"We found that the Random Forest classifcation was much better at predicting the punt returns than the logistic regression model.
