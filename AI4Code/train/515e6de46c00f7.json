We originally implicitly defined $v_1, v_2$ as \"number\" types, which are scalars. In order to use our $A$ and $B$ matrices, we use the $array()$ function so that we can leverage matrix multiplication functionality with $matmul()$. After this, the results $v[0]$ and $v[1]$ have \"array\" types, but we want them to be scalars (so as not to break the code - the while loop expects scalar \"number\" types when evaluating the exit conditions). The $float()$ operator does something called \"casting\" where the array type is changed to a scalar \"float\" type. If you're unfamiliar with casting, the intuition behind it is fairly straightforward. A quick google search should clear this up if you're not comfortable with what's going on in the code below.","727ca386":"Given the definitions in the artistic masterpiece below, the problem statement goes something like this:\n\nFind two blocks with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, where $m_2$ is any power of $100$ times more massive than $m_1$, and place them in in a scenario with frictionless surfaces and perfectly elastic conditions with $m_1$ nearer to the wall than $m_2$. If you push $m_2$ towards $m_1$ at any initial velocity, the number of collisions that occur thereafter will approximately equal $\\pi$. Amazingly, you can theoretically use this method to approximate $\\pi$ to any accuracy by increasing the mass of $m_2$ by factors of $100$.

This Notebook was brought to you by Alex Augenstein and Rich Sofranko. Rich is finishing the write-up on our mathematical proof. I'll either re-create the results below or link to it in a public DropBox (or similar). Thanks for reading!","ac3709dc":"**(Step 6)** This step is wordy but I want to discuss the meat of the simulation line-by-line. What you'll see is a while loop, and the loop will keep running over and over again (incrementing the collisions counter by $+1$ each time) until the \"exit conditions\" are reached. The exit conditions simply state that Mass 1 and Mass 2 are both moving away from the wall, and Mass 2 must be moving at least as fast as Mass 1 so the masses themselves will never collide with each other or with the wall again. Additionally, because Mass 1 has an initial velocity of 0, and Mass 2 has some initial negative velocity, the first collision will always happen between Mass 2 and Mass 1 (so the $A$ matrix models the result of this collision as $v = Au$). You'll notice from the problem statement that Mass 1 and Mass 2 will never collide twice back-to-back. Because of this, after a Mass 1 Mass 2 collision, there will either be a collision with the wall or no collisions will ever happen again. Similarly, when Mass 1 will never collide with the wall twice in a row. After Mass 1 hits the wall (modeled as $v = Bu$), it will either collide with Mass 2 or no collisions will happen ever again. So we get this toggling action between the $A$ matrix and $B$ matrix. Very conveniently, the $A$ matrix models all odd numbered collisions, and the $B$ matrix models all even numbered collisions. The code selects this by using the modulo operation (%) which gives the remainder of an integer division (in our case, we mod by $2$, giving either $0$ or $1$ as the result which tells us whether we should model the next collision using the $A$ or $B$ matrix).","811454d9":"#### Note: this simulation has exponential time complexity $O(10^k)$ (the number of times the loop runs increases by a factor of $10$ each time you increment $k$ by $1$). \n#### Translation: Keep $k$ between $1$ and $7$ so as not to inadvertently break anything.","82617ec3":"The following section focuses less on code and more on visualization.

Run it a bunch of times. The helper functions in the code blocks that follow are intended to be run at any point in the middle of the simulation. Run any one of those and come back to this block! The simulation will stop updating when there are no more collisions.","95ca67d8":"### Pretty cool right? We won't write the mathematical proof here (when my friend completes the write-up we'll put a link here to the document (in his DropBox or mine)). As a teaser, now that you know the angles are identical between adjacent points, the question becomes \"how many times can we sweep this angle before the collisions end?\" (for m2>>m1, this happens in a special region in the first quadrant). ","ad3db4e2":"**(Step 4)** Now we're going to work directly from [fundamental physics equations for elastic collisions](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elastic_collision#One-dimensional_Newtonian). You'll find these equations on Wikipedia. Let's reformulate these equations using matrices. The $A$ matrix models the collisions, and the $B$ matrix corresponds to Mass 1 bouncing off the wall (since it simply reflects the velocity of Mass 1 from negative to positive).","1718f47a":"### We did it! The above line of code shows that digits of $\\pi$ fall out of our simulation, which agrees with our expectations.","9530a143":"To make this simulation as simple as possible, for this particular problem we can write an update equation where the velocities of Mass 1 and Mass 2 after a collision depend only on their masses and their velocities just prior to the collision. Since the floor is frictionless, the velocities will be the same until the next collision (no matter how long it takes). **This means we only need to model the collision dynamics, independent of (absolute) time!** ","3d2adc72":"**(Step 7)** Now that the simulation is done, we just need to print the result. As expected, we get $k$ digits of pi. More specifically, $\\pi \\approx \\frac{collisions}{10^{(k-1)}}$","ee98d6bb":"**(Step 2)** Next, we want to select a $k$ for this experiment (which is identical to specifying how many digits of $\\pi$ we want to calculate)","9bb117b7":"He even posted a few follow-up videos on his channel showing mathematical proofs for this problem.","3c95b756":"**(Step 5)** There are no collisions at the outset of this experiment, so let's initialize the collisions counter to $0$."}}
