The non-frequent drinkers in that area eventually scores the highest, so perhaps those students manage their study well and only go for fun at the weekend. This story might make sense since student in rural area need to go to town to buy drinks, hence they only do it on weekend. Good boy!\n\nOn the other side, interesting things happend in the urban area. Those who has alcoholoic consumption index =7 in urban area do score the highest.","a1d8dbd1":"**Conclusion:**\n\nSurprisingly, unhealthy males with drunk level (alcoholic consumption index)=7 turns out to perform better in school then any other category. The opposite happens for the sex counter-part, female with drunk level = 7 score the lowest among all groups. What confuse me then is the fact that healthy male with drunk level=6-7 perform much worse as well as the unhealthy counterpart. It seems that alcoholic consumption, health, and grades has a peculiar relationship.\n\nIn addition, unhealthy female with drunk level=4 performs the best among other female groups. Idk how heavy drinker are you to have drunk level >=4 but having a good pubtime with a right dosis seems to enhance performance. Happy mind happy brain... \n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that health and alcohol consumption might do harm to students' performance on the extreme level. ","7a02fba9":"# Student Alcohol Consumption\n\n## Context:\nThe data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. You can use it for some EDA or try to predict students final grade.\n\n![Figure1.

Does drunk student perform worse?](http:\/\/www.quickmeme.com\/img\/a6\/a617241ae190e2db9ef75e5ffc73afa79ad6c46778fc697668541f7b81b501ab.jpg)","e67e239d":"## Distribution plot\nTo understand further  how alcohol consumption affect grades, let's compare their grades over the average scores.

However the question seems to abstract and not well defined. Ask yourself, how do we quantify good performance (eg. by each student's highest score, or by average score over G1-G3). Aside alcohol consumption, other factors play a significant role in affecting exams performance. \n\nSo how about dividing the big question into several detailed questions? First, let us agree that student performance can be measure using the average of three mathematic exams (G1, G2, G3). Now, these questions will guide us to get insights from different perspectives to answer the big one.\n","0f44426f":"Seem's good. Notice we have 395 rows x 33 cols and the data is clean. Meaning data that there is no Nan data point. Thus, some data are represented as strings.\n\nIf you look at the data description provided by [UCI Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/uciml\/student-alcohol-consumption\/home) on Kaggle,  those string\/object type features are, most of the time, binary features. It means that those the string-type data only have two values. Take a look at *sex* feature for example, only has either 'M' or 'F' values. The same goes for *school*, *Pstatus*, *romantic*, *internet*, *higher* features. \n\nNotice that we can use Dalc+Walc (Weekly alcohol consumption index) to measure individual alcohol consumption rate. Now let's  dive head first into our data. But first, we need to tidy up a few things before we start:","3fbd175b":"Looking to each individual data, let's do some plotting.
