Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.\n\nIn the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.\n\nAlthough Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms. Occasionally, your doctor may suggest surgery to regulate certain regions of your brain and improve your symptoms.\n\n\n### Objective:\nUsing different machine learning models to predict the presence of parkinson's disease in an individual.","4f494a24":"## Models\nDifferent machine learning models are used to predict outcomes:\n* Logistic Regression\n* Decision Tree\n* K nearest Neighbours\n* Support Vector Machine\n* Gaussian Naive Bayes\n* Dense Neural Network\n* XGBClassifier","7598cf47":"## Scope of Improvements\n* Better hyperparameter tuning\n* Changing Learning Rate and Optimizers\n","79efb4bc":"## Dense Neural Network Model","0f4cf880":"# Data Processing \nIn this part we will prepare the data for training \n\n\n#### Steps\n* Finding the labels and features to train the data.\n* Scaling the features betweem -1 and 1 to normalize the data.\n* Fitting the data and transforming it.\n* Split the data into training and testing datasets.","c2869aac":"## Decision Tree Classifier Model","32e275df":"## Support Vector Machine Model ","d48dafa2":"## Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier Model","08767b23":"## K Nearest Neighbour Classifier Model","a8abc3da":"So among all the models F1 score of XGBClassifier is the highest.","db306cb5":"Let's now take a look in the Parkinson Dataset.","89e7a2e7":"Spliting the data for training and testing","c7ec8df5":"## Logistic Regression Model","a2af80d7":"The MinMaxScaler transforms features by scaling them to a given range.
