Across developed and developing countries, the proportion of people in older age groups is predicted to increase significantly over the coming decades, secondary to decreasing mortality and declining fertility. The number of people aged 60 and over is expected to double globally from 841 million in 2013 to more than 2 billion in 2050, with a projected 69% global increase in the number of ALS cases worldwide by 2040.\n\nA counterpoint to the challenge of future population change is the hope offered by the possible development of new ALS treatments to slow progression and prolong survival for some or all patients. While there is not yet such a treatment, significant survival improvement might be expected in coming decades. For example, randomized controlled trial evidence shows that Riluzole can improve 12-month survival by about 35%, and lithium may improve the survival of a genetic subgroup . Edaravone, though not licensed in the UK, has been shown to slow functional decline in ALS for a subgroup of patients. Targeted gene therapy approaches are in development, and future treatments may slow or halt the progress of disease, resulting in a larger prevalent cohort of people with ALS.\n\nPopulation change and its interaction with the effects of treatments have major implications for a healthcare and societal system with limited resourcing and many competing demands. The authors therefore modelled the effects of demographic changes under various scenarios of treatment outcomes in ALS.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/21678421.2019.1587629","3ad0e707":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Incidence Estimates<\/span>**\n\n\n\"Patients were grouped by sex and age according to age at diagnosis in 5-year age bands from 15 years upwards, with an open-ended cohort for those aged 90 years and above. In the event of no cases within any particular category, they substituted 0.5 to allow extrapolation to future projections.\"\n\n\"Crude age- and sex-specific incidence rates were calculated using age- and sex-specific mid-2010 population estimates for the relevant boroughs as the denominator from Office of National Statistics (ONS) census data.

This generated an estimate of the number of incident cases per future year, by sex and age cohort.\"\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Prevalence Modelling<\/span>**\n\n\"To estimate the number of prevalent cases in future years, they used an established method. The number of cases per year was estimated based on the product of calculated age- and sex-specific incidence rates, the age- and sex-specific future population estimates taken from the main UK population projection described above, and the median disease duration. To generate estimates of median disease duration they performed a Kaplan Meier survival analysis using data from the whole of the SEALS Register. Cases were censored at death or at last recorded follow up date, with median survival (in months) calculated from date of symptom onset to the censor\/event date. Cases were grouped into three age cohorts\u2014under 40 years, 41\u201379 years and 80 years and over\u2014based on findings of a previous review of age as a prognostic factor in ALS.\"\n\n\"Assuming constant incidence, they modelled four different future prevalence scenarios to reflect possible developments in treatment.\"\n\n\"A new Riluzole-equivalent drug that increases median survival in all affected people by 3 months.\"\n\n\"A new gene therapy for SOD1 gene mutation that increases median survival in carriers by 50%. Based on estimates of 10% of people with ALS having an ascertained family history, 20% of which can be attributed to SOD1 mutation, and 2% of sporadic cases being SOD1 mutation carriers, 4% of the total population was selected for this survival benefit.\"\n\n\"A new gene therapy for C9orf72 gene mutation that increases median survival in carriers by 50%.

Several previously studied risk factors are confirmed as causally related to ALS by Mendelian randomization analysis. The previously known prognostic indicators for ALS appear to be the same across populations.\"\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">PREVALENCE<\/span>**\n\n\"Recent population-based studies reported a prevalence of ALS between 4.1 and 8.4 per 100\u200a000 persons. This high prevalence is likely because of the greater proportion of elderly people involved in the US population with a Medicare Advantage prescription drug plan. Difference in ALS prevalence by ethnicity is reported in the United States, for example, in the study using the National ALS Registry the prevalence of European-American ALS patients was found to be more than double the prevalence of African-American ALS patients (5.4 versus 2.3 per 100\u200a000).\"\n\n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Sex<\/span>**\n\n\"Male sex has since long being considered a risk factor for ALS. Recent studies have reported a male-to-female ratio between 1 and 2 , except for a report from Africa, whereas the male-to-female ratio was reported as high as 2.9. It has been proposed previously potentially as a result of the improved case ascertainment for women, especially elderly women, and the fact that women are nowadays more exposed to potential risk factors of ALS, such as smoking and occupational toxicants. However, the temporal trend of male-to-female ratio in ALS incidence might differ between countries, and needs to be examined further.\n\n **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">AGE AT ONSET<\/span>**\n \n\"Recent studies have shown that the mean or median age of ALS onset is between 51 and 66 years. Population-based studies are more likely to include patients with the entire spectrum of disease characteristics, whereas clinic-based studies are more likely to include patients with specific characteristics (e.g., younger age at onset or slower disease progression). Another predictor for age at ALS onset is whether the disease is familial or sporadic. Patients with familial ALS tend to have an earlier age of onset compared with patients with sporadic ALS. This could partly be because of closer surveillance of ALS symptoms among relatives of ALS patients, leading to earlier clinical diagnosis of ALS. However, showed that younger age of onset for patients with familial ALS can also be attributable to a Mendelian gene variant.\"\n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">DIAGNOSTIC DELAY<\/span>**\n\n\"Initial symptoms of ALS are nonspecific and may mimic symptoms of other neuromuscular diseases. Misdiagnosis, common in the early stage, can therefore delay ALS diagnosis. In addition, given the lack of valid diagnostic biomarkers, the diagnosis of ALS is made clinically and requires evidence of a progressive spread of symptoms, which takes time to demonstrate. Recent studies have reported the mean or median diagnostic delay to range between 9 and 24 months.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6735526\/","2e79e49c":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">AGE AT DIAGNOSIS<\/span>**\n\n\"The mean or median age at ALS diagnosis was reported as between 54 and 69 years in recent studies . Predictors of higher age at diagnosis are cognitive impairment and sex. Mean age at diagnosis was reported to be eight years higher among patients with cognitive impairment compared with patients without cognitive impairment. Mean age at diagnosis was slightly higher among women, compared with men.\"\n\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">SITE OF ONSET<\/span>**\n\n\"ALS onset usually manifests as weakness in the limbs (spinal onset) or difficulty in speaking or swallowing (bulbar onset). Between 58 and 82% of ALS patients have a spinal onset. This seems to be rather consistent across different countries.\"\n\n\"In addition to spinal onset and bulbar onset, recent studies reported that 8\u201323% of ALS patients might have other forms of onset, including mixed onset (spinal and bulbar; 9.9\u201317.1%), thoracic onset (1.5\u20133.5%), thoracic onset or dementia symptoms (17%), respiratory symptoms (1.7%), thoracic onset or respiratory symptoms (1.9%), or cognitive change (2.1%). However, these estimates are less frequently reported so far.\"\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">NONGENETIC RISK FACTORS<\/span>**\n\n\"An increasing number of susceptibility genes have been reported, but the overall genetic contribution to ALS still appears weak. Until recently the only established risk factors for ALS were older age and male sex, in addition to a family history of ALS. Nevertheless, epidemiologic research in the past has focused on various suspected risk factors for ALS, including lifestyle factors, body mass index, educational attainment, exposures to toxicants, virus infections, and comorbid conditions.\"\n\n\"In three Danish population-based studies using complete employment history, ALS was linked to diesel exhaust, lead , work-related intense physical activity, and specific occupations including agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing, and construction work. Similarly, a multicenter population-based control study found a positive association of diesel exhaust, silica, organic dust, and extremely low-frequency magnetic fields and electric shocks with ALS risk. Long-term exposure to air pollution has also been suggested as a risk factor for ALS .\"\n\n\"Concerning physical fitness, in a large longitudinal cohort of Swedish men, low muscle strength, low BMI, and low erythrocyte volume fraction at 17\u201320 was related to a lower risk of ALS at early age.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6735526\/","4938f094":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Future Projections<\/span>**\n\n\"The total number of people newly diagnosed with ALS per year in the UK is projected to rise over the coming decades, from a baseline of 1415 UK cases in 2010 to 1701 in 2020 and 2635 in 2116. For males, the projected increase in new cases was from 743 in 2010 to 1540 in 2116, with population increases in the highest age cohort (over 90 years) contributing significantly to this rise.
