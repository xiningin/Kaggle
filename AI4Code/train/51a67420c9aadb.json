A value **1 means perfect positive correlation**.\n\n**NEGATIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated**. A value **-1 means perfect negative correlation**.\n\nNow lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as **MultiColinearity** as both of them contains almost the same information.\n\nSo do you think we should use both of them as **one of them is redundant**. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n\nNow from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated.

It works by applying similar classifiers on small partitions of the dataset and then taking the average of all the predictions. Due to the averaging, there is a reduction in variance.

An example of this can be a Decision Tree or Random Forests. We can use KNN with a small value of **n_neighbours**, a small value of n_neighbours.","89577273":"The accuracy of a model is not the only factor that determines the robustness of the classifier.

The answer is **No**, because we can't determine which all instances will the classifier will use to train itself. As the training and testing data changes, the accuracy will also change. It may increase or decrease. This is known as **model variance**.\n\nTo overcome this and get a generalized model, we use **Cross Validation**.\n\n\n# Cross-Validation\n\nMany times, the data is imbalanced, i.e there may be a high number of class1 instances but fewer other class instances. Thus we should train and test our algorithm on every instance of the dataset. Then we can take an average of all the noted accuracies over the dataset. \n\n1)The K-Fold Cross Validation works by first dividing the dataset into k-subsets.\n\n2)Let's say we divide the dataset into (k=5) parts. We reserve 1 part for testing and train the algorithm over the 4 parts.\n\n3)We continue the process by changing the testing part in each iteration and training the algorithm over the other parts. The accuracy and errors are then averaged to get an average accuracy of the algorithm.\n\nThis is called K-Fold Cross-Validation.\n\n4)An algorithm may underfit over a dataset for some training data and sometimes also overfit the data for another training set.
