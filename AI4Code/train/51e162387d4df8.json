It also happens to be very helpful.  As clinical radiologists, we expect post-processing, even taking them for granted. However, the magic that occurs behind the scenes is no easy feat, so let\u2019s explore some of that magic.\n\nIn this quest, we will be starting from raw DICOM images. We will extract voxel data from DICOM into numpy arrays, and then perform some low-level operations to normalize and resample the data, made possible using information in the DICOM headers.\n\nThe remainder of the Quest is dedicated to visualizing the data in 1D (by histogram), 2D, and 3D. Finally, we will create segmentation masks that remove all voxel except for the lungs.\n\nProcessing raw DICOM with Python is a little like excavating a dinosaur \u2013 you\u2019ll want to have a jackhammer to dig, but also a pickaxe and even a toothbrush for the right situations.

Because air really only goes to -1000, so there must be some sort of artifact.\n\nLet's take a look at the actual images.\n\n## Displaying an Image Stack\nWe don't have a lot of screen real estate, so we'll be skipping every 3 slices to get a representative look at the study.","71f70dae":"This means we have 2.0 mm slices, and each voxel represents 0.7 mm.\n\nBecause a CT slice is typically reconstructed at 512 x 512 voxels, each slice represents approximately 370 mm of data in length and width.\n\nUsing the metadata from the DICOM we can figure out the size of each voxel as the slice thickness. In order to display the CT in 3D isometric form (which we will do below), and also to compare between different scans, it would be useful to ensure that each slice is resampled in 1x1x1 mm pixels and slices.","61251cd0":"## Save the loaded images in npy format","2ce66cd9":"## Segmentation\nIf you are interested in chest CTs because you're interested in picking up lung cancers, you're not alone. Machine learning algorithms work a lot better when you can narrowly define what it is looking at. One way to do this is by creating different models for different parts of a chest CT. For instance, a convolutional network for lungs would perform better than a general-purpose network for the whole chest. Therefore, it is often useful to pre-process the image data by auto-detecting the boundaries surrounding a volume of interest.\n\nThe below code will:\n\n* Standardize the pixel value by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation\n* Identify the proper threshold by creating 2 KMeans clusters comparing centered on soft tissue\/bone vs lung\/air.\n* Using Erosion) and Dilation) which has the net effect of removing tiny features like pulmonary vessels or noise\n* Identify each distinct region as separate image labels (think the magic wand in Photoshop)\n* Using bounding boxes for each image label to identify which ones represent lung and which ones represent \"every thing else\"\n* Create the masks for lung fields.\n* Apply mask onto the original image to erase voxels outside of the lung fields.","cab1e20e":"## Helper function\n\nHere we make two helper functions.\n\n* `load_scan` will load all DICOM images from a folder into a list for manipulation.\n* The voxel values in the images are raw. `get_pixels_hu` converts raw values into [Houndsfeld units](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hounsfield_scale)\n\n    * The transformation is linear. Therefore, so long as you have a slope and an intercept, you can rescale a voxel value to HU.\n    * Both the rescale intercept and rescale slope are stored in the DICOM header at the time of image acquisition (these values are scanner-dependent, so you will need external information).","2e3160fc":"Looks like things check out.
