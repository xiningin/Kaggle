made as to impute these features with a mean or median or zero.","c7354fb7":"### Missing Data","9b9355fd":"### Getting Dummies","511004ff":"After dropping the 'ID' and target variable 'SalePrice' columns,\nthe data set contains 79 features and 2917 entries.","fa855cc5":"In order to find the optimal alpha value for this model, a number of models will be created iteratively using various alpha values with their RMSE scores being plotted against one another , allowing for the alpha value of the model with the lowest RMSE score to be selected.\n\nThe alpha parameter needs to greater than 0 as alpha = 0 will yield the same coefficients as simple linear regression.","17fae500":"It can be seen that both Ridge and Lasso score very similarly on this data.","d70d947a":"From the above Heatmap we can see that there are a decent amount of predictor variables highly correlated with the target variable.","33ddda00":"### ->Imputation (Categorical Features)","5fb273f0":"### Skewness","1098fcc2":"It can be seen above that the 'SalePrice' does not follow a Normal Distribution.\nWhilst the LogNormal and Johnson SB (Bounded) Distributions are fit quite well,\nThe Johnson SU (Unbounded) Distribution is fit more optimally.\n\nThe Johnson's SU distribution (Unbounded) is a distribution that goes to infinity in both the upper or lower tail.","ab31807d":"## Data pre-processing","d5d3f893":"## Package Imports","9dc3479e":"There are some numerical features that would serve better as categorical features as they represent various categories pertaining to condition and quality as well as building class.\n\nThe aforementioned features are : \n- MSSubClass  : (The building class)\n- YrSold      : (Year Sold)\n- MoSold      : (Month Sold)\nAs such these features will have their data type changed to string (object).","99ccfd5e":"The 'LotFrontage' feature which describes the linear number feet of street connected to the property\nhas 16.65 % of data missing.

They are both simple techniques which reduce model complexity and prevent over-fitting. The difference between the ridge and lasso regression lies in how the regularization term is calculated.\n\nLasso penalizes the absolute size of coefficients which leads to coefficients that can be exactly 0. It also offers automatic feature selection because it can completely remove some features.\n\nRidge regression penalizes the squared size of coefficients which leads to smaller coefficients, but it doesn't force them to 0.  It will not get rid of irrelevant features but will instead minimize their impact on the trained model.","c541ed9b":"A Q-Q plot can also be used to determine the presence of skew.\nIn statistics, a Q\u2013Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.

The fucntion will be scoring the mean squared error with a cross validation splitting strategy of 10 folds.\n\nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). \nResiduals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are.\n\nThis function will also aid in finding the optimal alpha value when building the models.","fe7341a6":"# House Prices Regression","ab13009d":"For the categorical features with missing data pertaining to toward the Garage, Basement, Fence, Fireplace, Alley access and Pool.
