It made its way to the United States after the creation of instant noodles in the 1970s. Momofuku Ando, the inventor of instant noodle, realised that he could partially fry and dehydrate the noodle to improve its shelf-life. He then moved on to found Nissin Foods and introduced instant Chikin Ramen to Japanese consumers. 5 years later, the company created the cup noodle, a product that revolutionise the entire processed-food industry. Needless to say, the instant ramen was a great success worldwide, including the United States.\n\n![Even Michael Scott endorses it](https:\/\/productplacementblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Nissin-Cup-Noodles-Held-by-Steve-Carell-Michael-Scott-in-The-Office-1.jpg)\nIn The Office, Cup Noodles is a popular lunch among the characters of the show (specifically Michael Scott and Kevin Malone).\n\nHere, we will identify the following:\n- Which brand has the most review?\n- Which country produce the most ramen brand?\n- Which style of ramen (cup, tray, pack) is the best?\n- What are the common words used in these products?","ed73e5a2":"### What do we see?\n- We do not need 'Top Ten' column so we will remove it.\n- We can convert stars to numerical values.\n- We will identify the 2 null values in style and replace them with the appropriate style.","5908c260":"Great!
