The N tokens (words) will form a dictionary and the size of the bag-of-words matrix M will be given by D X N. Each row in the matrix M contains the frequency of tokens in document D(i).\n\nLet us understand this using a simple example.\n\nD1: He is a lazy boy. She is also lazy.\n\nD2: Smith is a lazy person.\n\nThe dictionary created would be a list of unique tokens in the corpus =[\u2018He\u2019,\u2019She\u2019,\u2019lazy\u2019,\u2019boy\u2019,\u2019Smith\u2019,\u2019person\u2019]\n\nHere, D=2, N=6\n\nThe matrix M of size 2 X 6 will be represented as \u2013\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nNow the columns in the above matrix can be used as features to build a classification model.","24bd7bb8":"### TF-IDF Features\nThis is another method which is based on the frequency method but it is different to the bag-of-words approach in the sense that it takes into account not just the occurrence of a word in a single document (or tweet) but in the entire corpus.\n\nTF-IDF works by penalising the common words by assigning them lower weights while giving importance to words which are rare in the entire corpus but appear in good numbers in few documents.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the important terms related to TF-IDF:\n\n    TF = (Number of times term t appears in a document)\/(Number of terms in the document)\n\n    IDF = log(N\/n), where, N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.\n\n    TF-IDF = TF*IDF","4fe730be":"### Modeling\n\n\nWe are now done with all the pre-modeling stages required to get the data in the proper form and shape.

Exploring and visualizing data, no matter whether its text or any other data, is an essential step in gaining insights. Do not limit yourself to only these methods told in this course, feel free to explore the data as much as possible.\n\nBefore we begin exploration, we must think and ask questions related to the data in hand. A few probable questions are as follows:\n\n    What are the most common words in the entire dataset?\n    What are the most common words in the dataset for negative and positive tweets, respectively?\n    How many hashtags are there in a tweet?\n    Which trends are associated with my dataset?\n    Which trends are associated with either of the sentiments? Are they compatible with the sentiments?\n\n##### A) Understanding the common words used in the tweets: WordCloud\n\nNow I want to see how well the given sentiments are distributed across the train dataset. One way to accomplish this task is by understanding the common words by plotting wordclouds.\n\nA wordcloud is a visualization wherein the most frequent words appear in large size and the less frequent words appear in smaller sizes.\n\nLet\u2019s visualize all the words our data using the wordcloud plot.","cbb6af3c":"### Word2Vec Features\n\nWord embeddings are the modern way of representing words as vectors. The objective of word embeddings is to redefine the high dimensional word features into low dimensional feature vectors by preserving the contextual similarity in the corpus. They are able to achieve tasks like King -man +woman = Queen, which is mind-blowing.\n\nDrawing\n\nThe advantages of using word embeddings over BOW or TF-IDF are:\n\n    Dimensionality reduction - significant reduction in the no. of features required to build a model.\n\n    It capture meanings of the words, semantic relationships and the different types of contexts they are used in.\n\n\n1. Word2Vec Embeddings\n\nWord2Vec is not a single algorithm but a combination of two techniques \u2013 CBOW (Continuous bag of words) and Skip-gram model. Both of these are shallow neural networks which map word(s) to the target variable which is also a word(s). Both of these techniques learn weights which act as word vector representations.\n\nCBOW tends to predict the probability of a word given a context. A context may be a single adjacent word or a group of surrounding words. The Skip-gram model works in the reverse manner, it tries to predict the context for a given word.\n\nBelow is a diagrammatic representation of a 1-word context window Word2Vec model.\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n\nThere are three laters: - an input layer, - a hidden layer, and - an output layer.\n\nThe input layer and the output, both are one- hot encoded of size [1 X V], where V is the size of the vocabulary (no. of unique words in the corpus). The output layer is a softmax layer which is used to sum the probabilities obtained in the output layer to 1. The weights learned by the model are then used as the word-vectors.\n\nWe will go ahead with the Skip-gram model as it has the following advantages:\n\n    It can capture two semantics for a single word. i.e it will have two vector representations of \u2018apple\u2019. One for the company Apple and the other for the fruit.\n\n    Skip-gram with negative sub-sampling outperforms CBOW generally.\n\nWe will train a Word2Vec model on our data to obtain vector representations for all the unique words present in our corpus. There is one more option of using pre-trained word vectors instead of training our own model. Some of the freely available pre-trained vectors are:\n\n    Google News Word Vectors\n\n    Freebase names\n\n    DBPedia vectors (wiki2vec)\n\nHowever, for this course, we will train our own word vectors since size of the pre-trained word vectors is generally huge.\n\nLet\u2019s train a Word2Vec model on our corpus.","823a23d4":"#### 1.

We should try to check whether these hashtags add any value to our sentiment analysis task, i.e., they help in distinguishing tweets into the different sentiments.\n\nFor instance, given below is a tweet from our dataset:\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nThe tweet seems sexist in nature and the hashtags in the tweet convey the same feeling.\n\nWe will store all the trend terms in two separate lists \u2014 one for non-racist\/sexist tweets and the other for racist\/sexist tweets.","aeea6b62":"#### Preparing Vectors for Tweets\n\nSince our data contains tweets and not just words, we\u2019ll have to figure out a way to use the word vectors from word2vec model to create vector representation for an entire tweet.

We will repeat the same process for all the tweets in our data and obtain their vectors. Now we have 200 word2vec features for our data.\n\nWe will use the below function to create a vector for each tweet by taking the average of the vectors of the words present in the tweet.","55a5d14b":"##### Updating subsample and colsample_bytree","5e3550e7":"We will be following the steps below to clean the raw tweets in out data.\n\nWe will remove the twitter handles as they are already masked as @user due to privacy concerns.

For example, \u2018pdx\u2019, \u2018his\u2019, \u2018all\u2019. So, we will try to remove them as well from our data.\nLastly, we will normalize the text data. For example, reducing terms like loves, loving, and lovable to their base word, i.e., \u2018love\u2019.are often used in the same context. If we can reduce them to their root word, which is \u2018love\u2019.
