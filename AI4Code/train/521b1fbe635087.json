As we know serial number does not affect target variable so its best to remove them in first place. In this project I'm trying to capture user's music taste. I want to do this without the bias of artist, So that we can understand how user is persuing which kind of music despite consideration of artist. so I'm removing song_title and atist column.","7cbf98b2":"<h1>Analysis<\/h1>\n\nBelow graphs are target responses with respect to specific feature, where red and green indicates dislike and like respectively.\nAs we see in accousticness and liveness graphs targets are overlapping each other. Which means user is not concerned about them in first place.\nBut on the other hand energy and loudness gives us more information about user's song choices. In both of them dislike is more right skewed than liked songs. Also if we observe key, 4th key songs are mostly disliked by user where as 3rd key songs are liked by him.So in sense we can conclude that data is not random. There are some primary intuitions on which we can work. ","943ff97d":"<h1>Corelation Analysis<\/h1>\n\nCorrelation between two features defines how similar are they to each other.With this type of analysis we can identify similarity in features.If features are highly corelated then we can eliminate any one of those two. Because of that we are able to reduce dimensionality of model without losing any significant information.\n\nBut in above data features are highly un-corelated because of that every feature has its own significance for model development Hence we are keeping all features in our dataset.","a8a60f27":"<h1>Model Building<\/h1>"}}
