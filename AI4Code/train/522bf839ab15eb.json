The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n\n**Content**\n\nThe datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nSmith, J.W., Everhart, J.E., Dickson, W.C., Knowler, W.C., & Johannes, R.S.

After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, they're able to categorize new text.\n\nSupport vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.\n\n**The advantages of support vector machines are:**\n\n1. Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n\n2. Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n\n3. Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n\n4. Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n\n**The disadvantages of support vector machines include:**\n\n1. If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.\n\n2. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below).","24a40dd0":"look at the columns ('Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin','BMI') minimum value. which is zero. \n\nCan minimum value of above listed columns be zero ?\n\nNo. this value doesn't make any sense\n\n","97713c0e":"## **GradientBoostingClassifier**\n\nGB builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion; it allows for the optimization of arbitrary differentiable loss functions.
