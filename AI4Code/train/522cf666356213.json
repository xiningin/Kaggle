One challenge of this competition is that there are only these very few earthquakes to work with.  The is a signal spike (high amplitude) just before an earthquake, but there are also signal spikes in other places that may complicate matters.

Earthquakes occur when the time-to-failure signal (blue) jumps up from very near zero to a much higher value where that new higher value is the time to what is then the next quake.  There appears to be a short term high amplitude oscillation very shortly before each quake.  But, there also several similar such peaks that occur nearer the region centered in time between quakes.  Signal noise seems to increase as time gets closer to failure, though there is also a drop after the big peak.  A signal's standard deviation may prove to be a helpful predictor.  The region just after the big peak may be especially hard to predict.","eb4579db":"Hunter, J., (2007).

The problem is that the 150k sample slices are actually very short compared to the overall time between quakes and thus these big apparently meaningful signal spikes are unlikely to be present in many training or test samples.  If slicing the training data directly into 150k chunks, then only 16 of 4194 training samples (0.38%) would contain a meaningful high-valued spike.

This verifies that they all contain 150,000 samples as expected.","8df732c0":"Below is a look at the signal just before failure (an earthquake).  It is very interesting that the signal becomes quiet in the 150k sample slice before an earthquake.  Thus, the signal spike observed in the big picture plot above must occur more than one slice (more than 150k samples) before the earthquake.  These do not appear much different than plots 5 or even 8 seconds before the quake that are presented above where the time to failure ramps are shown.  This looks like it will create major problems for accurate prediction.  Earthquakes are deemed to have occurred where the blue line jumps up in value, representing the time to the next quake.","348487e7":"From the code below, the test set \"big peaks\" seem to match the proportion with which they are found in the training data at 0.38% of signals (test set signals are all 150k samples long).  The number of earthquakes in the training set seems to be approximately proportional to the overall size relationship between the two sets. With 16 quakes in the training set we might expect 10 quakes in the test set based on their relative sizes.  As seen by the code output, there are 10 such files within the test set that exhibit the peak behavior.   However, there is also concern about the possibility of bogus peaks in the test data that do not correlate well with an actual quake.  The expectation of 10 possible quakes in the test set should be considered cautiously and as only an approximation.","de5c86c8":"Frequency components of the signal could be very interesting to look at.  This is a plot of the Fourier transform magnitude for some of the test signals.  Note that there appears to be little information in the signal above the 20,000th frequency line.  Noise appears to mostly disappear above the 25,000th frequency line.  It is difficult to translate this to a frequency because of the signal gaps noted earlier.  Still, it may be best to concentrate signal analysis on frequencies below those represented by the 20,000th frequency line.  Also, there are peaks in the frequency analysis that may be valuable to collect in some manner.  The DC component was eliminated for plotting purposes because it would otherwise dominate the plot and make the other frequencies hard to see.  Also note that while referred to as an \"FFT\" in the code below, this is actually a Discreet Fourier Transform (DFT) because the signal length of 150k samples is not a number that is a power of two.","6251a7ff":"Having validated that the test samples are 150,000 samples long, it could help to examine the training data in 150,000 sample chunks.  Here are some random samples of the training data and plots of the acoustic signal along with the time-to-failure.  Note that the y-axis scales vary for all plots.  It is very interesting that the high level spike in the signal occurs in row 3, column 1 in a signal only 0.32 seconds before failure.  This spike reaches vales above 2000 and below 4000.  A similar situation occurs in row 4, column 2.  Contrast this with other plots where the time-to-failure is many seconds away and the signal level peaks around 100.  Time-to-failure plots as a ramp because we are slowly approaching the next quake as the signal progresses in time.  Apparently the time-to-failure has limited resolution and so is represented by a stair step rather than a smooth line.  It appears that if signal spikes could be captured in some way it might help the effort to model time-to-failure.  Somewhat shockingly, we are trying to predict an earthquake from only around 0.04 seconds or so worth of data, as can be noted from examining the right hand axes of the plots.

There do not seem to be many obvious features in the signal to correlate with the time to system failure (an earthquake).  An examination of the Kaggle leader board confirms this as even the best scores show significant error as of the date of this Jupyter notebook.  The most obvious feature is the big signal spike just before failure.  But, as noted, it is only present in about 0.38% of 150k sample training slices.  This may make it a difficult feature to work with and 99.6% of the time the quake needs to be predicted in the absence of the major signal spike.  A great starting approach for generating features to model this problem appears to be the mass statistical feature generation used by many scripts on the Kaggle kernels section.  Much of this feature generation seems to be come from work by Lukayenko (2019), and others credited by citations in his Kaggle kernel.","2c121ca0":"Presented here is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Kaggle Earthquake Prediction Challenge (Rouet-Leduc, et. al, 2019).  The modeling and machine learning portion of the project may be found in a separate Jupyter notebook within the github repository (https:\/\/github.com\/Vettejeep\/MSDS696-Masters-Final-Project). The goal of the project is to predict the time that an earthquake will occur in a laboratory test.  The laboratory test applies shear forces to a sample of earth and rock containing a fault line.  We note that these are laboratory earthquakes, not real earthquakes.  The simulated earthquakes tend to occur somewhat periodically because of the test setup, but this periodicity is not perfect or guaranteed to the modeler attempting to predict the time until an earthquake in the test data provided.

The idea of using the window is to avoid any start up transients that might cause ringing in filters applied to the signal.  It is very interesting that windowing seems to emphasize noise.  This noise, however, would almost entirely be removed by a low pass or band pass filter.  Windows are used to force the signal to be periodic in the time domain which reduces leakage effects at the signal endpoints in the Fourier transform.","001175c9":"The training input data consists of an acoustic signal that is over 629 million rows long.  Each acoustic signal value is associated with a time-to-failure, the time when an earthquake happens.  The test data consists of samples that are 150,000 samples long taken from earthquakes different from those in the test set.  There is therefore likely to be a need to examine the data in 150,000 sample chunks that represent the test signals.","2e02809d":"The signal is recorded at 4MHz which is an extremely high sample rate for an acoustic sensor.  A complicating factor is that the signal is recorded in bins that are 4096 samples in length.  There is a 12 microsecond gap between bins.  This means that there are 46-48 samples of lost data in each gap depending on how the gap is interpreted.  The location of the gaps are not given to challenge participants (Rouet-Leduc, 2019).  Given the noise level of the signal it would appear to be impossible to attempt reconstruction of the missing data.  Further, there are not the same number of missing samples in each of the 150k long test sample files because 4096 does not evenly divide into 150,000.  Because of the difficulty in reconstructing the missing data, or knowing where it is, it has been decided to proceed with continuous signal processing techniques even though that is not strictly perfect."}}
