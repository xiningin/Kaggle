And this information can be helpfull to make prediction. ","3855155f":"This is valable for all variables in the list. For example: \n  - **MasVnrType & MasVnrArea**:  In the description file we can read :\n                MasVnrType: Masonry veneer type\n                      BrkCmn\tBrick Common\n                      BrkFace\tBrick Face\n                      CBlock\tCinder Block\n                      None\tNone\n                      Stone\tStone\n     So the None values mean that the house doesn't have a Masonry, and this can be used as an information.\n     This works also for MasVnrArea because if there is no Masonry, the MasVnrArea is not defined. Besides \n     the percentage of missing vales of the two variables are equal (0.547945%)\n         \n  - **GarageType & GarageYrBlt & GarageFinish & GarageQual & GarageCond**:They have the same percentage of missing\n    values : 5.54%. Na means that there is no garage\n  - **BsmtQual & BsmtCond & BsmtFinType1** : They have the same percentage\n  - **BsmtExposure & BsmtFinType2** : they have the same percentage 2.6%. But the percentage is higher than 2.5, the percentage of missing vales of BsmtQual & BsmtCond & BsmtFinType1. This is because of we look at the distribution file we find that: \n  \n             BsmtExposure: Refers to walkout or garden level walls\n                   Gd\tGood Exposure\n                   Av\tAverage Exposure (split levels or foyers typically score average or above)\t\n                   Mn\tMimimum Exposure\n                   No\tNo Exposure\n                   NA\tNo Basement\n     So there is two type of missing values: No and Na, so the higher percentage is explined by the number of house with No exposure\n  - **PoolQC & Fence & MiscFeature & Alley** : The missing values have a meaning            \n                   ","4e29f6fa":"So missing values are : **LotFrontage** and **Electrical**","6c28159a":"The next step is to chekch data description file to see if there is a meaning of NA value for certain variables. For example in the description file we find: \n    \n    FireplaceQu: Fireplace quality\n\n       Ex\tExcellent - Exceptional Masonry Fireplace\n       Gd\tGood - Masonry Fireplace in main level\n       TA\tAverage - Prefabricated Fireplace in main living area or Masonry Fireplace in basement\n       Fa\tFair - Prefabricated Fireplace in basement\n       Po\tPoor - Ben Franklin Stove\n       NA\tNo Fireplace\n\t\t\n","1c0816ae":"**Now, I'm gonna compute the percentage of missing values**"}}
