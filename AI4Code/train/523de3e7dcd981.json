Can we quantify how much more likely an athlete is to win a medal given that they satisfy certain criteria? For concreteness, we'll focus on female swimmers. Note that in the following analysis, individual swimmers are counted multiple times, but as we are considering physique and age, this makes sense as these attributes can change over time for a single person, potentially affecting their ability to win medals. \n\nI'm going to hypothesize that height, weight, and age all have some kind of predictive value on whether an athlete will win a medal. To get a sense, let's plot the distributions of heights, weights and ages both for gold medalists and non gold medalists. ","3ad8db09":"We get really poor recall scores! I suspect that's because our model predicts *'no medal'* for most athletes, which is true, but not very helpful for recalling those athletes that *did* get a medal! To see whether this is true, we train the model on the full data set, and have a look at the fraction of data points that are predicted to be medalists by the model, compared to the true medalist distribution. ","63a29c9f":"There are quite a few missing Age, Height, and Weight values, but not quite on the scale of hundreds of thousands, which is the size of the data set.

NaN values in the Medal feature indicate that no medal was obtained, so a high value there is not concerning. ","48775f55":"### 4.2 Precision: being sure about your predictions \n\nWe can also look at another metric, which is precision. This essentially measures the accuracy of positive predictions. In other words, for those entries predicted to be medalists, were they correct? This is computed as the number of true positives divided by the total number of positives predicted (true positives plus false positives)\n\nWith some wishful thinking and anthropomorphism, our model might be being very conservative about its positive predictions, only saying \"Medalist!\" when it's really sure. We can see whether that's true by measuring the precision score on a cross-validated set.  ","ff336a64":" This time, the volume under each surface shown above should sum to one. We can see that the weight \/ height distribution of medalists is shifted up and right compared to the non-medalists distribution. This implies that medalist swimmers are heavier and taller on average. The distributions here again look roughly Gaussian, and from the way they are skewed, we can tell that weight and height are positively correlated, i.e. tall people tend to weight more and vice versa, and this makes intuitive sense.

","8b4c4ce6":"### 1.3 Visualize the distributions of numerical data \n\nLet's look at a few basic properties of the data set to get a feel for it. Let's look at the Age, Height, Weight and Year features since they're all numerical values and check whether their distributions over the whole data set makes intuitive sense. First, we can use the `describe()` which tells us some properties of the distributions. ","d813b3fd":"Sadly, our precision scores are poor too. This means that, even for those very few entries that the model predicted as medalists, not even they were medalists very often! (Note: the warning above tells us that the model made no positive predictions for some of the test sets, making the precision value undefined)\n\nWe've learned a valuable lesson. Although we trained a model to predict medalists with about 85% accuracy, that didn't make it a useful model, because a) it mostly predicted negative, making it useless for *identifying* true medalists, and b) even those positive predictions that it made were on mostly not correct. Perhaps age, weight, and height are just not sufficient for identifying medalists, although we have not shown that here, and will not endeavour to try to prove or disprove that statement.  In the end, we didn't quantify the likelihood of being a medalist given phyisque values (this probably requires a bit more exploration) but we did learn a lesson about accuracy, precision and recall. ","7f3f7774":"# Exploring Olympic History ","1dbc6517":"Before we start analyzing the data, let's first get a feel for all the features and roughly what they look like.

","1364f014":"### 5.1 Physique distributions with KDE\n\nEarlier we looked at the Weight, Height and Age distributions of medalist and non-medalists swimmers. To visualize the distributions, we plotted histograms, which essentially bin the data into discrete bins, which one can think of as a discrete way of estimating the distribution that generated the data. Another way to estimate the distribution generating data is kernel density estimation (KDE). This estimates a continuous distribution from the data, which makes more sense for a continuous quantity. We now use KDE on the weight and height features of female swimmers.

The area under a given section of the curve corresponds to the probability of a sample having a height \/ weight in the given section, and as such the area under the whole curve is 1. We can see that these are qualitatively similar to the histograms we computed before. Now we use the same technique to compute distributions over weight and height at the same time, so that we can visualize the *joint distribution* of weight and height, seeing how the two features co-occur. We will do this for medalist and non-medalist swimmers, and see if we can spot a difference.
