Luckily, a lot of that work has been done for us by the creators of https:\/\/github.com\/CellProfiling\/HPA-Cell-Segmentation. \n\nAnother approach would be to use a purpose-built instance segmentation model such as Mask R-CNN, which outputs individual object masks, bounding boxes, and class predictions for each objects.

Appreciate any comments + advice","6172332a":"A note about 'Negative' labels from the organiser\n\n> 1) Image-level label uncertainty The image-level labels are what we refer to as weak or noisy. During annotation, the image-level labels are set per sample (i.e per a group of up to 6 images from the same sample). This means that the labels present in the majority of the images will be annotated. For negative samples it is not uncommon that lets say 4 images show no staining, while the remaining 2 show some unspecific staining or some granular pattern. If you compare the image-level label with the precise pattern observed in any given cell from this group of images, the label will be correct for the vast majority of cells, but perhaps not for all of them (as in your example 1 and 3 above).\n\n> 2) Single cell label accuracy in test set The test set consists of images where each single cell has been annotated independently. Hence the accuracy of these labels is much better, and will be correct for each cell in every image. The statement below made by Trang Le, @lnhtrang, in our notebook explaining the patterns is correct for how the test set was annotated.\n\n\nSo in other words, in some of the 'Negative' samples, one or two of the cells in the image may in fact have a protein pattern, but most will not. ","614412a0":"This notebook contains some basic EDA and notes about segmentation as it pertains to the HPA Single Cell Classification competition. I am a beginner in this field, and explaining my work as I go is as much for my benefit as anyone else's, so I appreciate any advice\/corrections etc. ","258b9828":"The first segmentation technique that I will implement is a graph-based technique first proposed by Felsenzwalb. It involves representing our image as an undirected graph G = (V,E) of vertices and edges, with each vertex being a single pixel and each edge connecting a pair of two vertices. An edge has a 'weight' which is given by the distance between the two vertices (pixels) in the edge. The distance metric is the difference in colour, intensity, and location. \n\nA segmentation solution is a partition of V into multiple connected components. Starting with each pixel in its own component, the segmentation is arrived at through a 'bottom-up' technique. \n\nThe basic idea is that a if the distance metric between two components is small compared to the internal difference of both those components, then merge the two components, otherwise do nothing. \n\nThe higher the scale factor 'k', the higher the threshold for a decision to label two components to be separate. So higher k will give us larger components\/segments.\n\nFor more information on how the algorithm works see http:\/\/cs.brown.edu\/people\/pfelzens\/papers\/seg-ijcv.pdf\n","f7fcdc68":"As we can see, this approach runs into problems where cells overlap, as is the case with much of our dataset. ","b298d6f8":"**Defining the problem**  \n\nThis is a weakly supervised classification problem. The training labels are given at the image level, and we are tasked with predicting labels at the cell level. We will therefore have to identify each cell in each image, segment them, and classify them individually. \n\nThe labels themselves refer to the 'subcellur protein localization patterns of single cells'. We have 17 classes of these patterns, and a 'negative' class.\n\nThe challenge here will be segment the images correctly, and then find a way to use the imprecise labels to classify our segmented cells accurately. The problem can therefore be framed as an instance segmentation problem. \n\nFor each image in the test set, you must predict a list of instance segmentation masks and their associated detection score (Confidence). The submission csv file uses the following format:\n\nImageID,ImageWidth,ImageHeight,PredictionString  \nImageAID,ImageAWidth,ImageAHeight,LabelA1 ConfidenceA1 EncodedMaskA1 LabelA2 ConfidenceA2 EncodedMaskA2 ...  \nImageBID,ImageBWidth,ImageBHeight,LabelB1 ConfidenceB1 EncodedMaskB1 LabelB2 ConfidenceB2 EncodedMaskB2 \u2026\n\n\nNote that a mask MAY have more than one class. If that is the case, predict separate detections for each class using the same mask.\n\n","912b534f":"19 different training labels, want to look at their distributions in the training set. \n\nWhich are more common, do they tend to occur together?","94b39e80":"Thresholding pretty clearly isn't going to be the answer given that the task is to segment the individual cells in the image, and the background is already completely distinct.","254ec42f":"So we are submitting a list of masks, their respective labels, and the respective confidences with which these label predictions were made. \n\nThe submissions are evaluated using Mean Average Precision, or mAP.

It is built on top of a segmentation algorithm such as Felzenszwalb. \n\nIt is a hierarchical grouping algorithm, iteratively grouping together the most similar regions (which were obtained by Felzenszwalb), until a stopping point determined by the min_size parameter. \n\nsigma is a Gaussian blur parameter to smooth the image.  \n\n\nNote, while this algorithm returns bounding boxes, not the image masks we will need for submission,it will be interesting to see if it can reliably identify individual cells, especially when their boundaries overlap.
