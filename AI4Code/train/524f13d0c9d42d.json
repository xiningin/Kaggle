At the starting stage of Parkinson's disease, you may notice your face show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.\n\nThis is a very serious disease and predicting it's progression in the early stage is very necessary. So, in this notebook I will perform some operations on a Parkinson's Disease dataset to prepare a model to predict Parkinson's Disease. To be honest I did not make this notebook at first. It was already made by some one else but, I tried to do some operations of my own. Could not bring much improvement but, since I made it I am sharing my project. Check it out. Hope you will like it.","4ef34190":"### SPLITTING DATA","d75d94e5":"# PARKINSONS DISEASE PREDICTOR","02c040a5":"Importing Modules","b6063690":"So, we have finally trained the model with all the data.

Not perfect yet pretty good. So, we will train the final model again with all the data in the dataset for the last time and this will give us the ultimate model that we are looking for."}}
