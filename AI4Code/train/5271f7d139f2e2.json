n_mels when we compute a mel-spectrogram(and is equal to n_fft when we don't use the mel scale). If you scroll down, you'll see that we have a lot of black bars when we have too many mels. This is because when librosa converts a spectrogram to the melscale, there are points where it doesn't have enough data from the linear scaled fft buckets to fill in the logarithmically scaled mel buckets. If we increase n_fft, they will go away, but not without a cost. ","83607540":"Now we can see, just like when we plotted the audio, the x-axis is time, but now, instead of the amplitude of the wave on the y-axis, we have the frequency. The y-axis is also no longer linear, each new tick doubles the frequency, with a max frequency, or fmax of 8000. Also, this isn't a line graph like the raw waveform, instead of a single value at each timepoint on our x-axis, we have many. Every point in the square represents the energy at the **frequency of it's y-coordinate at the time of it's x-coordinate**. \n\nTake the point 1 second in at 1024hz, it appears to be cream colored meaning the energy at that point is somewhere around 80-85db. Meanwhile at that same time, 4096hz appears to be purple and have about 40dB of energy. That means that at t = 1 second, the sound with 1024hz is around 10000 times louder than sound at 4096hz. 10^((80-40)\/10) = 10^4 = 10000.\n\nLet's check out the min, max, and mean of the spectrogram. Remember, the units for these are all decibels. ","b3bde63d":"### Full explanation of STFT, hop_length, and n_fft: \n\nFeel free to skip this, especially if audio is new to you.\n\nRemember how we wanted to split a signal into chunks, and then compute the fourier transform of each chunk to see how the frequencies were changing over time? The STFT is taking your signal and splitting it into those chunks. Hop_length is the size (in number of samples) of those chunks. If you set hop_length to 100, the STFT will divide your 52,480 sample long signal into 525 chunks, compute the FFT (fast fourier transform, just an algorithm for computing the FT of a discrete signal) of each one of those chunks. \n\nThe output of each FFT will be a 1D tensor with n_fft # of values, each value is the magnitude of the energy for a particular range of frequencies, at that chunk of time. For example, if our min and max frequencies (something we havent covered yet) are set to 0hz and 8000hz, and my n_fft is 100, every FFT will chop that frequency range into 100 baskets, 0-80hz, 80-160hz, 160-240hz...7920hz-8000hz, and will then perform an fft on each chunk of 100 samples, and will return a 1D tensor where the first value is the magnitude of the energy in the 0-80hz range for the first 100 samples, the second value is the energy in the 80-160hz range for the first 100 samples and so on. That tensor is then rotated and becomes the first column of our STFT image. If you are not using the mel_scale, you will have n_fft as the height of your images, but if you are using the mel-scale, the height of your image will be determined by the number of mel filters you use, the parameter `n_mels`, something that is much simpler than it sounds, and that we will discuss next","c9c68332":"To use 3Blue1Brown's analogy, we've mixed together 3 colors of paint, and it seems impossible to separate them, but if we do a fourier transform using `scipy.fft`. Don't worry about understanding the code below, you will not need to do manually fourier transforms. The only things worth noting are that the FT has a real component (magnitude) and an imaginary one (phase) and we only capture the real. Also fourier transforms output symmetric data so we are only taking the first half. ","53fe1b34":"Next we use the mel-scale instead of raw frequency. `librosa.feature.melspectrogram` can take either a raw spectrogram and convert to mel-scale, or a raw signal, compute the spectrogram, and then convert. We will use what we generated in the above cell, but usually you'll want to pass the signal directly. ","ac120fa4":" ## Short-time fourier transform ","bd70e136":"Audio is a continuous wave that is \"sampled\" by measuring the amplitude of the wave at a given time. How many times you sample per second is called the \"sample rate\" and can be thought of as the resolution of the audio. The higher the sample rate, the closer our discrete digital representation will be to the true continuous sound wave. Sample rates generally range from 8000-44100 but can go higher or lower. \n\nIn our example, the audio was sampled 16000 times per second, so our data is  a 1 dimensional tensor with length 16000*time in seconds = 52480 samples\n\nOur signal is just a numpy array with the amplitude of the wave","b30957eb":"## n_mels","69a8f0bf":"To understand exactly what is happening inside the STFT, let's start playing with our first spectrogram parameters, n_fft, and hop_length.

This is due to the way melspectrograms are constructed, and somethign we'll cover later in the 'n_mels' section. If you go back and try it again with `mel_scale`=False, you'll see that they still stretch, but what appears to be additional information that we are losing on the mel_scale is actually information that is disproportionately unimportant to discriminating between sounds that we care about. \n\nYes, we will lose the ability to differentiate between an 8050hz sound and an 8060hz sound, but this is an ability that humans don't have and will never impact your models accuracy on a human-centric problem like speech-recognition. That being said, keep in mind that if your application does depend on being able to differentiate between sounds in a way that a human cannot, the mel-scale might not be a good idea.\n\nNow we do the same with hop_length, using an n_fft of 850. ","3b5115a9":"The mel scale is a human-centered metric of audio perception that was developed by asking participants to judge how far apart different tones were.

This makes intuitive sense as the frequency of the first was doubled and the frequency of the second only increased 10%. Like other forms of human perception, hearing is not linear, it is logarithmic. This will be important later as the range of frequencies from 100-200hz convey as much information to us as the range from 10,000-20,000hz.

Thus something that is 20dB louder has 100x (10*10) the amount of energy, something that is 25dB louder has (10^2.5) = 316.23x more energy. \n\nThe lowest audible sound, near absolute silence, is 0dB and we refer to other sounds based on how many times more energy they have than a 0dB sound. A dishwasher is ~30dB, or 10^3 = 1000x louder. Here is a nice chart taken from: https:\/\/boomspeaker.com\/noise-level-chart-db-level-chart\/\n\n![image.png](https:\/\/boomspeaker.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/DB-LEVEL-CHART-LOUD.jpg)\n\nThe range of human perception is vast, from a base of 0dB up to 100dB (an amount that will damage your hearing), is a range of 10^10, or 10,000,000,000x. A doubling of energy will only increase the dB level by ~3dB. If we don't use a logarithmic scale, we would squish whispers and rustling leaves, and even normal conversation out of existence. Thus is it is important that we measure our spectrograms be on the decibel scale for most of our applications. \n\nDeep dive for decibel scale: http:\/\/www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au\/jw\/dB.htm","6d701337":"The n_fft is making our images taller, and more spaced out, but the bars for an individual frequency remain the same size. Thus when we increase n_fft in our stft, we have more resolution in the frequency dimension, and can distinguish between more possible frequencies. If we set the n_fft too low, they all get smashed together. Let's try again with our real world speech data, this time narrowing the range to lower values so we can more easily see the impact","067d2501":"Most libraries will pass back a tuple with signal (y) and a sample rate (sr). \n\nNote the sr=None, librosa has an annoying habit of \"resampling\" or changing the sample rate automatically, unless you tell it not to. More about resampling is included later ","fe44c0a6":"So it looks like spectrograms have a built in min, mean, and max, that's nice. Let's see what type of object a spectrogram really is so we can see what else we can do.","0deac6b9":"## Basics of Librosa, audio signals, and sampling","3a015b71":"The best way to understand what changes will happen as you mess with these variables, is to mess with these variables and see what happens. First at a base level by looking at the spectrograms and trying to understand and then actually try training one of the audio datasets, but seeing how changing a variable like n_fft or hop_length (while keeping everything else the same) impacts training, in the same way that you do with normal ML hyperparams like learning rate or image_size.","a62f5522":"As you can see there are loads, and I'm sure it's overwhelming, but the good news is that most models will train just fine with defaults, only a few of these have a big impact, and they are all pretty easy to understand, it will just take time and changing the values to see what effect it has. The bad news is that I've been lying about our starting spectrogram. Matplotlib is stretching this a lot for us, but unless we save the file as a jpg and train on that (slow) we will have small images. So let's use fastai's `Image` to see what this really looks like (hint: it's the same dimensions as the underlying numpy array)","c1943945":"Let's try a fourier transform on our example speech clip.","d1153f47":"Before running and listening to the cells below, think about the concept of sampling rate and try to predict what effect the varying sample rates will have","fcb06f40":"IPython.display.Audio also accepts a Numpy array and sample rate as arguments. ","bcda5415":"## Fourier Transforms","a9cc94d0":"Remember a spectrogram is taking a complex signal (the raw waveform) and cracking it open so that instead of the amplitude of the signal at time t, we can see the magnitude of each frequency at time t. Behind this decomposition is the fourier transform. Because it is such an important operation in science, and also so difficult to wrap your head around, many other people have done a better job explaining it than I ever could. \n\nHere is one such video: [3Blue1Brown: A Visual Introduction to the Fourier Transform](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)\n\nLet's reboot our tone generator, add some signals together, and see if the fourier transform can take them apart for us.","de28f68f":"Spectrograms become a lot less magical and a lot easier to work with when you realize they're just 2d numpy arrays. We no longer have to remember and call random functions like librosa.display.specshow, with a little tinkering (converting to pytorch, and adding a unit axis) we can just use fastai's `Image()`","bf983468":"Each melspectrogram in the last section was 128 pixels tall. That's because, by default, we set n_mels to 128. Let's try with `n_mels` what we did for n_fft and hop_length to see what effect it has. \n\nA random tip is that n_fft will be fastest when it is a power of 2 and slowest when it's prime, so convention is to just use powers of 2. Let's set that to 2^10 = 1024. What should our hop be? Let's do 2^8 = 256 for now until we figure out what impact n_mels has. ","69f58f0f":"## Spectrogram as a visual representation of audio","520d6f4d":"This signal looks impossibly complex, even when decomposed, but that's because we are adding up the energy at each frequency for the entire 3 seconds of the clip. Looking at the above image is the same as listening to a 3 second clip in an instant. We've lost our time component and are now purely in the frequency domain. \n\nTo illustrate the limitations of the fourier transform in a different way, let's take two 1 second long signals, s1 and s2, and add them so we have a new 1 sec long clip, and then let's concatenate them, so that we have a 2 second long clip composed of 2 distinct signals. ","94c3386f":"So if that's frequency, what is pitch? Pitch is a musical term that means the human perception of frequency. This concept of human perception instead of actual values seems vague and non-scientific, but it is hugely important for machine learning because most of what we're interested in, speech, sound classification, music...etc are inseparable from human hearing and how it functions. Let's do an experiment and increase the frequency of the above tones by 500hz each and see how much this moves our perception of them","b6b8fa59":"Remember how it was impossible to see the smooth cycles and frequencies in the raw waveform graph of our first audio clip? A spectrogram is an almost magical way of breaking a complex signal apart into it's constituent frequencies, and then representing that as an image. Before we get into how this actually happens, let's see what they look like and how to generate and play with them, because this is more important for training your models than actually understanding what a fourier transform is and how it works. \n\nLibrosa allows us to generate a spectrogram with the melscale directly using `librosa.feature.melspectrogram`. To demonstrate why the previous discussion of melscale and decibels was necessary, we'll first display a raw spectrogram with `librosa.stft`, then a melspectrogram, and then finally a melspectrogram on the decibel scale. \n\nsg = spectrogram, this is a raw energy spectrogram. stft = short-time fourier transform. stft returns a complex result with a real component, the magnitude, and a complex part, the phase. The complex part is typically not used in machine learning applications, but there are a few papers that suggest it is useful so you may want to experiment. For now we will discard it.","fe85f2ec":"Most of us remember frequency from physics as cycles per second of a wave. It's the same for sound, but really hard to see in the above image. How many cycles are there? How can there be cycles if it's not regular? The reality is that sound is extremely complex, and the above recording of human speech is the combination of many different frequencies added together. To talk about frequency and pitch, it's easier to start with a pure tone, so let's make one. \n\nHuman hearing ranges from 20hz to 20,000hz, hz=hertz=cycles per second. The higher the frequency, the more cycles per second, and the \"higher\" the pitch sounds to us. To demonstrate, let's make a sound at 500hz, and another at 5000hz. ","26bdfedd":"When we increase resolution in the frequency dimension (y-axis), we lose resolution in the time dimension, so there is an inherent tradeoff between the choices you make for n_fft, n_mels, and your hop_length. This is getting to the limits of my understanding, so if you feel you can explain this precisely, message me or post in the [FastAI Audio Thread](https:\/\/forums.fast.ai\/t\/deep-learning-with-audio-thread\/38123\/)\n\nIf not, just know that you can control the height of your images by setting the number of mel filters via the `n_mels` argument to `librosa.feature.melspectrogram` or if you are using fastai audio, setting the n_mels parameter in your spectrogram config. ","7971e744":"Okay, this is starting to look like reasonable. But what does any of this mean?

Images in fastai have 3 dimensions, the \nfirst, a channel dimension 1 for monochrome images, 3 for rgb. This is really black and white data but the `cmap` (colormap)\nparam displays it to us with color.

This is good to know, but since image size can be really important to training, I'm going to show you exactly how you can control the width of your spectrogram images.","37456484":"The main idea behind the short-time fourier transform is that, instead of doing an FT on the entire signal, we break the signal up into chunks, and compute the FT of each chunk to see how the frequencies of the signal are changing over time. \n\nThe demonstration below allows us to distinguish between the signals above in a way that a normal fourier transform could not. Don't worry about understanding code here, we will break it down later to learn what everything does.","b6bf42ef":"## Spectrogram parameters and how to fine tune them for deep learning","16cd8f69":"Most everything we are interested in for deep learning, noise, speech, music...etc is going to have frequencies that change over time. In speech that means from phoneme to phoneme and word to word. If we just add it all together we get a meaningless jumble of information. \n\nRemember that the end result of our spectrogram had both time and frequency information. The color of the image at pixel (x,y) represented the magnitude of frequency y at time x. The raw signal\/waveform has all time and no frequency. The fourier transform has all frequency and no time. We need something in between. \n\nWhat we really want to do is compute the fourier tranform at different points in time so that we can see the breakdown of frequencies of the sound at that time. The way to do this is through the short-time fourier transform, or STFT we saw earlier.
