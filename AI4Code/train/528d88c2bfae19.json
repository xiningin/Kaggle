With arcane customs like sex being a taboo in India, Sati, and Dowry, and the overall lower status of women further exacerbates these crimes.\n\nFrom the last decade's crime statistics, we see sharp number of crimes registered under \u2018Cruelty by Husband and his Relatives\u2019. It also appears that the same category has had the most dramatic rise over the years.\n\nThis is a surprising insight since the popular media is rife with news of rapes, which appear to be the most rampant and high profile of all the crimes. No other crime has been given as much attention in the media than Rape, with a significant increase in the last few years owing to cases like the Delhi Gang Rape, Scarlett Keeling Case in Goa, etc. which made international headlines.\n\nThe hype in the media compels us to believe that rapes are on a dramatic rise. However, the data reveals that rapes have more or less followed a flat trend.\n\nThis raises a lot of questions - if the number of rapes was always the same (or this high), why all the sudden media attention? Where was the media in earlier years? Could the data hiding the truth for the last few years?. There could be any one or more of multiple possible explanations.","5a89b3cd":"In MP max cases are registered towards \"Assault on Women & cruelty by husband\"","9983394b":"Let's take a quick look at what the data looks like:","f5072948":"In UP max cases are reported towrds \"Kidnapping & cruelty by husband\"","2278f6f7":"In WB max number of cases are refistered towards \"Cruelty by husband & Assault on Women\"","9e84b1d5":"In Rajasthan max number of cases are reported against \"Cruelty by husband & assault on women\"","b63bcdd8":"## Exploratory Analysis\n"}}
