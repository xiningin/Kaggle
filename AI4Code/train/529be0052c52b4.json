between Sedentary Minutes and Sleep time.\n\n* As an idea: **if Bellabeat users want to improve their sleep, Bellabeat app can recommend reducing sedentary time.**\n\n* Keep in mind that we need to support this insights with more data, because correlation between some data doesn\u2019t mean causation.\n\n<a id=\"share\"><\/a>\n# 6. Phase SHARE\n\nBy observing about 30 participants that most of them had high sedentary minutes, low amounts of daily steps, and some clients didn't use all of the features. \n\nThere are a lot of zeros and some of the sedentary minutes at 1440 (which is 24 hours). We can suggest that the participant either left their watch at home to charge and didn't want to use it that day, or maybe they just forgot it at home.\n\nAfter analyzing FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, I found some **insights that would help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy.**\n\n**Target audience**\n\nWomen who work full-time jobs (according to the hourly intensity data) and spend a lot of time at the computer\/in a meeting\/ focusing on work they are doing (according to the sedentary time data).\n\nAccording to the activity analysis these women do some light activity to stay healthy. But they need to improve their everyday activity to have health benefits. They might need some knowledge about developing healthy habits or motivation to keep going. \n\n**The key message for the Bellabeat online campaign**\n\nThe Bellabeat app is not just another fitness activity app. \nIt\u2019s a guide (a friend) who empowers women to balance full personal and professional life and healthy habits and routines by educating and motivating them through daily app recommendations. \n\n### Recommendations for the Bellabeat app\n\n1. Average total steps per day are 7638 which a little bit less for having health benefits for according to the CDC research. They found that taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). Taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps. Bellabeat can encourage people to take at least 8 000 explaining the benefits for their health.\n\n2. If users want to lose weight, it\u2019s probably a good idea to control daily calorie consumption. Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie lunch and dinner.\n\n3. Most activity happens between 5 pm and 7 pm - Bellabeat can use this time to remind and motivate users to go for a run or walk.\n\n4. If users want to improve their sleep, the Bellabeat app also can recommend reducing sedentary time and send notification about sleeping time.\n\n\n**Thank you** for your interest to my Bellabeat Case Study!\nI will be happy to improve my work.\n\nAnastasia Sergeeva\n","568b22e7":"### 4.3 Visualization\n\n### Graph 1.

The average sedentary time is 991 minutes or 1 hours.\n* Most of the participants are lightly active.\n* On the average the users sleep 7 hours one time per day, which is in the range of recommended hours.\n* Average total steps per day are 7638 which a little bit less for having health benefits for according to the CDC research.

The goal of this study will be to analyze and gain insight into how consumers use the **FitBit**, a popular smartwatch brand, in their daily lives and apply these insights to **Time**, the Bellabeat-created smartwatch.\n\nThe Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.
