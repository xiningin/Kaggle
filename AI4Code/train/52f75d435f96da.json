The three disciplines in modern fencing are the foil, the \u00e9p\u00e9e, and the sabre; winning points are made through the contact with an opponent. A fourth discipline, singlestick, appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped after that, and is not a part of modern fencing. Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics. Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship, the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century, with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial art of classical fencing, and the French school later refining the Italian system. There are three forms of modern fencing, each of which uses a different kind of weapon and has different rules; thus the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes: foil, \u00e9p\u00e9e, and sabre. Most competitive fencers choose to specialize in one weapon only.\nFencing has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. Women's foil made its Olympic debut in Paris, during the 1924 Olympic Games. \n<br><br>\nFoil \u2014 a light thrusting weapon; the valid target is restricted to the torso; double touches are not allowed. <br>\n\u00c9p\u00e9e \u2014 a heavy thrusting weapon; the valid target area covers the entire body; double touches are allowed. <br>\nSabre \u2014 a light cutting and thrusting weapon; the valid target area includes almost everything above the waist (excluding the back of the head and the hands); double touches are not allowed.<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/secure.i.telegraph.co.uk\/multimedia\/archive\/02246\/fencing_Eddie-Mulh_2246153b.jpg\" width=\"600px\"\/>","93317c8d":"Rowing is a sport whose origins reach back to Ancient Egyptian times.
