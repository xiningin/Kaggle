So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `reviews.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `reviews.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `reviews.iloc[0:1001]`.","a56c525c":"## 2.\n\nSelect the first value from the description column of `reviews`, assigning it to variable `first_description`.","a6d2dc5e":"## 4.\n\nSelect the first 10 values from the `description` column in `reviews`, assigning the result to variable `first_descriptions`.\n\nHint: format your output as a `pandas` `Series`.","218408a8":"## 8.\n\nCreate a DataFrame `italian_wines` containing reviews of wines made in `Italy`.
