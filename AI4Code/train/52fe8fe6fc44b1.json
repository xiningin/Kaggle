There are [many libraries in Python for working with PDFs](https:\/\/reachtim.com\/articles\/PDF-Manipulation.html), each with their pros and cons, the most common one being **PyPDF2**. We can install it with (note the case-sensitivity, we need to make sure our capitilization matches):\n\n\n    \nKeep in mind that not every PDF file can be read with this library. PDFs that are too blurry, have a special encoding, encrypted, or maybe just created with a particular program that doesn't work well with PyPDF2 won't be able to be read. If we find ourself in this situation, try using the libraries linked above, but keep in mind, these may also not work. The reason for this is because of the many different parameters for a PDF and how non-standard the settings can be, text could be shown as an image instead of a utf-8 encoding. There are many parameters to consider in this aspect.\n\nAs far as PyPDF2 is concerned, it can only read the text from a PDF document, it won't be able to grab images or other media files from a PDF.\n___\n\n## Working with PyPDF2\n\nLet's begin by showing the basics of the PyPDF2 library.","91b514eb":"## Adding to PDFs\n\nWe can not write to PDFs using Python because of the differences between the single string type of Python, and the variety of fonts, placements, and other parameters that a PDF could have.\n\nWhat we *can* do is copy pages and append pages to the end.","db7881fc":"## Reading PDFs\n\nFirst we open a pdf, then create a reader object for it. Notice how we use the binary method of reading , 'rb', instead of just 'r'.","2916b6e5":"___","222639ee":"We can then extract the text:"}}
