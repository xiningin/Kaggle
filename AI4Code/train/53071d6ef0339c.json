The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2020, using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 4.2 million accident records in this dataset.","e725eb77":"* Let's Check Out Data About Monday","4bb6d42a":"## Percentage of missing values per column","7ed66fe9":"* So As We Can See Sundays Occurs Most Accident Between 10 Am to 3 Pm.
