Specifically we are asked to predict the sales for 16 days from 2017-08-16 to 2017-08-31. In this short notebook we shall build a very simple model that uses the values of each family of product sold, for each store number, averaged over a 'look-back' window of the same length (16 days) just prior to the date range we will be predicting.","8357b027":"With this in mind ideally one should not directly calculate the mean, by rather first take the  $\\log_e(1+y)$ of the target, in this case the target is the `sales`, using the numpy [`log1p`](https:\/\/numpy.org\/doc\/stable\/reference\/generated\/numpy.log1p.html) function. Once we have done this then we can proceed to calculate the [`mean`](https:\/\/numpy.org\/doc\/stable\/reference\/generated\/numpy.mean.html) of this transformed  target, and finally invert the transform using the numpy [`expm1`](https:\/\/numpy.org\/doc\/stable\/reference\/generated\/numpy.expm1.html) to obtain our average value.\n\n### <center style=\"background-color:Gainsboro; width:60%;\">Related notebooks<\/center>\n* [Store Sales: Naive one-day model](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/carlmcbrideellis\/store-sales-naive-one-day-model)\n\n### <center style=\"background-color:Gainsboro; width:60%;\">Recommended reading<\/center>\n* [Rob J.
