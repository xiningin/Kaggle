Time series data means that data is in a series of  particular time periods or intervals.  The data is considered in three types:\n\n* **Time series data:** A set of observations on the values that a variable takes at different times.\n\n* **Cross-sectional data:** Data of one or more variables, collected at the same point in time.\n\n* **Pooled data:** A combination of time series data and cross-sectional data.\n\n<i style=\"color:royalblue;\">Time Series Analysis is used for many applications such as:<\/i>\n * Economic Forecasting\n * Sales Forecasting\n * Budgetary Analysis\n * Stock Market Analysis\n * Yield Projections\n * Process and Quality Control\n * Inventory Studies\n * Workload Projections\n * Utility Studies\n * Census Analysis\n     \n<h2 style=\"color:royalblue;\">Components of Time Series<\/h2>\nTime series data consist of four components:\n\n * Trend Component: This is a variation that moves up or down in a reasonably predictable pattern over a long period.\n\n * Seasonality Component: is the variation that is regular and periodic and repeats itself over a specific period such as a day, week, month, season, etc.,\n\n * Cyclical Component: is the variation that corresponds with business or economic 'boom-bust' cycles or follows their own peculiar cycles, and\n\n * Random Component: is the variation that is erratic or residual and does not fall under any of the above three classifications.\n\nTo make this concept more clear here is a visual interpretation of the various components of the Time Series.

Its footprint stretches over a wide range of industries, spanning automobiles (two wheelers manufacturer and three wheelers manufacturer), home appliances, lighting, iron and steel, insurance, travel and finance. The group's flagship company, Bajaj Auto, is ranked as the world's fourth largest three and two wheeler manufacturer and the Bajaj brand is well-known across several countries in Latin America, Africa, Middle East, South and South East Asia. Founded in 1926, at the height of India's movement for independence from the British, the group has an illustrious history. The integrity, dedication, resourcefulness and determination to succeed which are characteristic of the group today, are often traced back to its birth during those days of relentless devotion to a common cause. Jamnalal Bajaj, founder of the group, was a close confidant and disciple of Mahatma Gandhi. In fact, Gandhiji had adopted him as his son.\n<p>In 2007, Bajaj Auto acquired a 14% stake in KTM that has since grown to 48%. This partnership catalysed Bajaj Auto\u2019s endeavour to democratise motorcycle racing in India. Bajaj Auto today exclusively manufactures Duke range of KTM bikes and exports them worldwide.
