H2O's core code is written in Java.\n\nIt also offers an easy to use AutoML (Automatic Machine Learning) pipeline that quickly iterates through various models and then stacks them to provide a reasonable baseline.","54dd9a84":"# Tabular Playground Series - Mar 2021\n\nFor this competition, we will be predicting a binary target based on a number of feature columns given in the data.
