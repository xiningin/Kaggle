Not too surprisingly there is a jump of Gold Star Chili into the top 10. Additionally, subway is exchanged for jimmy johns, and white castle also makes an appearence while sonic and Dominos disapear. \n\nLet look more into this Ohio Chili relationship.","4ad48336":"I think it turned out okay!  We can see relatively easily that Gold Star is a big thing in Cincinatti and thats about it.  \n\n## Waffle House\nI have to say, while I'm not a chili fan, I'm a die hard Waffle House consumer..  \n \n (I ran out of time..

Color identifying if its a Gold Star or not..  I'm hoping it gets close to mapping it onto a grid of Ohio coordinates.  I don't think Seaborn has any in house geo plotting functions?\n\nNOTE: I'm not too much of a chili fan.. I actually don't even eat meat.. Just an interesting abnormality in the data I noticed and dove into ^.^","d09451db":"First two are not too much of a surprise given their populations in comparison to other states.. Ohio (my home state) is a surprise.\n\nDoes ohio tend to the typical fast foods of the nation?","247c8509":"How about top states for fast food?","6a61bfd8":"So as I expected Gold Star Chili is contained in a very small radius.. Two states total. Impressive that a local chain such as this can make it into the top 10 for the state of Ohio. \n\nLets prep for one more.. possibly weird.. chart.","2626aabb":"## Plots\n\nLets first look at what fast food chains America seems to like the most."}}
