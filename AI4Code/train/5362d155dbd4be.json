Technically when there is a true difference, we can stop at any point in time and we will end up choosing the winner at varying degrees of probability (this is a clear improvement from the frequentist approach where we can only say we are not sure most of the time). We can also use a simple rule like if the probability of `A` beating `B` is lower than 10% or greater than 90%, we declare a winner like the plot above.\n\nStopping criteria for experiments such as ROPE and expected loss as described in [Bayesian A\/B Testing: a step-by-step guide](http:\/\/www.claudiobellei.com\/2017\/11\/02\/bayesian-AB-testing\/); here we are using **value remaining** as introduced by [Google](https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/2846882?hl=en). Value remaining per round of experiment is defined as:\n\n$$V_t = \\frac{rate_{max}-rate_{opt}}{rate_{opt}}$$\n\nAs experiment goes on, we plot the distribution of $V_t$ and stops when the $1-\\alpha$ percentile is lower than our threshold. Intuitively, this is to say that we are $1-\\alpha$% confident that our \"best\" arm might be beaten by the margin equals to the threshold. For practical purpose, we try 95th percentile and threshold of 1%.","afcd1fa6":"We can see that for events that acts like a Bernoulli trial the posterior distribution takes a very convenient form. What we need to do is simply choose a reasonable set of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for the prior. This is where our assumption factors into a Bayesian A\/B test. One way is to set the prior based on past campaign performance; for instance, if we have run this type of campaign and had the average conversion rate of 10%, we can scale the prior according to how certain we are about the conversion rates. Note that different priors can represent 10%, for instance $Beta(1,9)$ and $Beta(10,90)$, but at different level of certainty. See how $Beta(10,90)$ is more pointy around 10% than $Beta(1,9)$.","d354c441":"One way to determine which variation is better is to look at the posterior distributions and their expectations; however, that does not tell us the margin of difference. Since we have a posterior distribution for each variation we can derive what people sometimes confuse with the frequentist p-value: **what is the probability that one variation is better than another?** One way to do this is by using Monte Carlo simulation to draw a large number of samples from each posterior then calculate the percentage of times each sample won.","763c4d3d":"The core idea of Bayesian A\/B testing is to formulate a posterior distribution for each variation. Recall that frequentist approach does not do this; it instead first assume a null hypothesis that there is no difference between the variations and see the data to determine the false positive rate. The advantage is that we can have hypotheses directly about the true values we are interested in such as the conversion rate for each variation. The cost is that now we cannot leverate central limit theorem to assume normal distribution for our hypotheses; instead we need to construct our own distributions, called **posterior distriubtion**, using Bayes' Rule:\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(H|D) &= \\frac{P(H \\cap D)}{P(D)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{P(D)} \\text{; chain rule of probability}\\\\ \n& = \\frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{\\sum_{j=1}^k P(D|H_j)P(H_j)} \\text{; summing over all possible hypotheses}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $H$ is the hypothesis or model and $D$ is the data or evidence\n\n* $P(H|D)$ is the probability of the hypothesis being true given the observed data, called the **posterior**. This is the distribution we use to estimate the true values such as true conversion rates in the Bayesian approach.\n* $P(D|H)$ is the probability of seeing the data given that the hypothesis is true, called the **likelihood**, this is similar to p-value of rejection of the null hypothesis under frequentist approach.\n* $P(H)$ is the probability of the hypothesis being true aka our belief in the hypothesis, called the **prior**. Refer to a table of [conjugate priors](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conjugate_prior) to choose the suitable prior for your posterior and likelihood.\n* $P(D)$ is the probability of the data being present, called the **evidence**.

Consider the following problem. We are running an online ads campaign `A` for a period of time, but now we think a new ads variation might work better so we run an experiemnt by dividing our audience in half: one sees the existing campaign `A` whereas the other sees a new campaign `B`. Our performance metric is conversion (sales) per click (ignore [ads attribution problem](https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1662518) for now). After the experiment ran for two months, we obtain daily clicks and conversions of each campaign and determine which campaign has the better performance.\n\nWe simulate the aforementioned problem with both campaigns getting randomly about a thousand clicks per day. The secrete we will pretend to not know is that hypothetical campaign `B` has slightly better conversion rate than `A` in the long run (10.5% vs 10%). With this synthetic data, we will explore some useful statistical concepts and exploit them for our frequentist A\/B testing.","cd710a5f":"## Derive The Posterior Distribution","05e99aff":"In our case, the likelihood that we would see this set of clicks and conversions data given that the true conversion rate is `p` can be described as the probability mass function of a Bernouilli distribution:\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(D|H) &= \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p^{x_i} (1-p)^{1-x_i} \\\\\n&= p^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i} (1-p)^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1-x_i)}\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere $x_i$ is the binary flag for conversion and `p` is the true conversion rate by the hypothesis $H$.\n\nThe prior is a beta distribution with the following probability density function:\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(H) &= \\frac{p^{\\alpha-1} (1-p)^{\\beta-1}}{B(\\alpha,\\beta)} \n\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are hyperparameters correlated with number of successes and failures respectively, and $B(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is the beta function to normalize the distribution to be between 0 and 1. Intuitively, the beta distribution is shaped by the number of successes and failures initialized by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$; moreover, higher number means we are more certain about our distribution thus resulting in less variance:"}}
