And it drastially dropped by the next elections in 1977 to 47%. The drop in turnout was to be expected becasue the country had goen through such serious conditions. Bangaldesh was seperated and formed as independent state. The people were in shock and they were not ready to participate in the elections.in 1988 general elections the turnout further dropped to 44%. After the martial law lifted, and announced the elections PPP headed by Benazir Bhutto has again secured highest votes defeating the alliance of 9 parties under the umbrella of IJI ( Islami Jamhoori Ittehad). This trend having more or less than 2-3% change continue till 1997 when it reached 36%. Turn out in the elections of 1997 was significantly low becasue the elected government was dimissed by the then President Farooq Laghari. The supporters of PPP was not happy with the decision. Political leaders of PPP were detained in corruption charges. Most of the supporters have not taken part in electiosn despite the contest of leadership. After the electiosn of 1997 two mainly two party elections were started to held in the country. After 1997 the turnout started to rise again and till now the there is highest turnout in 2013 where it reached 53%. \nFrom the graph we can also see the average turnout of past 10 elecions is 42.5%.","1c77e276":"## Boxplot","e76aa431":"## Read Dataset","7adf670d":"## Activity 3","a02846ca":"## Analysis\nThe Graph is negatively skewed.
