The first two blocks follow the same structure:\n1. Apply a Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel size and valid padding, then another Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel but with same padding to keep the same dimensions\n2. Apply a BatchNormalization layer to avoid layers being too depended from one another and allowing each activation to have 0 mean\n3. A RELU activation and a MaxPooling2D layer with 2x2 kernel size and stride=2\n4. An element-wise Dropout layer applied to MaxPooling2D keeping 80% of the activation units\n\nThe final 2 layers consists of a Fully Connected Layer that uses a Softmax activation for classification.","cdc44697":"Here 1 is black and 0 is white....after normalization\n\nSmaller size helps us visualise better?","21744b09":"## Training and Prediction\n\nWe will train the model for 50 epochs, with a batch size of 64.","59698ddf":"# Get trian and test data","61a59145":"### Model Compilation\n\nHere we will use an Adam optimizer with a Cross entropy loss function.","d778c089":"You can make verbose=0, in the code above if you dod not  want to see each step in the process","a54a1db7":"##  Display images\n\nTo check whether everything worked as expected, let's take a look at a few images from each folder.","be907290":"As you can see 20 epochs should have been fine.
