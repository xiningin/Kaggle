Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is a first step in analysing a new dataset. The primary objective of EDA is to analyse the data for distribution, outliers and anomalies in the dataset. It includes analysing the data to find the distribution of data, its main characteristics, identifying patterns and visualizations. It also provides tools for hypothesis generation by visualizing and understanding the data through graphical representation.<\/span>\n\n* <span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Feature Engineering is the Second Step one should follow while doing any Machine Learning Project. In this step we perform the following things:\n          \n          Handle the Missing Values if any.\n          Handling the Outliers.\n          Handling the Categorical Data.\n          Normalizing the Data for further Model building.\n    \n    \n* <span style=\"font-size:20px;\">The third Step is Feature Selection.

There are numerous unfavourable impacts of outliers in the data set:\n\n* It increases the error variance and reduces the power of statistical tests\n* If the outliers are non-randomly distributed, they can decrease normality\n* They can bias or influence estimates that may be of substantive interest\n* They can also impact the basic assumption of Regression, ANOVA and other statistical model assumptions.\n    \n    ","a7f0b1cc":"## THE DATA IS NOW BALANCED !!!!!!!!!","d280c21f":"## EDA\n\n* <span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.
