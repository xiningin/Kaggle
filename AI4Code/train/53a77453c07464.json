How should we define \"how well\"? What is this score being used for? That additional context would be useful, however let's begin to break out the problem. \n\n\n### TL:DR\n\n- Methodology used was to create a relative score based on percentage of people fully vaccinated\n- The benefits are\n1. We can better compare how countries are doing relative to others\n2. Our scores fit a normal distribution which makes other type of modeling and analysis easier\n3. The results are easy to communicate. \n\n\n### Approach \n- Pre-process data: Check data for NA, 0 or other issues.\n- Methodology: people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred as the topline metric. This is easily interpretable and can be analyized quickly. The final score provided is a relative score of the percentage of people fully vaccinated. I noticed that the data had a log-normal distribution, so I transformed it to fit a normal distribution. This way, the score could be easily implemented into a more sophisitcated model or analysis. \n  - Without having qualitaive analysis of how the different factors such as GDP\/capita, population\/density, pre-vaccine covid conditions, vaccine utilization, and how they correlate to the topline score, it made more sophisitcated scoring method difficult to produce. Given domain knowledge at this point in time, I stuck with the simpler approach. \n\n### Future work\n- What other factors impact the vaccine rollout that could be included in the score?\n    - Prior-covid cases\/deaths: If a country has a higher proportion of the world cases, then vaccines should be prioritized to them\n    - GDP\/captia: Developed countries have more resources and as a result will likely obtain a larger volumes of the vaccines realtive to poorer counties.\n    - Vaccine utilization: Based on how many vaccines available to the country, how effective is the country at distributing them? \n    - supply chain limitations\n- Create a time series of the scores and see how countries perform over time? Compare scores with a third dimension which is days from first vaccination. (ie lets say USA first vax was start of Decemnber and Japan was a month later, comparing those two at isn't necessairly equivalent) \n- Improving quality of data. There was a lot of missing data. This analysis took a lot of that into consideration.  \n\n   \n","3bb7e9b6":"The benefits are\n1. We can better compare how countries are doing relative to others\n2.
