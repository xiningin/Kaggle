column","00a78ca0":"<h2>What is Stroke<\/h2>\nA stroke is a sudden interruption in the blood supply of the brain. Most strokes are caused by an abrupt blockage of arteries leading to the brain (ischemic stroke).  Other strokes are caused by bleeding into brain tissue when a blood vessel bursts (hemorrhagic stroke). Because stroke occurs rapidly and requires immediate treatment, stroke is also called a <b>brain attack<\/b>. When the symptoms of a stroke last only a short time (less than an hour), this is called a <b>transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke.<\/b>\n\nThe effects of a stroke depend on which part of the brain is injured, and how severely it is injured. Strokes may cause sudden weakness, loss of sensation, or difficulty with speaking, seeing, or walking. Since different parts of the brain control different areas and functions, it is usually the area immediately surrounding the stroke that is affected. Sometimes people with stroke have a headache, but stroke can also be completely painless. It is very important to recognize the warning signs of stroke and to get immediate medical attention if they occur.\n\n<h2>Types of Stroke<\/h2>\n<h3>Ischemic Stroke<\/h3>\nThe most common type of stroke, accounting for almost 80 percent of all strokes, is caused by a clot or other blockage within an artery leading to the brain.\n\n<h3>Intracerebral Hemorrhage<\/h3>\nAn intracerebral hemorrhage is a type of stroke caused by the sudden rupture of an artery within the brain. Blood is then released into the brain compressing brain structures.\n\n<h3>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage<\/h3>\nA subarachnoid hemorrhage is also a type of stroke caused by the sudden rupture of an artery. A subarachnoid hemorrhage differs from an intracerebral hemorrhage in that the location of the rupture leads to blood filling the space surrounding the brain rather than inside of it.\nSource: http:\/\/www.strokecenter.org\/patients\/about-stroke\/what-is-a-stroke\/","057f0ad2":"Made things worse","dc0c4067":"<img src=\"https:\/\/vascular.org\/sites\/default\/files\/gallery\/Stroke_hemorrhagic_0.jpg\">\n\nsource:https:\/\/vascular.org\/sites\/default\/files\/gallery\/Stroke_hemorrhagic_0.jpg","d7126914":"Conclusion:<br>\nStroke starts from age 38 and incerases with age.<br>\nDataset have spike of persons age having 78.","3a95383d":"## Data transformation","ec7f06a5":"Not much difference","93e4efb1":"<h2>Data Exploration<\/h2>","aac69102":"Conclusion: <br>\nBMI have 40 NA values with stroke positive.<br>\nFind corelation of bmi to fill na.","b92971f7":"Conclusion: <br>\nIn dataset female data is more then male.<br>\nOther count is only 1, We will make it female since mode is female\n","8b2cfd7e":"### Defining class weights","2d0f5280":"Conclusion: More glucose -> More strokes? :\/","22498372":"<h1>Stroke Prediction<\/h1>","97062a85":"Conclusion: age is most corelated column","1003c301":"Conclusion: Linear regression works well","bee080d4":"Conclusion:\n1.
