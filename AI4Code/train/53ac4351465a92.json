They urged these companies to immediately start developing coronavirus detection kits for mass production and promised to give emergency approval.\n\nWithin two weeks, although confirmed cases remained not so much, over 10,000 of test kits were shipped every day in South Korea.\nSouth Korea has far more coronavirus tests than any other country, which allows many people to be quarantined and treated shortly after infection, minimizing the spread. If the test result is positive, the health worker will trace the patient's recent activity and track the contact. Once a new case is found, the Korean\u2019s mobile phone will vibrate and an emergency alert will be issued. By early detection and treatment of infections, and isolation of mild patients to special centers, South Korea managed to leave all hospitals to critical patients. The country\u2019s case fatality rate is just over 1%, one of the lowest in the world.\n\nAnd also, TV broadcasts, subway station announcements, and smartphone reminders will constantly prompt people to wear masks, instruct people how to stay away from others, and report infection data for the day to get people's daily participation.","dbcdaffe":"# Day to day cases","d42cc0d9":"reference\uff1a\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/COVID-19_pandemic_in_South_Korea\n\nhttps:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2020\/05\/08\/asia-pacific\/science-health-asia-pacific\/south-korea-coronavirus-seoul-nightclubs\/#.XuWMHC-tY6U\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/23\/world\/asia\/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html","6f8357cc":"# Informative Table","0a54cfd3":"# Excercise6 - Corona cases in South Korea\n\n20M51955 - Qiao Yu","86b58fa2":"# Interactive chart\n\nThe first peak of the outbreak in South Korea came in late February.
