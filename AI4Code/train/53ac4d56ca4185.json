However , the timing of take-offs of civilizations differ, with societies in Americas taking off quite later than those of Eurasia and Europe. There's also a major difference between the rate of change and level of social complexity reached by 1900s(colonial times). It can be clearly seen that more complex societies of Americas emerged later than those of Europe and Eurasia.The difference in the values indicate that societies in America were not as complex as those of Eurasia at the time they came into contact with each other. This could be one of the contributing factors to the invasion and colonization of Americas by European countries.","89147285":"There are 30 unique NGAs( Natural Geographic Areas).We  call  them  \u2018NGAs\u2019  because  they  each  cover  a  geo-ecological  zone  that  has  retained  its  distinctive  character  over  the  millennia,  even  while  the  scale  and  structure  of  human  social  systems  have  changed,  often  quite  dramatically.

Social complexity reflects human behavior as it is exercised in ongoing and increasingly broader and more complicated circumstances of individual and group existence. Social complexity has emerged as the conceptual and practical framework wherein these phenomena and their relationships can be studied. \n\nA <strong>ritual<\/strong> is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, actions, or objects, performed in a sequestered place and according to a set sequence.Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a <strong>religious community<\/strong>. Rituals are characterized, but not defined, by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance.\n\nThe origins of religion and ritual in humans have been the focus of centuries of thought in archaeology, anthropology, theology, evolutionary psychology and more. Play and ritual have many aspects in common, and ritual is a key component of the early cult practices that underlie the religious systems of the first complex societies in all parts of the world.\n\nAs a deep and enduring aspect of human societies and individual psychology, religion remains an evolutionary puzzle. Considering its centrality in so many lives, however, the scientific study of religion remains a largely neglected and fragmented topic.\n\nIn his classic works,<em> The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life <\/em>, Emile Durkheim(1965) examined the significance of ritual in society. He concluded that one of ritual's major functions is the integration of the individual into the group and the maintenance and vitalization of collective order and solidarity. The performance of ritual,according to this view, expresses the collective consciousness of the social group; hence participation in ritual action reinforces conformity to collective values.\n","023ebf5b":"1.
