You have seen how to define neural networks, compute loss and make\nupdates to the weights of the network.\n\nNow you might be thinking,\n\nWhat about data?\n----------------\n\nGenerally, when you have to deal with image, text, audio or video data,\nyou can use standard python packages that load data into a numpy array.\nThen you can convert this array into a ``torch.*Tensor``.\n\n-  For images, packages such as Pillow, OpenCV are useful\n-  For audio, packages such as scipy and librosa\n-  For text, either raw Python or Cython based loading, or NLTK and\n   SpaCy are useful\n\nSpecifically for vision, we have created a package called\n``torchvision``, that has data loaders for common datasets such as\nImagenet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. and data transformers for images, viz.,\n``torchvision.datasets`` and ``torch.utils.data.DataLoader``.\n\nThis provides a huge convenience and avoids writing boilerplate code.\n\nFor this tutorial, we will use the CIFAR10 dataset.\nIt has the classes: \u2018airplane\u2019, \u2018automobile\u2019, \u2018bird\u2019, \u2018cat\u2019, \u2018deer\u2019,\n\u2018dog\u2019, \u2018frog\u2019, \u2018horse\u2019, \u2018ship\u2019, \u2018truck\u2019. The images in CIFAR-10 are of\nsize 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.\n\n![](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/_images\/cifar10.png)\n\n   cifar10\n\n\nTraining an image classifier\n----------------------------\n\nWe will do the following steps in order:\n\n1. Load and normalizing the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using\n   ``torchvision``\n2. Define a Convolutional Neural Network\n3. Define a loss function\n4. Train the network on the training data\n5. Test the network on the test data\n\n1.
