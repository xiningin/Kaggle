The hotel is being well-run and well-maintained. The rooms are rather standard for resorts of this kind. The beach is right there (not the best, though - large-grain sand and quite a bit of crushed shells). In the room, we were pleasantly surprised to find a PS-3 gaming console that can run both games and DVDs you may rent from automated kiosks (free if you have a status of certain level with Hilton).The hotel has a large, well-equipped gym (I counted 33 cardio machines plus HIIT\/pulley rack, all typical main-muscle groups strength machines, a full rack of dumbbells running through 100 lbs, balls, batons, etc. There\"s a nice spa, too.

After security visited, they would lower the volume, but we could still hear the music and their voices. As soon as security left, they started up again. We finally asked to be moved.
