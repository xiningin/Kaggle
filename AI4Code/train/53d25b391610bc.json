There are many explanations for this.\n* Damon Arnette was the biggest reach (+14) followed by Andrew Thomas (7.02), Jalen Reagor(6.4), and Austin Jackson (6.16).\n* Tristan Wirfs (-5.85) fell the most followed by Ceedee Lamb (-4.53) and Patrick Queen (-3.34). I am not listing Noah Igbinoghene here because he only appeared in one mock draft and I am hesitant to list Jeff Gladney because he only appeared 20 times. Technically Jeff Gladney fell the most (-6.5) outside of Noah.\n* Damon Arnette (0), Noah Igbinoghene (1), Clyde Edwards-Helaire (3), and Jordyn Brooks (4) were the biggest surprises - they appeared in the fewest mock drafts.\n","1619324b":"# Post NFL Draft 2020 Mock Draft Stats\n\nA day before the 2020 NFL Draft, I scrapped 47 Mock Drafts for the 1st Round only. The dataset of those drafts can be found here: [Mock Drafts 2020](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sherkt1\/mock-drafts-2020). I then provided descriptive statistics of mock draft position taken for every player that appeared in any of those mock drafts which can be found here: [stats](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sherkt1\/mock-draft-post-draft-stats). This kernel condenses the stats from these datasets and provides a quick analysis. I might continue to update if I have the time.","e04dc7ac":"# Explanation\n\n* Count: Number of Appearances in mock drafts\n* Mean, StdDev, Max, Min: of mock draft draft positions\n* Actual: actual pick position\n* 1st Round Mocked: percentage of mock drafts that had that player mocked in the first round\n* Within 1 Std. Deviation: if actual pick was within one standard deviation of the mean\n* Difference Between Mean and Actual: of mean pick postion and actual pick position\n* Damon Arnette didn't appear in any mock draft so I set his mock draft mean pick as 33 which is outside of the first round."}}
