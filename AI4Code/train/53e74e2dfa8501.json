Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via Folium.\n\n* Folium makes it easy to visualize data that's been manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing Vincent\/Vega   visualizations as markers on the map.\n\n* The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys.
