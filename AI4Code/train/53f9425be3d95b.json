Income of geographical area of consumer\n* 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet\n* 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement\n* 'City': City of consumer\n* 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male\n* 'Country': Country of consumer\n* 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window\n* 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad\n\n## Import Libraries\n\n**Import a few libraries you think you'll need (Or just import them as you go along!)**","950bbada":"** Create a classification report for the model.**","084efb77":"## Get the Data\n**Read in the advertising.csv file and set it to a data frame called ad_data.**","2a58f56f":"## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nLet's use seaborn to explore the data!\n\nTry recreating the plots shown below!\n\n** Create a histogram of the Age**"}}
