A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point.\n\n**Kurtosis** is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers.
