Answer the question: ***Did Covid have a notable effect on Crime in London through the past 24 months?***\n\nIt uses seaborn which is an extremely versatile package and I hope you will want to experiment with further. \n\nA useful tutorial that I drew the code from is located [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/data-visualization). It's very informative and assumes no prior knowledge. It provides just enough to get you started which is great! \n\nThe data is taken from my [police crime dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/benjaminfox\/london-crime-records-2019-08-01-to-2021-07-31) and has been summarised in google sheets before re-importing here.
