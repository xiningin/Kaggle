The hardest part of my project has to either be the BMI calculating part or the part where I had to find a way to put % and \/\/ in there. The easiest part had to be calculating inches to centimeters. I read my peer feedback and tried to implement it. I didn't have a way to put \/\/ and % in it. I think I planned well and the project was just right. If I had unlimited time I would try to make it give ways to loose weight.
