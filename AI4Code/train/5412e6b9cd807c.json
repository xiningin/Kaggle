I have been digging about parts of speech (POS) tagging in a sentence and found out a technique where they used hidden markov model in that. But I could't fully understand that. Moreover, in that tutorial they used Viterbi Algorithm to tag the parts of speech in a sentence. This notebook is my efforts to understand markov models and use them in code. If you want to learn along with me, you can follow along. \n\nThanks :) \n","aa0f5862":"### Creating the transition matrix\nNow let us create the transition matrix. Here each column represent the from node and each row represent the to node of the graph given in the video. Terefore the in the matrix P, $p_{ij}$ where i is the destination node and j is the source node. Now let us create the matrix. ","81e62076":"The example says that at the beginning of the month, three shops A, B and C has 200, 120 and 180 visitors. However, at the end of the month in store A, 10% goes to store B and 10% goes to store C. Similarly, in sotre B, 20% goes to sotre A and 10% goes to store C at the end of the month. In store C, 10 % goes to store A and 30% goes to store B at the end of the month. Now from this information, we can find several things like\n* What will be the number of visitors in the next month in the next month?\n* What will be the number of visitors in the $3^{rd}$ month?\n* What will be the number of visitors in the $n^{th}$ month?\n\nIn order to find them the general formula is $$X_{i+1} = P*X_{i}$$ \nwhere $ X_{i+1} =$ [Next State], <br>\n$ X_{i} =$ [Present State]<br>\nand $P = $ [Transition Probability]<br>\n\nHere the important thing is to define the transition matrix. Here each **column represent the source node** and **row represent the destination node** in the graph given in the video example. \n"}}
