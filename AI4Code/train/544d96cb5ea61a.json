Analysis Part II: Need for COVID-19 Testing Sites by County for Selected States (MN, GA, MA)","c620c6d9":"This analysis aims to determine where two pop-up testing centers should be built in the United States. A lower score in this scoring system indicates a higher need for testing centers. \n\nPart I of the analysis examines state-wide data to identify target states. Metrics (by state) used include median annual household income, median age, peak date, number of testing centers per capita, and number of testing centers per case. Only 26 states with peak dates that have not yet passed (as of April 15th) are examined in this analysis.\n\n\n\n*Sources of data include NPR for peak dates, World Population Review for median age and population data, and the Kaiser Family Foundation for median annual household income data. The data on the total number of cases per state came from the Guardian and the data on the number of test sites per state came from the members of the Get Tested COVID-19 web scraping team.*\n\n*Analysis completed by Yashi Sanghvi (Cornell '21) and Amanda Zhang (Yale '21) with Get Tested COVID-19.*","08aaea52":"From this sorted scoring table, we can see that the top 10 lowest scores (highest need) are Kansas, Minnesota, Georgia, Iowa, Oklahoma, Missouri, Texas, Massachusetts, Virgina, and Kentucky. More detailed county-level analysis will be conducted to identify zip-codes with the highest need within three of these ten states. These three states will be selected out of these 10 with consideration of unquantifiable factors along with these scores (e.g. Georgia's governor has recently reopened the state, likely increasing infection rates).","8a139ef5":"From this analysis, the top 10 counties in need all appear to be from GA, with the top three counties being Randolph, Early and Terrell. These results align with other data points suggesting that these are counties being highly impacted by the disease. All three of these counties are located in Southwest GA where [coronavirus is hitting hard](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2020\/04\/26\/coronavirus-southwest-georgia\/?arc404=true) - in several of these counties, African Americans make up most of the population and about 30% of residents live in poverty.

Metrics (by county) used include median annual household income, median age, percent poverty, total COVID-19 cases per capita, and total COVID-19 deaths per capita.\n\n**Reason Why MA was Selected:**\nMassachusetts' status as a coronavirus hotspot is confirmed by the climbing death rate. It is currently ranked [3rd in the number of COVID-19 cases](https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/health\/massachusetts-new-coronavirus-hot-spot) in the US, and these numbers are continuing to rise. Furthermore, due to the high prevalence of crowded housing in minority communities, the risk of COVID-19 spreading Massachusetts only increases.\n\n**Reason Why GA was Selected:** \nWith Georgia [re-opening businesses](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/04\/24\/opinion\/coronavirus-covid-19-georgia-reopen.html), it is even more imperative that more test centers are established in Georgia. Georgia has extremely low testing rates, with only 1% of its citizens having been tested. Its testing rate continues to fall behind that of other states while the incidence of COVID-19 cases in Georgia continue to rise. With these increased number of cases and a high population of at-risk individuals, more testing will help to identify asymptomatic carriers in Georgia.\n\n**Reason Why MN was Selected:** \nMinnesota now records over [1 coronavirus-related death every hour](https:\/\/www.startribune.com\/this-won-t-be-the-last-hard-day-minnesota-gov-tim-walz-says-as-daily-covid-deaths-hit-28\/569963432\/). With Minnesota's reopening of some workplaces, concerns of COVID-19 spreading are growing. Group-living housing, such as assisted-living facilities, are becoming hot spots for corona virus due to Minnesota's large elderly population. It is essential that there are more testing centers in Minnesota to get a better estimate of the true number of COVID-19 cases and to protect its population.\n\n*All population, median income, and percent of population in poverty data was sourced from IndexMundi\/US Census Bureau.
