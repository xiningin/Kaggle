The information is therefore limited to only what is available in the dataset.\n\nThe method that I'll be using includes a simple bag of words overlap to fetch relevant documents. The documents retrieved will be based on which keywords are used. Keywords such as 'risk', 'lung', 'vulnerab', etc. are used to mark the paper as 'is_risk' while keywords such as 'gene', 'molecule' are for 'is_research'. For the preliminary version, only those papers marked 'is_risk' are analyzed. The advantage of this approach is that it's simple and easily understood.\n\nFuture improvements can include using more advanced NLP techniques such as sentence similarity using word and character embeddings which will require more resources. Analyze full text documents using summary tools like [summy](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/sumy\/). The chosen words were manually selected based on experience however, other synonymous words or words from experts can increase the specificity and accuracy of the results.\n\nA couple of hand-picked results:\n>==========\/kaggle\/input\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/noncomm_use_subset\/noncomm_use_subset\/pdf_json\/6c7341f17bfd790cdc05b6d1010c63f4f8eb5890.json==========\nantivirals for influenza-like illness?
