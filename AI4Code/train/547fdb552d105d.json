User Based Recommender Systems\n2. Item Based Recommender Systems\n\n   * Based on previous(past) behaviours, it predicts the likelihood that a user would prefer an item.\n   * For example, Netflix uses recommendation system. It suggest people new movies according to their past activities that are like watching and voting movies.\n   * The purpose of recommender systems is recommending new things that are not seen before from people.\n\n1. User Based Collaborative Filtering\n   * Collaborative filtering is making recommend according to combination of your experience and experiences of other people.\n   * First we need to make user vs item matrix.\n       * Each row is users and each columns are items like movie, product or websites\n   * Secondly, computes similarity scores between users.\n       * Each row is users and each row is vector.\n       * Compute similarity of these rows (users).\n   * Thirdly, find users who are similar to you based on past behaviours\n   * Finally, it suggests that you are not experienced before.\n   * Lets make an example of user based collaborative filtering\n        * Think that there are two people\n        * First one watched 2 movies that are lord of the rings and hobbit\n        * Second one watched only lord of the rings movie\n        * User based collaborative filtering computes similarity of these two people and sees both are watched a lord of the rings.\n        * Then it recommends hobbit movie to second one.\n    \n2. Item Based Collaborative Filtering\n   * In this system, instead of finding relationship between users, used items like movies or stuffs are compared with each others.\n   * In user based recommendation systems, habits of users can be changed. This situation makes hard to recommendation. However, in item based  recommendation systems, movies or stuffs does not change. Therefore recommendation is easier.\n   * On the other hand, there are almost 7 billion people all over the world. Comparing people increases the computational power. However, if items are compared, computational power is less.\n   * In item based recommendation systems, we need to make user vs item matrix that we use also in user based recommender systems.\n       * Each row is user and each column is items like movie, product or websites.\n       * However, at this time instead of calculating similarity between rows, we need to calculate similarity between columns that are items like movies or stuffs.\n   * Lets look at how it is works.\n       * Firstly, there are similarities between lord of the rings and hobbit movies because both are liked by three different people. There is a similarity point between these two movies.\n       * If the similarity is high enough, we can recommend hobbit to other people who only watched lord of the rings movie\n","a1233e38":"* Now lets make a scenario, we have movie web site and \"Bad Boys (1995)\" movie are watched and rated by people. The question is that which movie do we recommend these people who watched \"Bad Boys (1995)\" movie.\n* In order to answer this question we will find similarities between \"Bad Boys (1995)\" movie and other movies.","a90d5e9a":"* As it can be seen data frame that is above, we have 4 features that are movie id, title user id and rating.\n* In order to learn item based recommendation system lets use 1 million of sample in data.","2c7683a7":"* It can be concluded that we need to recommend \"Headless Body in Topless Bar (1995)\" movie to people who watched \"Bad Boys (1995)\".\n* On the other hand even if we do not consider, number of rating for each movie is also important."}}
