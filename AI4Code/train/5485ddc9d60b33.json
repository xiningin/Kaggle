Each of the four Topography types has the same mean number of True values? There are 17 True values in every row in this 50901 rows set! These Trues are not all in the same columns either; you can simply print more rows to verify. I assume then that this value is dictated by the ruleset. Maybe I need to learn more about this game to understand why this is.","0ab8c208":"Now that we have a list of all the columns of type bool, lets create a new column to hold the count of all the True values in those columns.

The Surviving Mars Maps dataset contains a list of all the colony locations with their environmental conditions and breakthroughs available on each map. I've not played the game, nor ever heard of it, but I had some time and wanted to at least take a cursory look at the data. What I found led me to more questions than I had when I started.\n","ae1417b9":"The first question I'd like to answer:\n\nDoes non-flat topography have a detrimental effect on the good indicators of a thriving city? In other words, does the Topography type \"Relatively Flat\" have an advantage over the other three types when it comes to indicators of advanced technology, like \"Advanced Drone Drive\", \"Artificial Muscles\", \"Forever Young\", and all the other good-sounding advances?\n\nTo answer the question, we must first decide what are indicators of a thriving city. Looking at the column names, it seems that all the boolean type columns are upgrades, meaning that if you were playing the game, then you'd eventually want your civilization to have these capabilities. If that's the case, we can simply check whether the flat topography, ostensibly better areas of the map for building cities, have more True than False in these columns.","242f6329":"Ok, ... that's weird, it's 17 too. Next let's find the mean counts for \"Rough\":"}}
