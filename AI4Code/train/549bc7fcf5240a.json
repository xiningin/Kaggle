The average rating appears to lie around a 4, which is pretty impressive. It's also funny to see the density of 0 star ratings. Some people are clearly very unhappy with their experience.\n\n**An interesting note:**\n\nIn this dataset, there are 0 recorded user ratings of 0.5 stars. If this isn't a mistake in the data or a misunderstanding on my part, it's further evidence of how users rate in absolutes: they either love it or they hate it!","1f9946b2":"That's a lot of games!","ed16e7fc":"Now let's take a look at how apps are generally rated.","042dd382":"It's important to note that the 4+ category encompasses a wide variety of apps, so there are many more datapoints in the 4+ histogram.\n\nThat being said, it appears that 17+ apps generally are rated much lower than 4+ apps. Notably, 17+ apps have a surprising number of 0-star ratings. These histograms suggest that apps for mature audiences are generally more controversial or provocative, as one might expect.\n\n","92d06c7c":"**Is there a correlation between Byte Size and Price?**\n\n\nI would think that a higher byte size means more work for the developers, which would drive prices up. \n\nLet's find out!","517ed896":"**How are apps rated with different content ratings?**\n\nLet's compare the user ratings of 4+ apps and 17+ apps.","32bde632":"Apparently not. If anything, it almost seems that apps get slightly cheaper as the size increases. Weird!\n\nTo me, this suggests that the value of an app to the user isn't necessarily related to its size."}}
