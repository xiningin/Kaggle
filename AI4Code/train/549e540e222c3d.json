Box plots may also have lines extending vertically from the boxes (whiskers), indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, hence the terms box-and-whisker diagram and box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers may be plotted as individual points.","674fc1f7":"An outlier is a data point that is distant from other similar points. They may be due to variability in the measurement or may indicate experimental errors. \nMachine learning algorithms are very sensitive to the range and distribution of attribute values. Data outliers can spoil and mislead the training process resulting in longer training times, less accurate models and ultimately poorer results.","c684a9da":"###  Filling with printing method","dc6bfcac":"If we are not sure that contradictory observations are contradictory or if we want to take into account the inconsistencies in our data, suppression may be a good method.","eb9cee89":"The definition above suggests that if there is an outlier it will plotted as point in boxplot but other population will be grouped together and display as boxes.
