This clearly suggests that the mean obtained above has been heavily influenced by outliers. This is possible because the number of samples is only 2550 talks.\n\nAnother question that I am interested in is if the number of views is correlated with the number of comments. We should think that this is the case as more popular videos tend to have more comments. Let us find out.\n","b6c0656a":"Finally, in this section, let us investigate the summary statistics and the distibution of the views garnered on various TED Talks.","67032752":"* Writers are the most popular with more than 45 speakers identifying themselves as the aforementioned.\n* Artists and Designers come a distant second with around 35 speakers in each category.\n\nThis result must be taken with a pinch of salt as a considerable number of speakers identify themselves with multiple professions (for example, writer\/entrepreneur). Performing an analysis taking this into consideraion is left as an exercise to the reader.\n\nDo some professions tend to attract a larger number of viewers? Do answer this question let us visualise the relationship between the top 10 most popular professions and the views thet garnered in the form of a box plot.","3753c39c":"This analysis has actually raised extremely interesting insights. Half of the talks in the top 10 are on the lines of Faith and Religion. I suspect science and religion is still a very hotly debated topic even in the 21st century. We shall come back to this hypothesis in a later section.\n\nThe most discusses talk, though, is The Case for Same Sex Marriage (which has religious undertones). This is not that surprising considering the amount of debate the topic caused back in 2009 (the time the talk was filmed).","a8472060":"# TED Events\u00b6\nWhich TED Events tend to hold the most number of TED.com upload worthy events?

This suggests a medium to strong correlation between the two quantities. This result was pretty expected as mentioned above. Let us now check the number of views and comments on the 10 most commented TED Talks of all time.","bf5d1e5f":"February is clearly the most popular month for TED Conferences whereas August and January are the least popular. February's popularity is largely due to the fact that the official TED Conferences are held in February. Let us check the distribution for TEDx talks only.\n","4b2c629b":"# Analysing TED Talks by the month and the year\nTED (especially TEDx) Talks tend to occur all throughout the year. Is there a hot month as far as TED is concerned? In other words, how are the talks distributed throughout the months since its inception? Let us find out.\n","b41af33a":"**Hans Rosling**, the Swiss Health Professor is clearly the most popular TED Speaker, with more than 9 appearances on the TED Forum. **Juan Enriquez** comes a close second with 7 appearances. **Rives** and **Marco Tempest** have graced the TED platform 6 times.\n\nWhich occupation should you choose if you want to become a TED Speaker? Let us have a look what kind of people TED is most interested in inviting to its events.\n\n","59f2f431":"* Almost every talk has just one speaker. \n* There are close to 50 talks where two people shared the stage. \n* The maximum number of speakers to share a single stage was 5. I suspect this was a dance performance. Let's have a look.","2b4946e7":"The next question I'm interested in is the most popular days for conducting TED and TEDx conferences. The tools applied are very sensible to the procedure applied for months.","8f3ff60a":"As can be seen above, Richard Dawkins' talk on Militant Atheism' generated the greatest amount of discussion and opinions despite having significantly lesser views than Ken Robinson's talk, which is second in the list. This raises some interesting questions.\n\nWhich talks tend to attract the largest amount of discussion?\n\nTo answer this question, we will define a new feature discussion quotient which is simply the ratio of the number of comments to the number of views. We will then check which talks have the largest discussion quotient.","a54fbfa5":"**Observations**\n\n* Ken Robinson's talk on Do Schools Kill Creativity? is the most popular TED Talk of all time with 47.2 million views.\n* Also coincidentally, it is also one of the first talks to ever be uploaded on the TED Site (the main dataset is sorted by published date).\n* Robinson's talk is closely followed by Amy Cuddy's talk on Your Body Language May Shape Who You Are.\n* There are only 2 talks that have surpassed the 40 million mark and 4 talks that have crossed the 30 million mark.","e2be5b25":"The average number of views on TED Talks in 1.6 million. and the median number of views is 1.12 million. This suggests a very high average level of popularity of TED Talks. We also notice that the majority of talks have views less than 4 million. We will consider this as the cutoff point when costructing box plots in the later sections.","b00318fb":"# TED Speakers\nIn this section, we will try and gain insight about all the amazing speakers who have managed to inspire millions of people through their talks on the TED Platform. The first question we shall ask in this section is who are the most popular TED Speakers. That is, which speakers have given the most number of TED Talks.","5446eee9":"The distribution of days is almost a bell curve with Wednesday and Thursday being the most popular days and Sunday being the least popular. This is pretty interesting because I was of the opinion that most TED Conferences would happen sometime in the weekend.\n\nLet us now visualize the number of TED talks through the years and check if our hunch that they have grown significantly is indeed true.","df7bf519":"* * On average, there are 191 comments on every TED Talk. Assuming the comments are constructive criticism, we can conclude that the TED Online Community is highly involved in discussions revolving TED Talks.\n* There is a huge standard deviation associated with the comments. In fact, it is even larger than the mean suggesting that the measures may be sensitive to outliers. We shall plot this to check the nature of the distribution.\n* The minimum number of comments on a talk is 2 and the maximum is 6404. The range is 6402.. The minimum number, though, may be as a result of the talk being posted extremely recently.","798e196a":"On average, out of the top 10 most popular professions, Psychologists tend to garner the most views. Writers have the greatest range of views between the first and the third quartile..\n\nFinally, let us check the number of talks which have had more than one speaker.","3a7cfc7d":"# Most Popular Talks ","9fa68ccf":"* As expected, the number of TED Talks have gradually increased over the years since its inception in 1984.\n* There was a sharp increase in the number if talks in 2009. It might be interesting to know the reasons behind 2009 being the tipping point where the number of talks increased more than twofold.\n* The number of talks have been pretty much constant since 2009.\nFinally, to put it all together, let us construct a heat map that shows us the number of talks by month and year. This will give us a good summary of the distribution of talks."}}
