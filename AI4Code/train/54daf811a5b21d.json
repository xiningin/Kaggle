These shapes are \"rock\" (a closed fist), \"paper\" (a flat hand), and \"scissors\" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). \"Scissors\" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating \"victory\" or \"peace\") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rock_paper_scissors\n\nAn easily memorised rule determines the winner: \u201cRock breaks scissors, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock.\u201d In other words, a player who chooses rock beats one who chooses scissors; scissors in turn beats paper; paper beats rock. This yields a winner whenever the two players choose differently.","907d013b":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata @mpwolke"}}
