These hands-on exercises are targeted for someone who has worked with Pandas a little before. \nEach page has a list of `relevant resources` you can use if you get stumped. The top item in each list has been custom-made to help you with the exercises on that page.\n\nThe first step in most data analytics projects is reading the data file. In this section, you'll create `Series` and `DataFrame` objects, both by hand and by reading data files.\n\n# Relevant Resources\n* ** [Creating, Reading and Writing Reference](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/creating-reading-and-writing-reference)**\n* [General Pandas Cheat Sheet](https:\/\/assets.datacamp.com\/blog_assets\/PandasPythonForDataScience.pdf)\n\n# Set Up\n\nRun the code cell below to load libraries you will need (including code to check your answers).","e2f6e8af":"## 2.\n\nCreate a dataframe `fruit_sales` that matches the diagram below:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CHPn7ZF.png)","138670a9":"## Keep going\n\nMove on to the **[indexing, selecting and assigning workbook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/587910)**\n\n___\nThis is part of the [Learn Pandas](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/pandas) series.","f7d565ac":"## 4.\n\nRead the following csv dataset of wine reviews into a DataFrame called `reviews`:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/74RCZtU.png)\n\nThe filepath to the csv file is `..\/input\/wine-reviews\/winemag-data_first150k.csv`.","2d0e6df0":"# Exercises","1288da98":"## 1.\n\nIn the cell below, create a DataFrame `fruits` that looks like this:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Ax3pp2A.png)"}}
