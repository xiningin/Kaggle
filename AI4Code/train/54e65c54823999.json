These temperatures usually walk in opposite directions.\n\nAlso, from lag 12 and sequentially from every 12 lags there is a significant positive autocorrelation. The **PACF** shows a positive spike in the first lag and a drop to negative **PACF** in the following lags.\n\nThis behavior between the **ACF** and **PACF** plots suggests an AR(1) model and also a first seasonal difference ($Y_{t} - Y_{t-12}$).

It assumes that the past errors are going to be similar in future events.\n     * The formula for the MA(p) model is: $\\hat{y}_{t} = \\mu - \\Theta_{1}e_{t-1} + ... + \\Theta_{q}e_{t-q}$ Where $\\mu$ is the constant term, **q** is the period to be used on the $e$ term and $\\Theta$ is the parameter fitted to the errors\n     * The error equation is $ e_{t} = Y_{t-1} - \\hat{y}_{t-1}$\n     \n## <font color=green>Seasonal ARIMA<\/font>:\n\nThe **p, d, q** parameters are capitalized to differ from the non seasonal parameters.\n\n* **SAR(P)** is the seasonal autoregression of the series.\n    * The formula for the SAR(P) model is: $\\hat{y}_{t} = \\mu + \\theta_{1}Y_{t-s}$ Where P is quantity of autoregression terms to be added, usually no more than 1 term, **s** is how many periods ago to be used as base and $\\theta$ is the parameter fitted to the data.\n    * Usually when the subject is weather forecasting, 12 months ago have some information to contribute to the current period.\n    * Setting P=1 (i.e., SAR(1)) adds a multiple of $Y_{t-s}$ to the forecast for $y_{t}$\n    \n* **I(D)** the seasonal difference MUST be used when you have an strong and stable pattern.\n     * If d = 0 and D = 1: $y_{t} = Y_{t} - Y_{t-s}$ where $y_{t}$ is the differenced series and $Y_{t-s}$ is the original seasonal lag.\n     * If d =1 and D = 1: $y_{t} = (Y_{t} - Y_{t-1}) - (Y_{t-s} - Y_{t-s-1}) = Y_{t} - Y_{t-1} -Y_{t-s} + Y_{t-s-1}$\n     * D should never be more than 1, and d+D should never be more than 2. Also, if d+D =2, the constant term should be suppressed.\n     \n* **SMA(Q)** \n     * Setting Q=1 (i.e., SMA(1)) adds a multiple of error $e_{t-s}$ to the forecast for $y_{t}$\n\n\n* **S** It's the seasonal period where you are going to calculate the the P, D, Q terms. If there is a 52 week seasonal correlation this is the number to be used on the 'S' parameter\n  \n  ## <font color=green>Trend<\/font>:\n  \nWe will use [SARIMAX](https:\/\/www.statsmodels.org\/dev\/generated\/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html) to create a forecast, the following terms are a definition to the trend:\n\n * 'n' when there is no trend to be used (default).\n * \u2018c\u2019 indicates a constant (i.e. a degree zero component of the trend polynomial)\n * \u2018t\u2019 indicates a linear trend with time\n * \u2018ct\u2019 is both trend and constant. \n * Can also be specified as an iterable defining the polynomial as in numpy.poly1d, where [1,1,0,1] would denote a+bt+ct3\n"}}
