In humans, the proper functioning of organs and tissues is dependent on the interaction, spatial organization, and specialization of all our cells.  Scientists estimate there are 37 trillion cells in an adult human body, so determining the function and relationship among these cells is a monumental undertaking.  Using the latest molecular and cellular biology technologies, HuBMAP researchers are studying the connections that cells have with each other throughout the body. The resulting HuBMAP Atlas will be openly available to accelerate understanding of the relationships between cell and tissue organization and function and human health.\n\n\nThis competition, \u201cHacking the Kidney,\" starts by mapping the human kidney at single cell resolution.

A tissue sample is first preserved by fixing it in formaldehyde, also known as formalin, to preserve the proteins and vital structures within the tissue. Next, it is embedded in a paraffin wax block; this makes it easier to cut slices of required sizes to mount on a microscopic slide for examination.\n\nThe Periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS), is just a staining method.

Normal glomeruli typically range from 100-350\u03bcm in diameter with a roughly spherical shape (Kannan, 2019).\n\n\nThe dataset is comprised of very large (>500MB - 5GB) TIFF files. The training set has 8, and the public test set has 5. The private test set is larger than the public test set.\n\nThe training set includes annotations in both RLE-encoded and unencoded (JSON) forms. The annotations denote segmentations of glomeruli.\n\nBoth the training and public test sets also include anatomical structure segmentations. They are intended to help us identify the various parts of the tissue.","cc11570e":"### **What the kidney do ?**\n\n\nThe main function of the kidneys is to filter water, impurities and wastes from the blood.\n\nThe blood from the body enters the kidneys through the renal arteries. Once in the kidney, the blood passes through the nephrons, where waste products and extra water are removed. The clean blood is returned to the body through the renal veins.\n\nThe waste products filtered from the blood are then concentrated into urine. The urine is collected in the renal pelvis. The ureters move the urine to the bladder, where it is stored. Urine is passed out of the bladder and the body through the urethra.","e6eb59b4":"# Data \ud83d\udcbe","5c5a357c":"For understand the Run-length enconding (RLE) let us take an example :  consider a screen containing plain black text on a solid white background.
