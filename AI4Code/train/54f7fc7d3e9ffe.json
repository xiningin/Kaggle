Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via folium.<br>\n\n**Concepts**<br>\nfolium makes it easy to visualize data that\u2019s been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector\/raster\/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.\n\nThe library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys. folium supports both Image, Video, GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays.\n\n**Installing: **<br>\n pip install folium <br>\n conda install folium -c conda-forge\n\nThis is called the Folim Library, it's a library to show some data on maps simply. I think I'm familiar with some of the examples I'll share with you. I know you need something like this, especially for my friends from the GIS. We'll explain the school names on the map and color the special icon. According to the type of school, and also we will divide them geographically and we will learn some simple functions as an introduction in that library","21cc16d0":"We will check each row and we will add its color based on its type, then we will show it on the map and when pressed it will show the name of the school, it is simple and very easy You can read the code is very simple","cfa5d69b":"* **Mapbox Control Room:**"}}
