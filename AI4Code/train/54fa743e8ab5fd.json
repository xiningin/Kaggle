context of all the police beats in Chicago, the mean and median rankings are still pretty high for percentage of White residents, median income, and percentage of residents with at least a Bachelor's Degree. Rankings are slightly below 66th percentile for percentage of residents without a Bachelor's Degree and percentage of Black residents\n* These beats are still more than 50% White, followed by 20% Hispanic and 11% White, figures which match the percentages of the other Bottom beats\n* We see the beats in question have an avergae median income about $300 LOWER than the city-wide average and about 13% of the residents in these beats are on food stamps, about 8% lower than the city-wide average. It is strange to see the median income be lower than the city-wide average, but the percentage of residents on food stamps also lower than the city-wide average \n* These beats had about 62% of residents earning at least a Bachelor's Degree with the remaining 38% never completing college. Percentages which are still far greater than the city-wide average\n* These beats had close to 20% of its population in each of the minors, twenties, and thirties categories, a trend we continue to see in these Bottom beats. The other age groups were all close to 10%, a continuing trend again\n\n**Some Conclusions:**\n* Compared to all the other Bottom Beats, the residents of these aren't nearly as \"wealthy\", but these beats are still comprised of a large majority of White residents and many of these residents continue to be well-educated\n* Thus, we are led to assume these beats are mostly middle-class residents with a college degree. Although they may not be earning the city-wide average median income as a group, the residents of these beats maintain a self-serviceable standard of living\n* The trends of the Complaints beats suggests that complaints don't follow the trends of the other Top and Bottom beats. This is subjective to the nature of complaints, a secondary account of police action. For these bottom beats, we can specualte that the wealthier, more affluent beats that were so prevlaent in the other Bottom categories have such light police presence that complaints rarely, if ever, occur. Rather, these \"middle-class\" beats are more likely to be areas of light crime\/police patrol and are thus slightly more likely to even garner any police complaints","cdf10964":"**Now, the 20 beats at the bottom of each category:**\n\nFirst, crime:","773bd0f6":"**Key Takeaways:**\n* When we look at how these beats rank in the context of all the police beats in Chicago, the mean and median rankings are relatively low  for percentage of white citizens, Asian citizens, and Hispanic citizens (each individually) to the total population in these beats\n* However, we see these beats rank relatively high for percentage of black citizens to the population in these beats and the percentage of the population in these beats on food stamps in the context of all the police beats in Chicago\n* Black citizens make up roughly 78% of these beats residents and Hispanic residents make up roughly 18% of these beats population...a very large portion of these beats demographic makeup, but singificantly more Black citizens.

This is well-reflected in the low average and median ranking for these beats in the median income category and the beats high ranking in the 'percentage of population on food stamps' category.\n* These beats also had high rankings of residents who earned at most a High School Diploma or didn't have a High School Diploma (~50 and ~90, respectively) when compared to all police beats in Chicago.

The average median income for these beats is higher than the average median income in the bottom 20 Crime and Arrests beats and a smaller percentage of the population is on food stamps comapred to the bottom 20 Crime and Arrests beats\n* Minors, residents in their twenties, and residents in their thirties each made up close to 20% of these residents population, the smallest percentage of minors we have seen thus far and the greatest percentage of residents in their twenties and thirties we have seen. Residents in their forties, fifties, and senior citizens each made up close to 11% of these resident's population, a figure almost identical to the city-wide average for these age groups. \n*These beats also had a high ranking for residents earning at least a Bachelor's Degree (about 66% of residents) and ranked very low for residents who haven't earned a Bachelor's Degree (about 27% of residents had a High School Diploma as their highest degree, 6% didn't have a High School Diploma). However, these beats had lower levels of educational attainment than the bottom 20 arrests beats\n\n**Some Conclusions:**\n* These beats are made up of mostly \"afluent\" White residents and a smaller percentage of Hispanic (and a much smaller percentage of Black) residents than in the other Bottom 20 beats. Unsurprisingly, these beats can be categorized as more \"wealthy\" than the average Chicago beat and signficiantly more welathy than the beats with the most crime. These beats are categorically the \"wealthiest\" and have the lowest percentage of residents on food stamps we have seen thus far\n* These residents also had a higher level of educational attainment than the city-wide average. Thus, we see the residents of these beats are not only predominantly White and \"afluent\", they also have much higher levels of eduational attainment on average\n* Just based off these observations, we would assume areas with the greater concentration of White populations and with higher standards of living (even more white-dense and afluent than the other bottom beats) will have the lowest arrest rate. Areas with well-educated, extremly affluent, and predominantly white residents will be policed have very few arrests compared to the number of reported crimes in that area, both of which will be some of the lowest in Chicago","0bb9c226":"**Now, the last 20 beats in police-caused injuries:**","533666be":"**Getting some info on Chicago as a whole:**\n\nFirst, race breakdowns:","50d92848":"Ranking by school enrollment (total and each age group):","e0746208":"Now, we will look at the age breakdowns:","aace1849":"Now, we will compute the average and median ranking for the race, income, food stamp, and educational attainment categories for this data:","13ed5577":"# EDA","2671a439":"Lastly, we will look at the age breakdowns:","8cae5a41":"Now median income and food stamps:","3e51750e":"School enrollment percentages:","335d3dc5":"Now, we will compute the average and median ranking for the race, income, food stamp, and educational attainment categories for this data:","ed761d1f":"Lastly, we will look at the age breakdowns:","0d787faf":"Now, we will compute the average and median ranking for the race, income, food stamp, and educational attainment categories for this data:","4650d9d6":"Unfortunately, we are missing beat data for two of these beats...so we will have to remove them from our aggregate analysis","e08bbd2f":"Let's create percentages for each educational attainment category:","9d7a336d":"**Key Takeaways:**\n* When we look at how these beats rank in the context of all the police beats in Chicago, the mean and median rankings are relatively low  for percentage of all of the races (each individually) except Blacks to the total population in these beats (much like what we saw in the top 20 crime beats)\n* However, we see these beats rank relatively high for percentage of black citizens to the population in these beats and the percentage of the population in these beats on food stamps in the context of all the police beats in Chicago, but ranking lower than the arrest, crime, and arrest:crime beats\n* There isn't as clear a dominance of one race in this data as we've seen before, but Black residents still make up virtually 57% of these beats total population, while Hispanic and White residents make up 27% and 13% of these beats total population, respectively\n* We still see the beats in question have a low avergae median income (about $32500, which is nearly half the average income throughout all of Chicago) and about 37% of the residents in these beats are on food stamps (about 15% more than the total percent of the population of Chicago on food stamps).

Thus, we cannot necessarily assume that Black citizens are necessarily at a greater risk of police brutality, rather they are more liekly to be in areas of higher crime and arrest, inevitably lending itself to an increased chance of police brutality if we assume police brutality occurances occur with random frequency and are not subjected to any other influencers (big caveat)\n    ","c19491ac":"Lastly, we will look at the age breakdowns:","7c071702":"Let's do some aggregate measurements on this data:\n\nFirst, we will look at race percentages for these beats all together:","5c0a95d9":"Now, we will compute the average and median ranking for the race, income, food stamp, and educational attainment categories for this data:","897381a1":"Now median income and food stamps:","4710e253":"Now, we will compute the average and median ranking for the race, income, food stamp, and educational attainment categories for this data:","196937c1":"Now median income and food stamps:","00ec07fb":"Let's do some aggregate measurements on this data:\n\nFirst, we will look at race percentages for these beats all together:","f3bab99d":"Now, the educational attainment percentages:","0eeab84e":"Now median income and food stamps:","116312e1":"Unfortuantely, some of these beats are located in Chicago-O'Hare Airport and thus have no data...we will drop them from our analysis","2df85e05":"Now, income and food stamps data:","794657d4":"**Key Takeaways:**\n* When we look at how these beats rank in the context of all the police beats in Chicago, the mean and median rankings are relatively low for percentage of Black citizens and percentage of residents on food stamps \n* However, we see these beats rank slightly higher for percentage of white citizens to the population in these beats and the median income of the residents in these beats in the context of all the police beats in Chicago\n* White citizens make up roughly 62% of these beats residents.

It's also worthwhile to mention that Hispanic and White citizens make up only about 7% and 4% of these beats residents, respectively\n* We also see these beats have a much lower avergae median income (about $30700) than the average median income in Chicago and about 28% of the residents in these beats are on food stamps, which is close to the average amount of residents on food stamps in all of Chicago.

These beats can be categorized as less affluent\/wealthy than the average Chicago residentail area. Out of the three categories measured thus far, these beats are populated by the most Black residents, but have an equal standard of living (albeit all are low comapred to the average of Chicago and the US).\n* These beats also have a smaller percentage of residents with at least a Bachelor's Degree, signifying that these residents have a lower level of educational attainment than even the Top Crime beats, both of which are significantly lower than the average level of educational attainment in Chicago. The educatioanl attainment statistics for these Top Ratio beats, however, are on par with the Top Arrests beats\n* Just based of these observations, we would assume areas with greater Black populations and lower standards of living will be more active in terms of arrests to the amount of crime being reported. We would also be lead to assume that the beats with high arrest rates are among some of the poorest in Chicago and are predominantly African-American\n* These beats are also predominantly populated by minors, suggesting we have large nuclear and extended families where children and young adults far outnumber parents and older citizens, even more so than in the Top Crime beats\n","1dfae9a3":"Now ranking by each category of educational attainment:","354b9f15":"**Key Takeaways:**\n* When we look at how these beats rank in the context of all the police beats in Chicago, the mean and median rankings are at just about the 50th percentile in all categories (most in the mid 120-160 range)\n* There isn't as clear a dominance of one race in this data as we've seen before, but Black residents still make up virtually 42% of these beats total population, while Hispanic and White residents make up 26% and 27% of these beats total population, respectively.
