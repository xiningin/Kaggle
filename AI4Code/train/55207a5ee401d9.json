This can be puzzling at first.\n\nIt occurs because the training accuracy was calculated at multiple points as the network was improving (the numbers in the convolutions were being updated to make the model more accurate).  The network was inaccurate when the model saw the first training images, since the weights hadn't been trained\/improved much yet.  Those first training results were averaged into the measure above.\n\nThe validation loss and accuracy measures were calculated **after** the model had gone through all the data.  So the network had been fully trained when these scores were calculated.\n\nThis isn't a serious issue in practice, and we tend not to worry about it.","6871cfba":"# Introduction\n\nAt the end of this lesson, you will be able to use transfer learning to build highly accurate computer vision models for your custom purposes, even when you have relatively little data.\n\n# Lesson\n","6a48f18f":"### Fit Model","a83e2afa":"# Sample Code\n\n### Specify Model","505d7f49":"### Compile Model"}}
