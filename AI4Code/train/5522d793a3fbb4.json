Except Brenouille and Le Plessis-P\u00e2t\u00e9, Micro_firms are the main type of company in all cities.\n2. From Population Dimension:\n   1. Population has high correlation to number of firms with 0.94 correlation coefficient. Large population make bigger market, more options, more opportunities for more business development.\n3. From Salary Dimension:\n   1. Inequality salary phenomenon is obvious in France, the maximum salary is almost 4 times than minimum salary and 3 times than mean salary.\n   2. Gender affects salary acquisition, men always recieve more in all age groups and all job categories.\n   3. Young_age_salary has relative lower correlation with other groups of salary. Because young people are full of more uncertainty, their average wages are more unstable.\n4. From Geography Dimension:\n   1. There is no obivous correlation between Population Distribution and Salary Distributinon in France. Some relative small population Towns can still have higher mean salary than Paris. \n   2. Paris did play a key role as Economic center, most of towns with higher salary concentrate nearby Paris.","9fac27b8":"1.
