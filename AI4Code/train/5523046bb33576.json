Indeed, the north subsystem is a water table (or unconfined) aquifer while the south subsystem is an artesian (or confined) groundwater.\n\nThe levels of the NORTH sector are represented by the values of the SAL, PAG, CoS and DIEC wells, while the levels of the SOUTH sector by the LT2 well.\n\n    Waterbody: Petrignano\n\nType: Aquifer\n\nDescription: The wells field of the alluvial plain between Ospedalicchio di Bastia Umbra and Petrignano is fed by three underground aquifers separated by low permeability septa. The aquifer can be considered a water table groundwater and is also fed by the Chiascio river. The groundwater levels are influenced by the following parameters: rainfall, depth to groundwater, temperatures and drainage volumes, level of the Chiascio river.\n\n    Waterbody: Doganella\n\nType: Aquifer\n\nDescription: The wells field Doganella is fed by two underground aquifers not fed by rivers or lakes but fed by meteoric infiltration. The upper aquifer is a water table with a thickness of about 30m. The lower aquifer is a semi-confined artesian aquifer with a thickness of 50m and is located inside lavas and tufa products. These aquifers are accessed through wells called Well 1, ..., Well 9. Approximately 80% of the drainage volumes come from the artesian aquifer. The aquifer levels are influenced by the following parameters: rainfall, humidity, subsoil, temperatures and drainage volumes.\n\n    Waterbody: Luco\n\nType: Aquifer\n\nDescription: The Luco wells field is fed by an underground aquifer. This aquifer not fed by rivers or lakes but by meteoric infiltration at the extremes of the impermeable sedimentary layers. Such aquifer is accessed through wells called Well 1, Well 3 and Well 4 and is influenced by the following parameters: rainfall, depth to groundwater, temperature and drainage volumes.\n\n    Waterbody: Amiata\n\nType: Water spring\n\nDescription: The Amiata waterbody is composed of a volcanic aquifer not fed by rivers or lakes but fed by meteoric infiltration. This aquifer is accessed through Ermicciolo, Arbure, Bugnano and Galleria Alta water springs. The levels and volumes of the four sources are influenced by the parameters: rainfall, depth to groundwater, hydrometry, temperatures and drainage volumes.\n\n    Waterbody: Madonna di Canneto\n\nType: Water spring\n\nDescription: The Madonna di Canneto spring is situated at an altitude of 1010m above sea level in the Canneto valley. It does not consist of an aquifer and its source is supplied by the water catchment area of the river Melfa.\n\n    Waterbody: Lupa\n\nType: Water spring\n\nDescription: this water spring is located in the Rosciano Valley, on the left side of the Nera river. The waters emerge at an altitude of about 375 meters above sea level through a long draining tunnel that crosses, in its final section, lithotypes and essentially calcareous rocks. It provides drinking water to the city of Terni and the towns around it.\n\n    Waterbody: Arno\n\nType: River\n\nDescription: Arno is the second largest river in peninsular Italy and the main waterway in Tuscany and it has a relatively torrential regime, due to the nature of the surrounding soils (marl and impermeable clays). Arno results to be the main source of water supply of the metropolitan area of Florence-Prato-Pistoia. The availability of water for this waterbody is evaluated by checking the hydrometric level of the river at the section of Nave di Rosano.\n\n    Waterbody: Bilancino\n\nType: Lake\n\nDescription: Bilancino lake is an artificial lake located in the municipality of Barberino di Mugello (about 50 km from Florence). It is used to refill the Arno river during the summer months. Indeed, during the winter months, the lake is filled up and then, during the summer months, the water of the lake is poured into the Arno river.\n\nEach waterbody has its own different features to be predicted. The table below shows the expected feature to forecast for each waterbody. ","c9d7f2b2":"# Welcome"}}
