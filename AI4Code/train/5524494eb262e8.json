Create pretrained facial detection (MTCNN) and recognition (Inception Resnet) models.\n1. For each test video, calculate face feature vectors for N faces evenly spaced through each video.\n1. Calculate the distance from each face to the centroid for its video.\n1. Use these distances as your means of discrimination.\n\nFor (much) better results, finetune the resnet to the fake\/real binary classification task instead - this is just a baseline. Alternatively, I'm sure there is much more interesting things that can be done with the feature vectors.","1ff54237":"## Process test videos\n\nLoop through all videos and pass N frames from each through the face detector followed by facenet.

Note that, intuitively, this is not a very good approach as it does nothing to take into account the progression of feature vectors throughout a video, just combines them together using the weights below. This step is provided as a placeholder only; it should be replaced with a more thoughtful mapping from a sequence of feature vectors to a single prediction."}}
