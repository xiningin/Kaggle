To the song \"Joy, Joy, the Guides and Scouts are there. I clap my hands, I snap my fingers, I turn this way and dance a little\", they wait for the glue and the posters to embark on the day's adventure: to cover N'Djamena with awareness messages to stop the advance of the coronavirus. Three months after the first positive case in Chad, lowering one's attention at this time could bring the number of infected people back up.\n\nThe risk of contamination does not disappear as long as covid-19 continues to circulate among a population unaware of its existence, risks and preventive measures. Physical distancing, frequent hand washing with soap and water or hydroalcoholic gel, and wearing a mask are the three golden rules for stepping onto the podium of the responsible and virtuous citizen. Getting informed and avoiding the spread of false information must become part of the daily routine.\n\n\"I want and I must help Chadian men and women so that we are not victims of this deadly disease,\" continues Ndilnodji Marius, who will soon be 18. \"For the occasion, my colleagues and I from the musical group Boys Baden created a song in two languages, French and English, and four dialects, Chadian Arabic, Moundang, Mesmai and Ngambaye. Through music the Chadian people listen and more easily integrate the barrier gestures into their daily life. https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/chad\/stories\/ndjamena-covered-posters-fight-covid-19","f855fd88":"#Dealing with Numerical features(handling missing data)"}}
