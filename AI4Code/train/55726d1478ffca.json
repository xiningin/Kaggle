This is a good default starting point when creating neural networks.\n\nThe weights are initialized using a small Gaussian random number. The Rectifier activation function (ReLu) is used. The output layer contains a single neuron in order to make predictions. It uses the sigmoid activation function in order to produce a probability output in the range of 0 to 1 that can easily and automatically be converted to crisp class values.\n\nFinally, we are using the logarithmic loss function (binary_crossentropy) during training, the preferred loss function for binary classification problems. The model also uses the efficient Adam optimization algorithm for gradient descent and accuracy metrics will be collected when the model is trained","b9bf754d":"This shows how both the crisis overlap leading to confirming that systemic crisis has an impact on banking crisis.","e6dc7ab1":"The p-values for most of the variables are smaller than 0.05, except some variables, therefore, we will remove them.","8991dadb":"The result is telling us that we have 205+182 correct predictions and 21+0 incorrect predictions.","5d68e1af":"I hope you guys have enjoyed the reading.

It is the constant rise in the general level of prices where a unit of currency buys less than it did in prior periods.\n\nLet's look at the countries that were accounted for an inflation crisis","90a4fcec":"We see only Central African Republic , Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe defaulting. Let's take a look at a few other things for these three countries in particular","b48e477b":" ### Visualisations\n#### Systemic Crisis\nA systemic crisis is a domino effect in which a financial trouble spreads. between institutions and markets until it affects the whole monetary. and financial system with dire global economic consequences","dab22add":"In this first architecture, we take our model with 11 neurons in the hidden layer and we will try to reduce it by half to 5. This will put pressure on the network during training to pick out the most important structure in the input data to model.\nOne aspect that may have an outsized effect is the structure of the network itself called the network topology.\nA neural network topology with more layers offers more opportunity for the network to extract key features and recombine them in useful nonlinear ways.\nWe will add one new layer (one line) to the network that introduces another hidden layer with 5 neurons after the first hidden layer.\nOur network now has the topology:\n\n**11 inputs --> (5 --> 5)-- 1 output**\n","0def08a7":"### Implementing the model\n\nLet\u2019s first use the stasmodel.api method to run the logistic regression model as shown in the following code:","244fd71e":"For this method, one can get the value of the coefficients using the following code snippet:","6c9db353":"# 5.Conclusion\n\n* The logistic regression model we have built has enabled us to identify Which factors are most associated with the banking crisis in Africa.\n* The neural network classifier we built has a higher performance accuracy boost.\n* We also find that a different architecture or a completely different class of algorithms could be used to gain a performance.\n","2e92c331":"# 4.2 Simple neural network model\nIn this part we will design a simple neural network to predict whether or not a banking crisis will occur in a given country in a given year.","8a4bc5b3":"#### Currency Crisis\nA currency crisis is a situation in which serious doubt exists as to whether a country's central bank has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to maintain the country's fixed exchange rate. The crisis is often accompanied by a speculative attack in the foreign exchange market. A currency crisis results from chronic balance of payments deficits, and thus is also called a balance of payments crisis. Often such a crisis culminates in a devaluation of the currency.\nLet's take a look at the countries who were reported to have faced a currency crisis","091dfc3c":"The variable coefficients indicate the change in the log (odds) for a unit change in the variable. The coefficient for the** systemic_crisis** variable is 8.01. This implies that, if the ** systemic_crisis** variable increases by 1, the log(odds) will increase by  6.46 and, hence, the probability of the **emergence of banking crises**  will change accordingly.","e69116cc":"One advantage of this method is that p-values are calculated automatically in the result summary. \n\nThe scikit-learn method doesn\u2019t have this facility, but is more powerful for calculation-intensive tasks such as prediction, calculating scores, and advanced functions such as feature selection. \n\nThe statsmodel.api method can be used while exploring and fine-tuning the model, while the scikit-learn method can be used in the final model used to predict the outcome.","94c42342":"Again, like currency crisis, we see that the countries had an inflation crisis, despite not being hit by a banking crisis. Inflation can be viewed positively or negatively depending on the individual viewpoint. Those with tangible assets, like property or stocked commodities, may like to see some inflation as that raises the value of their assets. People holding cash may not like inflation, as it erodes the value of their cash holdings. Ideally, an optimum level of inflation is required to promote spending to a certain extent instead of saving, thereby nurturing economic growth.","7fca34f8":"(1059, 14) as output which means our dataset has 1059 rows and 14 columns.","db63414d":"We are going to implement SMOTE in Python :","9b058e84":"#### Sovereign External Debt Default\nExternal debt is the portion of a country's debt that was borrowed from foreign lenders, including commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions. These loans, including interest, must usually be paid in the currency in which the loan was made. To earn the needed currency, the borrowing country may sell and export goods to the lender's country.\n\nA debt crisis can occur if a country with a weak economy is not able to repay the external debt due to the inability to produce and sell goods and make a profitable return.\n\nIf a nation is unable or refuses to repay its external debt, it is said to be in a sovereign default. This can lead to the lenders withholding future releases of assets that might be needed by the borrowing nation. Such instances can have a rolling effect, wherein the borrower\u2019s currency collapses and that nation\u2019s overall economic growth is stalled.","aec4845f":"This shows that the three countries default on external debt, despite not having a banking crisis as a premise. Even without the banking crisis they are marked to default on external debt.","375ad31a":"Our classes are imbalanced, and the ratio of no crisis is 91%."}}
