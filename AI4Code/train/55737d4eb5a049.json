The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.\n\nThe term \u201clinearity\u201d in algebra refers to a linear relationship between two or more variables. If we draw this relationship in a two-dimensional space (between two variables), we get a straight line.\n\nLinear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value **(y)** based on a given independent variable **(x)**. So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between **x (input)** and **y(output)**. Hence, the name is Linear Regression. If we plot the independent variable **(x)** on the x-axis and dependent variable **(y)** on the y-axis, linear regression gives us a straight line that best fits the data points, as shown in the figure below.\n\nWe know that the equation of a straight line is basically:\n\n","08237bce":"### Train - Test Split\n","86371b98":"\n### Import libraries","4bc7e015":"### Residual plots\nResidual plots can be used to assess the quality of a regression\nThese residual plots can be used to assess the quality of the regression. You can examine the underlying statistical assumptions about residuals such as constant variance, independence of variables and normality of the distribution. For these assumptions to hold true for a particular regression model, the residuals would have to be randomly distributed around zero.\n\nDifferent types of residual plots can be used to check the validity of these assumptions and provide information on how to improve the model. For example, the scatter plot of the residuals will be disordered if the regression is good. The residuals should not show any trend. A trend would indicate that the residuals were not independent. On the other hand, a histogram plot of the residuals should exhibit a symmetric bell-shaped distribution, indicating that the normality assumption is likely to be true.\n$$y(test)-y(pred)$$","350e9bc5":"## Data Preprocessing\n","d4cb9c2e":"###  Regression Evaluation Metrics","3d028a28":"### Dataset Information\n","fca2582e":"![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*weGmaJTZewji5_9H2TZetA.png)","f202fedc":"### Linear Regression Model\n","af18a03f":"### Load Dataset\n"}}
