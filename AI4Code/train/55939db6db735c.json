These tasks are sent out for completion at the same time. \n\n> Note: All tasks within a pool have the same settings (price, quality control, etc.)\n\nLet's set pool parameters:\n   - Give the pool any name you find suitable. You are the only one who will see it. The description can be either public or private.\n   - The price per task suite to $0.01. Audio recording tasks are normally paid as basic tasks (e.g. binary classification) because these tasks do not take much time. Read more about [pricing principles](https:\/\/toloka.ai\/knowledgebase\/pricing) in our Knowledge Base.\n   - Allows only English-speaking performers do these tasks. And allow performers to complete tasks on their computers or mobile devices.\n   - Auto accept solutions to False. Since there is no one true answer to a voice recording task that can be used as ground truth, post-acceptance is the preferable way to check if the recordings provided are acceptable. Read more about [quality control principles](https:\/\/toloka.ai\/knowledgebase\/quality-control) in our Knowledge Base or check out [post-acceptance settings](https:\/\/yandex.com\/support\/toloka-requester\/concepts\/offline-accept.html) in the Requester\u2019s Guide\n   - Time given to complete a task suite to 120 seconds. To understand how much time it should take to complete a task suite, try doing it yourself.\n   - Overlap to 1. In the case of voice recording tasks, you only need one correct response. This overlap value is set by default, so we don't need to define it in code.","82c92763":"## Receiving responses\n\nWait for performers to complete the tasks, then download the results.","ec1a8c54":"## Summary\n\nThis project consists of the minimum number of settings that will allow you to collect audio dataset.","30ca5acd":"Set data specification.

Performers will get paid only after their assignment is accepted.\n\nYou can open the pool page and click Review Assignments, for manual checking responses from performers.\n\nAnother way to review tasks is to ask other performers to do that. We recommend this option when you have limited resources for checking tasks yourself.
