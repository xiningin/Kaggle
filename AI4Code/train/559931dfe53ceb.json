Most notable count on the graph being El&nbsp;Salvador.\n\nColombian immigration, however, shows a different pattern. While Central American countries immigration to Canada experienced an increase in early 1990s, Colombia did not. The increase in Colombian immigration started before the 2000. Note that the Colombian immigration dies down as 2010s progressed.","efcb98c3":"**Vietnam** immigration into Canada did not plateau until 2000s. It experiences two spikes over the course of its refugee crises. Unfortunately, I can't pin down specific different causes for the two different spikes of entry to Canada.\n\nThe effects of wars in the Middle East that is visible on graph shows several things:\n\n- **Afghanistan** doesn't particularly have increased immigration into Canada after US-led intervention there.\n\n- **Iraq** does have a spike of immigration into Canada, but it does not happen immediately after the war starts. Immigration spikes (a sign of refugee crisis) on around 2006. Notable event around this time is a civil war (post-war situation wasn't stable enough) where Iraq descends into chaos.","772cb591":"# Epilogue\n\nAs interesting these visualizations are, Canadian immigration counts do *not* entirely reflect the situation of global crises. Many other refugee crises happen but the displaced people can't even reach Canada.\n\nThis notebook feels unfortunately like data science meet geopolitics, but hey, that's how context works. We combine knowledge from different domains that can help understand the data and graphs. Graphs alone without context is dull\/unprovoking at best and useless at worst.\n\nThat's all for this notebook. Feel free to upvote and fork if you like.\n\nKeep learning and happy data-sciencing!","80be7f8c":"# Prologue\n\nVisualization is better if the audience understands the concept and context. Context is important in reading visualizations and should be provided and communicated. And what better context to show beside immigration data, than the refugee crises around the world.\n\nCanada is a developed country that has been perceived as open and friendly to people. This sometimes makes it a prime target for a person seeking new life in a totally new world.\n\n---\n\nThis notebook will attempt to show how Canadian immigration data changes over time, along with relevant conflicts that perhaps contribute to said changes. I try to keep the visuals and codes lightweight and bite-sized for beginners. Enjoy!","dc41dde2":"In a glimpse, we can see several spikes that stand out from the rest of the data on specific years.  For example El-Salvador in early 1990s and Colombia in mid 2000s. To make this difference more pronounced visually, we can:\n\n- split the visualizations so there's less lines bunched up together\n- give context by highlighting where\/when there are relevant conflicts happening","852a2815":"Brief explanation summarized from Wikipedia to give some nuance about why refugee crises happened:\n\n**Central America** has a time period in which it was unstable and nations fell into civil wars. Causes may include:\n\n- Ideological conflicts between rising communism and capitalism.\n\n- United States' involvement to make sure Central America is not a danger to its economic and security interests in the region. This includes destabilizing regions and funding rebel groups.\n\n**Colombia**, on the other hand, has been on an ongoing conflict even before 1980 (this dataset's earliest coverage).\n\n- Armed paramilitary groups that wage war against Colombian government and against one another.\n\n- Drug manufacturing (think poppy fields) is widespread. There is no single, comprehensive, unified action system that has been able to wipe it out completely. These two factors combined make for long, dragged-out, and asymmetric conflicts in Colombia.","23eecb9a":"# Middle East and Asia\n\n**Afghanistan** and **Iraq** fell into chaos partly due to United States' involvements in the region. The overarching theme is called \"War on Terror\", where Western-led (mostly US-led) coalitions invade and try to control these nations. The covered periods in this dataset is the Iraq War and US invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, Post-war **Vietnam** in 1980s has experienced massive exodus due to border conflicts and tensions with its neighbors China, Cambodia, and Laos. After North's victory in Vietnam War, many were forced to flee due to fear of violence. There are those who flee due to fear of racial-stoked tensions, and there were also those who flee because they support or live in American-controlled South Vietnam and fear repercussion of living in North-controlled regime."}}
