[Convolutions in Depth](https:\/\/sgugger.github.io\/convolution-in-depth.html) by Sylvian Gugger (this article implements convolutions from scratch)\n\nThere are certain advantages offered by convolutional layers when working with image data:\n\n* **Fewer parameters**: A small set of parameters (the kernel) is used to calculate outputs of the entire image, so the model has much fewer parameters compared to a fully connected layer. \n* **Sparsity of connections**: In each layer, each output element only depends on a small number of input elements, which makes the forward and backward passes more efficient.\n* **Parameter sharing and spatial invariance**: The features learned by a kernel in one part of the image can be used to detect similar pattern in a different part of another image.\n\nWe will also use a [max-pooling](https:\/\/computersciencewiki.org\/index.php\/Max-pooling_\/_Pooling) layers to progressively decrease the height & width of the output tensors from each convolutional layer.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/computersciencewiki.org\/images\/8\/8a\/MaxpoolSample2.png\" style=\"max-width:400px;\">\n\nBefore we define the entire model, let's look at how a single convolutional layer followed by a max-pooling layer operates on the data.","63e3eb4e":"## Saving and loading the model\n\nSince we've trained our model for a long time and achieved a resonable accuracy, it would be a good idea to save the weights of the model to disk, so that we can reuse the model later and avoid retraining from scratch. Here's how you can save the model.","690d8fd9":"We can now wrap our training and validation data loaders using `DeviceDataLoader` for automatically transferring batches of data to the GPU (if available), and use `to_device` to move our model to the GPU (if available).","245ea57e":"## Training and Validation Datasets\n\nWhile building real world machine learning models, it is quite common to split the dataset into 3 parts:\n\n1. **Training set** - used to train the model i.e. compute the loss and adjust the weights of the model using gradient descent.\n2. **Validation set** - used to evaluate the model while training, adjust hyperparameters (learning rate etc.) and pick the best version of the model.\n3. **Test set** - used to compare different models, or different types of modeling approaches, and report the final accuracy of the model.\n\nSince there's no predefined validation set, we can set aside a small portion (5000 images) of the training set to be used as the validation set. We'll use the `random_split` helper method from PyTorch to do this. To ensure that we always create the same validation set, we'll also set a seed for the random number generator.","77122f59":"Our model reaches an accuracy of around 75%, and by looking at the graph, it seems unlikely that the model will achieve an accuracy higher than 80% even after training for a long time.

This can be done by adding more convolutional layers to our model, or incrasing the no. of channels in each convolutional layer, or by using regularization techniques.\n\nWe can also plot the training and validation losses to study the trend.","1ae6489d":"Based on where you're running this notebook, your default device could be a CPU (`torch.device('cpu')`) or a GPU (`torch.device('cuda')`)","93e78887":"The initial accuracy is around 10%, which is what one might expect from a randomly intialized model (since it has a 1 in 10 chance of getting a label right by guessing randomly).\n\nWe'll use the following *hyperparmeters* (learning rate, no. of epochs, batch_size etc.) to train our model.

The 10 outputs for each image can be interpreted as probabilities for the 10 target classes (after applying softmax), and the class with the highest probability is chosen as the label predicted by the model for the input image.","dbc60afc":"Before we begin training, let's instantiate the model once again and see how it performs on the validation set with the initial set of parameters.","ff50dc97":"## Testing with individual images\n\nWhile we have been tracking the overall accuracy of a model so far, it's also a good idea to look at model's results on some sample images. Let's test out our model with some images from the predefined test dataset of 10000 images. We begin by creating a test dataset using the `ImageFolder` class.\n\n","8f73540c":"Let's look at a sample element from the training dataset. Each element is a tuple, containing a image tensor and a label. Since the data consists of 32x32 px color images with 3 channels (RGB), each image tensor has the shape `(3, 32, 32)`.","6d1ec7ad":"### Using a GPU for faster training\n\nYou can use a [Graphics Processing Unit](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Graphics_processing_unit) (GPU) to train your models faster if your execution platform is connected to a GPU manufactured by NVIDIA. Follow these instructions to use a GPU on the platform of your choice:\n\n* _Google Colab_: Use the menu option \"Runtime > Change Runtime Type\" and select \"GPU\" from the \"Hardware Accelerator\" dropdown.\n* _Kaggle_: In the \"Settings\" section of the sidebar, select \"GPU\" from the \"Accelerator\" dropdown. Use the button on the top-right to open the sidebar.\n* _Binder_: Notebooks running on Binder cannot use a GPU, as the machines powering Binder aren't connected to any GPUs.\n* _Linux_: If your laptop\/desktop has an NVIDIA GPU (graphics card), make sure you have installed the [NVIDIA CUDA drivers](https:\/\/docs.nvidia.com\/cuda\/cuda-installation-guide-linux\/index.html).\n* _Windows_: If your laptop\/desktop has an NVIDIA GPU (graphics card), make sure you have installed the [NVIDIA CUDA drivers](https:\/\/docs.nvidia.com\/cuda\/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows\/index.html).\n* _macOS_: macOS is not compatible with NVIDIA GPUs\n\n\nIf you do not have access to a GPU or aren't sure what it is, don't worry, you can execute all the code in this tutorial just fine without a GPU.","d4a3091d":"The dataset is extracted to the directory `data\/cifar10`. It contains 2 folders `train` and `test`, containing the training set (50000 images) and test set (10000 images) respectively. Each of them contains 10 folders, one for each class of images. Let's verify this using `os.listdir`.","6cf59268":"## Training the Model\n\nWe'll define two functions: `fit` and `evaluate` to train the model using gradient descent and evaluate its performance on the validation set. ","dfc8b3a3":"The `.state_dict` method returns an `OrderedDict` containing all the weights and bias matrices mapped to the right attributes of the model. To load the model weights, we can redefine the model with the same structure, and use the `.load_state_dict` method.","8c6f9d1a":"We'll download the images in PNG format from [this page](https:\/\/course.fast.ai\/datasets), using some helper functions from the `torchvision` and `tarfile` packages.","00632032":"The list of classes is stored in the `.classes` property of the dataset. The numeric label for each element corresponds to index of the element's label in the list of classes.","4c39643d":"We can view the image using `matplotlib`, but we need to change the tensor dimensions to `(32,32,3)`. Let's create a helper function to display an image and its label.","7d29981d":"## Summary and Further Reading\/Exercises\n\nWe've covered a lot of ground in this tutorial. Here's quick recap of the topics:\n* Introduction to the CIFAR10 dataset for image classification\n* Downloading, extracing and loading an image dataset using `torchvision`\n* Show random batches of images in a grid using `torchvision.utils.make_grid`\n* Creating a convolutional neural network using with `nn.Conv2d` and `nn.MaxPool2d` layers\n* Capturing dataset information, metrics and hyperparameters \n* Training a convolutional neural network and visualizing the losses and errors\n* Understanding overfitting and the strategies for avoiding it (more on this later)\n* Generating predictions on single images from the test set\n* Saving and loading the model weights, and attaching them to the eperiment \n\nThere's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n* Try chaging the hyperparameters to achieve a higher accuracy within fewer epochs. \n* Try adding more convolutional layers, or increasing the number of channels in each convolutional layer\n* Try using a feedforward neural network and see what's the maximum accuracy you can achieve\n* Read about some of the startegies mentioned above for reducing overfitting and achieving better results, and try to implement them by looking into the PyTorch docs.\n* Modify this notebook to train a model for a different dataset (e.g. CIFAR100 or ImageNet)\n\nIn the next tutorial, we will continue to improve our model's accuracy using techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization and dropout. We will also learn about residual networks (or ResNets), a small but critical change to the model architecture that will significantly boost the performance of our model. Stay tuned!","cddb286d":"We can look at batches of images from the dataset using the `make_grid` method from `torchvision`. Each time the following code is run, we get a different bach, since the sampler shuffles the indices before creating batches.","545cfda4":"# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch","b8007792":"To seamlessly use a GPU, if one is available, we define a couple of helper functions (`get_default_device` & `to_device`) and a helper class `DeviceDataLoader` to move our model & data to the GPU as required. ","aaca5c74":"The `Conv2d` layer transforms a 3-channel image to a 16-channel *feature map*, and the `MaxPool2d` layer halves the height and width. The feature map gets smaller as we add more layers, until we are finally left with a small feature map, which can be flattened into a vector. We can then add some fully connected layers at the end to get vector of size 10 for each image.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KKtPOKE.png\" style=\"max-width:540px\">\n\nLet's define the model by extending an `ImageClassificationBase` class which contains helper methods for training & validation."}}
