chess star who beat men 90 years before \u2018Queen\u2019s Gambit\u2019\n\n#By Michael S. Rosenwald, November 28, 2020\n\nVera Menchik astonished the chess world by taking down high-level male opponents in the 1920s and \u201930s\n\nShe was born in the winter of 1906, in Moscow. She turned to chess, a game her father taught her at age 9. Menchik could not speak English, so she threw herself into chess, joining a local club and taking private lessons. The game suited her inability to communicate. In her letter to Chess Magazine, she wrote:\n\n\"I have often been asked, what made me think seriously about chess? It would appear that the atmosphere of silence and heavy smoking is not appropriate for a young lady. That\u2019s true! In other life circumstances it would not occur to me to spend time in such a way, but chess is a quiet game and therefore the best hobby for a person who cannot speak the language properly.\"\n\nShe immediately excelled, first in local matches, then regionally, then nationally, then internationally. When the first Women\u2019s World Chess Championship was held in 1927, Menchik won. When she kept winning women\u2019s matches, often very easily, she set her sights on men, becoming the first woman to play in male tournaments.\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/history\/2020\/11\/28\/vera-menchik-chess-queens-gambit-beth-harmon\/","e60b1586":"#Discouragement\n\nThis is only half the prize of the main event, but unlike other sports, women in chess can play against men.\n\n\u201cOne of the main things we do is maintain the female category. This is controversial and many people say that this category should be abolished completely,\u201d says David Llada, head of communications for FIDE.\n\n\u201cBut, in our experience, it can act as an incentive to bring more players into chess. Offer some support, as women face different challenges to become great masters.\u201d\n\nFormer American champion Jennifer Shahade says that participation of girls and young women in chess tends to decrease as they get older.\n\n\u201cFemale participation in the United States is highly concentrated at younger ages. It is around 15%, but among those aged seven, we can have something around 28%\u201d, explains Shahade.\n\nShahade, who has written two books on women in chess, says the determination of the main character \u2013 Beth Harman \u2013 has not been tested on the Netflix series as it would have been in real life.\nhttps:\/\/www.time24.news\/2020\/11\/the-gambit-of-the-queen-netflix-series-ignores-sexism-in-chess-says-former-champion.html","4d381944":"#Gambit\n\nA gambit (from ancient Italian gambetto, meaning \"to trip\") is a chess opening in which a player, more often White, sacrifices material, usually a pawn, with the hope of achieving a resulting advantageous position. Some well-known examples are the King's Gambit, Queen's Gambit, and Evans Gambit. A gambit used by Black may also be called a gambit, e.g. the Latvian Gambit , or Englund Gambit; but is sometimes called a \"countergambit\", e.g. the Albin Countergambit and Greco Countergambit (an old-fashioned name for the Latvian Gambit).https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gambit","5ccb72f3":"#Queen's Gambit': Netflix series ignores sexism in chess, says former champion\n\nThere are several moving scenes in The Queen\u2019s Gambit, the Netflix series that tells the fictional story of Beth Harman, a young chess prodigy from the 1960s.\n\nIn one, an experienced player takes Harman\u2019s hand and kisses it gently after being humiliated on the board by her.\n\nThis \u2018act of kindness\u2019 happened to the Hungarian-American Susan Polgar in real life, while acting professionally as a chess player.\n\n\u201cI remember once playing with six-time American champion Walter Browne,\u201d says Polgar, one of the first women to win the coveted Grand Master title.\n\n\u201cInstead of accepting defeat or congratulating me, he threw the pieces on the board.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went flying and hit me and other people around,\u201d adds Polgar, 51.\n\nI hardly remember a tournament in which things like sexual harassment, physical intimidation and verbal or psychological abuse didn\u2019t happen,\u201d says Susan Polgar, a great chess master.\n\nNote to laymen: \u201cgambito\u201d is a play in which the player sacrifices one of his pawns in order to have some kind of advantage later on. \u201cRainha\u201d, on the other hand, is the Portuguese translation of the English word \u2018Queen\u2019, which actually refers to \u201cqueen\u201d, the most important piece on the board that moves without limiting the number of squares or in the direction in which shifts.\n\nThe series is based on the book of the same name written by the American Walter Tevis and released in 1983.\n\nBut Polgar has some reservations about how the series addresses gender issues in chess.\n\n\u201cThe sexism part has been minimized. Beth Harman certainly faces sexism, but what she suffers from is a little bit compared to what I and other players have been through,\u201d she says.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.time24.news\/2020\/11\/the-gambit-of-the-queen-netflix-series-ignores-sexism-in-chess-says-former-champion.html","30dfaa73":"The chess environment is still \u201cquite intimidating for women\u201d.\n\nSusan Polgar defends support for girls to keep them playing chess\n\nAgain, she uses personal experience: since 2007, Polgar has coached chess teams at US universities and became the first woman to lead a men\u2019s team to the national title \u2013 much to the dismay of some colleagues of the opposite sex\n\n\u201cSome rival university coaches refused to shake my hand or congratulate me when we won,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cSo, if you want girls and young women to stay in chess, you need to show them that they are not alone in a male-dominated field.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe girls are already discouraged enough to play chess since school age.

But he says there is no reason a real world Harmon could not one day succeed him \u2013 if a game with a notoriously chauvinistic history can become more hospitable to its prospective female superstars.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem that\u2019s been around in chess for a long time,\u201d the Norwegian said in a Zoom interview. \u201cChess societies have not been very kind to women and girls over the years.

Even Garry Kasparov \u2013 who later resiled from his comments and was an adviser to the makers of The Queen\u2019s Gambit \u2013 once claimed that chess \u201cdoes not fit women properly\u201d.\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2020\/nov\/21\/magnus-carlsen-chess-interview-queens-gambit-beth-harmon-netflix","92d90acd":"#Queen's Gambit: The reality is not like that\n\n\"Beth's character has many similarities with the late American grandmaster, and former world champion, Bobby Fischer. Often described as one of the best players of all time, Fischer was also known for controversial comments he made including this one from 1963: \"Women are terrible chess players ... I guess they're just not so smart.\"\n\n\"This is not an isolated case. Garry Kasparov, a Russian chess grandmaster and former world champion who participated in the making of Netflix's The Queen's Gambit, also made misogynistic comments in the past but later reneged them having been beaten in competition by Polgar in 2002.\"\n\n\"Although Polgar is the highest-ranking female player of all time, it is likely that others with similar potential preceded her but had their achievements falling into oblivion.\n\n\"Like Maria Teresa Mora Iturralde, a Cuban woman who, in 1922 at the age of 20, defeated all-male rivals to become Cuban chess master and Ibero-American champion. She is the only person to have ever received lessons from Jos\u00e9 Raul Capablanca, the world champion from 1921 and 1927, and described as one of the greatest players of all time.\"\n\n\"Legend has it the student beat the master but sadly, her chess career stopped at the Cuban championship of 1922 and her story was all but forgotten until it was resurrected by the Havana3am specialised blog recently.\"\n\n\"Still, there is about one woman in competition for every 15 men and lonely one woman is currently ranked amongst the world's top 100 chess players: Hou Yifan of China at the 88th spot.\"\n\n\"The way to remedy this dismally-low number has however divided opinions. For instance, should the sport be fully segregated with male-only events and female-only competitions?\"\n\n\"However, in countries where women's competition were experimentally abolished, the participation in mixed events was further reduced while in the federations that developed specific programmes aimed at young players, the results improved.\"\nhttps:\/\/www.euronews.com\/2020\/11\/27\/the-queen-s-gambit-why-there-has-never-been-a-female-chess-world-champion","b0944e8c":"#Rapid (FIDE), quick (USCF) or active\n\nTime controls for each player in a game of rapid chess are, according to FIDE, more than 10 minutes, but less than 60 minutes.
