The stronger the acid, the better it dissociates in an aqueous solution, releasing more cationic hydrogen (H+) ions. Examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). However, because pH measures the amount of hydrogen ions released in a solution, even a very strong acid can have a high pH reading if its concentration is very dilute. For instance, a 0.0000001 molar HCl solution has a pH of 6.79. As a strong acid, HCl exhibits 100 percent dissociation, but the extremely low concentration of hydrogen ions it releases in this case gives it a nearly neutral pH.","7b02294a":"Like strong acids, a **strong base** dissociates nearly completely in water; however, it releases hydroxide (OH-) ions rather than H+. Strong bases have very high pH values, usually about 12 to 14. Well-known examples of strong bases include caustic soda or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), as well as lye or potassium hydroxide (KOH). Hydroxides of alkali or Group 1 metals are generally strong bases."}}
