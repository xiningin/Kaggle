In this lab, we will focus on generating a plethora of plots that will help you analyze, comprehend and visualize data.  \n\nFollowing are the steps to be taken to complete the lab exercise for week-1:\n1. Make sure you have a Kaggle account, if not create an account at: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/\n2. Fork the root notebook and create a copy for yourself. The newly created notebook is your working version and will have to be submitted at the end of the lab session.\n3. The data sets required for this lab are available as a part of the \"Draft Environment\" (visible to the right of the notebook). To ensure all the data sets have been imported, execute cell-4 and the resultant output will be a list view of the files available.\n4. All questions pertaining to lab-1 have been detailed below. Write your code and execute each cell against the associated question.\n5. Post the completion of the lab execrcises, commit your notebook and share it with Prof. Karim and Manish Varma. We will review and provide comments if the need be.\n\nP.S : Always ask questions! Incase any of the above steps are not clear do let us know and we will help you resolve them. ","ee913f57":"## Introduction to using Kaggle Notebooks\nNotebooks are a handy way to explore data because they combine narrative with live code in an attractive report. Here's how to use a Kaggle Notebook: \n\n1. You can execute \"cells\" of Markdown text (like this section) or code. Just select a cell and toggle between \"Markdown\" and \"Python\". To execute the code, hit the play button. To add a new cell, use the \"+\" buttons. To delete a chunk click on the red trashcan.\n2. In the notebook editor, you can inspect the dataset's files by expanding the \"Input Files\" component at the top of the editor.\n3. Make sure the notebook is always kept private for the duration of the lab and continually keep commiting your notebook.
