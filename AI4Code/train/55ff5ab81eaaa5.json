Consulting LLC","90627bca":"About CLEVR\n\nWhen building artificial intelligence systems that can reason and answer questions about visual data, CLEVR needs diagnostic tests to analyze our progress and discover shortcomings. Existing benchmarks for visual question answering can help, but have strong biases that models can exploit to correctly answer questions without reasoning. They also conflate multiple sources of error, making it hard to pinpoint model weaknesses. CLEVR presents a diagnostic dataset that tests a range of visual reasoning abilities. It contains minimal biases and has detailed annotations describing the kind of reasoning each question requires. They used this dataset to analyze a variety of modern visual reasoning systems, providing novel insights into their abilities and limitations.
