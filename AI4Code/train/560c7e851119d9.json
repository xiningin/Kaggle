We chose not to go into details in each step to keep the welcoming notebook simple and make a room for improvement.\n\nYou're encourged to `Fork` the notebook, edit it, add your insights and use it to create your submission.","c2291ce5":"## Mergening data ","06d4ce16":"The remaining steps is to submit the generated file and are as follows. \n\n1. Press `Save Version` on the upper right corner of this notebook.\n2. Write a `Version Name` of your choice and choose `Save & Run All (Commit)` then click `Save`.\n3. Wait for the saved notebook to finish running the go to the saved notebook.\n4. Scroll down until you see the output files then select the `submission.csv` file and click `Submit`.\n\nNow your submission will be evaluated and your score will be updated on the leaderboard! CONGRATULATIONS!!","601b39a6":"## Exploratory Data Analysis\nIn this step, one should load the data and analyze it. However, I'll load the data and do minimal analysis.

So we'll split the \"training\" set into training and validation sets with 0.8:0.2 ratio. \n\n*Note: a good way to generate reproducible results is to set the seed to the algorithms that depends on randomization.

We hope you enjoy and learn as much as we did prepairing this competition.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the competition, it's required to predict the `Severity` of a car crash given info about the crash, e.g., location.\n\nThis is the getting started notebook. Things are kept simple so that it's easier to understand the steps and modify it.\n\nFeel free to `Fork` this notebook and share it with your modifications **OR** use it to create your submissions.\n\n### Prerequisites\nYou should know how to use python and a little bit of Machine Learning. You can apply the techniques you learned in the training program and submit the new solutions! \n\n### Checklist\nYou can participate in this competition the way you perefer. However, I recommend following these steps if this is your first time joining a competition on Kaggle.\n\n* Fork this notebook and run the cells in order.\n* Submit this solution.\n* Make changes to the data processing step as you see fit.\n* Submit the new solutions.\n\n*You can submit up to 5 submissions per day. You can select only one of the submission you make to be considered in the final ranking.*\n\n\nDon't hesitate to leave a comment or contact me if you have any question!"}}
