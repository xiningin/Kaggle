It is based on the same retriever of DrQA, which creates TF-IDF features based on uni-grams and bi-grams and compute the cosine similarity between the question sentence and each document of the database.\n\nAfter selecting the most probable documents, the system divides each document into paragraphs and send them with the question to the Reader, which is basically a pre-trained Deep Learning model. The model used was the Pytorch version of the well known NLP model BERT, which was made available by HuggingFace.\n\nThen, the Reader outputs the most probable answer it can find in each paragraph. After the Reader, there is a final layer in the system that compares the answers by using an internal score function and outputs the most likely one according to the scores.
