The top few rows of your raw data might look like this:\n\n| got_pneumonia | age | weight |  male | took_antibiotic_medicine | ... |\n|:-------------:|:---:|:------:|:-----:|:------------------------:|-----|\n|     False     |  65 |   100  | False |           False          | ... |\n|     False     |  72 |   130  |  True |           False          | ... |\n|      True     |  58 |   100  | False |           True           | ... |\n-\n\n\nPeople take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. So the raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns. But *took_antibiotic_medicine* is frequently changed **after** the value for *got_pneumonia* is determined. This is target leakage.\n\nThe model would see that anyone who has a value of `False` for `took_antibiotic_medicine` didn't have pneumonia.  Validation data comes from the same source, so the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores. But the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world.\n\nTo prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded. Because when we use this model to make new predictions, that data won't be available to the model.\n\n![Leaky Data Graphic](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CN4INKb.png)","0cef5caa":"# Conclusion\nData leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data is a first step, and pipelines can help implement this separation.  Leaking predictors are a more frequent issue, and leaking predictors are harder to track down. A combination of caution, common sense and data exploration can help identify leaking predictors so you remove them from your model.","3da72c0a":"Everyone with `card == False` had no expenditures, while only 2% of those with `card == True` had no expenditures.  It's not surprising that our model appeared to have a high accuracy. But this seems a data leak, where expenditures probably means *expenditures on the card they applied for.**\n\nSince **share** is partially determined by **expenditure**, it should be excluded too.  The variables **active**, **majorcards** are a little less clear, but from the description, they sound concerning.  In most situations, it's better to be safe than sorry if you can't track down the people who created the data to find out more.\n\nWe would run a model without leakage as follows:","dbf43e4f":"# References\n<b>Kernels<\/b>:<br>\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jturkewitz\/magic-features-0-03-gain<br>\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tour1st\/magic-feature-v2-0-045-gain<br>\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ianlini\/find-the-data-leak-from-scratch\/notebook<br>\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/leakage-especially-knowledge-leakage\/notebook<br>\n<b>Blogs<\/b>:<br>\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/ml-byte\/rare-feature-engineering-techniques-for-machine-learning-competitions-de36c7bb418f<br>","998bbb23":"## Leaky Validation Strategy\n\nA much different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful distinguishing training data from validation data.  For example, this happens if you run preprocessing (like fitting the Imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split.  Validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data it hasn't considered before.  You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavoir..  The end result?  Your model will get very good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.\n\n\n## Preventing Leaky Predictors\nThere is no single solution that universally prevents leaky predictors. It requires knowledge about your data, case-specific inspection and common sense.\n\nHowever, leaky predictors frequently have high statistical correlations to the target.  So two tactics to keep in mind:\n* To screen for possible leaky predictors, look for columns that are statistically correlated to your target.\n* If you build a model and find it extremely accurate, you likely have a leakage problem.\n\n## Preventing Leaky Validation Strategies\n\nIf your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of *fitting*, including the fitting of preprocessing steps.  This is easier if you use [scikit-learn Pipelines](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/lpdataninja\/data-science-glossary-16-pipelines).  When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you use pipelines and do your preprocessing inside the pipeline.\n\n# Example\nHere's the <a href='https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/aer-credit-card-data'>dataset link<\/a>.<br>\nWe will use a small dataset about credit card applications, and we will build a model predicting which applications were accepted (stored in a variable called *card*).  Here is a look at the data:","b7dbd094":"# What is Data Leakage\n\n<img src='https:\/\/media.threatpost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/103\/2018\/04\/03111404\/Security-Breach-Investigation.jpg'>\n\nHere are some definitions:\n- <b>Data Leakage is the creation of unexpected additional information in the training data, allowing a model or machine learning algorithm to make unrealistically good predictions.<\/b>\n- <b>Data leakage is when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model.<\/b>\n- <b>if any other feature whose value would not actually be available in practice at the time you\u2019d want to use the model to make a prediction, is a feature that can introduce leakage to your model.<\/b>","f99fd485":"# Why Data Leakage is a Problem\nIt is a serious problem for at least 3 reasons:\n- It is a problem if you are running a machine learning competition. Top models will use the leaky data rather than be good general model of the underlying problem.\n- It is a problem when you are a company providing your data. Reversing an anonymization and obfuscation can result in a privacy breach that you did not expect.\n- It is a problem when you are developing your own predictive models. You may be creating overly optimistic models that are practically useless and cannot be used in production.\n\n This kenel will show you what leakage is and how to avoid it.","ed0d20bf":"We can see with `data.shape` that this is a small dataset (1312 rows), so we should use cross-validation to ensure accurate measures of model quality","7e6b928c":"With experience, you'll find that it's very rare to find models that are accurate 98% of the time.  It happens, but it's rare enough that we should inspect the data more closely to see if it is target leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the data, which you can also find under the data tab:\n\n - **card:** Dummy variable, 1 if application for credit card accepted, 0 if not\n - **reports:** Number of major derogatory reports\n - **age:** Age n years plus twelfths of a year\n - **income:** Yearly income (divided by 10,000)\n - **share:** Ratio of monthly credit card expenditure to yearly income\n - **expenditure:** Average monthly credit card expenditure\n - **owner:** 1 if owns their home, 0 if rent\n - **selfempl:** 1 if self employed, 0 if not.\n - **dependents:** 1 + number of dependents\n - **months:** Months living at current address\n - **majorcards:** Number of major credit cards held\n - **active:** Number of active credit accounts\n\nA few variables look suspicious.  For example, does **expenditure** mean expenditure on this card or on cards used before appying?\n\nNow let us get into the leaky data exploration part. We have a couple of leaky features which seem to improve the score significantly.","17d6a6cd":"Wherever the expenditure is zero the cards have not been issued. This is a clear data leak.","8bd5e140":"This accuracy is quite a bit lower, which on the one hand is disappointing.  However, we can expect it to be right about 80% of the time when used on new applications, whereas the leaky model would likely do much worse then that (even in spite of it's higher apparent score in cross-validation.).","b730f0f1":"# Techniques To Minimize Data Leakage\nTwo good techniques that you can use to minimize data leakage when developing predictive models:\n- Perform data preparation within your cross validation folds.\n- Hold back a validation dataset for final sanity check of your developed models.\n- Generally, it is good practice to use both of these techniques."}}
