This could be the case, for example, when a patient has taken multiple pictures at different times.

It is the process of creating more images from the existing training data by applying transformations. These include, but not limited to, flips, adding blur, increase sharpness and more. Some of these are very helpful to increase the accuracy of the models.\n\nThere is a fantastic library called 'Albumentations' that helps in creating augmenations quickly and effectively within a few lines of code. The github link is [here](https:\/\/github.com\/albumentations-team\/albumentations) and is a really good resource for beginners.

Basic Data Exploration<center>","d9d11183":"To keep the convolutional base's weight untouched, we will freeze it, otherwise, the representations previously learned from the ImageNet dataset will be destroyed.","50552b9f":"As expected the the number of benign cases are exponentially higher than the malignant cases, a perfect example of an imbalanced dataset. Now, let's explore the patient information a bit more.","c2201ea8":"Looks like the dcm images may be more useful since they enhance the the lesions. But just maybe that we picked the right images :-)\n\nAs stated earlier we have about 33,127 images to play with. However, we can always use more data. That is where augmentations will come into play.","2986c7b7":"We will create our own classification layers stack on top of the EfficientNet convolutional base model. We adapt GlobalMaxPooling2D to convert 4D the (batch_size, rows, cols, channels) tensor into 2D tensor with shape (batch_size, channels). GlobalMaxPooling2D results in a much smaller number of features compared to the Flatten layer, which effectively reduces the number of parameters. ","7d1af591":"* ## 4.2 Preparing Images\n\nWith our dataset splits ready, we can now proceed with setting up our model to consume them. For this we will use the off-the-shelf ImageDataGenerator class from the Keras framework, which allows us to build a \"generator\" for images specified in a dataframe. This class also provides support for basic data augmentation such as random horizontal flipping of images.","056a711f":"Some of these augmentations like saturation and contrast may be useful.","527ebe20":"# <center>2. Images<center>","053ea607":"## 4.3 Model Development\n\nAs stated earlier we will use the pre-trained EfficentNet B0 model as the baseline. The EfficientNet is built for ImageNet classification contains 1000 classes labels. For our dataset, we only have 2, which means the last few layers for classification is not useful for us. They can be excluded while loading the model by specifying the include_top argument to False, and this applies to other ImageNet models made available in Keras applications as well. ","d0b715de":"There are a total of 33,126 records for 2,056 unique patients.\n\nAs a first step let's take a look at the total number of benign vs malignant cases.","28778aa9":"Now that we have all the pieces in place the last step is to compile the model and run. We will use the Binary Cross Entropy fopr the loss and the adam opimizer. We may need to define other loss functions to address the class imbalance and will do that in later stages.","0d8c9b25":"We will also define some variables that we will use in the future.","0196a11c":"### Images with lesions that are benign.","be51af66":"Great! We do not have any data leakage since the repeating  id's are 0."}}
