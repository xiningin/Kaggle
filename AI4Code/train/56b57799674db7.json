As a workaround, we'll take the total number of user ratings as a proxy, which we can find in the `rating_count_tot` app.\n- Let's start with calculating the average number of user ratings per app genre on the App Store. To do that, we'll need to:\n\n    - Isolate the apps of each genre.\n    - Sum up the user ratings for the apps of that genre.\n    - Divide the sum by the number of apps belonging to that genre (not by the total number of apps).","de13a05c":"### App Store Data\n- After removing non-English apps from the list, the data set is named `Appstore_english`","0f8417a2":"Appstore has 7197 apps and Google play has 10841 apps.","2b30dd68":"### Number of Apps in Each Genre","cd4b0906":"#### Apple Store Data\n- Index 5 shows the price. \n- Free apps are isolated by price equals 0\n- New dataset is named Appstore_final and the number of free apps is 4056","c4a05f4b":"Using the function `explore_data()` to check number of apps in each dataset. \n- Takes in four parameters:\n1) `dataset`, which is expected to be a list of lists.\n2) `start` and `end`, which are both expected to be integers and represent the starting and the ending indices of a slice from the data set.\n3) `rows_and_columns`, which is expected to be a Boolean and has False as a default argument.\n- Slices the data set using `dataset[start:end]`.\n- Loops through the slice, and for each iteration, prints a row and adds a new line after that row using print('\\n').\n- Prints the number of rows and columns if `rows_and_columns` is True.","cd94b006":"### Most Common Genre in App Store","b1afdb92":"### Average Number of User Reviews","ce933bac":"- We can use this information to build a criterion for removing the duplicates.
