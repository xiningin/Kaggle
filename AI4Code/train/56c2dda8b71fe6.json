Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service\/facility records.

Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nThis kernel is a STARTER for understanding the percentage of 1-year-olds who have received one dose of bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine in a given year using plotly.\n\nBacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis (TB). In countries where tuberculosis or leprosy is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as close to the time of birth as possible. In areas where tuberculosis is not common, only children at high risk are typically immunized, while suspected cases of tuberculosis are individually tested for and treated. Adults who do not have tuberculosis and have not been previously immunized but are frequently exposed may be immunized as well. BCG also has some effectiveness against Buruli ulcer infection and other nontuberculous mycobacteria infections. Additionally it is sometimes used as part of the treatment of bladder cancer.\n\nThe BCG vaccine was first used medically in 1921. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system [source - wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BCG_vaccine). We still don't know if it can protect us from COVID-19 but there is some probability.
