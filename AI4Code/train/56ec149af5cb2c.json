We rescale pixel values from the range (0, 255) to the range (0, 1) as it is the best format for neural network models. Through this transformation, we also reduce the effect of illumination's differences, which is not as relevant for our case but can generally be helpful when working with the photo. \n\nScaling data to the range (0, 1) is usually called **normalization** and, in our case, is achieved by dividing the value of each pixel by 255 (normalization coefficient 1\/255 = ~0.0039).","ad399bcc":"## Load and prepare the data","a2fa56bd":"...and here we go!","09ae0d2c":"## Introduction","6a1a17ca":"In this notebook I use the Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition. This is a fairly simple and versatile algorithm, before MNIST digits I used it for other image recognition. Although it showed less accuracy there due to the greater variety and complexity of the images. Here we have only 10 classes and they are more or less distinguishable.\n\nYou can try to use this notebook for MNIST digits recognition as well as other image recognition cases. If you have any ideas please share them in the comments, it would be interesting if you could share your approach.","3c05d7e1":"Here I use Keras Sequential API with the following architecture:\n\n - Input<br>\n - Conv2D - > Conv2D - > MaxPool2D -> LayerNormalization -> Dropout<br>\n - Conv2D - > Conv2D - > MaxPool2D -> LayerNormalization -> Dropout<br>\n - Flatten<br>\n - Dense<br>\n - Dropout<br>\n - Output\n","d486c6df":"**Data augmentation** \n\nOne way to avoid overfitting and improve the accuracy is to increase the variability of existing samples. Which is also helps to compensate lack of data.\n<br>Data augmentation generates data from existing samples by applying various transformations to the original dataset. This method aims to increase the number of unique input samples, which, in turn, will allow the model to show better accuracy on the validation dataset.","619778f0":"## Model","12dd03b4":"Our data is now stored as 1D np.array. The length of the array is 784 (28 pixels x 28 pixels). To feed the data into the Keras model, we reshape it to 28 pixels x 28 pixels and add additional dimension for the number of channels (1 in case of greyscale).","f007aafc":"Some comments to the layers.\n\n**Conv2D**  layers perform the process that is called convolution. The essence of convolution is to create another set of values, which is called a kernel or filter. In our case, this is a 3 x 3 matrix. Then we scan our image using this kernel. A convolution layer is applied to each section of the input image. In other words, here, the network learns the details of the image.\n\nWe can experiment with number of filters and their size.\n\n**MaxPool2D** layer is simply compressing (reducing the size of) the image. The result will be a smaller image compared to the original input image. At this layer, the network also learns the whole structure of the image.\n\n**Dropout** layer is used to avoid overfitting. \n\n**Flatten** layer converts the data into a 1D array. "}}
