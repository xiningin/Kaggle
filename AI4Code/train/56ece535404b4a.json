Application of ACF and PACF<\/font>\n\nIn **Machine Learning**, selecting a perfect model is a very tedious job. Though we have to do **Trial and Error** method to find out the best model, it would be better if we could assume first which model could perfom better with our specific dataset.\n<br\/>\n\nAnd here comes up **ACF** and **PACF** as saviour. They are mostly used to choose the model between **Auto regressive (AR)** and **Moving Average (MA)**. ACF and PACF not only help us choosing the model, but also tell us which **lagged value** will perform better.","52beed2a":"<a id =4.4> <\/a>\n<br\/>\n\n#### 4.4. ACF Plot","50e347f0":"<a id =1> <\/a> \n## <font color=red> 1. What is ACF and PACF<\/font>\n\nACF stands for **Auto Correlation** where PACF stands for **Partial Auto Correlation**. Before diving into the deep, let's first understand what is **Correlation** which stays both in the ACF and PACF.  \n<br\/>\n\nCorrelation is basically the relationship between two variables or features as well. Say, we have two features to work with : **Weight** and **BMI**. If we plot them in a scatterplot, we will see that the BMI will be increased with the increment of Weight. Then we can say that Weight and BMI are correlated with each other or they have a strong correlation.  \nWe measure this correlation by **Pearson Correlation Factor** which value lies between **<font color=blue>-1<\/font>** to **<font color=blue>1<\/font>**. Value close to **<font color=blue>1<\/font>** means **<font color=blue>strong positive correlation<\/font>** while close to **<font color=blue>-1<\/font>** means **<font color=blue>negative positive correlation<\/font>**.\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n\nBut in **Time Series Analysis** we often have to work with a single feature. We Observe the historical data to find out a pattern and use the pattern to forecast what can be happened in future. And here comes up **ACF** and **PACF**. This two terms indicate the correlation between the values of a single feature while correlation does it between two features.\n<br\/>\n\n**<font color=blue>ACF<\/font>**  \nNow let's explore ACF in a more detailed manner. Say, we are working with a stock price datasaet. Then the correlation between the stock price of current time and the stock price of the previous time is called ACF. ACF tells us how strong they are correlated with each other.\n<br\/>\n\n**<font color=blue>PACF<\/font>**  \nBut what if the correlation between two data points of different two times are influenced by other data points? Here comes up PACF as a saviour. Let's understand it with an example.\n<br\/>\n\nSay, **t**, **t-1** and **t-2** are the stock prices of today, yesterday and the day before yesterday respectively.  \nNow **t** can be correlated with **t-2** and **t-1** can also be correlated with **t-2**. Then PACF of **t-1** is the real correlation between **t** and **t-1** after taking out the influence of **t-2**.","40ee152d":"<a id =4.1> <\/a>\n#### 4.1.

Normally **One-lag differencing** is used in this regard.\n<br\/>\n\n**2.** If there is no significant auto-correlation, then the series will be called **Random (White Noise)**. We will have to apply **differencing** before the analysis.\n<br\/>\n\n**3.** If you find no significant auto-correlation even after the first **differencing**, then it will be called a **Random walk** and **AR** and **MA** can't be applied here. We will then have to go for other models for the analysis."}}
