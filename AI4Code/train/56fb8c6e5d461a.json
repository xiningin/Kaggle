As noted in one recent replacement called the Fashion-MNIST dataset, the Zalando researchers quoted the startling claim that \"Most pairs of MNIST digits (784 total pixels per sample) can be distinguished pretty well by just one pixel\". To stimulate the community to develop more drop-in replacements, the Sign Language MNIST is presented here and follows the same CSV format with labels and pixel values in single rows. The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion).\n\n## Load the dataset\n","1ad2cb75":"As you can see each one is almost equally distributed and droping the label coloumn from the training set","d6dd2177":"Reshaping the images","b8523df3":"Fit and validate model","789e161f":"# Conclusion\n\n* If this tutorial is not enough you can check Deep Learning Tutorial for Beginners prepared by \n    - https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kanncaa1\/deep-learning-tutorial-for-beginners\n    - https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ranjeetjain3\/deep-learning-using-sign-langugage\n* After this tutorial, my aim is to prepare 'kernel' which is connected to 'Novel Corona Virus' data.\n* If you have any suggestions, please could you write for me?
