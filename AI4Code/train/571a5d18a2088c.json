COVID19\nCoronavirus disease is a contagious disease that is believed to have started in Wuhan, China in the month of December, 2019. The virus has been spreading worldwide since then and still hasn't been controlled. Several vaccines have been approved and distributed leading to mass vaccination drives. However, the virus seems to be constantly evolving and has not been properly controlled yet.\nThis analysis is for experimenting and the data can be found on Kaggle as a public dataset.","f6376ab5":"## Conclusion\n* On 11th August, 2021, total number of confirmed cases in India had reached 3.2 crores, out of which 3.1 crore poeple had been cured and the number of reported deaths was around 4.29 lakhs.\n* Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka were the top three states with the most confirmed cases.\n* In the cases by month graph, we see that the number of cases are less in winter months compared to summer months, which might suggest that coronavirus becomes more active in summer. However, I need more data to support this hypothesis.","4512f63c":"## Descriptive Analysis\nAs you can see below, the last data recorded in this dataset was on 11th August, 2021.
