This statistical method quantifies the degree to which ranked variables are associated by a monotonic function, meaning an increasing or decreasing relationship. As a statistical hypothesis test, the method assumes that the samples are uncorrelated (fail to reject H0).  \nTherefore, if our assumption is correct, the result of the test should enable us to reject the null hypothesis.","211b405b":"### E.
