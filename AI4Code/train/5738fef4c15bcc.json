First, we will use the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann-law\n\n$$P=e\\sigma AT^4$$\n\nHere the power $P$ is defined by the emissivity $e$ (equal to 1 for the sun since it is an almost perfect black body), the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant $\\sigma = 5.670373 \\times 10^{-8} Wm^{-2}K^{-4}$ and the temperature $T$ in Kelvin.\n\nSecond is the intensity of radiation $I$ defined as\n\n$$I=\\frac{P}{A}$$\n\nwith the power $P$ (here the sun) and the illuminated or radiating area $A$. For the latter we have to compare the area of the sun's surface to the area occupied by a sphere with the radius of one AU - Astronomical Unit or mean distance between earth and sun. Since the distance is far greater and the same power is radiated into this much larger area, the intensity is much lower.\n\nTo measure the irridated and absorbed power $P$ here on earth we measure the change in internal energy $Q$ over time $t$\n\n$$P=\\frac{Q}{t}$$\n\nLast we have to determinte the change in internal energy $Q$. This follows the relation \n\n$$Q=mc\\Delta T$$\n\nwith the mass $m$ of the heated water, the specific heat capacity $c=4.184 Jg^{-1}K^{-1}$ of water and the temperature change $\\Delta T$.\n\n### Setup\n\nWe placed a test tube with $22 mm$ diameter into the sun. Filled with $30 ml$ water the filled height was $100 mm$. The illuminated area can therefore be estimated as a rectangular with the length of $100 mm$ and width of $22 mm$. Note that you don't calculate the surface area of the test tube, which would be close to a cylinder. Only half of that area is irradiated by the sun. And this 50% area is not evenly illuminated, since the angle to the sun is changing around the cylinder. The effective illuminated area can be seen in the shadow - nearly a rectangle.\n\nLet's define our variables:","d2c93120":"# Huy's formula\n\nHuy says this is the correct formula:\n\n$$T=\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{mc\\Delta T}{tA}\\frac{r_{AU}^2}{\\sigma r_{SUN}^2}}$$\n\nNow we need the values","cb48f189":"In our final step we rearange the Stefan-Boltzmann law and bring the area on the left side of the equation, which gives us the intensity at suns surface.\n\n$$\\frac{P}{A_{sun}}=I_{sun}=\\sigma T^4$$\n\nThe temperature can now be calculated using\n\n$$T = \\sqrt[\\uproot{3}4]{\\frac{I_{sun}}{\\sigma}}$$","b199f8b8":"## Error calculation\n\nTo estimate our error for this measurement we take the percentage error for each measurement. The absolut values are $\\Delta m = 1 g$ for the mass of water, the area $A$ is calculated from the diameter $d = 0.022 m$ with $\\Delta d = 0.001 m$ and the length $l = 0.1 m$ with $\\Delta l = 0.001 m$. The temperature measurement has an uncertainty of $\\Delta T = 0.1 K$ for our temperature difference of $5.9 \\text{Kelvin}$. \n\nThe percentage error has then to be devided by 4 because we calculate the fourth root. We get an error of 2.5%. The absolute error is 150 Kelvin.
