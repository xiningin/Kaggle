This is an in-depth analysis of China's Ministry of Industrial and Information Technology (MIIT) from 2002 to 2018, and a complimentary to the [articles](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/computational-policy-intelligence-turning-data-part-1-roachell\/) written on LinkedIn. All statistical analysis are based on the data from the MIIT website. Conclusions are arrived from these logical probabilistic assumptions. For the whole story, please click [here](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/computational-policy-intelligence-how-does-machine-define-roachell\/).

(filter out topics by clicking the legend tabs)\n* For **Internet Product Marketization** topic, it appears to be the dominant topic among the MIIT publication documents starting from July 21st to October 11th. The hottest day for this topic was on July 29th, on which it appeared in 81% of all released documents. That was a big day for internet products regulations, according to the data. This also confirms with our previous findings of a large spike in publication volume in July 2017 with a record high number policy publications in total 356 documents. As mentioned before this spike can be associated with the [\u201cNew Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\u201d](https:\/\/flia.org\/notice-state-council-issuing-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan\/) (\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u89c4\u5212).\n\n### What is the relationship of **Public Opinion topic** and **Standard Setting** interacting with all the other topics?\n* **Public Opinion topic** appeared in 70% of all released public documents on November 10th.  \n* **Public Opinion** vs **Internet Product Marketization**: There are 2 insights we can gain from here. \n> 1. **They have the most obvious inverse relationship**: when *Public Opinion topic* decreases, *Internet Product Marketization* tends to spike (examples March 14, May 2, July 3, July 29th, August 22, and September 30). Vice versa, on days when *Public Opinion topic* is abnormally high, *Internet Product Marketization* tends to be the lowest (example Feb 6, Feb 23, March 27, June 12, August 14, Nov 10, and Dec 25). \n> 2. One can interpret that a spike in **Opinion & Feedback Policy Output** is a *clear predictor* for an immediate rise in **Internet Product Marketization** related policy output. What does that mean? Perhaps the public feedback opinions in 2017 are strongly connected to the Internet Product Marketization policies by causal relationship.  It appears that large abnormal spikes in **Opinion & Feedback Policy topics** give signal to a large volume of **Internet Product Marketization** output later down the timeline. This can be confirmed by the released of several AI related action plans such as[ Three-Year Action Plan for Promoting Development of a New Generation Artificial Intelligence Industry (2018\u20132020)](https:\/\/www.newamerica.org\/cybersecurity-initiative\/digichina\/blog\/translation-chinese-government-outlines-ai-ambitions-through-2020\/) published December 2017 and the previous mentioned [\u201cNew Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\u201d](https:\/\/flia.org\/notice-state-council-issuing-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan\/) (\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u89c4\u5212). \n\n* **Setting National Business Standards** vs **Internet Product Marketization**: also share a similar inverse relationship. \n> We can assume **time relation matters**: right after a huge spike in *Internet Product Marketization* topics, there is also a huge spike of *Setting National Business Standards* topics later down the timeline. A time-series autocorrelation test can be utilized to further explore a causal relationship; however I will not be performing that in this analysis.\n\n# Thus we can interpret MIIT's policy publication behavior are as follows: \n> ## In the year 2017, data has led us to reasonably conclude that there may be a causal relationship between how *MIIT ask for public opinion feedback* and *Marketization of Internet products*, which then has some influence on the *establishment of business technology standard-setting policies*. It is not clear which variable comes first or last, for all we know, this can be a cycle of constant feedback-test-standardization loop. \n\n\n#### To see the whole story, please click [here](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/computational-policy-intelligence-turning-data-part-1-roachell\/).","1a48b550":"# Quick Glance at the dataset from Ministry of Industrial and Information Technology (MIIT):\n- source: http:\/\/www.miit.gov.cn\/\n- composition of data:\n>>*     1\/3 from document release section (\u6587\u4ef6\u516c\u793a).\n>>*     1\/3 from official policy regulations publications (\u6587\u4ef6\u53d1\u5e03).\n>>*     1\/3 from policy explanation (\u653f\u7b56\u89e3\u8bfb).\n\n#### From my initial China Industrial Policy [topical modeling analysis](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/computational-policy-intelligence-turning-data-part-1-roachell\/) using Python Gensim package, we learned that the Machine has summarized the more than 9000 policy-related documents into five different topical themes. Reading and learning from these 9000 policy documents took the Machine **less than 3 minutes** (training process), but it would probably take a human **3 weeks**! **That is the power of Machine Learning!**\n","24398b2a":"#### Note: filter out topics by clicking the legend tabs\n# **Analysis**:\n\n*What we already know:* When more than 9000 policy documents (Input) from 2004 to 2018 were fed through the machine learning model, the Machine discovered there are **five major topical themes**:\n1. Industrial and business information products.\n2. **Public opinion concerning industrial policy. (Important predictor)**\n3. **Internet product marketization. (Important Predictor)**\n4. Automotive production and equipment.\n5. **Setting national business technology standards. (Most Important predictor)**\n\n### Observations:\nNotice from 2010 to 2015, our *Policy Life-time Cycle hypethesis* appears to be applicable here. We should see an increasing amount of **Public Opinion topic** released, then immediately follow by an increasing volume of **Setting national business technology standards** topic. That is exactly what is being displayed here from 2010 to 2015, with an increase of **Public Opinion topic** from 5% to 28% (2010 to 2012), followed by an increase in **Setting national business technology standards** topic from 17% to 64% (2012 to 2015).\n\n**Note**: through out the analysis, be aware of the percentage of these topics label in Orange, Green, and Purple. \n\n### **Let's analyze these 5 topics individually:**\n1. **Industrial and business information products** may include online or offline manufacturing equipment in any industry or sector, perhaps focused more in the B2B area. From 2007 to 2013 marks the first wave of *Industrial Business Information products* related policy topic. Its zenith was reached in 2010, when this topic made up 72% of all policy documents published by MIIT. In other words, this topic appeared in 72% of all MIIT published policy documents in 2010. We can conclude that 2010 was a big year for policies concerning Industrial information products. The second wave of this topic appeared  from 2014 to 2017, with its height reaching slightly less than the first wave at 61%. \n\n2. **Public Opinion concerning industrial policy** is actually strong predictor of policy publication. We know this from the RandomForest classification feature importance analysis [here](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/computational-policy-intelligence-turning-data-part-1-roachell\/). This actually raises some interesting questions about China's Political Economy. One can argue that industrial policy is essentially top-down control of certain industrial sectors like banking, telecom, insurance, and railroads, that's why there are so many State-Own-Enterprises (SOE) in those sectors. The real question is: if the State dictates what the demand should be in the economy, then why do they need **public opinion & feedback** for? To put it in perspective, since Deng Xiaoping's *[Reform and Opening Up](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chinese_economic_reform)* policy, China has been working toward liberalizing certain market sectors. The data in the graph supports this *reform and opening up strategy* as it displays a huge percentage growth of **Public Opinion Topic** related documents from 2016 up to 2018. Data suggests that this **Public Opinion Topic** has been somewhat relatively poorly represented from years 2004 up to 2010. However, we can conclude that from 2016 up to present, MIIT has been very busy asking for the opinions of the market, representing about 85% of all policy publications in 2018. This is a good sign that China's information technology industry is and continues to be market-driven. A good follow up question would be: what are these opinions and feedback about? If we understand these feedback concerns, then we can better predict whether policies will tightening or expanding. \n\n3. **Internet Product Marketization** is mainly regarding E-commerce, Artificial Intelligence and information technology products most likely for the B2C area. This topic has been playing a minor role in the overall grand themes of all policies, only covering less than 10% of all topics published year to year. However, it does not mean it\u2019s not an important predictor in policy regulation release in the future. \n\n4. **Automotive Production & Equipment** is an obvious topic that addresses the entire automotive industry and perhaps contingent on EV market as well. From the interactive chart, data indicates that from 2004 to 2009, MIIT published many regulations concerning the automotive industry (make up 55% of all topics), an illustration which confirms with the [2004 Automotive Industry Development- Policy](https:\/\/www.cecc.gov\/publications\/commission-analysis\/china-revises-2004-auto-policy). From 2004 to 2007, MIIT policy publications regarding the automotive market grew almost by three times (from 24% to 65% overall). In 2009, a newly-revised version of the old 2004 Automotive Policy was published. We can conclude that the Machine is surprisingly relatively accurate in depicting this time-line. \n\n5. **Setting National Business Tech standards** is the most important topic with the highest predictive power, according to my [feature importance analysis](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/computational-policy-intelligence-turning-data-part-1-roachell\/). From 2003 to 2006, data suggests that MIIT began publishing the first wave of documents concerning **National Standard Setting**. Furthermore, during 2004 to 2005, this topic appeared in 56% of overall published documents. The large-scale *2004 Automotive Industry Development Policy* could be a driving factor for this rise of standard-setting regulations. The second wave of standard-setting policies started in 2013 and ended in 2015 representing 64% of all published topics. These statistics acts as a confirmation of Xi Jinping\u2019s [One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) announced in 2013, which is all about setting infrastructural standards. \n\n","5e2561bf":"## **Life-time Cycle of a MIIT Policy from incubation to publication**\n**What we already know**: there are 3 main policy document repositories: 1) **\"document release section (\u6587\u4ef6\u516c\u793a)\"** ,2) **policy regulations publications (\u6587\u4ef6\u53d1\u5e03)**, 3) **policy explanation (\u653f\u7b56\u89e3\u8bfb)**. From my data analysis, *public opinion & feedback* *Internet Product Marketization* and *Standard Setting* are most important topical variables in determining policy document publication. When a policy proposal is released, it most likely will initially appear under the **\"document release section (\u6587\u4ef6\u516c\u793a)\"** for public viewing and feedback (mainly from business stakeholders and investors). Thus by this logic, I hypothesize that a policy document first incubate in the **\"document release section (\u6587\u4ef6\u516c\u793a)\"**, subsequently when feedback window ends, MIIT collects all the feedbacks and adjusts the policy accordingly. Next, MIIT publishes the policy under the **policy regulations publications (\u6587\u4ef6\u53d1\u5e03)** section of the website. Lastly, explanations and expectations of the newly released policy are published under the **policy explanation (\u653f\u7b56\u89e3\u8bfb)**. This policy generation pipeline guarantees initial feedback from the market, as well as knowledge sharing among the stakeholders, the Government, and the market. \n\n### By this logic, can we assume there is a Policy Generation Pipeline:\n- A high volume of output from the **Document Release (\u6587\u4ef6\u516c\u793a)** section of the website will lead to a high volume of output from the **Policy Regulations Publications (\u6587\u4ef6\u53d1\u5e03)** section, following by a high volume of **policy explanation (\u653f\u7b56\u89e3\u8bfb)** publication.\n\nThis is my personal assessment from my research on the topic, but other scholars may have different perspective on this policy incubation to publication pipeline.","889748f8":"## Analysis of the Timeline\n\n* This interactive visualization displays the cumulative number of policy documents published per month, dynamically moving from 2002 to 2018. \n* We can safely assume 2002 was the year that MIIT started to become active online because of the relatively low number of policy document output. \n* From 2005 to 2007, the number of publication still remain relatively low, approximiately less than 10 per month. \n* In October 2008, data indicates that MIIT published 76 policies, which is a huge spike in publication output comparing to previous publication behaviors. Concurrent to this point in time, the 2008 Financial Crisis rang all around the world, a factor that perhaps could have explained this sudden spike in MIIT's policy-publication behavior, indirectly reflecting Beijing's fear of the Financial Crisis spreading to China. \n* December 2015: reflects the highest record of policy regulation output of the year with 137 policy documents. The [\"Made In China 2025\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Made_in_China_2025) released in May 2015 perhaps contributed a delayed whip-effect on the regulation publication of the MIIT, thus causing a spike in December 2015. \n* August-September 2016: displays the highest number of policy regulation output of the year with 258 documents in total. Concurrently, MIIT had released the [Temporary Management Regulation for Corporate Average Fuel Consumption (CAFC) and New-Energy Vehicle (NEV) Credits](https:\/\/www.theicct.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/China%20CAFC%20and%20NEV%20credits_policy-update_vF_06102016.pdf) on clean transportation policies. \n* July-August 2017: displays a record high number policy publications in total 356 documents. One large factor that contributed to this spike was [\u201cNew Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\u201d](https:\/\/flia.org\/notice-state-council-issuing-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan\/) (\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u89c4\u5212) published July 2017 by the State Council, which plans to drastically change how China interacts with AI.\n\n## 2017 is an interesting year for MIIT: \n### *Here is what we already know:* MIIT published 1194 policy documents in total (including public policies, explanations, and feedback comments) during a 224-day publication period.  That's 2 out of 3 days during the year that something new was being published! Out of these 1194 policy documents, about 560 contain the topic of \"Public Opinion & Feedback\" (figure 1).  Now let's explore why that is and what are all these documents are about!"}}
