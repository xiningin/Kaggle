So the people who taken the loan depends on the family size and income level won't depends on past value. \n    \n   Consider the dataset of percentage of nitrogen level which are recorded every day. So Time series is defined as the data which is recorded consistently with time i.e hourly,daily,yearly,weekly etc. \n    \n   For forecasting the time series data we require the past data. We can't apply regression model because regression model won't consider the relationship between the past values.\n    \n**  Models can be applied on Time series Data: **\n\n**1. Naive Approch:**\n\nThe future data is predicted by the previous value. But the forecasting will be flat line.\n\n**2. Simpe Average Approch:**\n\nThe future data is predicted by the considering all the average of previous value.So by this forecastiong won't be flat line. But every time we won't require the all previous values for forecasting.\n\n**3.Moving Average Approch:**\n\nThe future value is predicted by considering N previous values. \n\n**4. Weighted Moving Average Approch:**\n\nThe future value is predicted by considering the different weights for previous N values. \n\n**5. Simple Exponentail Moving:**\n\nThe funture value is predicted by considering the more weights for most recent previous values and than the distant observations.\n\n**6.Holt's Linear Trend model:**\n\nIn the above approches the trend is not considered.  consider the booking of hotel are increasing every year, which means increasing trend.\n\n**7.Holt winter Method:**\n\nSimilar to holt's linear trend model also it consider seasonality. Not only booking of hotel are increasing every year but weekdays the bookings are decreasing and increasing at the weekend. \n\n**8.ARIMA:**\n\nARIMA is the most widely used  method for time series. Auto Regression integrated moving average.ARIMA provides the correlation between the datapoints. So ARIMA considers the data as the stationay. \n\n** *Stationay Data- Mean and Covarience must be constant according time.* **\nStationary can be made by using log transformation. Also data provided input must be as the univarient,since arima uses the past values for prediction of fututre of values. ARIMA has 3 components\nAR-Auto regression. I- differencing term, MA- moving average.\n\n**  *AR- term uses the past value for forecasting the next value. So it is defined by 'p' and determined by PACF plot.* **  \n\n**   *MA- uses the past forecast errors used to predict the fututre values. So it is defined as 'q' and determined by ACF plot.* **  \n\n**  *d- differencing order specifies the number of times differencing operation is performed on series to make it stationary.* **  \n\n**9. AUTO ARIMA:**\n\nIt is same to ARIMA model but there is no need to find the values of 'p' and 'q'. These values are calucluated automatically by the auto arima model.    \n\n**We will use ARIMA and build an AUTO ARIMA function here**\n   ","c4c52772":"Finding the best model with lowest AIC and parsing its results into a model","4b5bfa75":"**PLEASE VOTE FOR ENCOURAGEMENT**"}}
