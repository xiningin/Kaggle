analysis,we need to collect data of previously launched sounding rockets \ntemperatures at different seasons and needed to be compared with standard MSIS100 model data. \nThe temperatures are collected and compared in 'centigrade' and the data is collected at \nstratosphere region i.e; below 100km. Here, i conduct data visualization between 20-60km,\nthat is stratosphere region with step size 5. so i got 9 values for each season Here, i have\ncalculated accuracy of sounding rocket temperature data by maximum deviation and standard deviation"}}
