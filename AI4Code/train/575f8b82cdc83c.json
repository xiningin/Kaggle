Since SHAP values represent a feature's responsibility for a change in the model output, the plot below represents **the change in predicted placement as either of `'killPlace_MAX', 'walkDistance_MEAN', 'weaponsAcquired_MIN'`changes**. \n\nNote that This plot also shows the strongest interaction on the feature with another feature in the dataset:\n\n> Vertical dispersion at a single value of the X axis represents interaction effects with other features.
