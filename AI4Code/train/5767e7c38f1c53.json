We see that there are some missing values as the total count of different columns are different. One student has not provided his\/her name and around 58 students have not provided their email addresses. In name column we have 50479 unique values, some people might be having same names. In email Id column we have 65058 unique mail ids. This means some students have used their friend's email id. Similarly we have 65526 unique mobile nos , that means around 8 students have used their friend's mobile number. We see that there are 25 unique colleges from where we had our students. The top field shows the most occuring entity. So we can see that Amit Kumar is the most occuring name, ajay_kanojiya23@yahoo.com was used the most number of times. 991108911 is the mobile no. used by most number of students. And we had maximum students from CVS college."}}
