Hence, we will keep all of the predictors in our current model.\n\nLet's also create a regularized regression model, Ridge Regression to see if it will perform better than our previous multiple regression approach. We will be using grid search to find the optimal value for the hyperparameter alpha.","7e749b4c":"The model's RMSE (on the scale of the dependent variable) is 1.171 which is a satisfactory result for our model.\n\nLet's have a look at our Ridge Regression model to see if it has a lower RMSE.","809c1767":"\"added_status_beaten\", \"added_status_owned\", \"added_status_dropped\", \"added_status_playing\", \"added_status_toplay\" are prime candidates for independent variables for counting the number of reviews. But because of high multicollinearity between some of these variables. \"added_status_beaten\", \"added_status_toplay\" and, \"added_status_dropped\" are the only ones that will be added. \"rating_top\" and \"rating\" are both moderately correlated as well with \"review count\". But again, due to multicollinearity with these variables, we'll only choose to add in \"rating\". We'll also throw in \"suggestions_count\" and \"game_series_count\" despite the weak correlation to test if it improves the predictive power.\n\n**Note**: We are not including \"ratings_count\" because giving a rating indicates giving a review as well at RAWG so that shows a clear bias.\n\nLet's now visualize the plot between each predictor against the number of reviews to check if it follows a linear relationship.","c92125d3":"It becomes apparent that some of the relationships shown above exhibits a cone-shaped pattern. This could be a problem as the residuals plot may show heteroscedasticity. Some of the relationships as well especially on variables such as \"rating\" and \"suggestions_count\" shows that the line is heavily pulled by a lot of data points that have low amount of reviews despite the high rating or high suggestion counts. This makes sense as instances where there's only a single review with a high rating happens often which pulls our line downwards heavily. Let's log transform these variables to see if it fixes some of the problems.","1b61b137":"First, we'd like to train our model with as much data as possible. Let's look at the independent variables with the most amount of missing values (Top 5).","33ae2ab9":"# Predicting the number of Reviews of a Video Game: A Regression Approach\nWe will be using the video games dataset collected from RAWG which is one of the biggest video games databases. A question that will be answered today is if it's possible to create a fairly accurate model that predicts the number of reviews a game would have given a certain amount of independent variables. To answer this question, we will be performing a multiple regression approach first then try out a regularized regression method.","22d4272f":"By performing a log transformation on some of the independent variables along with the dependent variable, we have seen a lot of improvement with the relationships. The only instance where the correlation dropped is when we compare log transformed added_status_beaten and log transformed reviews_count. We see an improvement with every other relationship. The only variable that wasn't log transformed is suggestions_count as the correlation between the log transformed dependent variable and the log-transformed suggestions_count is significantly lower than if we don't do a log transformation on that variable.\n\nBy that, we should be ready to start creating our model.\n\n## Modeling\nWe'll be using Scikit-Learn to train our multiple regression model. We will be using the closed-form solution way to obtain our model parameters so we won't have to do feature scaling for our variables. We'll also be splitting our dataset into training and testing.","7cebdde9":"Let's first load our dependencies.","a8a80722":"Let's have a look at our model's RMSE.","56e2b21a":"## Feature Selection:\nNow that we're all set.

We will be choosing the row with the highest amount of reviews to see what our model predicts.","f6497a40":"This does not tell us a lot though as the units are dependent on the scale of our dependent variable which has been log transformed. Let's reverse the log transform of the RMSE to check its value on a much understandable scale.","9cda39a3":"The max amount of reviews for a single game in the test set is 1811 reviews. Let's see what our model predicted.","64451e0b":"The model seemed to do a pretty good job with predicting the amount of reviews as it was off by only 88 reviews.\n\n## Conclusion and where to go from here:\n\nThe model is far from perfect but with the given variables, we can show that it is possible to have a fairly accurate model that predicts the amount of reviews a game has. Future works on this problem could try out other feature selection methods and could even go for text mining utilizing the previously dropped categorical variables. Other modeling alternatives could be used as well that could provide more accurate results. \n\n\nExample alternative modeling techniques that could be used in this problem: Deep learning (ReLu as the final activation unit) or other regularized regression techniques.","b06b6e62":"Modify years to an integer variable.
