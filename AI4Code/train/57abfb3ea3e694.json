Other things I said in this work. Well, please rate this notebook and leave your comments. \nGood luck!","c857abf6":"So, what is about Europe:","676a6f78":"After this we can plot the best-selling genre in each country beginning with Global Sales. We will use method groupby and usual plot, because we don\u2019t need in very hard graph here. This plot is about genres and Global Sales around the world:","77aa9e95":"4)\tCorrelation\nIn my opinion to know correlation between different qualities is very interesting. Well, let`s try to do this.\nInformation about simple correlation you can see here: https:\/\/www.educba.com\/correlation-formula\/\n\nWe will use the method corr() and heatmap. It looks like this:","1d5bfa1b":"Here we can see the best-selling games in each genre. For example, there are GTA games in first three places in Action genre, in the Shooter genre the same situation that one game series in first three places.","ff3c542f":"Here we can see that:\n\n\u2022 Action and Sport games are in the top again, it means that best-selling genres are Action and Sport;\n\n\u2022 Less selling is Strategy games again and Adventure.\n","edd532f7":"Second column is Platform and it is more interesting. Firstly, we can make countplot about names of platforms and the number of games which was made for it. It is will look like that:","3c87ae43":"Here we can see that:\n\n\u2022 The top 3 genres are Action, Sports and Shooter again;\n\n\u2022 Strategy and Adventure is the less popular.","2089ad19":"The next column is Year_of_Release. Here we can make distplot and learn how many computer games were made in each year. Also we must to use method dropna() because there are null variables. This plot looks like this:","a5bf16ea":"About dataset\nThis data includes many different things about computer games since 1980 to nowadays, also there are columns about ratings, sales, genres and etcetera. I have chosen this dataset because I`m only 14 years old, that\u2019s why I love computer games and want to know more information about it. Let\u2019s start work with it.","d2abeb0c":"Here we can see that:\n\n\u2022 More than 1400 games were released in 2008 and 2009;\n\n\u2022 In 2020 were released very few video games.","0e291d52":"Here we can see that:\n\n\u2022\tThe most popular genres are Action is about 3400 games and Sport is about 2400 games;\n\n\u2022\tThe least popular genres are Strategy games and Puzzles.","46a76fd9":"Next columns are about sales. I think for fast analyze we can choose only global sales. So, let`s try to work with this column. In my opinion the most interesting thing here is to know what game in each genre is the most salable. To do this we should make a new dataframe which will include the information we need. We can do this with this code:","48c2df04":"Well, we did good job and we can go to data visualization!","9e32f18e":"Here we can see that:\n\n\u2022\tThe most popular publishers are Electronic Arts and Activision;\n\n\u2022\tElectronic Arts published more than 1300 games.","39ed71aa":"As we can see there are null variables in these columns: Name, Year_of_Release, Genre, Publisher, Critic_Score, Critic_Count, User_Score, User_Count, Developer, Rating. ","cc6ef2de":"Here we can see that:\n\n\u2022 Situation in other countries is similar with Europe and North America.","3806b811":"Here we can see that:\n\n\u2022 The top of genres in Japan is more interesting than in other countries, because we can see Role-Playing genre at the     first place;\n\n\u2022 Shooter genre at the last position;\n\n\u2022 Also, Platform games in Japan are more popular than in other countries.","e9afd418":"Now we are going to watch the situation in Japan:","416c3c0c":"We know that correlation is defined in range from -1 to 1, that\u2019s why we can see that:\n\n\u2022 Year of Release slightly influence on Critics and User Count, because the correlation between these qualities is 0.22 and 0.18;\n\n\u2022 Correlation between Year of Release and Global Sales is too small, but I thought that will be bigger.","854744d6":"Let`s see this information, but about other continents. Firstly, about North America:","dabf327e":"2)\tDataset Description.\nFirstly, look at 5 strings of this data. We can see all columns here. ","622c47ff":"1) Import libraries and load data.\nThis stage is one of the easiest, I think everyone understand it.","a846603a":"Here we can see that:\n\n\u2022 The most popular platform is PlayStation 2 and DS, after them, on 3rd place is Wii;\n\n\u2022 More than 2000 games were made for DS and PS2.","a20a86a6":"The 4th column is Genre. It is interesting column to explore, because we can learn the best-selling genre and the most popular genre. Let`s try do this. This column includes null variable too, so we should to drop nan values again. The countplot of genres looks like this:","20dd963a":"I also think that we must to know numeric features describing, because it is important part of data analyzing. ","f2d20478":"For best understanding let`s print the list of columns\u2019 names and also the size of our data. ","5593a201":"3) Data Visualization. I think the best way to explore data is go in ascending column order. So, lets start. First column is Name, but I think we cant visualize anything here.","38d68147":"**Hello everyone!** This my first serious work, so I wait for your comments. I think they will be helpful for me and I will take a lot important information from it. Well, Lets go!","062b936a":"Let`s go to the 5th column. It is Publisher. This column tells to us about publishers of different computer games. So, we will plot this info using countplot and argument order. This graph includes top 10 publishers:","9041d150":"Since we spoke about other countries let`s plot information about them:","7b2357b7":"Here we can see that dataset has 16 columns and names of these columns. After that we understand that there are columns about sales in different countries, ratings, names of games, games` developers, platforms, publishers and year of release.","4ae4a53b":"To know how many null variables in data is important too, because when we describe columns we must to know about Nan variables. That\u2019s why we will check this. ","757e040b":"Here we can see:\n\n\u2022 Top 3 genres are the same like in North America;\n\n\u2022 But the Adventure genre is more popular in Europe than in Noth America."}}
