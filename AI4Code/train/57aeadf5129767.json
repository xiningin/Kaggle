Distribution.\nWhilst the LogNormal and Johnson SB (Bounded) Distributions are fit quite well,\nThe Johnson SU (Unbounded) Distribution is fit more optimally.\n\nThe Johnson's SU distribution (Unbounded) is a distribution that goes to infinity in both the upper or lower tail.","ab48297c":"Whilst doing a log('SalePrice') transformation will yield satisfactory results, the more optimal choice would be a log1p('SalePrice') transformation.\n\nThe log1p(x) calculates log(1 + x) and returns the natural logarithm of one plus the input array, element-wise.\n\nSince for real-valued input, log1p is accurate also for x so small that 1 + x == 1 in floating-point accuracy.\nThis will help getting the target variable to follow an unbounded Johnson distribution better accounting for the fact that the distribution goes to infinity in both upper or lower tail.","1562c813":"<img src=\"https:\/\/kimcranehomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/20\/2018\/02\/market-stats.jpg\" style=\"width:

It also offers automatic feature selection because it can completely remove some features.\n\nRidge regression penalizes the squared size of coefficients which leads to smaller coefficients, but it doesn't force them to 0.
