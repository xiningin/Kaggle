On this training dataset, we removed all NaN values but that may not be true considering some predictor unknown data (test dataset). We also make some data transformation to make sure that our model can correctly understand data.\n\nAs a programming strategy, we will be using sklearn [Pipeline](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) at all steps during our training. This approach makes it easier to have the same transformation at different datasets and to have better control of the entire model pipeline.\n\n**Categorical Features**\n1. Fill all missing values with the string `missing` using [SimpleImputer](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html)\n1. Transform all categorical features into ordinal categories using [OrdinalEncoder](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.html). Here, we use this transformation for the column `Type`.\n\n**Numerical Features**\n1. All numerical data were transformed into `float64` on function **create_features**\n1. Fill all missing values to -9999 using [SimpleImputer](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html). We don't have any on the training set, but that can not be true on the test set.  -9999 were chosen because this value is lower than any other value at [Descriptive Analysis](#descriptive-analysis)\n1.
