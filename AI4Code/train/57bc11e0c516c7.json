questions posed in the competition (some theories, just theories)\nDigital learning was the only option during the pandemic, and I can't speak to how many people adjusted, but it seems that those who did, adjusted well, seeing that the patterns which you would normally expect in school as a graphh of mean enthusiasm\/interest in class was fairly similar to that of the mean_engagement_index. \n\nAlthough we analysed more products related to LC and CM than we did SDO, it is evident that school planning was the major utiliser of online platforms and resources to continue education, followed by classroom management, and then curriculum. I think this shows that the institutions were the ones who had to take up drastic changes, with rethinking the entire way of managing schedules, classes, clubs etc., then comes the teachers managing their classes, who had to go through monumental changes as well, but the change wasn't as drastic (probably becuase Google Classroom and things like that are already used in countries like America, not sure if this is true, ut I think it is), and finally the thing that changed the least is the curriculum, which is to be expected, as most teachers (atleast in my experience), continued to teach the same curriculum, only in the online mode. Some changes have been incorporated, but the base remained the same and this would explain the comparatively low usage of LC products.\n\nFinally, for the questions of how demographics\/state policies affected learning, I couldn't begin to theorise (sorry)","ca6e6b39":"### Functionwise\nFirst, I separate the LC, CM and SDO out as Function Categories \\\nThen, I repeated the process for the sector(s) with the sub-categories \n\nIn essence\\\nIf a product had Primary Essential Function as LC - Sites, Resources & Reference, Games & Simulations \\\nIn the new dataframe, it has two entries, with all the details, and an added column of Primary Essential Function Category which shows LC for both and in those 2 entries, one will have Primary Essential Function as Sites, Resources & Reference], one will have Games & Simulations","d3f00064":"This would possibly have been the most interesting and insightful type of analysis, but I haven't done it yet :(","9de4f8ce":"#### Holidays\nI got the holidays on 2020, and made a bar graph coloring them separately","3fc5108c":"Another interesting piece of info, is that on Mondays and Fridays, there's a drop, and if you remove all the Mondays and Fridays, you get a pretty smooth trend line\\\n\n**The main dip is during the summer break, and the rest is more or less consistent, but there is a pretty big jump around Feb-Mar. That was the time most of the schools, daycares and all closed down, so, I guess that's what caused our big jump**\n\n**There appears to be a spike around mid-September and lasting for a few more weeks before dropping back to fairly regulat. And although I am not American, it appears that they start their school year somewhere around mid-September or end-September. So, it would appear that the jump is caused by enthusiasm during the beginning of the school year, which waned off in the next few weeks, and this would explain the return to normal that is seen by those who weren't just a part of the over-eager students in the beginning, but were consistently studying** (PS: This is just a guess I have as a student, because I have seen this spike and dip happen)\n","99b38204":"## Productwise analysis","17ffa751":"To summarise this, for sectorwise and productwise, it is quite clear \\\nFor the functionwise details, when seen with the engagement index as well, each seems to have a fairly similar trajectory, one that matches up quite neatly with the mean_engagement_index (eception: initially, the mean engagement index was below the CM values, but it eventually dropped below, and continued that way)\n\nAlso at an given date, *SDO > CM > LC = LC\/CM\/SDO* \n\nAlso, SDO sees a visibly higher peak during mid- to end-September, which would make sense if schools reopened then and there were the intiial management things to get through before settling back to normal","f71a641d":"Okay, so as of now, the 2-day dip is because of the weekends, and the holidays themselves do have little activity compared to the general activity at the time, but no other impact(which should have been pretty obvious)\\\n\\\nAlso, I am clearing up the weekends dips, and just have the weekdays to get an idea of the trend","d7c50938":"Get the mean of the usage of all products for each date of a district, like:\\\nOn 01\/01\/2021, product A had engagement_index = 10, product B had engagement_index = 20\\\nOn 02\/01\/2021, product A had engagement_index = 5, product B had engagement_index = 15\\\nSo, finally we have 01\/01\/2021: 15 and 02\/01\/02021:10\n\nAlso, I colored the weekends separately\n\n"}}
