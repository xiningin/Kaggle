Of course we don't expect to have labels in our serving data, so let's tell TFDV to ignore that.","dcaf8534":"We also split off a 'serving' dataset for this example, so we should check that too.  By default all datasets in a pipeline should use the same schema, but there are often exceptions. For example, in supervised learning we need to include labels in our dataset, but when we serve the model for inference the labels will not be included. In some cases introducing slight schema variations is necessary.\n\n**Environments** can be used to express such requirements. In particular, features in schema can be associated with a set of environments using `default_environment`, `in_environment` and `not_in_environment`.\n\nFor example, in this dataset the `tips` feature is included as the label for training, but it's missing in the serving data. Without environment specified, it will show up as an anomaly.","569ff3ed":"We'll deal with the `tips` feature below.  We also have an INT value in our trip seconds, where our schema expected a FLOAT. By making us aware of that difference, TFDV helps uncover inconsistencies in the way the data is generated for training and serving. It's very easy to be unaware of problems like that until model performance suffers, sometimes catastrophically. It may or may not be a significant issue, but in any case this should be cause for further investigation.\n\nIn this case, we can safely convert INT values to FLOATs, so we want to tell TFDV to use our schema to infer the type.  Let's do that now.","2f30f0d4":"In this example we do see some drift, but it is well below the threshold that we've set.","ef19a195":"Hey, look at that!  We verified that the training and evaluation data are now consistent!  Thanks TFDV ;)","05dc2b80":"## Compute and visualize statistics\n\nFirst we'll use [`tfdv.generate_statistics_from_csv`](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tfx\/data_validation\/api_docs\/python\/tfdv\/generate_statistics_from_csv) to compute statistics for our training data. (ignore the snappy warnings)\n\nTFDV can compute descriptive [statistics](https:\/\/github.com\/tensorflow\/metadata\/blob\/v0.6.0\/tensorflow_metadata\/proto\/v0\/statistics.proto) that provide a quick overview of the data in terms of the features that are present and the shapes of their value distributions.\n\nInternally, TFDV uses [Apache Beam](https:\/\/beam.apache.org\/)'s data-parallel processing framework to scale the computation of statistics over large datasets. For applications that wish to integrate deeper with TFDV (e.g., attach statistics generation at the end of a data-generation pipeline), the API also exposes a Beam PTransform for statistics generation.","7a875432":"## Infer a schema\n\nNow let's use [`tfdv.infer_schema`](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tfx\/data_validation\/api_docs\/python\/tfdv\/infer_schema) to create a schema for our data.  A schema defines constraints for the data that are relevant for ML. Example constraints include the data type of each feature, whether it's numerical or categorical, or the frequency of its presence in the data.  For categorical features the schema also defines the domain - the list of acceptable values.  Since writing a schema can be a tedious task, especially for datasets with lots of features, TFDV provides a method to generate an initial version of the schema based on the descriptive statistics.\n\nGetting the schema right is important because the rest of our production pipeline will be relying on the schema that TFDV generates to be correct.  The schema also provides documentation for the data, and so is useful when different developers work on the same data.  Let's use [`tfdv.display_schema`](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tfx\/data_validation\/api_docs\/python\/tfdv\/display_schema) to display the inferred schema so that we can review it.","6aa659d0":"### Skew\n\nTFDV can detect three different kinds of skew in your data - schema skew, feature skew, and distribution skew.\n\n#### Schema Skew\n\nSchema skew occurs when the training and serving data do not conform to the same schema. Both training and serving data are expected to adhere to the same schema. Any expected deviations between the two (such as the label feature being only present in the training data but not in serving) should be specified through environments field in the schema.\n\n#### Feature Skew\n\nFeature skew occurs when the feature values that a model trains on are different from the feature values that it sees at serving time. For example, this can happen when:\n\n* A data source that provides some feature values is modified between training and serving time\n* There is different logic for generating features between training and serving. For example, if you apply some transformation only in one of the two code paths.\n\n#### Distribution Skew\n\nDistribution skew occurs when the distribution of the training dataset is significantly different from the distribution of the serving dataset. One of the key causes for distribution skew is using different code or different data sources to generate the training dataset. Another reason is a faulty sampling mechanism that chooses a non-representative subsample of the serving data to train on.","729fa17f":"##### Copyright &copy; 2020 The TensorFlow Authors.\n","0fef255c":"## Check evaluation data for errors\n\nSo far we've only been looking at the training data.  It's important that our evaluation data is consistent with our training data, including that it uses the same schema.  It's also important that the evaluation data includes examples of roughly the same ranges of values for our numerical features as our training data, so that our coverage of the loss surface during evaluation is roughly the same as during training.  The same is true for categorical features.  Otherwise, we may have training issues that are not identified during evaluation, because we didn't evaluate part of our loss surface.\n\n* Notice that each feature now includes statistics for both the training and evaluation datasets.\n* Notice that the charts now have both the training and evaluation datasets overlaid, making it easy to compare them.\n* Notice that the charts now include a percentages view, which can be combined with log or the default linear scales.\n* Notice that the mean and median for `trip_miles` are different for the training versus the evaluation datasets.  Will that cause problems?\n* Wow, the max `tips` is very different for the training versus the evaluation datasets.  Will that cause problems?\n* Click expand on the Numeric Features chart, and select the log scale.  Review the `trip_seconds` feature, and notice the difference in the max.

It's also important to look for anomalies in your data, and to compare your training, evaluation, and serving datasets to make sure that they're consistent.\n\nWe'll use data from the [Taxi Trips dataset](https:\/\/data.cityofchicago.org\/Transportation\/Taxi-Trips\/wrvz-psew) released by the City of Chicago.\n\nNote: This site provides applications using data that has been modified for use from its original source, www.cityofchicago.org, the official website of the City of Chicago.

It looks like we have some new values for `company` in our evaluation data, that we didn't have in our training data.  We also have a new value for `payment_type`.  These should be considered anomalies, but what we decide to do about them depends on our domain knowledge of the data.  If an anomaly truly indicates a data error, then the underlying data should be fixed.  Otherwise, we can simply update the schema to include the values in the eval dataset.\n\nKey Point: How would our evaluation results be affected if we did not fix these problems?\n\nUnless we change our evaluation dataset we can't fix everything, but we can fix things in the schema that we're comfortable accepting.  That includes relaxing our view of what is and what is not an anomaly for particular features, as well as updating our schema to include missing values for categorical features.  TFDV has enabled us to discover what we need to fix.\n\nLet's make those fixes now, and then review one more time."}}
