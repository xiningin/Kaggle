As there is a huge drop in the number of questions per daily email after 3 questions per mail, I have split the graph of the number of questions in daily mails into two figures (please notice the very different scales!).The number of daily emails with 4 questions is still 4,000+. Small numbers of daily emails have a very large number of questions, and the the maximum number of questions found in a daily email is 90 (one email).\n\nWe can also see that almost all immediate emails have exactly one question (never more than one question, and sometimes no questions).\n\nThe graph of the weekly emails shows a strange pattern. Most weekly emails contain 19 questions (why this number?). Few weekly emails have more than 20 questions (the small amounts are not visible on the graph).\n\n**Overall, the largest chunks within the total of about 1,800,000 emails are: almost 1,000,000 daily emails with three questions (about 3 million questions), about 300,000 daily emails with one question, and also about 300,000 immediate emails with one question. In addition, the about 230,000 questions are raised in the relatively small number of 12,000 weekly emails with 19 questions**.","1c0a5ed1":"As I am also interested to see how many questions are raised by email type (daily, immediate, weekly), I have joined this info from the email file before showing the head() of the matches below.","8a5c739c":"## 2.5 Matches\nmatches.csv: Each row tells you which questions were included in emails.

The CareerVillage.org analytics competition\n\nCareerVillage.org is a nonprofit that crowdsources career advice for underserved youth. Founded in 2011 in four classrooms in New York City, the platform has now served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners. The platform uses a Q&A style similar to StackOverflow or Quora to provide students with answers to any question about any career.\n\nIn this Data Science for Good challenge, CareerVillage.org, in partnership with Google.org, is inviting you to help recommend questions to appropriate volunteers. To support this challenge, CareerVillage.org has supplied five years of data.\n\n**Problem Statement**\nThe U.S. has almost 500 students for every guidance counselor. Underserved youth lack the network to find their career role models, making CareerVillage.org the only option for millions of young people in America and around the globe with nowhere else to turn.\n\nTo date, 25,000 volunteers have created profiles and opted in to receive emails when a career question is a good fit for them. This is where your skills come in. To help students get the advice they need, the team at CareerVillage.org needs to be able to send the right questions to the right volunteers. The notifications sent to volunteers seem to have the greatest impact on how many questions are answered.\n\nYour objective: develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them.","137fa905":"## 2.2 Professionals\nWe have 28,152 professionals in our database with 4 variables.","6714d7ff":"**This is work in progress.Please stay tuned!**","bc922e13":"The tags file contains the tag_name for each tag_id.","045021a4":"## 2.3 Questions and answers\nAltogether, we have 23,931 questions with 4 variables","3922bc31":"### 2.2.2 Industries","599c5d5f":"Altogether, we have 51,123 answers which 4 variables.","6d25728d":"CareerVillage.org has provided several years of anonymized data and each file comes from a table in their database.\n\n* answers.csv: Answers are what this is all about!
