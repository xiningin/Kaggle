However, a common question that arises is - Why move to neural networks when we had the traditional machine learning algorithms? So let us have a look at the differences now.\n\nWe will see the differences between the two techniques based on the following parameters-\n\n* **1. Feature Engineering**\n\nMachine Learning - requires extensive feature engineering for the model to perform better.\nDeep Learning - learns to extract the relevant features from the dataset \n\n* **2. Performance with data**\n\nDeep Learning - performs poorly with lesser data but outshines the traditional machine learning algorithms with huge amounts of data. Since we are generating huge amounts of data every day, deep learning algorithms definitely perform better.\n\n* **3. Computation Requirements**\n\nTraditional machine learning algorithms generally have a low computational requirement. However, since there are not that much of matrix multiplications required in the implementation unlike neural networks based learning, therefore, these algorithms are computationally extensive.\n    \nNow, with the huge amounts of data being generated and extensive computation abilities being present, organisations are stressing on deep learning research work and most of the AI-based applications are finding their foundations in Neural Networks.\n\nHappy Learning!","2816d4f0":"Now Let us import out data and get it ready for modelling.","bef4ef94":"## Reference Links - Evolution of Deep Neural Networks\n\n* **McCulloch-Pitts Neuron \u2014 Mankind\u2019s First Mathematical Model Of A Biological Neuron -** https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/mcculloch-pitts-model-5fdf65ac5dd1\n* **Perceptron Learning Algorithm: A Graphical Explanation Of Why It Works -** https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/perceptron-learning-algorithm-d5db0deab975\n\n* **How neural networks build up their understanding of images -** https:\/\/distill.pub\/2017\/feature-visualization\/\n\n* **TensorFlow Extended (TFX) is an end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines -** https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tfx"}}
