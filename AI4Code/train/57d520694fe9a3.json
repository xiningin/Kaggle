In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\nThe rest of the code are simply methods of the class which simply call the corresponding methods already existing within the sklearn classifiers. Essentially, we have created a wrapper class to extend the various Sklearn classifiers so that this should help us reduce having to write the same code over and over when we implement multiple learners to our stacker.","640e542e":"**Feature importances generated from the different classifiers**\n\nNow having learned our the first-level classifiers, we can utilise a very nifty feature of the Sklearn models and that is to output the importances of the various features in the training and test sets with one very simple line of code.\n\nAs per the Sklearn documentation, most of the classifiers are built in with an attribute which returns feature importances by simply typing in **.feature_importances_**. Therefore we will invoke this very useful attribute via our function earliand plot the feature importances as such","29bdc411":"Now let us calculate the mean of all the feature importances and store it as a new column in the feature importance dataframe.","03abbfe4":"**Plotly Barplot of Average Feature Importances**\n\nHaving obtained the mean feature importance across all our classifiers, we can plot them into a Plotly bar plot as follows:","1906b0e2":"**Parameters**\n\nJust a quick summary of the parameters that we will be listing here for completeness,\n\n**n_jobs** : Number of cores used for the training process. If set to -1, all cores are used.\n\n**n_estimators** : Number of classification trees in your learning model ( set to 10 per default)\n\n**max_depth** : Maximum depth of tree, or how much a node should be expanded. Beware if set to too high  a number would run the risk of overfitting as one would be growing the tree too deep\n\n**verbose** : Controls whether you want to output any text during the learning process. A value of 0 suppresses all text while a value of 3 outputs the tree learning process at every iteration.\n\n Please check out the full description via the official Sklearn website. There you will find that there are a whole host of other useful parameters that you can play around with. ","fc8af008":"Hello everyone, the original ensembling tutorial was not working properly. So the KFold error has been fixed for the original code, and should work now. Credits to the original authors of the ensembling tutorials.\n# Introduction\n\nThis notebook is a very basic and simple introductory primer to the method of ensembling (combining) base learning models, in particular the variant of ensembling known as Stacking. In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\n\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling\/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\n\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \n\n\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\n\n\n  [1]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mmueller\/allstate-claims-severity\/stacking-starter\/run\/390867\n  [2]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arthurtok\/titanic\/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808","d90a675a":"# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!","5904f4d3":"# Second-Level Predictions from the First-level Output","f897c717":"**Takeaway from the Plots**\n\nOne thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\nFinally let us generate some pairplots to observe the distribution of data from one feature to the other. Once again we use Seaborn to help us.","74de046a":"Furthermore, since having mentioned about Objects and classes within the OOP framework, let us now create 5 objects that represent our 5 learning models via our Helper Sklearn Class we defined earlier.","dc3e24ba":"**Output of the First level Predictions** \n\nWe now feed the training and test data into our 5 base classifiers and use the Out-of-Fold prediction function we defined earlier to generate our first level predictions.

As per the code below, we are therefore having as our new columns the first-level predictions from our earlier classifiers and we train the next classifier on this.","d5b6a954":"### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.","b17dc278":"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.","98c5fcdc":"Having now concatenated and joined both the first-level train and test predictions as x_train and x_test, we can now fit a second-level learning model.","8c0ad414":"**Interactive feature importances via Plotly scatterplots**\n\nI'll use the interactive Plotly package at this juncture to visualise the feature importances values of the different classifiers  via a plotly scatter plot by calling \"Scatter\" as follows:","0cafc9f2":"Just a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree.

Gradient Boosting classifer\n 5. Support Vector Machine","98e605a2":"### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code\/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn classifiers. Therefore this cuts out redundancy as  won't need to write the same methods five times if we wanted to invoke five different classifiers.","9a9542fc":"### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.
