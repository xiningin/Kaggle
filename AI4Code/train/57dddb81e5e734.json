The first, or \u201ctop\u201d one, is your systolic blood pressure. The second, or \u201cbottom,\u201d one is diastolic blood pressure.\n\nKnowing both is important and could save your life.\n\n## What Does the Systolic Blood Pressure Number Mean?\nWhen your heart beats, it squeezes and pushes blood through your arteries to the rest of your body. This force creates pressure on those blood vessels, and that's your systolic blood pressure.\n\n#### Here\u2019s how to understand your systolic blood pressure number:\n\n- Normal: Below 120\n- Elevated: 120-129\n- Stage 1 high blood pressure (also called hypertension): 130-139\n- Stage 2 hypertension: 140 or more\n- Hypertensive crisis: 180 or more. Call 911.\n\n\n\n## What Does the Diastolic Blood Pressure Number Mean?\nThe diastolic reading, or the bottom number, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. This is the time when the heart fills with blood and gets oxygen.\n\n#### This is what your diastolic blood pressure number means:\n\n- Normal: Lower than 80\n- Stage 1 hypertension: 80-89\n- Stage 2 hypertension: 90 or more\n- Hypertensive crisis: 120 or more. Call 911.\n\n\n(ref: https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/)","546def1c":"# Hiearchical Ordering "}}
