Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC? How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility? How did you verify the data's integrity? How does it help you answer your question? Are there any problems with the data?\n \n* **Process**: What tools are you choosing and why? Have you ensured your data's integrity? What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean? How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze? Have you documented your cleaning process so you can review and share those results?.\n\n* **Analyze**: How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it? Has your data been adequately formatted? What surprises did you discover in the data? What trends or relationships did you find in the data? How will these insights help answer your business questions?\n\n* **Share**: Were you able to answer the business questions? What story does your data tell? How do your findings relate to your original question? Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them? Can data visualization help you share your findings? Is your presentation accessible to your audience?\n\n* **Act**: What is your final conclusion based on your analysis? How could your team and business apply your insights?

They (the users) consented to submit their personal tracker data, including info about their physical activity, steps, daily activity, heart rate, and sleep.\n\n\nShould we find it necessary later, I'll consider using other datasets.","008c6af6":"Lastly, let's go the extra mile and extract information on the day, month, year and day of the week (*day_of_week*) from the formated dates:","a9768cc9":"# **Act** \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n---\n\nAaaaaand we're done!\n\nBased on our analysis, we've obtained some interesting insights.\n\n\n## Steps:\n- There's no apparent correlation between the day of the week and the level of activity.\n- Users take 7670 steps on average; according to a [2011 study](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3197470\/), the recommended amount of steps per day is 10,000 in healthy adults. Another cool note is that people who track their steps take ~2,500 more steps than those who don't. Walking is generally associated with a lower mortality risk.\n- There's a direct correlation between steps taken and calories burned. So we could design a model that predicts how many steps a user should take to burn x calories. The model would consider gender, age, weight, and height variables. Then, we could take those same variables to calculate the user's BMR.\n\n## Sleep:\n- There's an inversely proportional relation between minutes of sleep and minutes of sedentary activity. The more you sleep, the more likely you will spend LESS time in a sedentary state. We could implement tools that remind users to sleep at a particular time. We could offer sleep-tracking services that allow users to sleep optimally. This should also motivate users to wear our products all day, which means more data to improve our product!\n\nConclusions: We should develop software that allows users to track their steps in real-time. Some gamification (achievements, motivational messages per steps taken, etc.) could also be implemented to promote more step-taking! Sleep tracking should also help our users take better care of their health by adopting healthier habits while awake!\n\n\n# **FIN.**\n\nAnd that's it for now.\n\nI had tons of fun doing this.
