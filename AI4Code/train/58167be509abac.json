As we will observe sooner, each of these files consists of 60K lines. On the disk, size of the files under train and test directory is 30G.\n\nThere are mostly two problems we encounter as a Data Scientist when dealing with such a large volume of data:\n\n1. **Limited Memory:** For a normal laptop or desktop, memory (RAM) is often limited to 16 or 32 GB. So, it's kind of impossible to load all the data files together.\n2. **Limited CPU:** Libraries like pandas or numpy can utilize only 1 CPU at any point of time. As a result, even though the laptop\/desktop\/VM have multiple cores, we can't use those.\n\n**Dask** is a framework designed to overcome these limitations:\n\n1. **Parallel Computing:** Dask enables parallel computation using multi-core CPUs.\n2. **Out of Core Computing:** In case, the size of the data is larger than the memory (RAM), dask doesn't load all the data in-memory at a time. In turn, it streams the data from the disk as and when needed.\n\nDask can scale on thousand-machine clusters to handle hundreds of terabytes of data. At the same time, it works efficiently on a single machine as well, enabling analysis of moderately large datasets (100GB+) on relatively low power laptops.\n\nIn this notebook, we are going to focus on using Dask in a single machine.\n\n#### **Note: Since the number of CPUs available in Kaggle Kernel is just 4, this notebook takes lot of time to get executed. If you have a VM or a laptop with higher number of CPUs, this notebook will take much lesser time and help you to fully understand the power of Dask**","518e66a0":"### Compute number of observations for every segment in the Dask DataFrame","80a60234":"**There are approximately 265 million rows. This is huge.**\n\nHere, the compute() function has been invoked implicitly by Dask. As expected, Dask needs to read all the CSV files from the disk, calculate the number or rows of each file and then add those values to compute the final result. It took arond 8 min 47 seconds. If we can increase the number of cores, this value will come down drastically."}}
