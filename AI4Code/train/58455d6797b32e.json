For the purpose of convinience 'Currently Not Employed' are referred as 'CNE' through out the story.","887b9e43":"### ML experience and Neural networks","c670dcf0":"#### Except 'Research scientist', all the other ML related current roles are mostly from the age group '25-29' and many of them are also from the age group '30-34'. Since most of the CNEs are from age group '25-29', the opportunity for them is high.","63ec0739":"#### Tensorflow is more popular than Keras among all the years of ML experience. Both the frameworks are used by most of the CNEs with ML experience of '0-2 years'. Considerable number of CNEs with '2-3 years' of ML experience also use these frameworks.","0dd16b8b":"#### The countries like \u2018India\u2019,'Brazil\u2019 and \u2018Other\u2019 have more number of smaller companies. India have both high number of smaller and bigger companies creating an opportunity for the CNEs from India.

","714f7af5":"#### Both the smaller and bigger companies have most number of employees with ML experience of '0-2 years'. Some of these companies also have few employees with '2-3 years' of ML experience. Since most of the CNEs also have same ML experience of '0-2 years', there is a good opportunity for them. ","83412118":"#### Most of the smaller companies and the bigger companies are not investing much on the ML. But few of such companies are investing good amount on ML, which gives an opportunity for the development of ML and creates an opportunity for the CNEs to get hired in such companies.","d1ec6cd0":"### Key findings\n#### Many of the CNEs have interest in popular media sources and have various ML and Datascience skills. These cahracteristics and capabilities of CNEs make them stand apart from other few CNEs and brings more opportunities to them. So, it can be observed from the above plots that,\n#### Interests of CNEs are,\n* \u2018Blog media sources\u2019 to learn and explore ML\n* \u2018Coursera\u2019 platform to learn data science and ML content\n\n#### Knowledge and skills of CNEs are,\n* \u2018Word embeddings\u2019 from NLP\n* Frame works like \u2018Keras\u2019 and \u2018Tensorflow\u2019\n* \u2018RNN' and 'CNN' algorithms on regular basis\n* \u2018SQL\u2019 programing language on regular basis","6aeb681a":"### Key findings,\n* There are good opportunities for CNEs in countries like \"India\" and \"USA\" as they have more companies with well established ML methods.\n* The investment on ML is higher in the countries like \"USA\" and \"Japan\" which creates more employment in the field of ML and hence an opportunity for CNEs.","fb89a0a8":"### Education","b9da4483":"#### Highest numbers of CNEs are from \u2018India\u2019 followed by \u2018United States of America\u2019.

Count of CNEs with \u2018<1 year\u2019 of coding experience is highest followed by CNEs with \u20181-2 years\u2019. Hence most of the CNEs have '0-2 years' of coding experience.

Many of these CNEs have the knowledge and the skills equivalent to the knowledge and skills possessed by the employees who are already working in different roles and in different companies. Since the investment in ML in many countries is increasing, more and more companies (both small and big) are adopting ML methods, the opportunity is going to increase for the new ML and data science enthusiasts. Hence, most of these CNEs are not going to hold the status of \u2018Currently Not Employed\u2019 for the longer period of time.  Sooner or later they are going to change their status and hold any role in any organization.
