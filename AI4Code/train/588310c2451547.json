To specify your own ordering explicitly, pass the appropriate argument to the `row_order` and `col_order` parameters.","0cdc1a1b":"So far we've been dealing exclusively with one `col` (column) of data. The \"grid\" in `FacetGrid`, however, refers to the ability to lay data out by row *and* column.\n\nFor example, suppose we're interested in comparing the talent distribution for (goalkeepers and strikers specifically, to keep things succinct) across rival clubs Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and FC Barcelona.\n\nAs the plot below demonstrates, we can achieve this by passing `row=Position` and `col=Club` parameters into the plot.","33acc4c8":"Passing a method into another method like this may take some getting used to, if this is your first time seeing this being done. But once you get used to it, `FacetGrid` is very easy to use.\n\nBy using an object to gather \"design criteria\", `seaborn` does an effective job seamlessly marrying the data *representation* to the data *values*, sparing us the need to lay the plot out ourselves.\n\nWe're probably interested in more than just goalkeepers and strikers, however. But if we squeezed all of the possible game positions into one row, the resulting plots would be tiny. `FacetGrid` comes equipped with a `col_wrap` parameter for dealing with this case exactly.","ad2108c1":"## The FacetGrid\n\nThe core `seaborn` utility for faceting is the `FacetGrid`. A `FacetGrid` is an object which stores some information on how you want to break up your data visualization.\n\nFor example, suppose that we're interested in (as in the previous notebook) comparing strikers and goalkeepers in some way. To do this, we can create a `FacetGrid` with our data, telling it that we want to break the `Position` variable down by `col` (column).\n\nSince we're zeroing in on just two positions in particular, this results in a pair of grids ready for us to \"do\" something with them:","74d78a35":"(Note: the first code cell above contains some data pre-processing.

In this section we'll dive deeper into `seaborn` by exploring **faceting**.\n\nFaceting is the act of breaking data variables up across multiple subplots, and combining those subplots into a single figure. So instead of one bar chart, we might have, say, four, arranged together in a grid.\n\nIn this notebook we'll put this technique in action, and see why it's so useful.","62eb8cbf":"## Why facet?\n\nIn a nutshell, faceting is the easiest way to make your data visualization multivariate.\n\nFaceting is multivariate because after laying out one (categorical) variable in the rows and another (categorical) variable in the columns, we are already at two variables accounted for before regular plotting has even begun.\n\nAnd faceting is easy because transitioning from plotting a `kdeplot` to gridding them out, as here, is very simple. It doesn't require learning any new visualization techniques. The limitations are the same ones that held for the plots you use inside.\n\nFaceting does have some important limitations however. It can only be used to break data out across singular or paired categorical variables with very low numeracy&mdash;any more than five or so dimensions in the grid, and the plots become too small (or involve a lot of scrolling). Additionally it involves choosing (or letting Python) an order to plot in, but with nominal categorical variables that choice is distractingly arbitrary.\n\nNevertheless, faceting is an extremely useful and applicable tool to have in your toolbox.","923f54cd":"## Conclusion\n\nIn this notebook we explored `FacetGrid` and `pairplot`, two `seaborn` facilities for faceting your data, and discussed why faceting is so useful in a broad range of cases.\n\nThis technique is our first dip into multivariate plotting, an idea that we will explore in more depth with two other approaches in the next section.\n\n[Click here to go to the next section, \"Multivariate plotting\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/multivariate-plotting).","1e2f425f":"From there, we use the `map` object method to plot the data into the laid-out grid.","6f4816ed":"## Pairplot\n\nNow that we understand faceting, it's worth taking a quick once-over of the `seaborn` `pairplot` function.\n\n`pairplot` is a very useful and widely used `seaborn` method for faceting *variables* (as opposed to *variable values*). You pass it a `pandas` `DataFrame` in the right shape, and it returns you a gridded result of your variable values:"}}
