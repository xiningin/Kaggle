Such news is now common, as medical centers across the world have focused their precious resources on treating people infected with the coronavirus. But there are some signs of a cautious restart: Pfizer said recently it would resume enrollment in trials where permitted by conditions.\n\nWe broke down drugmakers into three categories, defined by market value. \n\n1. Small biotech indicates companies worth less than 1 billion dollars as of April 6.\n2. Mid-sized biotech refers to those valued between 1 billion dollars and 10 billion dollars\n3. Large biotech or pharma means drugmakers with a market capitalization of 10 billion dollars or more. \n\nFor counting trials by study phase, we only included those trials specifically mentioned by companies.

Therefore, it makes sense to search for a potential BIOMARKER that could rapidly and effectively identify severe cases early. Clinical samples from 28 cases of COVID-19 (8 severe cases, 20 mild cases) in Zunyi District from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were collected and otherwise statistically analysed for biochemical markers. \n\nSerum urea, creatinine (CREA) and cystatin C (CysC) concentrations in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.001), and there were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). \n\nSerum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including urea, CREA, CysC, which reflect glomerular filtration function, may have some significance as potential indicators for the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and to distinguish it from mild COVID-19. Glomerular filtration function injury in severe COVID-19 patients should also be considered by clinicians.","05df42bd":"<h4> 1.

Within 7 days, on 24th March 2020, the Global confirmed case count reached beyond 400k mark.\n3. It took 3 days from March 24th 2020 to March 27th 2020, for global confirmed case count to reach 600k mark.\n4. The same trends were observed of 3 days.

A total of 20.55% cases were recovered out of total confirmed cases as of April 6th 2020. The rapid rise in cases, lead to more testing and more research on COVID-19 Curing which directly affected the ongoing research and clinical trails in Oncology.","672bf56b":"The content for the same is available at - [See here]( https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2020\/03\/28\/822869504\/why-it-takes-so-long-to-get-most-covid-19-test-results)\n\nFirst, a sample is taken from a patient's nose or throat, using a special swab. That swab goes into a tube and is sent to a lab. Some large hospitals have on-site molecular test labs, but most samples are sent to outside laboratories for processing. More on that later.\n\nThat transit time usually runs about 24 hours, but it could be longer, depending on how far the hospital is from the processing laboratory. Once at the lab, the specimen is processed, which means lab workers extract the virus's RNA, the molecule that helps regulate genes. \"That step of cleaning \u2014 the RNA extraction step \u2014 is one limiting factor,\" says Cathie Klapperich, vice chair of the department of biomedical engineering at Boston University. \"Only the very biggest labs have automated ways of extracting RNA from a sample and doing it quickly.\"\n\nAfter the RNA is extracted, technicians also must carefully mix special chemicals with each sample and run those combinations in a machine for analysis, a process called polymerase chain reaction, which can detect whether the sample is positive or negative for COVID.\n\n\"Typically, a PCR test takes six hours from start to finish to complete,\" says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. Some labs have larger staffs and more machines, so they can process more tests at a time than others. But even for those labs, as demand grows, so does the backlog.\n\nCapacity is expanding, but not fast enough Initially, only a few public health labs and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention processed COVID-19 tests. Problems with the first CDC test kits also led to delays. Now the CDC has a better kit, and 94 public health labs across the country do COVID-19 testing, says Wroblewski. But those labs can't possibly do all that's needed. In normal times, their main function is regular public health surveillance \u2014 detecting more common threats such as outbreaks of measles or monitoring seasonal influenza \u2014 \"but not to do diagnostic testing of the magnitude that is required in this response,\" she says.\n\n\"A chief medical officer on the East Coast said that, up until two days ago, on average, it was taking 72 hours to get results,\" says Susan Van Meter, executive director of AdvaMedDx, a division of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a device and diagnostics industry trade group. \"That will get better as our member companies come on the market.\" Even so, supply is not keeping up with demand, Roche CEO Severin Schwan told CNBC on Monday. Roche won the first approval from the FDA for a test kit under emergency rules, and it has delivered more than 400,000 kits so far. \"Demand continues to be much higher than supply,\" Schwan told CNBC. \"So we are glad that overall capacity is increasing, but the reality is that broad-based testing is not yet possible.","9fafaa90":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/graphic\/1\/1028731\/covid19-tests-select-countries-worldwide.jpg\" alt=\"Statistic: Number of coronavirus (COVID-19) tests performed in the most impacted countries worldwide as of May 19, 2020* | Statista\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:1000px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;\"\/>","30941643":"# Let's Wrangle the Web\n\nThe following details are the best to describe and answer the problem statement asked for this question under the UNCOVER COVID-19 Challenge.
