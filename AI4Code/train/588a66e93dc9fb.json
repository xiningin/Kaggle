Ben\u2019s neighbor, Caleb Whiteford, would publish redacted versions of the paper, using puns flowing across the text to create new meaning in the pages.\"\n\n\"The Dadaists, the Beat Poets, and other 20th century movements continued to explore and expand the form, but blackout poetry earned its greatest support from Austin Kleon at The New York Times. In 2010, Austin Kleon published his collection Newspaper Blackout; an instant bestseller, Newspaper Blackout (alongside Kleon\u2019s Tumblr and Instagram presence) put blackout poetry pages in front of every writer\u2019s screen.\"\n\n#\"Great blackout poetry can be short or long, abstract or concrete, linear or lateral. There\u2019s only one rule of the form: have fun making it!\"\n\nWow, so as far as I understood it, blackout poetry is almost making a Kaggle Notebook!\n\nhttps:\/\/writers.com\/what-is-blackout-poetry-examples-and-inspiration","8ef2fe21":"#Es ist nicht gut.
