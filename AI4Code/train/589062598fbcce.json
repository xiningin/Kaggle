I am using this notebook to brush up on my basic pandas and numpy knowledge. Also, I wanted to check matplotlibs visualization capabilities and brush up on it as well. \n\n*P.S. Be safe, be indoors and take care of your families. This will feel like one of those lonely periods where everything around you feels empty. Seek help if required. Also, reach out to vulnerable people in your neighbourhood and try to help as much as you can while trying to keep your families safe. Take care guys!!*","33772882":"**Number of Cases between March 2003 - July 2003**","2468f162":"The outbreak was officially contained on May 2005. Subsequent infection cases were mostly found in lab workers, who worked in heavy quarantine zone. The data above shows that the disease progression and decline phase happened between March - July, 2003. \n\nIf you liked this notebook, leave a like and also comment if you have anything to add. Moreover, you can click fork to copy the notebook and let me know if you guys come up with anything fun!","36fe9810":"**SARS 2003 Outbreak EDA**\n\nThe 2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak involving severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in Foshan, China in November 2002. Over 8,000 people were infected, and at least 774 died worldwide\n\nWe will try to answer few basic questions about SARS virus. \n1. How devastating was the SARS virus over the 5 month period?\n2. Top infected countries\n3. How did the disease progress over the 5 month period displayed in the Dataset\n\nThe SARS dataset is a very basic dataset with 5 variables and 2538 instances"}}
