If our model performs worse than this score we know that something is going *very* wrong!\n\nOf course on kaggle we have the leaderboard to tell us how we are doing compared to other people, but what if you didn't have a leaderboard to go by?\n\nHere we shall create a baseline score by simply taking the mean of the `SalePrice` found in the training data, without doing *any* modelling at all. This value will then serve as our future yardstick.\n\n## Load in the data:"}}
