Also, since I was (and still am) a complete beginner to Python, understanding pandas data structures became more difficult.\n\nWhile furthering into data science, I felt data needs to be very efficiently handled and manipulated using the pandas framework. Since I knew some basics of MySQL, I thought of learning pandas by translating some of the useful and easy commands in MySQL into pandas Series and DataFrames.\n\nThis kernel can be used as an introduction to the pandas framework for someone who has some knowledge of MySQL commands. Also, it can be used as a refresher to some of the basic scripts for pandas in case someone wants to revise.\n\nSince the kernel is very basic and I am a complete beginner too, I am expecting quite a number of errors here. Apologies.\nAlso, there could be several alternatives for the scripts that I have used for the translation.
