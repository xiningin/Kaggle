It imght be difficult to provide that a view at that fine granularity without using an interactive map (zooming in and out or typing in an address). Utlimately, that would be one feature a dashboard will need and therefore the exact LATITUDE and LONGITUDE of a collision will be important.\n\n**__What will affect the choices you or others will need to make?__**  \nThe total number of collision by location will inform how dangerous an interction is, as will a breakdown by the type of person either killed or injured. I also think that an understanding of factors contributing to the collision might inforn law makers and\/or enforment officials of how to improve safety.\n\n**_What changes have you made?_**  \nNone"}}
