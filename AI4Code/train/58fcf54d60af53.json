Students ask questons on the CareerVillage.org platform and Professionals answer them. CareerVillage.org has a pretty good recommendation system inplace that's based on hard-coded rules. They would love to make it more efficient and improve it's performance. That's where you come in :)\n\nSince questions and answers are the main focus of this competition, I thought it would be helpful to join a few tables together to help get things started. This is totally not an exhaustive list of things to do and there's a lot more data to explore so go get wild!\n","51aba0b7":"Ok friends, there's now a table with questions, answers, and the professionals that answered them.
