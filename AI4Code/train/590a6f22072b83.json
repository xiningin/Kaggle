Visualize distribution of `Age` variable with Seaborn `distplot()` function\n\n- Seaborn `distplot()` function flexibly plots a univariate distribution of observations.\n\n- This function combines the

Seaborn `distplot()` function.","c8a1f377":"To switch to seaborn defaults, we need to call the `set()` function as follows -","440e82fb":"We can plot a subset of variables as follows-","09f49a84":"### Seaborn figure styles\n\n\n- There are five preset seaborn themes: `darkgrid`, `whitegrid`, `dark`, `white` and `ticks`. \n\n- They are each suited to different applications and personal preferences. \n\n- The default theme is darkgrid. \n\n- The grid helps the plot serve as a lookup table for quantitative information, and the white-on grey helps to keep the grid from competing with lines that represent data. \n\n- The whitegrid theme is similar, but it is better suited to plots with heavy data elements:\n\n","ec902be4":"We can initialize a 1x2 grid of facets using the fifa19

`lmplot()` look the same but on axes that have a different size and shape. \n\n- This is because `regplot()` is an \u201caxes-level\u201d function draws onto a specific axes. \n\n- This means that you can make multi-panel figures yourself and control exactly where the regression plot goes. \n\n- If no axes object is explicitly provided, it simply uses the \u201ccurrently active\u201d axes, which is why the default plot has the same size and shape as most other matplotlib functions. \n\n- To control the size, we need to create a figure object ourself as follows-","9c136ee8":"We can see that there

kernel density estimate.\n\n- A violin plot plays a similar role as a box and whisker plot. \n\n- It shows the distribution of quantitative data across several levels of one (or more) categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared. \n\n- Unlike a box plot, in which all of the plot components correspond to actual datapoints, the violin plot features a kernel density

between a numerical and one or more categorical variables using one of several visual representations. \n\n- The `kind` parameter selects the underlying axes-level function to use.","83ec49c4":"We can
