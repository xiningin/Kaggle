This is one of my favorite applications of deep learning - this was interesting at first because the output is so visual and then even more after learning the technique.\n\nThe goal is to take two images, one with a distinct \"style\" and another with the desired \"content\" and combine so the style of the first image is transferred to the latter.\nThe way this approach of style transfer works is just like most deep learning approaches - specify a loss function and use a neural network to reduce this loss function. In this case, the loss comprises two major parts, \n1. Style loss - by minimizing this, the neural net learns to get closer to the style. \n2. Content loss - this loss ensures the neural net learns not to lose a lot of content. \n\nUsing the content image as the starting point, the neural network slowly starts to reduce the combination of the above losses to generate some fascinating outputs.\n\nTo define these losses, the intermediate layers of a CNN are used. The first layers of a trained model learn basic patterns like lines and curves and as we go deeper, the layers learn more complex patterns like squares and then even more like faces etc. Hence the output of these layers are used to calculate the loss functions. More information about all of this can be found in the resources below.\n\nMost of the code is from [this notebook](https:\/\/nbviewer.jupyter.org\/github\/fchollet\/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks\/blob\/master\/8.3-neural-style-transfer.ipynb).
