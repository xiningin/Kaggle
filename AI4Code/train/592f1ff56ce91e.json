It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (**MaxPool2D**) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. **It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value.** These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important. \n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\nDropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting. \n\n'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network. So numbers less than 0 will be set to 0 (removes negatives)\n\nThe Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional\/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end i used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier. In the last layer(Dense(10,activation=\"softmax\")) the net outputs distribution of probability of each class.","79191d09":"In order to make the optimizer converge faster and closest to the global minimum of the loss function, i used an annealing method of the learning rate (LR).\n\nThe LR is the step by which the optimizer walks through the 'loss landscape'. The higher LR, the bigger are the steps and the quicker is the convergence. However the sampling is very poor with an high LR and the optimizer could probably fall into a local minima.\n\nIts better to have a decreasing learning rate during the training to reach efficiently the global minimum of the loss function. \n\nTo keep the advantage of the fast computation time with a high LR, i decreased the LR dynamically every X steps (epochs) depending if it is necessary (when accuracy is not improved).\n\nEpochs vs LR\n* The learning rate controls how quickly the model is adapted to the problem. Smaller learning rates require more training epochs given the smaller changes made to the weights each update, whereas larger learning rates result in rapid changes and require fewer training epochs.\n* A learning rate that is too large can cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, whereas a learning rate that is too small can cause the process to get stuck.\n\nWhat is Epochs?\n* 1 Epoch = 1 Forward pass + 1 Backward pass for ALL training samples.\n* Batch Size = Number of training samples in 1 Forward\/1 Backward pass. (With increase in Batch size, required memory space increases.)\n* Number of iterations = Number of passes i.e. 1 Pass = 1 Forward pass + 1 Backward pass (Forward pass and Backward pass are not counted differently.)\n* Example : If we have 1000 training samples and Batch size is set to 500, it will take 2 iterations to complete 1 Epoch.\n\nWith the ReduceLROnPlateau function from Keras.callbacks, i choose to reduce the LR by half if the accuracy is not improved after 3 epochs.","c11e1ab6":"From the results, np.argmax will save the number with the highest probability(out of 10).

It is the error rate between the oberved labels and the predicted ones. We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the \"categorical_crossentropy\".\n\nThe most important function is the optimizer. This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss. \n\nI choosed RMSprop (with default values), it is a very effective optimizer. The RMSProp update adjusts the Adagrad method in a very simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.\nWe could also have used Stochastic Gradient Descent ('sgd') optimizer, but it is slower than RMSprop.\n\nThe metric function \"accuracy\" is used is to evaluate the performance our model.\nThis metric function is similar to the loss function, except that the results from the metric evaluation are not used when training the model (only for evaluation).","6a5b49cb":"In order to avoid overfitting problem, we need to expand artificially our handwritten digit dataset.

Some popular augmentations people use are grayscales, horizontal flips, vertical flips, random crops, color jitters, translations, rotations, and much more. \n\nBy applying just a couple of these transformations to our training data, we can easily double or triple the number of training examples and create a very robust model.\n\nThe improvement is important : \n   - Without data augmentation: 98.114% accuracy\n   - With data augmentation: 99.67% accuracy","c3c56bfe":"For the data augmentation, i choosed to :\n   - Randomly rotate some training images by 10 degrees\n   - Randomly  Zoom by 10% some training images\n   - Randomly shift images horizontally by 10% of the width\n   - Randomly shift images vertically by 10% of the height\n   \nI did not apply a vertical_flip nor horizontal_flip since it could have lead to misclassify symetrical numbers such as 6 and 9.\n\nOnce our model is ready, we fit the training dataset .\n\nWe can configure the batch size and prepare the data generator and get batches of images by calling the flow() function.\n* X_batch, y_batch = datagen.flow(train, train, batch_size=32)\n\nFinally we can make use of the data generator.
