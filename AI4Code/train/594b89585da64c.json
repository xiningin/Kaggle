Besides, rich states like S\u00e3o Paulo,  Rio de Janeiro, and Distrito Federal have an impressive health infrastructure composed of private and public services. Though, those states face problems related to high demographic density. However, poor states like Roraima, Acre, Piau\u00ed and other states from north and northeast regions suffer from extreme poverty, poor sanitation, and medical assistance.\n\n## The problem\nGiven the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil, like other countries around the world, is facing one of the hardest events of the century. The imminent risk of the healthcare system collapse mobilized the government, the companies, and the population towards prevention and mitigation strategies. Those strategies include quarantines, infected people's aid and, macro-economic actions that try to prevent the slow down of the economy.\n\n### Based on these circumstances, what is the current situation of each Brazilian state? How do they compare to each other, considering the infection spread rate, the number of confirmed cases, the number of deaths and, other demographic features of each state?\n\n## Acknowledgments\n* [Brazilian Health Ministry](https:\/\/www.saude.gov.br\/) is doing strong efforts trying to provide relevant information both on their official website and press releases;\n* [Raphael Fontes](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/unanimad\/corona-virus-brazil) did an impressive work gathering, processing, publishing and daily updating a dataset containing the official COVID-19 data in Brazil.\n\n* This work could not be possible without the combined efforts of many people.\n\n---\n\n# Data <a id='data'><\/a>\n## Import, load and process data\n* The main dataset used in this work was downloaded from the [Coronavirus - Brasil dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/unanimad\/corona-virus-brazil), with daily reports published by the Brazilian Health Ministry and assembled by [Raphael Fontes](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/unanimad);\n* The [Brazilian Dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/thiagobodruk\/brazilianstates) was used to enhance the information related to the Brazilian states, like population size, GDP, geo locations and other demographic data;\n* Additionally, I created a dataset containing the number of ICU beds on each state;\n* Finally, I downloaded a [datasets containing the airport traffic](https:\/\/pt.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lista_de_aeroportos_do_Brasil) by state.","9fc783e4":"## Features correlation\nBased on the data exploration, we can notice a stronger correlation with the number of cases and the following features:\n* Deaths count\n* Sub-notifications count\n* Population size\n* Airports traffic\n* ICU beds count","137ee0eb":"The Brazilian northeast region has the highest mortality rate with an average of 5.3%. Besides, 5 out of 9 states have mortality over 8%. Due to both economic and infrastructure issues, the region suffers from a poor healthcare service, when compared to southeast and south regions.","81f61f01":"As seen, most Brazilian states with a mortality rate of over 3.4% have a number of public ICU beds close, or under, one bed per 10K citizens. The following plots show the evolution of the infection over the last weeks.","318ed978":"## K-means Clustering\nFinally, a K-means Clustering model was created with 5 clusters, creating two levels over the average and two levels above the average. Then, the model was fit with the selected features and the clusters predicted.

This new subset will be used to store the normalized and binned data.","1e53a7ac":"---\n\n# Analysis <a id='analysis'><\/a>\n## What is the current status?\nBefore we start, let's create another dataset first, grouping the data by state, ordering by the number of cases and setting the state's abbreviation as the index.","22d1bff7":"---\n\n# Conclusion <a id='conclusion'><\/a>\nAt the present date, Brazil reached almost 20K cases and over 1K deaths. As seen in this report, the Brazilian pandemic has multiple foci, distributed all over the country. States like S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Cear\u00e1, have the biggest number of cases doubling the number of cases every 4 days. Due to the lack of available tests, Brazilian public healthcare services are testing just a small group of people, especially the most severe cases. This poor monitoring leads to a higher number of sub-notified cases and, probably, a surge in the number of confirmed cases in the next days.\n\nThe population size and the traffic of passengers seem to have an important influence on the infection spread. The number of ICU beds and proper healthcare infrastructure also show relevance to the mortality rate. Big states like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are suffering from the rapid spread of the infection due to the high demographic density. Despite their big healthcare infrastructure, those states can't handle the pandemic surge rapidly. In another hand, poor states, mostly northern and northeastern states, don't have proper healthcare infrastructure, considering the low number of ICU beds per citizen. This handicap leads to a very low rate of infection tests and monitoring, culminating into a very high mortality rate, due to the high number of sub-notified cases. Some states, like Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina and Distrito Federal, present an intermediate scenario, due to a high GDP rate, high number of ICU beds per citizen and, lower demographic density. Those states deal with a lower number of cases and a good monitoring of the infection spread, resulting on a mortality rate under, or very close to the global average.\n\nDespite the recent regional quarantines and the mitigation efforts, Brazil will face its critical moment in the next few weeks, between April 15th and May 15th. Currently, the social media and the traditional press have a very important role in reinforcing the importance of social distancing and other prevention efforts to avoid the healthcare system collapse. Although, a crescent number of people, including the Brazilian president himself defend what they call the \"vertical quarantine\", instead of the traditional horizontal quarantine. Based on this strategy, just the risk group should be isolated and the healthy citizens should circulate normally. As seem in this report, the higher the demographic density, the higher the infection rate, leading to a rapid increase in the number of cases. Despite the fact that 80% of the infected people will have mild or no symptoms, 15% of the share will need intensive healthcare.\n\nFinally, based on this analysis, the social isolation and the public efforts to prevent the rapid infection spread seem very appropriate. Mainly in high-density areas and regions with poor healthcare services.\n\n---\n\n## Disclaimer\nDue to the complex nature of a pandemic, this work does not intend to be an accurate projection or a model that tries to reproduce the complexity of reality. The main goal of this project is to propose a reflection of the importance of social distancing, quarantine and other infection prevention efforts, to minimize the pandemic effects and try to flat the infection curve.\n\n### Thank you!

For practical purposes, the data was sliced considering the day when the number of cases reached 100.","aed4fc24":"As seen above, SP has the biggest amount of cases, followed by RJ, CE, AM, MG, and PR. We can also notice a strong correlation between both population size and the number of cases, and demographic density and the number of cases.
