On using the ideas from these two approaches I could get an accuracy of 82.3% on the public leaderboard. A feature called GroupID was created taking into account the Ticket, Fare, PClass and Embarked features to segregate people into groups (this idea can be found in the comments of the previously mentioned kernel). Also, I liked the way Jack Roberts implemented the idea neatly in Python. So I tried to replicate his style in a few areas =D.\n\nGo through this kernel if you want see how an accuracy of 82.3% can be acheived.\n\nI would like to improve upon this model.
