Meaning chocolate bars with low cocoa percentage(less than 50%) and high cocoa percentage(above 90%) are less in number, but the most important fact is that most of these chocolate bars have a rating of less than 3. \n\n> *People prefer chocolate bars with not so much or not so little cocoa percentages. Usually around 70-75% cocoa composition*\n","247e9b8f":"We notice that the lowest ever rating was around 3 and it came in 2008. From 2008 to 2011, there was a steady increase in average ratings and in 2011 it was at 3.26. There has been several fluctuations in the ratings between 2011 & 2017 and in 2017, the rating lies at its highest at around 3.31.","9c9d0b15":"# Conclusion\nThere is a direct correlation between the percentage of cocoa in a chocolate bar and the average rating of that bar. We also found that the U.S.A had the highest amount of Chocolate producing companies, this is presumed to be due to the high volume of demand for chocolate in the country. ","bf6085bc":"With about 764 chocolate bar produced, the graph shows that the U.S.A has more chocolate companies than any other country. Closely followed by France and Canada.","ebc61808":"Close to 700 chocolate bars had a cocoa composition of 70%, while less than 100 bars had 60% or less cocoa. ","7f5add6f":"2008 had the highest number if cocoa percentages in chocolate bars at about 73% and it was followed by a steep reduction the very next year with the lowest percentage of cocoa in 2009 at a 69% cocoa composition. Between 2009 to 2013 the cocoa composition of chocolate bars rose to about 72.2% from 69%. From 2014, a steady decline in cocoa percentage in chocolate bars have been noticed and in 2017, it stands at just above 71.5%.\n\nSo how has this fluctuation in Cocoa percentage composition affected chocolate bar ratings?","d9803525":"We see that the company that produced most chocolate bars is Soma while **most of the cocoa beans are from Venezuela**. We also see that the **average chocolate bar contains 71% cocoa** while **consumers give an average rating of 3.1 to chocolate bars**.\n","84c0f8b6":"# **Who Produces the best choclates?**","3a19cd5d":"We see that Domori, C-Amaro, Artisan du Chocolat, Sirene and Claudio Corallo are the top 5 companies with a 100% cocoa in their chocolate bars. ","4fa0e5c0":"# So is there a relationship between the percentage of Cocoa in a chocolate bar and its rating?\n\nThe highest percentage of cocoa in choclolate bars came in 2008 and this was the year with the lowest ratings.\nWe also notice two coreelations between 2008 and 2009:\n1. There was a drastic reduction in the average percentage of cocoa in chocolate bars.\n2. The average rating had a very steep increase to 3.08 in 2009 from 3.00 in 2008.\n\nIs this an indication that the rate of a chocolate bar is proportional to the percentage of cocoa in it. It also looks like the percentage of cocoa that is considered a \"tipping point\" is 80% (I have a personal Experience on this).","2dacc371":"The company, Soma has the largest number of chocolate bars that have a rating above 3.0\n","6e310f3d":"# Which country produces chocolates the most?","0bb5fb2f":"Out of a total 1795 chocolate bars that were rated from 63 countries. Most of the ratings given are between 3.0 and 3.5 with a rating of 3.5 given by about 380 consumers.\n\n> *Most consumers considered the chocolate bars to be somewhere between Satisfactory(3.0) & Praiseworthy(3.75)*\n"}}
