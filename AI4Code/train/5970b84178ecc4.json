TL;DR - See the plot at the bottom of this kernel.\n\n[Nonce](https:\/\/en.bitcoinwiki.org\/wiki\/Nonce) is a parameter in a bitcoin's block where a miner adjusts it to find a block hash whose number of leading zero is more than the one agreed by bitcoin protocol (called \"difficulty\". The more leading zeros means more difficult to find such a hash). Strictly speaking it doesn't have to be uniformly distributed since a miner can choose it at will; however, any bias (such as incremental search from zero) might conflict with competing miners' search, ending up with a less success rate to win the mining race. In other words, an interest here is why we see a pattern implying many miners have the same bias in common at the risk of lowering the success rate - or a simple bug in commonly used ASICs? What do you think?\n\nThe pattern was originally found by [this tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/100trillionUSD\/status\/1081217034485149697).\nPatterns are explored in other blockchains as well:\n\n* [BCH](https:\/\/twitter.com\/goldenmiffy\/status\/1081522233040723968)\n* [XMR](https:\/\/twitter.com\/khannib\/status\/1082280569449447424)\n* [ETH](https:\/\/twitter.com\/StopAndDecrypt\/status\/1082291450619088897), notice the slope lines at the bottom around 3,000,000.\n* [MONA](https:\/\/twitter.com\/visvirial\/status\/1082825684572024832)\n\nThe discussions on why spread in different tweets or [reddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/adddja\/the_weird_nonce_pattern\/). The focus is more around  the pattern of four blank bands on the right hand side; it looks as if miners skipped certain nonce ranges.\n\nIn this reproduce case, because the dataset available doesn't seem to have block height which the original tweet used, I used block timestamp here instead. The result looks the same."}}
