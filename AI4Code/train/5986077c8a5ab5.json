Despite some improvements, such as the fall of the percentage of households poverty situations between 2015 and 2016, last year 31.5 percent of Costa Rican households suffered from some kind of poverty - monetary, multidimensional, and other types. Also, 'The State of the Nation Report 2017' states that Costa Rica has failed to name some of the structural problems underlying poverty. These facts lead to a necessary action from Costa Rican authorities to fight these structural problems. And, to do so, some institutions like The Inter-American Development Bank are asking skilled people to help them deal with such issue.\n","74c2b928":"# Data treatment","a2ae3018":"Based on the introduction for each feature we found out that we can assing 'yes' to be 1 and 'no' to be 0.","296c2f3c":"# Recursive Feature elemination\nWe defined the function rfecv_opt wich was responsible for doing a recursive feature elemination with F1 Macro as the metrics for calculating the score.","c95306e8":"# Testing our model on trainset\nWe divides our trainset into train and test to check the accuracy of our model on our trainset.","cb5b91b4":"This means that the number of members of the household wich are youger than 19 and older than 65 is given by:","c1e20f7f":"# Training our model to make predictions","c18be3e1":"# Treating testset\nThe treatment for the testset is similar to what we have done for the trainset.","72cf857d":"### Treating 'dependency'","22f34bc5":"### Treating rez_esc","6734d760":"#### Defining a function to treat 'dependency'","253ef983":"### Checking wich data types we have in our dataset","31488e23":"### Next, we have built some functions in order to simplify our dataset:\n1.

We also treated the 'dependecy' column by recalculating all values; \n3. Next we treated the columns 'edjefe' and 'edjefa' wich had some \"no\" and \"yes\" answers;\n4.
