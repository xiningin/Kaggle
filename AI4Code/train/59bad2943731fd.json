During fall and winter waterbodies are refilled, but during spring and summer they start to drain. To help preserve the health of these waterbodies it is important to predict the most efficient water availability, in terms of level and water flow for each day of the year.\n\nThis data contains total four different types of water bodies `water_spring`, `lake`, `river`, and `aquifer`.
