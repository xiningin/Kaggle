The best proof of this situation is the historical temperature change (It is shown in left figure[\u2074](https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/comparative-media-studies-writing\/cms-631-data-storytelling-studio-climate-change-spring-2017\/#)).  Our project investigates the reality of the increase in temperatures linked to industrial activities and the greenhouse effect. And before this investigation, the aim of this part enlight the significant sides of the temperature change data for each area. Before beginning the analysis, firstly, I want to figure out our problem, its cause and its effects in a short way. \n \n #### What is Climate Change?\n \n\"_Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth\u2019s local, regional and global climates. Changes observed in Earth\u2019s climate since the early 20th century are primarily driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, raising Earth\u2019s average surface temperature. These human-produced temperature increases are commonly referred to as global warming._[\u2075](https:\/\/climate.nasa.gov\/resources\/global-warming-vs-climate-change\/)\"\n \n ##### Causes\nAccording to NASA, Water Vapour, Carbon dioxide(CO\u2082), Methane, Nitrous oxide, Chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs) contribute to the greenhouse effect. Over the last century, human activities have increased concentrations of this natural greenhouse.\n \n ##### Effects:\n\n\"_Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted, and trees are flowering sooner. Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change: loss of sea ice accelerated sea-level rise and longer, more intense heat waves._[\u2076](https:\/\/climate.nasa.gov\/effects\/)\"\n","d0a5bd5f":"#### 1. What are the ten most countries that suffer from temperature change mostly in the last ten years?\n\n* Why? <br>\nIt has already known that Global warming has sped up during the last ten years[\u2077](https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/in-just-10-years-warming-has-increased-the-odds-of-disasters\/). And, I wanted to figure out which countries have been affected by this situation most.\n\n* Code explanation: <br>\nI wanted to show countries' names, and their average temperature change values belong to the last decade. So, I chose the last ten years as yearly and grouped these values according to countries. After these ordered descendingly and I limited the output to ten values.\n\n* Results: <br>\nBecause the country names also cover the areas' names, the top ten list shows Europe and some European countries. It also has been illustrated that Europe is affected mostly by climate change with its neighbour Russian Federation. And not surprisingly, all countries on the list are industrialized countries, excluding 'Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands.' This area is top of the list, and near Europe and Russia, also it is the arctic area, its natural life is in danger because of this reason[\u2078](https:\/\/www.deepdyve.com\/lp\/wiley\/climate-change-impacts-on-wildlife-in-a-high-arctic-archipelago-zKjAbf0Y5t)","641b8ca9":"### Investigation of Guiding Questions","a12b6dac":"<a id = \"3\"><\/a><br>\n\n### Data Wrangling\n\nIn this project, the other project data sets have country codes(ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization[\u2071](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) ). Because of that, I added this from another CSV[\u00b3](http:\/\/www.fao.org\/faostat\/en\/#definitions) that is provided by FAOSTAT(the source of main data set). So, I added this ISO-3 codes in my data set as 'Country Code'. Additionally, I encountered a few minor text formatting issues with 'Months' and 'year'. Only a small amount of cleaning and wrangling was required to obtain my visualizations. My cleaning and wrangling activities included:\n\n1. Data columns and some rows rename:<br>\n   I changed the 'Area' columns to 'country names' because it will be key in merging the other project data sets. I changed seasons names in the months' category as:'Dec\\x96Jan\\x96Feb' \u2192 'Winter', 'Mar\\x96Apr\\x96May' \u2192 'Spring', 'Jun\\x96Jul\\x96Aug' \u2192 'Summer','Sep\\x96Oct\\x96Nov'\u2192'Fall'. Because year was written like 'Y1961', I splitted 'Y' and using the other part of 'year'.\n\n1. Deleting of columns and some rows:<br>\n   The 'Area Code', 'Months','Elemet Code' columns are a unique identifier of each row which does not provide any statistical information. And, each of the 'Unit' column show 'Celsius degrees \u00b0C' so I do not need this information as a column. Also, in this analysis I do not use 'Standart Deviation', so after filtering all  'Temperature change'rows, the 'Element' column also deleted. \n   \n1. Manipulating data frame:<br>\n   As I mentioned above to make standart all data sets in the project, I added ISO-3 Country Code in my data. I merged 'Country Code' with my data set. Visualization and making analysis easier, I organized the data frames. I gathered all years' columns in the 'year' column. \n   ","c5f47998":"#### 3. Is there any remarkable trend between the years according to World, annex I countries and non-annex I countries? If there is, can we split these as periods?\n\n* Why? <br>\nIn this question, I wanted to find industrialization effects with temperature change during the years. \nWhile 'Annex I countries' means that industrialized countries, 'Non-Annex I countries' show mostly developing countries vulnerable to climate change's adverse impacts.[\u2079](https:\/\/unfccc.int\/parties-observers#:~:text=Annex%20I%20Parties%20include%20the,Central%20and%20Eastern%20European%20States.) Because of that, I used the temperature change data of 'Annex I countries,' 'Non-Annex I countries'  and 'World'  for comparison yearly.\n\n* Code explanation: <br>\nI made three different tables, including temperature change values yearly. Before converted as one table, I labelled each temperature change value with a related category ('World,' 'Annex I countries,' 'Non-Annex I countries'). I merged the first two tables; then, I merged the last table with this new one.\n\n* Results: <br>\nWhile I examined the graph and compared results, it is clearly seen while 'Annex I countries' has a relatively smooth line, 'Non-Annex I countries' has a more fluctuated line, and also, they have lots of peak points. So, it shows global warming has been speeding up for industrialized countries. On the other hand, as expected, World values have been between the other two categories. Finally, roughly, We can split up into ten-year periods according to 'Annex I countries' values because nearly every decade has a higher peak value than previous decades.  \n\n","d7dc9de6":"#### 5.  What is the trend of temperature change in the world?\n* Why?<br>\nI wanted to investigate how many historical records had in this decade to learn if global warming more rapid last decade.\n\n* Code explanation:<br>\nI selected 'World' records from 'Country Name' column. Then, I chose only monthly basis temperature change values and whole world records. \n\n* Results: <br>\nResult shows that already eight of the ten years in the current decade (2010\u20132019) were among the ten hottest years on record in terms of  mean annual temperatures. Additionally, Radar chart clearly shows how temperature change increased day by day.\n","93ed9e5d":"#### 2.What are the ten countries that suffer from temperature change at the very least in the last ten years?\n\n* Why? <br>\nI wanted to discover the bottom countries with the lowest temperature change in the last decade as the reverse version of the above question.\n\n* Code explanation: <br>\nI wanted to show countries' names, and their average temperature change values belong to the last decade. So, I chose the last ten years as yearly and grouped these values according to countries. After these ordered ascendingly and I limited the output to ten values. Because the missing values affect the average, I did not choose null ones.\n\n* Results: <br>\nI think the surprising country on the list is India. Even if India is a developing country,  it also has lots of industrial activities. This list shows that these activities do not have much effect on Temperature rising. And as I expected, there is no developed country on the list.\n","5c943935":"#### 4. Is there any significant difference between seasons?\n\n* Why? <br>\nLike the above question, this one aims to examine the seasonal effects of climate change besides the yearly trend. \n\n* Code explanation: <br>\nI made four different tables for each season, including temperature change values. Before converted as one table, I labelled each temperature change value with a related category ('Winter,' 'Spring', 'Summer','Fall'). I merged the first two tables and last two tables; then, I merged these tables.\n\n* Results: <br>\nWhile I examined the graph and compared results, it is clearly seen while Summer has a relatively smooth line, Winter has a more fluctuated line, and also, they have lots of peak points. So, it illustrates that global warming effects are seen mostly in the winter season. While spring also has similar fluctuation to winter, fall has a similar trend to summer. Additionally, It is also seen that the world had the hottest winter in 2016.[\u00b9\u2070](https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/press-release\/nasa-noaa-data-show-2016-warmest-year-on-record-globally\/)\n","cd1a87ac":"<a id = \"4\"><\/a><br>\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this section of the project, I examined how global surface temperature change between 1961 and 2019. According to my guiding question answers, when examining the top ten areas that have the highest temperature change in the last decade are mostly industrialized countries. Additionally, I found that temperature increased every ten decades, and the last decade can count as the hottest decade. From our above analysis result, I came up winter season getting more hotter.  Finally,  I tried to show how temperature is increasing worldwide as a proof of global warming. In the next section with these and the other outputs, we will analyze deeper climate change effects. As a visualization of these results, I added an animation map; this shows how climate change gets serious year by year. For the map, I added one more column in a different data frame; this column categorized each temperature change with half-point intervals. And, I used warmer colours for zero and above, colder colour zero and below.

The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain includes some extra information in this data set like Area names. Because in this project our key value is country names, I chose to use FAO's data set. <br>\n\nData in the Temperature Change domain can be reachable from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' [web data portal\u00b2](http:\/\/www.fao.org\/faostat\/en\/#data\/ET). According to [the license of FAO Statistical Database Terms of Use](http:\/\/www.fao.org\/contact-us\/terms\/db-terms-of-use\/en\/), the data set can be used for research, statistical, and scientific purposes. It can be access, download, create copies and re-disseminated datasets subject to these Dataset Terms.<br>\n\n_The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain disseminates statistics of mean surface temperature change by country, with annual updates. The current dissemination covers the period 1961\u20132019. Statistics are available for monthly, seasonal and annual mean temperature anomalies, i.e., temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951\u20131980. The standard deviation of the temperature change of the baseline methodology is also available._[\u00b2](http:\/\/www.fao.org\/faostat\/en\/#data\/ET\/metadata) It includes areas of all the countries and territories of the world. (In 2019: 190 countries and 37 other territorial entities) The data covers monthly, seasonal, yearly temperature changes as Celsius degrees \u00b0C between 1961 and 2019. The frequency of dissemination and Release calendar of the data is the yearly base. The format is a comma-separated value (CSV) file, has the tabular format and 6.3 megabytes. It includes 9656 rows and 66 columns.<br> \nWhile the first seven columns include information about temperature changes, the other columns show temperature change numbers between 1961 and 2019. And, all years have some missing values.

In this stage, my goal investigates missing values and answer my guiding questions. Before searching answer the guiding questions, I looked at the null values, and I know from the above information that only the temperature change column has some null values. As I expected, the old years have higher null values than new ones. In the first query, I looked at all missing values numbers for each year, and I found while 1961 has 719 missing values, 2019 has 385 missing values. Roughly, this decreasing trend is the same for other categories (in the yearly base, seasonal and monthly).","ac671cbe":"<a id = \"1\"><\/a><br>\n## Guiding Questions\nIn the first step, I determined what I curious about climate change in light of the above-mentioned information, and I wrote these down:\n\n1. What are the ten most countries that suffer from temperature change mostly in the last ten years?\n2. What are the ten countries that suffer from temperature change at the very least in the last ten years?\n3. Is there any remarkable trend between the years according to World, annex I countries and non-annex I countries? If there is, can we split these as periods?\n4. Is there any significant difference between seasons? \n5. What is the trend of temperature change in the world?\n\nI will use python libraries within the Jupyter notebook environment for Investigation these questions.
