after graduation](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/empsit.t12.htm) is a rough but common occurrence for most students, with six months of unemployment being a commonly-cited graduation gift for most new undergrads. Having unfortunately struggled with the issue for the past few months, when I saw that Kaggle had conducted their 2nd annual survey for data scientists and students around the globe, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to answer some nagging questions that I think plague all students:\n\n**What do I need to do to stand out from other students? And what skills do I lack that professionals have?**\n\nSo, fellow Kagglers, let's see if we can use the magic of data analytics to get some answers!","922fd821":"One other striking thing about the professional population is that while the majority are young, there also exists no representation of anyone who is within the 22-24 age range like what we saw with the student population. This can be a lot of confounding reasons for why this is the case (it could simply just be that there wasn't any 22-24 year olds who responded to the survey) but one can infer that, unless you recently graduated with a master's degree, that most data professionals did not obtain their position as their first job immediately out of college. This might be due to how new the field is, but it's certainly an oddity that could use a bit more exploration.","1d6e5b83":"At a glance, one of the key things that is evident is that while China and India contain a large number of students, the United States has the highest number of working professionals out of any given country. Russia also contains a significantly larger number of working professionals compared to their student population, while India and China have a relatively proportional amount of working professionals to students. We can intuit that this might be due to the United States and Russia having a strong, developed workforce while China and India are rapidly expanding their workforce with the incoming generation but it's hard to tell without digging into some economic data\/job listings within each country.","77ee60fe":"We'll revisit a bunch of these countries later when we start comparing the ratios of students to professionals in each country. For now, though, let's dig a bit deeper into what these students tend to be studying.","6b0e736e":"The age of students is also what you might expect given the prior information, with the bulk of the student body being between the ages of 18-24 (pursuing a bachelor's or freshly graduated and possibly pursuing a master's).","97796e2a":"<a name=\"demo\"> <\/a> \n# Demographics: Students, Professionals, and their Origins\nIn order to begin answering what skillgaps might exist between students and professionals, it is of upmost importance to first define what is an average student and professional. \n\n<a name=\"stud\"> <\/a> \n## Who is the Average Student?\nFirstly, one important thing to note with the data is that there existed several cases where respondants might identify as a student as their title or \"the industry of their employer\" but not both. While we can possibly intuit these individuals as someone who is pursuing a degree while working (as in the case with many graduate students), these cases were removed from the set as we cannot infer the true reason why they had this discrepancy.\n\nNow, perhaps one of the more interesting bits of insight is that while the United States beats out India in total number of respondants to the survey, there are significantly more Indian respondants (1058) who identify as students than the United States (597). This is followed closely by China in 3rd (502) while the rest of the countries have no real statistically significant difference in number of students from each other (all were 99 or less).","8bbd44f4":"<a name=\"prof\"> <\/a> \n## Who is the Average Professional?\n","3e845e7f":"<a name=\"prep\"> <\/a> \n# Preparations\n\n## Layout of Data\nThe data consisted of three distinct components:\n1. Free responses, recorded as strings\n2. Multiple Choice responses with preset options\n3. A schema that showcases how many people answered any particular question as participants might only receive specific questions\n\n\n## Initial Data Prep\nNotably, the **multiple choice responses** included both a row that had described the columns as \"Q1, Q2, etc.\" while also included the actual text questions underneath. The latter row was therefore dropped from the dataset and simply used as reference material while performing the analysis.\n","b7bc444d":"<a name=\"conclusion\"> <\/a>\n# Conclusion\n\nHaving gone through the data, it's nice to see that while there are clear gaps between professionals and students, that the gap is not so insurmountable as to be out of the reach of an ambitious student. Reflecting upon my own experience going through the coursework in school, however, I am definitely noticing clear deficiencies that my Computer Science background provided when it comes to approaching Data Science (SQL being largely relegated to one, optional database class) and I'd like to open the debate to everyone about the nature of education and the requirements of obtaining a position within Data Science.\n\nDo you believe that this deficiency is just simply due to academic institutions simply not quite catching up to the sudden increase in demand and can modify existing programs to include a track for it? Or do you believe that it requires a separate degree program entirely that more effectively hybridizes the nature of statistics and computer science? Is this slight dip in proficiency with certain technologies even an issue or is it just something than an enthusiast will be able to pick up on their own anyway, no need to fuss?\n\nI'm keenly interested in what you all have to say about the subject. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go brush up on SQL and AWS so that I can finally get employed :'D","6c975081":"In terms of what was studied, there also isn't much difference between the student and professional population but there is also a pretty drastic shift in education level as the bulk of working professionals have a master's degree while a significant number have progressed further to obtaining a doctorate. Anecdotally, this makes sense as the bulk of Data Scientist and even Data Analyst positions state a master's degree or higher as a requirement, which is feasible given the number of those who have gone on to graduate school.\n\nAll hope is not lost for new graduates, though, as there's still a sizable number of professionals with bachelor's degrees. However, before we isolate that subcategory, let's take a look at the relative age and degree distribution of professionals.","0c2c354a":"Another noticable difference in a mostly similar skillset is that young professionals overwhelmingly have much greater SQL proficiency than do students whereas students have a much higher usage of traditional software engineering languages like C\/C++ and MATLAB. This can be probably be chalked up to the fact that the vast majority of these students are Computer Science students who are being taught more the skills to be a software engineer than a data analyst during their classtime.\n\nThis also brings up the question of whether Data Science should be brought up as a separate degree track from Computer Science or as a specialized elective track given that SQL is so essential for basic data analyst functions but is oftentimes haphazardly thrown into many Computer Science programs if at all. Due to the hybrid nature of Data Science, I highly doubt that it'll ever fully tear itself away from its Computer Science core but it does make me question the efficacy of the program at getting fresh graduates into data analyst positions purely through their coursework. ","428addeb":"One important bit of insight from simply comparing the primary tools between students and young professionals is that the latter have a much higher usage (proportionally speaking) of cloud-based data software like AWS, which is one of the more highly sought after tool proficiencies that companies tend to look for beyond the basic Python\/SQL proficiency. \n\nFurthermore, while not a large jump in terms of usage, there does appear to be proportionally more young professionals who incorporate business intelligence software like Tableau which is another occassionally sought after tool proficiency for data analyst positions.","74595104":"As before, there is a significant concentration of professionals in STEM but the concentration of those with Master's degrees is much higher than with the student population. What is notable is that certain degree types such as doctorates in Physics have much higher representation than their student counterparts which can indicate a whole slew of possible effects (Are students not interested in obtaining doctorates in physics? Or are doctorates simply involved in data analytics by virtue of having to interact with so much of it as part of their job?)","61d396cb":"What is interesting, however, is that outside of Computer Science, the bulk of the students who are interested in Data Science are those who are pursuing graduate school. Specifically master's degrees. This makes sense on an intuitive level as undergraduate classes in fields like the Humanities and Social Sciences don't have students performing their own independent studies but it also showcases a kind of almost even split between undergraduate and graduate level interest in Data Science. \n\nThis poses an interesting problem with recruitment that we've kinda seen played out in the current environment where there's an almost equal number of undergraduate, primarily Computer Science, students as there are graduate students who are seeking similar positions but at different paygrades and skill-level expectations. This might be a partial explanation behind the current confusion between the various titles thrown about in the industry (Data Analyst vs Data Scientist vs Data Engineer) as companies struggle to not only fundamentally understand how big data can assist their business decisions but to also appropriately staff their nascent data departments with the appropriate stratification of lower-skilled individuals performing more menial analytics\/data wrangling and higher-level management.","ae7c9890":"As expected, the bulk of students studied Computer Science while over half of the total number of students were involved in some form of STEM related field. This isn't too surprising given the technical nature of Data Science, although it does make me a little saddened that the social sciences and humanities have not yet caught on to the power of harnessing large, public databases among more of their student body.","217e5da7":"<a name=\"yprof\"> <\/a> \n# What Separates Students from Young Professionals?\n\nGiven the above demographics, let's try to zero in on specifically young professionals who have recently acquired their job to see if we can spot some key differences between them and the student population. If we can do so, we can maybe identify specific keystones that a student needs to reach to transition successfully into the workforce.\n\nAs part of this, I'll define a \"young professional\" as someone who is between the ages of 25-29 (as we previously determined that 22-24 is not represented at all) and has only a bachelor's degree to see if it's possible in the current market for a freshly graduated bachelor's student to break into the market without requiring additional schooling\/loans.","dddd5caa":"# Transitioning from Academia to Industry - Identifying the Skillgaps between Professionals and Students\n\n***2018-11-29***\n\n* 1 <a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n* 2 <a href=\"#prep\"> Preparations<\/a>\n* 3  <a href=\"#demo\">Demographics: Students, Professionals, and their Origins<\/a>\n * 3.1  <a href=\"#stud\">Who is the Average \"Student\"?<\/a>\n * 3.2  <a href=\"#prof\">Who is the Average \"Professional\"?<\/a>\n* 4  <a href=\"#yprof\">What Separates Students from Young Professionals?<\/a>\n* 5  <a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion<\/a>\n\n\n","21da1dcc":"One bit of relief, however, is that students do not necessarily need to become experts in Machine Learning in order to find employment as the bulk of young professionals also have less than a year of experience working with the technology as well. Obviously, it probably wouldn't hurt to obtain a bit of knowledge with Tensorflow but it seems that the more key dependencies are SQL and cloud technologies."}}
