Magically, those operations, like subtracting, adding, will have some real-world meaning. For example, if we subtract the vector of \"man\" from that of \"woman\", we will get a new vector. And if we add this new vector to the vector of \"king\", the resulting vector will be close to the vector of \"queen\"! \n\n![Manipulation of word vectors](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/images\/linear-relationships.png)\n\nThe vectors can sure be fed into a machine learning model.

For now, the most interesting topic to me is NLP. So I decide to setup this notebook and update it regularly to share with friends what I have learnt and what I have experienced along the way.\n\nNLP means Natural Language Process. This process is to deal with text or speech so that we can gain insight of massive texts and speeches. After we preprocess text\/speech data into useful representations, we can use computer to help us, in a highly efficient way, to dig out a lot from the massive texts\/speeches, so that NLP can be used in:\n* Machine Translation\n* Speech Recognition\n* Sentiment Analysis\n* Question Answering System\n* Text Automatic Summariztion\n* Chatbots\n* Text Classification\n* Character Recognition\n* Spell Checking\n\n\nActually, since NLP is so important and attractive, there are more than one way to handle the process. To my knowledge, TensoFlow can do this job, spaCy is also very hot and spicy on this topic, [NLTK](https:\/\/www.nltk.org\/) is another powerful tool. Hopefully, in the future, I can pick those treasures up one by one and collect them here, so my friends can find a good starting point in this notebook. \n\nOne thing I have to admit here is that I am not a smart man. I am not a genius, but an ordinary person with genuine interesting in data science. People always say there are two species can land on the top of a pyramid, the eagle and the snail.  For those \"eagles\", they can understand snipet of code in a blink of eye, to me, in my \"snail\" way, I have to type them word by word, test, debug, more test more debug, until I really understand them. In the same manner, I will build up this notebook little by little with detailed explaination of code and complete links to the references or other useful resources. I hope my friends can find enjoyment in my community. Let us work together!","69a67eb1":"From the output from the code above, we can see new words like \"really\" and \"manatee\" are all replaced by '<OOV>' and then tokenized as \"1\".

Then, what is 'ner'? It is short for **N**ame **E**ntity **R**ecognition. As long as there are name entities in the given text, it can be referred to by using `.ents`. See the following example:","6bea32d0":"## 2.1 Tokenize\n\nDifferent from the tokenizing process happened in the previous section about tensorflow. Token here is still a word, not a number we get after tokenization from the tensorflow. For spaCy, tokenization is a process of purifying raw text into simpler individual words which will make more sense in the future computation.\n\nAs you will see from the following example, in spaCy, punctuation is token, and contractions like \"don't\" will be splitted into \"do\" and \"n't\" and counted as two tokens. \n\nAlso in the following example, we displayed POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging. In English, the parts of speech tell us what is the function of a word and how it is used in a sentence. They may be Noun, Pronoun, Adjective, Verb, Adverb, etc. Punctuation is labelled as \"PUNCT\".

The geomety tells us if there are two vectors in the space, and they are parallel to each other, then the angle between the two vectors is zero. If we do not care about the starting point and length of the two vectors, in this case, we can conclude those two vectors are identical to each other. They have the biggest similarity now. So, it is natural to use the angle between the vectors as a metric to tell if two vectors are similar to each other. The bigger the angle is, the smaller the similarity is. \n\nA little math here, although I hate this part, I cannot figure out any other way to explain this issue without using math. Suppose we a vector $\\bf{a}$ and a vector $\\bf{b}$, the angle between them is $\\theta$. Then the $\\theta$ can be calculated by:\n$$\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\bf{a}\\bullet \\bf{b}}{\\|\\bf{a}\\|\\space\\|\\bf{b}\\|}$$\n$\\|\\bf{a}\\|$ and $\\|\\bf{b}\\|$ are the magnitude of those two vectors respectively.

Pipes are classes for processing and transforming tokens. When you create a spaCy model with `nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')`, there are default pipes tht perform part of speech tagging, entity recognition, and other transformations. When you run text through a model `doc = nlp(\"some text here\")`, the output of the pipe are attached to the tokens in the `doc` object. The lemmas for `token.lemma_`come from one of these pipes.","f3c4fffc":"As a user, we can have some options over the paddings.

It is useful to summarize the steps at the very beginning, so that everyone will have a simplified map at hand to keep us at the right track.\n\n1. Loading in the data\n\n> Typical machine learning repository can be found from [UCI](https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/index.php). For a data scientist, the firt thing need to care about is the attribute information of the data. Those attributs can actually divided into the *factors* part and the *labels* part. For example, if you want to study the risk of diabetes, you man take into account the factors like age, sex, sudden weight loss, visual blurring, itching, etc. Then those factors will be associated to a certain label -- whether this guy has diabetes or not. \n\n> When data is not complex, we use Pandas to handl it.\n\n2.

Evaluating the model\n6. Making prediction based on the model\n\nIt seems I have forgotten to mention **data visualization**.  No, I don't. The only reason is, data visualiztion, as a powerful tool, can be used in almost every step mentioned above. I will learn how to use it along the way. \n\nOne thing we need to keep in mind is the six steps listed above is only a simplifed road map, or a sketch of the \"pipeline\", we will meet more details later on. For example, when the data is loaded, we need a **preprocess** procedure to get rid of the noise, to figure out if the data is complete or not, to scale the data, to do the dimensionality reduction, etc. \n","4b9f95fe":"Create a document from the text to search and use the phrase matcher to find where the terms occur in the text.","760b0cb3":"spaCy relies on **models** that are language-specific and come in different sizes.
