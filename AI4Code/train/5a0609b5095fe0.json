Elevation has distinct distributions for most forest cover types, important feature.\n2. Aspect - The cottonwood\/willow and Aspen trees are bunched together more prominently below 180 degree azimuth and the Douglas fir grows at some crazy high azimuth values. Most of examples of the cover types follow a similar distribution.\n3. The aspen, panderosa pine, cottonwood\/willow and douglas fir grow over a wider range of sloped terrain. The rest tend to grow in less steep terrain.\n4. The cotton willow mostly grows close to water features, to a higher extent than the other trees coverage types.\n5. There are coverage types that generally grow closer to the roadways.\n6. The hillshade features are highly correalted with the aspect and slope features, makes sense.\n7. The cover type that are closer to roads are also closer to fire points, they seem to be correlated.","46862211":"## Data Interaction and Selecting Useful Features \n1. Between Hillshade_9am' and 'Hillshade_3pm'. - Very high negative correlation. Different hillshade index for coverage types maybe due to growth at different elevation. The classes of the target do appear to be in narrow bands.\n2. Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology' and 'Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology'. - Strong positive correlation, signifies that certain coverage types survive further away from water sources, the Krummholz for example, the willow appears to grow closer to water sources. Relationship looks weakly linear.\n3. 'Aspect' and 'Hillshade_3pm'. - Interaction of the Sun's position and the aspect of the trees along with the resulting hillshade can be seen beautifully using these plots. The height of the trees must have an impact too and is possibly why we do see that the cottonwood willow is on the lower end of providing shade compared to the doghlas-fir and the krummholz.\n4. 'Aspect' and 'Hillshade_9am'.\n5. Slope' and 'Hillshade_Noon'. At noon, with the sun overhead, we see that the resulting hillshade must be an interaction of the slope of the trees, its height and the elevation. The trees standing straight provide the most shade when the sun is overhead. \n6. 'Elevation' and 'Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways'. - shows pretty distinct classes of the coverage types, important features. Also makes sense that the types growing at high altitudes are further away from roads i.e less roads up high.\n7. Elevation and Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points - Comparing with the above interaction, we can see that this is pretty similar, so most fire points are closer to roads, towns, civilisation. Except for maybe the lodgepole pine and cotton willow, posssible these are more susceptible to forrest fires due to extreme heat, other reasons.\n7. Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways and Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points. - Also reaffirms the hypothesis that the lodgepole pine and cotton willow are more susceptible to fire points further away from civilisation i.e. other factors at play.\n8. Elevation and Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points - Also shows that the Lodgepole Pine, aspen and Krummholz can grow further away from water sources, a cluster of krummholz can be seen growing in extreme conditions.","bd9a2f5a":"## Exploratory Data Analysis\n1.
