As we are building linear regression model, if explanatory variable has linear relationship with response variable or target variable then it plays a good role in predicting house price. To determine linear relationship we will use coefficient of correlation(pearson coefficient).\nif pearson coefficient is 0.7 in magnitude or greater that this we are considering there is good linear relationship between independent variable and target variable\nif pearson coefficient is less than 0.7 in magnitude than we are considering there is not good linear relationship between independent variable and target variable"}}
