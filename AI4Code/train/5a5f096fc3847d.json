The first two blocks follow the same structure:\n1. Apply a Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel size and valid padding, then another Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel but with same padding to keep the same dimensions\n2. Apply a BatchNormalization layer to avoid layers being too depended from one another and allowing each activation to have 0 mean\n3. A RELU activation and a MaxPooling2D layer with 2x2 kernel size and stride=2\n4. An element-wise Dropout layer applied to MaxPooling2D keeping 80% of the activation units\n\nThe final 2 layers consists of a Fully Connected Layer that uses a Softmax activation for classification.","35eea47b":"Why 255?\n\n1 byte of information = 8 bits. each bit has 2 values 0 or 1; the color intensity is 2^8=256 possible value; \ni.e. goes from 0 to 255\n\nby dividing by 255, we are making maximum value 1.
