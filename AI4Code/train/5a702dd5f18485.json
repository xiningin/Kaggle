This seperation can give us better point of view when we consider differences between countries. \nIn the figure below, I compare the freedom level for these two categories and as we can see, happy countries obviously have better freedom feeling than unhappy ones. So, it is clear to say that freedom is one of the feeling that makes us feel better.","9cd4c729":"With the help of my first 5 data, we can see the top 5 happiest countries in world. Now lets make some plots to look for which criteria is more effective on happiness. First, I would like to consider economical possibilities and trust on goverment of countries according to their happiness ranking.","2e783fbc":"According to information of my data, we can see that there are 155 countries which are ranked by some criteria like economical level, their freedom etc.","82681296":"As we can observe on the heat map, happiness level (rank or score) is related to a lot of factor of a country.  To understand the dataset better, I prefer to make a quick look to my data below.","aec4d898":"As we can see cleary on figure above, economical situation of citizens has critical effect on happiness level. When you consider challenges of huminity for survival, you can say money is one of the most important thing to solve problems in our lives. So, it is not hard to understand that happiness ranking is directly propotional to economical level. However, if we look the red line which presents govermental trust between citizen, we can say whether it is a happy country or not, most of the governments are not able to get their own citizen trusts. \nLets have a look to how freedom feeling affects the hapiness score.","71ead49e":"In this report, I will focus on what kind of situations are effective on happiness level of a country and I am going to use a dataset to understand these criteria. First of all, I would like to start with looking correlations inside data sets.","f43c1779":"According to my data, I assumed that a country can be considered as rich if their economy per capita is higher than 1.5 and I can see that all these rich countries are on top part of our mean line. So, as I showed before by using line plot, I can show economy effect on happiness score again on scatter plot"}}
