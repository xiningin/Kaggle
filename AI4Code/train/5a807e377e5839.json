NBSVM was introduced by Sida Wang and Chris Manning in the paper [Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classi\ufb01cation](https:\/\/nlp.stanford.edu\/pubs\/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf). In this kernel, we use sklearn's logistic regression, rather than SVM, although in practice the two are nearly identical (sklearn uses the liblinear library behind the scenes).\n\nIf you're not familiar with naive bayes and bag of words matrices, I've made a preview available of one of fast.ai's upcoming *Practical Machine Learning* course videos, which introduces this topic. Here is a link to the section of the video which discusses this: [Naive Bayes video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/37sFIak42Sc?t=3745).","b6402367":"## Building the model\n\nWe'll start by creating a *bag of words* representation, as a *term document matrix*.
