However, as most of the values of windspeed are under 25, that means that windspeed won't have much impact on bike hires unless it is a particularly windy day.","36d1f278":"The main conclusion I can make from this is that, unsurprisingly,the total number of bike hires - On average for any given day, winter has less bike hires, spring and autumn have a considerable amount more, and summer has the most total bike hires.\nHowever, I did notice that there are still days in winter with >200 bike hires, so this led me to look at temperature next.","d3f6f0a5":"Next I decided to investigate windspeed","39cb0571":"### Getting the data","129d7e0e":"# Practical ongoing assessment\n\n## Bike hires","b9ea9865":"The first thing I did was to check the info for the table","11e88e80":"Next I created another column that interpreted the value of weathersit and put it to words","7a8e4486":"I thought it would be useful to see the total number of hires in a day, so i created a new column called total that added the number of casual and registered hires","06dff8c6":"Research questions\n\nWhich features can be used to predict the casual hires?\n\nAre there any patterns by filtering in the categorical features? \n\nHow do casual hires compare to hires by registered users?","08db5819":"### Imports","932826ad":"Now that I have all of my data as I want it, lets start investigating.

However,once the temperature reaches around 30\u2070C, the average number of bike hires actually decreases. \nMy hypothesis for this is that it becomes too hot for most people to want to do much exercise, so people don't want to cycle. Alternatively, people may prefer to walk to their location and appreciate the weather instead of rushing the trip like they would if the weather was worse."}}
