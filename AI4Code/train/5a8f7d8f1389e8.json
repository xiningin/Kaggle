It is fairly clear that the countries with the highest population overall tend to have more scope for expansion overall. \n\nDRC is the interesting outlier here with a population rank of 66 but with only 8 percent of their population connected to the Internet, they have more scope in terms of numbers as well as getting more population to the Internet. Other countries in the top ten have atleast 18 percentage of people using the Internet as well.","62f5b21e":"As we can see these are the countries, whose large section of population is not logged onto the Internet. But the population size affects the total number of people that can be reached out to. So let us see in terms of Users Without Internet.","29eaef30":"As we can see, there is a slight issue. The object data type of Population and Internet Users will not allow us to perform numeric operations on the dataframe.
