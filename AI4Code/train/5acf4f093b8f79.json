There are a lot of individual responses for a question . Which is not nice rather than elaborating in comments they elaborated about it in the response answer.\n4. Add more columns like city gdp,per capita income and city revenue and their spending \n5. Also put a political stability score . Because in less developed cities authorities usually try to take advantage of the money that was given to do a project .\n6. As of climate security and water security develop a score for which countries have stricter rules on climate and water security . And are they really helpful\n7.

Many organizations have also reported in their local languages like spanish\n5. We see a huge drop in cities reporting in 2020 it is due to the coronavirus crisis and there is not active participation from many cities with huge participation.\n6. As from many countries the participation rate is too low for regions like Middle East, Asia ,Oceania we cannot give a particular country an overview based on very less cities it it likely going to mislead us .\n7.
