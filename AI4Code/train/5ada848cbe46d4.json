We want to encourage our model to find parts of the weight space that are both accurate and stable. Therefore, from time to time we increase the learning rate (this is the 'restarts' in 'SGDR'), which will force the model to jump to a different part of the weight space if the current area is \"spikey\".

One way to fix this is to effectively create more data, through *data augmentation*. This refers to randomly changing the images in ways that shouldn't impact their interpretation, such as horizontal flipping, zooming, and rotating.\n\nWe can do this by passing `aug_tfms` (*augmentation transforms*) to `tfms_from_model`, with a list of functions to apply that randomly change the image however we wish. For photos that are largely taken from the side (e.g. most photos of dogs and cats, as opposed to photos taken from the top down, such as satellite imagery) we can use the pre-defined list of functions `transforms_side_on`.
