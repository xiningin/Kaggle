","3547cea3":"## What is a Normal (or Gaussian) Distribution?\nA normal distribution often called as Gaussian or Laplace-Gauss Distribution is a continuous probabilty distribution for real-valued random variable. A sample of points is called normally ditributed if they follow certain properties which normal distribution follows. A point on the plot is the probability of sampling a variable on the corresponding x-axis point.\n\nNow, continuous probability distribution for a real valued ranodom variable is typically described by probability density functions (with the probability of any individual outcome being 0).\n\nLet's plot PDF of normal distribution.","d482f2c0":"A normal distribution has two parameters, mu and sigma, where mu is the mean of the distribution and the sigma is standard deviation. Probability of getting selected increases if the value is near the mean. In normal distribution, data points are centered and symmetric around mean.  \n\nSigma stands for standard deviation of the distribution. It accounts for the width of the normal distribution. More is the sigma, more will be variability in the values, and more flatter will be the normal distribution which brings down the peak of the ND.  \n\nLet's see it below","1955008b":"##### Above is the bell curve everyone talks about.","7576f791":"More is the value of stddev, straighter the cdf tends to become. This happens because the variability of data points increases with stddev. Stddev is measure of variability.","b53dab25":"If we are talking about PDF then we should definitely talk about CDF of probability distribution.","d791576d":"As expected, the normal distribution with higher value of stddev, is flatter than the smaller ones. Also, as the smaller stddev is, more higher is the peak of ND.   \n\nNormal distribution follows 68-95-97 rule, which means the 65% data points will fall within 1 stddev range centered at mean. 95% within 2 standard deviation and 97% within 3 stddev.\n\nKurtosis and Skewness values are both 0 for ND. Plot is centered around mean and it is symmetric around mean.\n\nND is present in many things in our day to day life.\n\nBy moving the means and keeping the stddev same, the plot will not change it will just move sideways."}}
