Before applying any AI or ML technique on the data set, it is extremely important to observe the basic properties of the data and therefore EDA is performed.\n    - In simple way: Before solving a question, we have to read it and observe the things\/facts given in the question. Once it is observed, we can go ahead to solve it. EDA is performed for similar purpose.\n    \n- What do we do in EDA?\n    - We apply maths, statistics, plotting techniques and various scientific methods and observe the meaning of the results produced by those various techniques.\n","747e5a84":"# Analyzing through plots\n   1. Univariate\n       - Only one variable\/feature is taken into consideration.\n   2. Bivariate\n       - Two variables\/features are taken into consideration.\n   3. Multivariate\n       - Two or more variables are taken into consideration.\n           \n           \n## Univariate Analysis\n  - Very simple to analyze because we have to look at only one feature.\n  - Doesn't deal with relationship or causes.\n  - Examples: PDF, CDF, Box-plot, Violin-plot, Percentage Distribution, Bar Graph, Histogram, Frequency Polygon, Pie Chart etc.","93e8afb3":"- Here also we can observe that, more than 80% patients are having the counts of positive axillary nodes less than 10.  ","451246ca":"#### Observation\n- As it stated earlier, violin plot represents PDF and Box-cox together:\n    - When we divide the figures inside in half, clearly PDF can be seen by looking horizontal sides. Thus, one full picture either blue or orange in this case, is the combination of two symmetric combination of one PDF.\n    - A thin vertical box inside each one represents the property of box-cox plot and the meaning is same as we saw earlier in box-cox plot.\n    - One white dot in middle of each box represents the middle quartile and represents the same meaning as we saw earlier in box-cox plot.\n    - In this plot also both the class labels are overlapping on each other that means they are not linearly separable.\n    - Similar violin plots can be drawn for other feature as well.","7e9acca5":"### Violin plots\n  - Combination of PDF and Box-plot so it's more informative.\n  - Represents four things:\n     1.

","5d01f35c":"- All the data points are random and mixed up, so, the class is not linearly separable including above two features age and operation year.\n- One thing that can be observed here that, there more data points belonging to class label 1 as we have seen it earlier in this document.","da90e97c":"- Here, orange curve is CDF that is representing the percentile.\n- Blue curve represents PDF.\n- PDF says, there are 20% patients between the age of 50-60.\n- Similarly, from CDF, we can observe that, 40% patients are under the age of 50 and similarly, 90% patients are under the age of 70.","1039c6e4":"#### Observation\n- It seems like more number of patients belong to the class label 2.\n- It is also observed that, between age of 40-60, very few patients belong to class label 1.\n- Anyway, there could be such nodes which might be overlapped by another and may not be visible.\n- Similar plotting can be performed for other features as well.\n","255083ca":"# Loading the dataset","524e954c":"- Solid squared bars are called 'Histogram'\n- Smoothed curved is just the continuous version of histogram and it is called PDF.\n- Since, there is much overlapping, we can't separate both the classes by looking at the age of patients in above plot.\n- In simple way: We can't say that some particular age of patients are belonging to a particular class.","0d310ff0":"- Much overlapping here also, so both the classes can't be distinguished.\n- Blue curved is very peaked with very less spread in above plot that represents the density of patients who survived 5 years of more.\n- We can say that, most of the patients who survived 5 years or more are having positive axillary nodes around 0.","931254be":"\n## Dataset: Haberman Survival\n- Study was conducted between 1958-1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients, undergone surgery for breast cancer.\n\n   1.
