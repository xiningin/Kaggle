Recommendations\n\n- What is seen as a competition of what country has the highest vaccinated population should be seen as the region who is distributing its resources the best and even helping poor countries. For the analysis we see how Uruguay is way more advanced than the countries in its region and this is a sign of poor regional coordination. The job of Uruguay has been outsanding, but the coopeartion problem in the region is evident and transcends to other areas. It is then reccomended to better the relationships in each region for a better distribution and further cooperation in other areas.\n\n- The role of social support in Uruguay is also evident and the data back up its results with the level of vaccinated population. A country that cares about its people will also provide them. The reccomendation is to invest in entities and programs than promotes social support","641c2e13":"The fact that there are contries which don't have fully vaccunated people is controversial, but consistent.

Category features\n\nWe know that each country is unique, so we only have one categorical variable to examine.","92ea4231":"the lines on top of the bars represent the variance of the mean, which is represented by the height of the bar. We can start seeing that Western Europe, North America and ANZ, and East Asia lead the vaccunation process. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa sit at the bottom. \n\nImportant to remark the high variance in each region except for western Europe. This means that there are some countries in the sample that have way more vaccinated people than other. Could this be a sign of regional cooperation between the countries? My intuition tells me yes. The european union and the european comission should have developed a plan around the continent, that would explain the low variance. \n\nNorth America and ANZ on the other hand, doesn't seem to be cooperating. United States and Canada have more thant 50% of its opulation vaccinated, whereas Australia and New Zealand have 24% and 14% respectively as shown in the table below.","b3dafb26":"## 1.1. Objectives\n\nThe notebook will focus mainly on what factors make a country more vaccinated than other.\n\n- Find key aspects of a leading vaccinated country\n- Develop strategies and reccomendations based on findings\n- Build a model that predicts how vaccinated a country is as on 30 June, 2021","47ed70a2":"## 3.1. What regions have most of its population vaccinated?","297b756e":"# 4. Conclusions\n- Countries in their regions are in different vaccination stage, which means that there's no evidence of cooperation between countries in their regions, this phenomenon is explained with the variance of the mean in seciton 3.1. Thats not the case for Western Europe, where the countries have a similar % of vaccinated population.\n\n- The trend in section 3.2. shows that the % of vaccinated population is directly related to the GDP of a country: the higher the GDP the higher the % of vaccinated population. This is not the case of Chile, since they are a medium level GDP but have a higher % of vaccinated population. This could be explained with the emphasis the country have on social support, factor that is higher than almost all of the high GDP countries.\n\n- A happy country is a vaccinated one. But do not rush with a direct causation. A happy country is the result of a combination of economic and social factors that usually make a developed country. Then, i would rather say that a developed country is a vaccinated one.","2558e5c2":"We can see from the graph that GDP does influence the percentage of population vaccinated: the higher the GDP, the higher the people vaccinated.\n\nIf we explore through the graph, we notice that there is one high GDP country with low vaccinated population (Saudi Arabia), and medium GDPs countries with high vaccinated population (Mongolia, Maldives and Uruguay). This Phenomenon could be because two reasons:\n\n1. An outsanding\/poor management of agreements with the labs\n2. A low\/high level of cooperation between countries of a region (as seen in section 3.1)","52796b46":"**Uruguay**\nWe can tell from the graphs and table that Uruguay is doing well in th evaccination process, even better than the average of Western Europe and way more than the its region, Latin America and the caribbean. Important to remark that Uruguay dont have a higher GDP than the average of Western Union. But, if we keep examining the graphs, we see that Uruguay has an outstanding social suuport. A couple of hypothesis then come to my mind.\n\n- Is Uruguay doing better than europe and latin america because the importance they put on social support?\n- Is Western Union doing worst because they level of cooperation en distribution? this could also explain why Uruguay is so far from the latin america average, since the level of cooperation in this region is quite low.\n\n**Saudi Arabia**\nSaudi Arabia is more of a special case than Uruguay. The contry has decent numbers in all of its indicadors. But, they still don't have any vaccinated person. \n\nTo answer this question i had to further research in the internet and found that Saudi Arabia has over 53% of its population vaccinated. Hence, the data of Saudi Arabia is not accurate in the dataset and should be discarted.","7b28a65f":"all good with the happiness dataset. Let's proceed and merge both datasets","71ceada3":"## 2.3. Descriptive Analysis\n\nSince we have 24 features, we will first start selecting the variables that we are going to use. The correlation matrix will help us find the the most relevant features.

Important to remark that the cosen criteria of the variables will be the relationship they have with the feature'% of population vaccinated', since our analysis is based on that.","05c8d437":"# 1. Introduction\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Covid-19 and the following development of the vaccine, the world now faces the challenge of distributing the vaccine all around the world with the hope of returning back to the now acclaimed 'normality'. The progress seems positive at a first glance. But, with the limited amount of vaccines, the problem now seems to distribute the vaccine in a fair manner, allowing the less wealthy countries to have access to the vaccine.\n\nThis notebook analyses the data of latest Covid-19 Vaccine Status of all the Countries in the World as on 30 June, 2021 (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/anandhuh\/latest-worldwide-vaccine-data) and compares it with the data of the world happiness report (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ajaypalsinghlo\/world-happiness-report-2021). \n\nWhat story is behind the data? Is the world succeding in distributing the vaccine in a fair manner? Is a happy country also a vaccinated one?

Therefore, they must have one key column that has the same values. Hence, We will also see if the values are consistent in both datasets.","5d60349d":"There is indeed a trend that shows that the higher a country is in the happines report ladder, the more people will be vaccinated.
