Unlike the horizontal coordinate system, the equatorial coordinates are independent of the location of the observer and the time of the observation. This means that only one set of coordinates is required for each object, and that these same coordinates can be used by observers at different locations and at different times.\n\nThe equatorial coordinate system is basically the projection of the latitude and longitude coordinate system that we use here on Earth, onto the celestial sphere. By direct analogy, latitude lines are converted to declination lines (Dec; measured in degrees, arc minutes, and arc seconds) and indicate how far north or south of the celestial equator (defined by projecting Earth's equator above the celestial sphere) is the object. Lines of longitude have their equivalent in lines of right ascension (RA), but while longitude is measured in degrees, minutes and seconds east of the Greenwich meridian, RA is measured in hours, minutes and seconds east from where the The celestial equator intersects the ecliptic (the vernal equinox)."}}
