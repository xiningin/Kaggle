First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also let's you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.)

Run the code cell below to do that, and you'll be ready to move on to question 0.","6f856db3":"You may have noticed a few problems (with accompanying warning messages printed out):\n\n- We wanted each image to be drawn in a square (with width and height of 2 inches), but they're being drawn inside fat rectangles.\n- Our grid can only fit at most 15 images. If we sample more than that, only the first 15 are shown.\n- If we sample a small number of images, we waste a lot of space.\n\nAll these problems stem from our shoddy approach to step 2 in the code. Instead of using the same grid dimensions every time, they should adapt to the number of images we're showing. For example, if `n = 3`,  we should make a 6\" x 2\" grid with 1 row and 3 columns. If `n = 15`, we should make a 16\" x 4\" grid with 2 rows and 8 columns. (We'll have one empty space in the grid, but that's okay, as long as we don't have whole rows or columns that are empty.)\n\nUpdate the code above to fix the values of `rows`, `cols`, `width`, and `height`, so that our grid adapts to the number of images shown and makes efficient use of space. Run your code a few times to make sure it doesn't generate any warnings.\n\n<small>**Note**: I'm intentionally glossing over the details of steps 1, 3, and 4 of the code. If you're curious about how the functions we imported such as `sample_images_of_category`, or `draw_images_on_subplots` work, you can check out their definitions [here](https:\/\/github.com\/Kaggle\/learntools\/blob\/master\/learntools\/python\/quickdraw.py). The code uses lots of syntax and data structures that we'll cover later, so if it looks like gibberish to you at this point, don't worry.
