all, ice cream = happiness:). Most of the products are globally popular with generic names. However, missing from the top products are not labeled, but vital products - bread, potatoes, rice. Perhaps contributors had not considered or were not able to add those more frequently, due to lack of labeling or information. \n\nInterestingly, Top 10 consists entirely of retailers. Nestle is the first food processing giant (ranked 14), but with that exception, retailers dominate the top brands. \n\nAre retailer's private labels really dominating to that exend or perhaps it is a data inconsistency - marking the store of purchase as a brand, rather than the brand itself?\nIn order to test if the brand tags were marked correctly, I will check the branding for two of the most popular brands in the world - Coca-Cola and Pepsi.","a212d2ae":"## **4. Marking warnings to additives**\n\nTopic of general interest is what exactly is in our food. In the EU, the famous \"E-numbers\" - given to food additives were intended to give clarity by providing additional information next to the scary chemistry names. Instead, they lead to much further discussion. Are all E-numbers bad? Which ones of all are bad? How can we find out which ones are? How much of a certain E-number is too much?\n\nConsidering the public interest in the topic, the available information online is difficult to work with. The EU has made available search engines and databases on the topic, but downloading a CSV file with the data is not available. One has either have to scrape one-by-one or in one of the EU sites, know SQL to pull a report. Similarly, FAO and WHO have information on each of the additives, but none is available in a ready dataset.\n\nMy approach was to collect the information that is clearly understandable and easily available. I used the website of the UK Food agency and Wikipedia's additives page and built a small dataset of 3 columns - additive's name, EU E-number and the warning.","429ab703":"As a next step, I would need to estimate the average carbohydrates per group, using the Open Food Data. While with ice cream, the category is relatively straight-forward (based on the analysis so far), I would have to understand how soft drinks and confectioneries are tagged, group together the right products and take the mean. Future studies (and more powerfull PCs than mine) can have a Monte Carlo simulation choosing a product from a group randomly to simulate intakes in different days.","6244c9c8":"# Abstract\nThe purpose of this study is in first place to thoroughly assess the data in the Open Food Data set. \n\nIn second place, two other topics of general interest were addresses - sugar intake and food additives. I used statistics of household food purchases from The UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (UK DEFR) and the Open Food Data to assess real intake of sugar from 3 categories of food from 1992 to 2017. Then the results were compared to the World Health Organization sugar intake recommendations.\n\nI scraped the internet to build a dataset of additives and current label warnings for them. I felt like that would be a natural addition to the Open Food Dataset. The added information revealed that significant portion of the food in the dataset requires a warning on the label clear enough for buyers. What is more, substances that are banned or phased-out in the EU were still to be found on some of the food.\n","502d0ed7":"For soft drinks, I will find the top tags for Pepsi and Coca Cola and use the same tags for the general query.","e74d19db":"## Open Food Data - Exploratory Data Analysis, translating additives to warnings and sugar intake in the UK\n","9830158f":"## **1. Know your data sources**\n\nBefore doing any actual exploration of the data, I would like to understand more on how the Open Food Data is collected. The purpose of this first step is to understand biases that might be introduced by the methods of data collection.\n\n[Open Food Data](https:\/\/world.openfoodfacts.org\/who-we-are) is an open-source, *\"collaborative project with contributors from all around the world\"*. The project was started by St\u00e9phane Gigandet, creator of food-related projects and blogs. Most of the initial contributors were French (see the [Who-we-are page](https:\/\/world.openfoodfacts.org\/who-we-are)).\n\nData is entered by volunteer contributors or food product manufacturers via the Open Food Data website or mobile apps. While there is no rigorous verification of the data quality at entry, Open Food Data has automatic checks to highlight outlier data. In addition, the dataset has been added to Kaggle Datasets for 3 years and is part of Google Summer of Code. Thus, the data is subject to attention and scrutiny by the Data Science community.\n\nStill, the data collecion method introduces biases. For example, I would need to be cautious how I use the dataset for questions on eating habits per economic class, as certain classes (e.g. very poor and very rich) are very unlikely to be a volunteer for this cause. Similarly, many countries without widespread internet usage are unlikely to be well-represented in the data. \n\nAs a summary, Open Food Data is a French initiative that has grown popular worldiwide. Data is entered by volunteers or food product manufacturers with access to internet, willingness, state-of-mind and time to contribute to a good cause.","189c3d1b":"The dataset has more than 356000 entries in 163 columns. The size of the data does not allow us to simply look at the results of the head() method and get a good feeling of the data. It will require closer expection of the columns of interest to understand the information contained.\n\nOut of the 163 columns, many contain information for only a very small portion of the dataset and only a handfull have no NaN entries. At first, I will focus on columns \ncontaining at least 10% data (not a NaN):","9598ef45":"Columns with tags in the dataset tend to have multiple tags per item. As a result, just grouping by a column and extracting the size of each tag would result in slightly distorted results. \nThe below function takes a column from the dataframe and returns a dataframe containing how frequently a tag was mentioned (independent of the fact if it is the only tag or part of a tag group). The dataset has a column \"main_category\" but it contains significantly less non-NaN rows than 'categories_tags', making a use of a function worthy.","87313722":"## 4. Conclusion\n\nThis short study aimed to first understand what value and what biases are there in the Open Food Data. The dataset is a tremendous sourse of food related information. One needs to have in mind the specifics of the data sources and the data collection methods when choosing what to use the dataset for. \n\nAdditionally, I looked at two popular concerns - How much sugar do we eat and What is in the food today. Much can be done to further expand on both topics. Sugar intakes can be simulated with consequences of day-to-day fluctuations understood better. Additionally, fibres in the food change the way our body treats sugar and should be taken into account. One fact is clear - we eat too much sugar and need to actively work to reduce our intake.\n\nThe current food economy cannot work without additives. However, there is still much work to be done explaining the effects of some of them to buyers and consumers. Further areas of research can be exactly how much of a certain additive is in a food item and what happens when its amount adds-up with different food items. For now, just understanding labeling and looking for warnings on it is a benefit in and of itself.\n","2c97ad0f":"Using chocolate and cookies as the typical examples of confectionery, the most used tags that describe the categories are en:sugary-snacks, en:chocolates, en:biscuits-and-cakes and some combination of the above.","0a6bd946":"en:carbonated-drink, en:sodas and en:sugared-beverages are the top tags that describe the category. I will use those as a filter for soft drinks.","5890325b":"## **3. Sugar intake estimation**\n\nThe UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFR) is kind enough to publish detailed statistics on family food and drink purchases. [UK has been rated](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_body_mass_index) in the middle of the BMI index - not a front-runner like the US, but also not exemplary like Austria and Switzerland.\nEstimation of the overall carbohydrates intake would require a more lenghty exercise. For the current one, I will focus only on 3 groups - daily carbohydrates intake from soft drinks, ice cream and confectionary. The algorithm is going to be the following:\n1. Load data for daily purchases of the 3 groups from UK DEFR. \n2. Based on the Open Food Data, estimate average carbohydrates per group. \n3. Calculate carbohydrates intake per day for each of the years (assuming similar food recepies throughout the timeframe - since 1992).\n4. Compare with WHO maximum recommended carbohydrates per day. \n<br \/> \n\nNote on 1): I pre-processed the data from UK DEFR, removing all other categories, converting ml. to gram (using 1.03 gr. per 1 ml for soft drings and 0.6 gr. per 1 ml for ice cream). Link to the original form of the dataset is provided in the References. <br \/> \nNote on 2): For the 3 groups carbohydrates is practically equal to sugar, but sugar_100g is reported in fewer cases. Only with cookies one can argue that the fibers to carbohydrates ratio is slightly higher, but it does not affect the conclusions.","dd6d5e2f":"## **2.
