One thing to notice though is the high amount of outliers in downsloping, we can see how thin the violinplot stretches as ST Depression gets higher.\n\nLastly for the up slope, ther is a clear correlation, meaning that the higher the ST Depression level, the lower the chance of heart attack. The up slope in peak exercise also has a mostly normal distribution and both median ST depression levels are higher then most of the other slopes.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems the ST Depression levels are a fairly good predictor of the chances of a Heart Attack (higher ST Depression Levels mean less of a chance of Heart Attacks). The Slope is not as accurate of a predictor but we can see that downsloping causes a fairly high increase in Heart Attacks (We can see this by looking at how stretched the downslope for higher chance of a heart attack is)","e4899f25":"**Alright that's enough EDA for now.

However, the maximum heart rate achieved has a significant correlation with the chance of a heart attack.

Lets take a closer look at the data for these rows.","e7a403a5":"Seems like the target feature is fairly balanced so we won't need to worry about imbalanced data.","ad558f37":"It's not clear from the data which gender is which but there is an imbalance of about 110 meaning that the data may be more biased towards one gender.

Age and Blood Pressure have little correlation and don't seem to really affect the chance of a heart attack.\n\nThe third graph shows us that cholestrol and blood pressure also have little relation with each other.\n\nI do want to mention that this is fairly surprising. It's common knowledge that high blood pressure and high cholestrol levels increase the chance for a heart attack and yet the graphs don't seem to support this.\n\nSomething interesting to note here, though, is the patient with a cholestrol level of about 580 mg!
