I tried to take a median for this too, but everything was 1 because most values are x1 in each set anyway.","caecde2b":"Going based purely on type matchups, the Fighting, Fire, and Ice types are the best to keep around for ensuring super effective damage. There are other considerations to keep in mind when choosing said moves, such as individual Pokemon stats and individual move power, but looking at this type effectiveness data should be a good indication of the smartest coverage moves to keep in mind. \n\nAlso, on another note, Normal type is not super effective on any other type. Thus, there is no bar because it all went to 0.","0d04f524":"This shows the multiplier counts for each pokemon type. The multipler means the multiplier a move of a said type will do when used on the specific Pokemon. The typical values are 0 (for unaffected), 0.5 for not very effective, 1 for normally effective, and 2 for super effective. The two other values (0.25 and 4) follow the same rules as the not very effective and super effective branches respectively, however, they only occur if the move type would be not very effective\/super effective on both of the two types of the Pokemon, hence why they are much less common.","06a1533e":"# Extremes (Not Very Effective\/Super Effective) analysis","3aec9485":"This simply sums up all the multipiers, which could possibly be skewed by x4 multipliers. Based on this, the smartest move to keep on hand is a rock type move, given that it gives the highest multiplier score.","92f11d7f":"The top three types to avoid for more general usage are Grass, Bug, and Fighting. Interestingly, Fighting is on both the super effective and non effective top threes. This shows that, while the beginning analysis emphasized types for more general usage, the super effective and non effective categories are for more specific usage. The fighting type likely is on here due to ghosts being immune to it, thus being it was not very high on the general usage graph but having highs on both the specific effectiveness graphs. \n\nThe biggest one on here is grass, which makes sense with seven types that resist its moves. That makes it less generally versitile. The tradeoff, however, is being strong against water types, which is the most abundant type in all of Pokemon. This means it has very specific usage, and thus this methodology weighs heavily against the type. Sums and means in this case emphasize generality, so while these types have their niches, these types will not have a more general appeal given that you have no idea what is coming out next.","a3b0a8fa":"## Sums without fitting the numbers into categories","1341c479":"---","f2170527":"There are no null values, but the matchups all have a * to show that is a multiplier. I will have to remove them to do math on them. I will also fix the Pokedex data.","4a8d5d26":"## Fit the types to ignore dual type damage","9cc19a03":"---","a756193e":"# Check for Nulls","ac424105":"## Super Effective","19151968":"# Pokemon Type Matchup Data Analysis","caf94491":"---","16d55d8a":"This will be similar to methodology before, just eliminating the opposite values by setting them to 0","dfe9036f":"Coded by Luna McBride\n\nData Scraped from Serebii.net","1fb9c03e":"## Type Matchup Exploration","be5a1d51":"This is not meant to be a guide to what is absolutely necessary for every battle. There are more factors than just type effectiveness. Pokemon stats, move damage, move effects, held item, and abilites will most definitely change what type of move is likely to be used on a case by case basis. This also assumes that any Pokemon in the current Galar dex can appear in any battle with equal probability, which is not true by modern battle standards.\n\nThe point of using this data, however, was not to compare all these different factors to determine the best overall choices. It was instead to compare type matchups and move types for a more general appeal. Of course Pokemon like Cinderace and Togekiss are going to come out more given their popularity and thus they are bigger threats to keep in mind, but knowing the more general use case and preparing accordingly can help for Pokemon that might not be within the popular picks club. This is actually the point of why I wanted to look at type matchup data in this way specifically. Watching the top players go against similar choices is not nearly as interesting as when someone picks an unusual Pokemon, thus putting emphasis onto what general use moves they have to counter the edge cases. \n\nThose general use move types being Flying, Rock, and Fire. For higher damage multipliers but more specific usage, Fighting and Ice fit the mold best.","4d8b4b2a":"# Conclusion","038fec04":"---","3aee8de9":"## Not Very Effective\/Non-Effective","17400db4":"After normalizing effectiveness, the flying type overtook the the rock type for most overall versitile move type. The top five still has the same types, being Flying, Rock, Fire, Ground, and Ice. This summation method only takes into account versitility when it comes to using that type against the whole range of effectiveness and not just searching for super effective like many players tend to do. That will be next (along with purely not very effective and non-effective so we have types to try and avoid), but for the best overall versitility, the flying and rock type moves take the cake.
