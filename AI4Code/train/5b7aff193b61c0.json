Therefore we need to find a way to encode them (represent as numbers) before handing them to the model.\n\n## Label encoding\n\nThis method involves assigning one label for each category\n\n| Occupation    | Label         |\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\n| programmer    | 0             |\n| data scientist| 1             |\n| Engineer      | 2             |\n\n\n\nThe problem with label encoding is that the assignment of integers is random and changes every time we run the function. Also the model might give higher priority to larger labels. Label encoding can be used when we have only 2 unique values.\n\n## One hot encoding\n\nThe problem with label encoding is solved by one hot encoding. It creates a new column for each category and uses only binary values. The downside of one hot encoding is that the number of features can explode if the categorical variables have many categories. To deal with this we can perform PCA (or other dimensionality reduction methods) followed by one hot encoding.\n\n| Occupation    | Occupation_prog| Occupation_ds | Occupation_eng |\n| ------------- |:-------------: |:-------------:|:-------------: |\n| programmer    | 1              | 0             | 0              |\n| data scientist| 0              | 1             | 0              |\n| Engineer      | 0              | 0             | 1              |","0e95881b":"## Other features\n\nIt might not be wise to analyse every feature so I will find the features most correlated to the final grade and spend more time on them.","55b2da2c":"# Modeling\n\n### We can create a model in 3 ways\n\n1.
