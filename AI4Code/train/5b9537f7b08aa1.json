This number, 85.8%, that we got through this very simple reasoning serves as a good starting point (*baseline*) for the further machine learning models that we will build. \n\nAs we move on in this course, recall that, before the advent of machine learning, the data analysis process looked something like this. Let's recap what we've covered:\n    \n- The share of loyal clients in the sample is 85.5%. The most naive model that always predicts a \"loyal customer\" on such data will guess right in about 85.5% of all cases. That is, the proportion of correct answers (*accuracy*) of subsequent models should be no less than this number, and will hopefully be significantly higher;\n- With the help of a simple forecast that can be expressed by the following formula: \"International plan = True & Customer Service calls > 3 => Churn = 1, else Churn = 0\", we can expect a guessing rate of 85.8%, which is just above 85.5%. Subsequently, we'll talk about decision trees and figure out how to find such rules **automatically** based only on the input data;\n- We got these two baselines without applying machine learning, and they\u2019ll serve as the starting point for our subsequent models. If it turns out that with enormous effort, we increase the share of correct answers by 0.5% per se, then possibly we are doing something wrong, and it suffices to confine ourselves to a simple model with two conditions;\n- Before training complex models, it is recommended to manipulate the data a bit, make some plots, and check simple assumptions. Moreover, in business applications of machine learning, they usually start with simple solutions and then experiment with more complex ones.\n\n## 3.

Demonstration of main Pandas methods\nWell... There are dozens of cool tutorials on Pandas and visual data analysis. If you are already familiar with these topics, you can wait for the 3rd article in the series, where we get into machine learning.  \n\n**[Pandas](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org)** is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.xlsx`. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, `Pandas` provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.\n\nThe main data structures in `Pandas` are implemented with **Series** and **DataFrame** classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of `Series` instances. `DataFrames` are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (examples, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features of these instances.","30529485":"\n**What is the maximum length of international calls among loyal users (`Churn == 0`) who do not have an international plan?**\n\n","8eb94640":"The same thing can be done with the `replace` method:","be4ed60d":"Although it's not so obvious from the summary table, it's easy to see from the above plot that the churn rate increases sharply from 4 customer service calls and above.\n\nNow let's add a binary feature to our DataFrame \u2013 `Customer service calls > 3`. And once again, let's see how it relates to churn. ","6a786e8f":"The `apply` method can also be used to apply a function to each row. To do this, specify `axis=1`. Lambda functions are very convenient in such scenarios. For example, if we need to select all states starting with W, we can do it like this:","c1152da0":"In order to see statistics on non-numerical features, one has to explicitly indicate data types of interest in the `include` parameter.","c3473016":"If we need the first or the last line of the data frame, we can use the `df[:1]` or `df[-1:]` construct:","30633f91":"The `map` method can be used to **replace values in a column** by passing a dictionary of the form `{old_value: new_value}` as its argument:","69c14bc7":"`bool`, `int64`, `float64` and `object` are the data types of our features. We see that one feature is logical (`bool`), 3 features are of type `object`, and 16 features are numeric. With this same method, we can easily see if there are any missing values. Here, there are none because each column contains 3333 observations, the same number of rows we saw before with `shape`.\n\nWe can **change the column type** with the `astype` method. Let\u2019s apply this method to the `Churn` feature to convert it into `int64`:\n","22140e87":"Let\u2019s do the same thing, but slightly differently by passing a list of functions to `agg()`:","95fbb2d9":"\n1. First, the `groupby` method divides the `grouping_columns` by their values. They become a new index in the resulting dataframe.\n2. Then, columns of interest are selected (`columns_to_show`). If `columns_to_show` is not included, all non groupby clauses will be included.\n3. Finally, one or several functions are applied to the obtained groups per selected columns.\n\nHere is an example where we group the data according to the values of the `Churn` variable and display statistics of three columns in each group:","34de189a":"**How much time (on average) do churned users spend on the phone during daytime?**","251c21d7":"\n14.5% is actually quite bad for a company; such a churn rate can make the company go bankrupt.\n\n**Boolean indexing** with one column is also very convenient. The syntax is `df[P(df['Name'])]`, where `P` is some logical condition that is checked for each element of the `Name` column. The result of such indexing is the DataFrame consisting only of rows that satisfy the `P` condition on the `Name` column. \n\nLet\u2019s use it to answer the question:\n\n**What are average values of numerical features for churned users?**\n","8e3f693c":"Let\u2019s have a look at data dimensionality, feature names, and feature types.","3e889645":"# <center> Topic 1.
