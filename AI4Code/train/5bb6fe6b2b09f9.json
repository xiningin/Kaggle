Here's a sample tutorial or workflow if you would like to utilize `Google Colab` for your training experiments.\n\nGreat references:\n\n- [Using kaggle datasets into Google Colab](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/49310470\/using-kaggle-datasets-into-google-colab)\n- [Mounting Google Drive in Google Colab](https:\/\/medium.com\/@rushic24\/mounting-google-drive-in-google-colab-5ecd1d3b735a)\n\n","7d192f17":"## Mount `Google Drive` to `Google Colab`\n\n","eeffc0f0":"## Submit from terminal","1e0717f3":"## Enable GPU support (!!!)\n\nGo to `Edit` -> `Notebook settings` and select GPU or TPU as your `Hardware accelerator`","6f3429be":"## Perform awesome training process and evaluation on `Google Colab`","29d45c19":"## Download kaggle dataset\n\n\n1. Create an API key in Kaggle. `My account -> Create New API Tokens`. This will download a `kaggle.json` file to your computer. You can either upload to `Google Drive` manually or using the script below for uploading it.\n\n2. If you would like to using script to upload your `kaggle.json` file, using the following snippet in a code cell:\n\n        ```\n        from google.colab import files\n        files.upload()\n        ```\n\n3. Install the kaggle API using\n\n        ```\n        !pip install -q kaggle\n        ```\n\n4. Move the `kaggle.json` file into `~\/.kaggle`, which is where the API client expects your token to be located:\n\n        ```\n        !mkdir -p ~\/.kaggle\n        !cp kaggle.json ~\/.kaggle\/\n        ```\n\n5. Give permissions to change avoids a warning on Kaggle tool startup.\n\n        ```\n        !chmod 600 ~\/.kaggle\/kaggle.json\n        ```\n\n\n6. Now you can download datasets by using:\n\n        ```\n        !kaggle competitions download -c name-of-the-competition --force\n        ```\n\n\n"}}
