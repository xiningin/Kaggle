Add other statistics to compute. I removed a lot just because I do not want to impute NaN's that will emerge, but these features also could give additional information. Examples will be kurtosis, skewness, CV, informational entropy. You can also add other TS features to the mix (from *tsfresh* or *tslearn* libs);\n3. Watch out for computation times, number of features and collinearity! Use L1\/L2 regulariazations (and feature subsampling if you are planing to use DT-based models). Blindly adding additional features and signals will lead to bloated dataset which will eat your RAM alive.

You can use boosting. I personally do not recommend it. GBDT can only interpolate, it could not extrapolate. So, if test set has target values that are out of range of train target values, you won't be able to predict them properly. Linear models or NNs can. You can use blend of GBDT and LR, this will be the best combination. Another option will be XGBoost with boosting='gblinear';\n2. You can use different scalers and different target transform functions (log, 1\/x, cbrt);\n3. You can predict hours, minutes, seconds and mseconds, then blend results together.
