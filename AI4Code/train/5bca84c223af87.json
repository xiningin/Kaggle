Polarity\n2. Subjectivity\n\n\n### **Polarity**\n\nIt simply means emotions expressed in a sentence.\n\nEmotions are closely related to sentiments. The strength of a sentiment or opinion is typically linked to the intensity of certain emotions, e.g., joy and anger.\n\nThe range of the Polarity  lies in [-1.0,1.0] where 1 is a positive statment and -1 is negative statement. Values with 0 is Neutral statment\n\n\n### **Subjectivity**\n\nSubjective sentence expresses some personal individual feelings, views, or beliefs.\n\nThe range of Subjectivity is [0.0,1.0] where 0 is very objective and 1 is very Subjective.","367abe1a":"**The Statement \"I am programmer\" has a Polarity Score of 0.0 indicating a Neutral Sentiment.**","4a8e713e":"# TextBlob Introduction","31e93070":"Attached Dataset \"Twitter Product Sentiment Analysis\" contains the Tweets of People who have expressed their opinions on Certain Product Brands\n\n[Twitter Product Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/blessondensil294\/twitter-product-sentiment-analysis)","db911656":"The Polarity of the Tweet is 0.62 which show the Tweet is a Positive Review of the Product. \n\nThe Subjectivity is 0.6 which shows the opinion of the User is slight towards Subjective view of his tweet.","6ab6b01d":"**The Statement \"I am the best programmer ever\" has a Polarity Score of 1.0 indicating a Positive Sentiment.**"}}
