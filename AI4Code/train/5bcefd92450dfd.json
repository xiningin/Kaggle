From there, you can try applying these methods to a new dataset and incorprating them into your own workflow!\n\nSee [Kaggle Datasets](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasets) for other datasets to try visualizing. The [World Food Facts data](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/openfoodfacts\/world-food-facts) is an especially rich one for visualization."}}
