It is used in the Logistic Regression also. We also know that the shape of the sigmoid function is like \"S\". In this notebook, I will plot a graph of a sigmoid function using numeric data. I will also plot a graph of it. Let's check is it \"S\" shaped or not?","ab9bae2f":"I will plot a graph of a sigmoid function by using matplotlib library of python."}}
