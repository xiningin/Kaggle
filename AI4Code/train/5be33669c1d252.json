It's also interesting to not that there appears to be more variance in Male suicides numbers over the years than Female.","a20ae981":"I will rename the columns in the dataset for my ease of use and understandment.","e0930edf":"There is one more important thing we must do before we can really show that this relationship between Male and Female rates is true. We must look at the population difference of our observations. If we found at that the populations of Men we obsereved is much larger than the populations of Females we observed. It would make sense why the Number of Suicides is much larger for Men. Lets look at a line plot of the average populations of Male and Female across the observed years...","22d1775b":"As you can see, there is no null data except for HDIForYear, which contains a lot of null data. Therefore I am gonna avoid using that column in my data exploration to make things easier on myself.","8b578f55":"As you can see, the number of observations is the same. Now we can begin our exploration.","7637f145":"Next, let's look at the relationship Sex has on suicide. Before we do this, we should make sure that the number of observations between Male and Female is the same. If we had much more observations on the male population, it would skew our data.

This is my first ever Kernel so please leave criticisms and advice. Thanks! I will start by importing the required packages, setting the style of plotting I want to use, and printing the columns contained in the dataset after reading it in.","7145c139":"This shows us that while the Russian Federation has the highest average number of suicides, Lithuania actually has the highest rate of Suicide, but due to it's low population, the number of suicides of low.","254f4ed0":"As this chart shows, Men make up over 75% of the population that commited suicide according to our dataset","0703570b":"Let's start by using a pie chart to examine the differences of the proportions Men and Women have on the overall number of suicides observed.","0b29d087":"It would be interesting to look into this relationship more and see if it changes with age. We can use Seaborns catplot, with age set for column.

The difference seems to be most prevelant during young and middleaged Men and Women.","16cf2e65":"Lets just start by looking at the top 10 countries with the highest average number of suicides.
