Let's use this dataset as an example to practice data reading.\n\n## About this Dataset\nContext: This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years of age of Pima Indian heritage.\n\nContent: The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\n\nWe have 768 rows and 9 columns. The first 8 columns represent the features and the last column represent the target\/label.","90c799d6":"As we can see above, All columns have the correct data type.\n"}}
