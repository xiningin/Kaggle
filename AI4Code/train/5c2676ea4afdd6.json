As the content we are going to analise is text we need first convert it into numeric values in order for our model to be able to process it. This is done by vectorizer algorithms that use different methods for comparing and weighing the relation between words in a single document and their relations in the whole corpus. They first collect all the unique words in a document(comment in our case) and build a dictionary of them and then vectorise each one giving it a specific weigth based on how much a word relates to a specific label within the whole corpus(the collection of all comments in our dataset).

A person can be either a male or a female.\n\n    Multiclass classification means a classification task with more than two classes; e.g., classify a set of people in different age groups. Multiclass classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label: a person can only be between 20 and 29 years old or 30 to 39 years old but not in both groups.\n    \n    Multilabel classification assigns to each sample a set of target labels. This can be thought as predicting properties of a data-point that are not mutually exclusive, such as topics that are relevant for a document. A text might be about any of religion, politics, finance or education at the same time or none of these.\n\nThere are two main methods for tackling a multi-label classification problem: problem transformation methods and algorithm adaptation methods.\nProblem transformation methods transform the multi-label problem into a set of binary classification problems, which can then be handled using single-class classifiers. They include OneVsRest and Binary Relevance techniques.\n\nWhereas algorithm adaptation methods adapt the algorithms to directly perform multi-label classification. In other words, rather than trying to convert the problem to a simpler problem, they try to address the problem in its full form. They include Classifier Chains, Label Powerset and Adapted Algorithm.","9d800a57":"We check the percentage of labeled and non-labeled comments","8a9f8cbf":"As it was a competition, to deter hand labeling, the test_set contains some comments which are not included \nin scoring.

In our case though, the StratifiedKFold does not suppport multi-label and using just KFold would not yeld any useful data splits. I decided to give it a try anyway to prove this or burst it. ","03b7f56b":"Running the pipeline with the suggested best parameters actually resulted in getting a better AUC accuracy.
