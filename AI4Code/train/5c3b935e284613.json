One important thing in this tutorial there is no point of me explaining each and every line of code, which is not needed here because python code is self-explanatory. However, I will try not to confuse you, and make things clear in an easy way. So I wrote this tutorial in such a way that everybody can understand irrespective of their programming background. Moreover, the entire source code can be found in my GitHub. There might be numerous tutorials available on the internet, but this tutorial is easy to understand because I have tried to explain the code as much as possible, some parts are a mechanical process, wherein you just have to follow them, just let me know if you have any doubt in the comments section down below.","b5bdb427":"![alt text](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/pluralsight\/guides\/master\/images\/310d6edd-b569-408a-a61d-f6d9a9a9eb61.png)","c4ac41c0":"Here we remove all the HTML tags and convert it to a text format, this can be done with the help of get_text method placed inside a for loop.
