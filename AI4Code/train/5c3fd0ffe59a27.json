It can tell you about your outliers and what their values are. \n\nMedian (Q2\/50th Percentile): the middle value of the dataset.\n\nFirst quartile (Q1\/25th Percentile): the middle number between the smallest number (not the \u201cminimum\u201d) and the median of the dataset.\n\nThird quartile (Q3\/75th Percentile): the middle value between the median and the highest value (not the \u201cmaximum\u201d) of the dataset.\n\nInter Quartile range (IQR): 25th to the 75th percentile.\nWhiskers (shown in above picture)\n\nOutliers (shown as circles in above picture)\n\n\u201cmaximum\u201d: Q3 + 1.5*IQR\n\n\u201cminimum\u201d: Q1 -1.5*IQR\n\n\nLet us take the example of titanic dataset to show a simple box plot","6c8da3e1":"<a id=\"62\"><\/a> <br>\n## <font color=\"blue\">2. Treating outliers as missing values\nThere are basically three methods for treating outliers in a data set. \n* Remove outliers as a means of trimming the data set. \n* Replacing the values of outliers or reducing the influence of outliers through outlier weight adjustments. \n* Estimate the values of outliers using robust techniques.","0c0cc2a0":"## 2.

Top \/ Bottom \/ Zero coding\n**Top or bottom coding** are also known as Winsorisation or outlier capping. The procedure involves capping the maximum and minimum values at a predefined value. This predefined value can be arbitrary, or it can be derived from the variable distribution.\n\nHow can we derive the maximum and minimum values? \n\nIf the variable is normally distributed we can cap the maximum and minimum values at the mean plus or minus 3 times the standard deviation. If the variable is skewed, we can use the inter-quantile range proximity rule or cap at the top and bottom percentiles.","ba555972":"So we have got around 144 outliers .Now its time to eliminate these outliers if we think the defined thresholds makes sense for us.\n\nLet us now remove the outliers","fa1980d2":"# 7. Feature Scaling <a id=\"7\"><\/a> <br> \n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/3316\/1*yR54MSI1jjnf2QeGtt57PA.png)\n**Feature scaling** in machine learning is one of the most critical steps during the pre-processing of data before creating a machine learning model. Scaling can make a difference between a weak machine learning model and a better one.\n\nThe most common techniques of feature scaling are Normalization and Standardization.\n\n**Normalisation**\n\nOne method utilised to bring all the variables to a more homogeneous scale is normalisation. Normalisation is synonym of centering the distribution. This means subtracting the mean of the variable to each observation. This procedure will \"center\" the new distribution at zero (the new mean of the variable will now be zero).\n\n**Standarisation**\n\nStandarisation is also used to bring all the variables to a similar scale. Standarisation means centering the variable at zero, and standarising the variance at 1. The procedure involves subtracting the mean of each observation and then dividing by the standard deviation:\n\nz = (x - x_mean) \/ std\n\n\n**Why do we need scaling?**\n\nMachine learning algorithm just sees number \u2014 if there is a vast difference in the range say few ranging in thousands and few ranging in the tens, and it makes the underlying assumption that higher ranging numbers have superiority of some sort. So these more significant number starts playing a more decisive role while training the model.\nThe machine learning algorithm works on numbers and does not know what that number represents. A weight of 10 grams and a price of 10 dollars represents completely two different things \u2014 which is a no brainer for humans, but for a model as a feature, it treats both as same.\n\nAnother reason why feature scaling is applied is that few algorithms like Neural network gradient descent converge much faster with feature scaling than without it.\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1200\/1*yi0VULDJmBfb1NaEikEciA.png)\n\nOne more reason is saturation, like in the case of sigmoid activation in Neural Network, scaling would help not to saturate too fast.\n\n**When to do scaling?**\n\nFeature scaling is essential for machine learning algorithms that calculate distances between data. If not scale, the feature with a higher value range starts dominating when calculating distances, as explained intuitively in the \u201cwhy?\u201d section.\n\nThe ML algorithm is sensitive to the \u201crelative scales of features,\u201d which usually happens when it uses the numeric values of the features rather than say their rank.\n\nIn many algorithms, when we desire faster convergence, scaling is a MUST like in Neural Network.\n\nSince the range of values of raw data varies widely, in some machine learning algorithms, objective functions do not work correctly without normalization. For example, the majority of classifiers calculate the distance between two points by the distance. If one of the features has a broad range of values, the distance governs this particular feature. Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the final distance.\n\nEven when the conditions, as mentioned above, are not satisfied, you may still need to rescale your features if the ML algorithm expects some scale or a saturation phenomenon can happen. Again, a neural network with saturating activation functions (e.g., sigmoid) is a good example.\n\nRule of thumb we may follow here is an algorithm that computes distance or assumes normality, scales your features.\nSome examples of algorithms where feature scaling matters are:\n\n* K-nearest neighbors (KNN) with a Euclidean distance measure is sensitive to magnitudes and hence should be scaled for all features to weigh in equally.\n* K-Means uses the Euclidean distance measure here feature scaling matters.\n* Scaling is critical while performing Principal Component Analysis(PCA). PCA tries to get the features with maximum variance, and the variance is high for high magnitude features and skews the PCA towards high magnitude features.\n* We can speed up gradient descent by scaling because \u03b8 descends quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and oscillates inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.\n\nAlgorithms that do not require normalization\/scaling are the ones that rely on rules. They would not be affected by any monotonic transformations of the variables. Scaling is a monotonic transformation. Examples of algorithms in this category are all the tree-based algorithms \u2014 CART, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. These algorithms utilize rules (series of inequalities) and do not require normalization.","b18f067b":"How does survival correlate with Age?\n\nWe can determine the relation between survival and Age by plotting the mean survival per Age.

Thus, Gaussian distributed variables may boost the machine learning algorithm performance.\n\nIf a variable is not normally distributed, sometimes it is possible to find a mathematical transformation so that the transformed variable is Gaussian.\n\nHow can we transform variables so that they follow a Gaussian distribution?\n\nThere are a few straightforward methods to transform variables so that they follow a Gaussian distribution.

But the loss of the data can be negated by this method which yields better results compared to removal of rows and columns. Replacing with the above three approximations are a statistical approach of handling the missing values. This method is also called as leaking the data while training.

Outlier Engineering<a id=\"6\"><\/a> <br>\n\n#### What is an Outlier?\n\nAn outlier is a data point in a data set that is distant from all other observations. A data point that lies outside the overall distribution of the dataset.\n\n#### Should outliers be removed?\nDepending on the context, outliers either deserve special attention or should be completely ignored. Take the example of revenue forecasting: if unusual spikes of revenue are observed, it's probably a good idea to pay extra attention to them and figure out what caused the spike. In the same way, an unusual transaction on a credit card is usually a sign of fraudulent activity, which is what the credit card issuer wants to prevent. So in instances like these, it is useful to look for and investigate further outlier values.\n\nIf outliers are however, due to mechanical error, measurement error or anything else that can't be generalised, it\u2019s a good idea to filter out these outliers before feeding the data to the modeling algorithm. \n\n#### What defines an outlier?\n* Data point that falls outside of 1.5 times of an interquartile range above the 3rd quartile and below the 1st quartile\n* Data point that falls outside of 3 standard deviations. we can use a z score and if the z score falls outside of 2 standard deviation\n\n#### Why do outliers exist in a dataset?\n* Variability in the data\n* An experimental measurement error\n\n#### Impact of an Outlier\n* It causes various problems during our statistical analysis\n* It may cause a significant impact on the mean and the standard deviation\n\n#### How to find an outlier?\nOutlier analysis and anomaly detection are a huge field of research devoted to optimise methods and create new algorithms to reliably identify outliers. There are a huge number of ways optimised to detect outliers in different situations. These are mostly targeted to identify outliers when those are the observations that we indeed want to focus on, for example for fraudulent credit card activity.\n\nUsing the following methods we can detect an outlier\n* IQR interquantile range\n* z score\n* Scatter plots\n* Box plot\n\n\nNow let us see how we can detect an outlier using the above methods and remove them where neccessary.

Birds play an essential role in nature. They are high up in the food chain and integrate changes occurring at lower levels. As such, birds are excellent indicators of deteriorating habitat quality and environmental pollution. However, it is often easier to hear birds than see them.\n\nWith proper sound detection and classification, researchers could automatically intuit factors about an area\u2019s quality of life based on a changing bird population.\n\nThere are already many projects underway to extensively monitor birds by continuously recording natural soundscapes over long periods. However, as many living and nonliving things make noise, the analysis of these datasets is often done manually by domain experts. These analyses are painstakingly slow, and results are often incomplete. Data science may be able to assist, so researchers have turned to large crowdsourced databases of focal recordings of birds to train AI models. Unfortunately, there is a domain mismatch between the training data (short recording of individual birds) and the soundscape recordings (long recordings with often multiple species calling at the same time) used in monitoring applications. This is one of the reasons why the performance of the currently used AI models has been subpar.\n\n### Objective\n\nTo identify a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings.

There might be anthropogenic sounds (e.g., airplane overflights) or other bird and non-bird (e.g., chipmunk) calls in the background, with a particular labeled bird species in the foreground. Bring new ideas to build effective detectors and classifiers for analyzing complex soundscape recordings.\n\nSo let us use the dataset of Cornell Lab of Ornithology\u2019s Center for Conservation Bioacoustics (CCB) to do a complete exploratory data analysis and finding the insights about data and based on the findings come up with AI model that can achieve the above objective.","3d652add":"## 3.

It is mostly up to what makes sense for the data, and it also depends on what you are trying to achieve.

If this is the case, it makes sense to substitute the missing values, by values extracted from the original variable distribution. \n* From a probabilistic point of view, values that are more frequent (like the mean or the median) will be selected more often (because there are more of them to select from), but other less frequent values will be selected as well. Thus, the variance of the variable is preserved. \n* The rationale is to replace the population of missing values with a population of values with the same distribution of the variable.\n\n**Advantages**\n* Easy to implement\n* Fast way of obtaining complete datasets\n* Preserves the variance of the variable\n\n**Limitations**\n* Randomness\n\nRandomness may not seem much of a concern when replacing missing values for data competitions, where the whole batch of missing values is replaced once and then the dataset is scored and that is the end of the problem. However, in business scenarios the situation is very different. \n\nReplacement of missing values by random sample, although similar in concept to replacement by the median or mean, is not as widely used in the data science community as the mean\/median imputation, presumably because of the element of randomness.However, it is a valid approach, with advantages over mean\/median imputation as it preserves the distribution of the variable.","41835cd4":"## M-estimator<a id=\"336\"><\/a> <br>\n\n**M-probability estimate of likelihood.**\n    This is a simplified version of target encoder, which goes under names like m-probability estimate or\n    additive smoothing with known incidence rates.

Therefore, both nominal and ordinal data are non-quantitative, which may mean a string of text or date. \n\n**What is Nominal Data? **\n\nNominal data is defined as data that is used for naming or labelling variables, without any quantitative value. It is sometimes called \u201cnamed\u201d data - a meaning coined from the word nominal. There is usually no intrinsic ordering to nominal data. For example, Race is a nominal variable having a number of categories, but there is no specific way to order from highest to lowest and vice versa.\n\n**What is Ordinal Data?  **\n\nOrdinal data is a type of categorical data with an order. The variables in ordinal data are listed in an ordered manner. The ordinal variables are usually numbered, so as to indicate the order of the list. However, the numbers are not mathematically measured or determined but are merely assigned as labels for opinions.\n\n\nNominal data is a group of non-parametric variables, while Ordinal data is a group of non-parametric ordered variables. Although, they are both non-parametric variables, what differentiates them is the fact that ordinal data is placed into some kind of order by their position.\n\n**For example, very hot, hot, cold, very cold, warm are all nominal data when considered individually. But when placed on a scale and arranged in a given order (very hot, hot, warm, cold, very cold), they are regarded as ordinal data.**\n\n\n**Cardinality:**\"Cardinality\" means the number of unique values in a column.\n\nFor nominal columns we use OneHotEncoder, Hashing, LeaveOneOut, and Target encoding. Avoid OneHot for high cardinality columns and decision tree-based algorithms.\n\nFor ordinal columns try Ordinal (Integer), Binary, OneHot, LeaveOneOut, and Target. Helmert, Sum, BackwardDifference and Polynomial are less likely to be helpful, but if you have time or theoretic reason you might want to try them.\n\n\n**Important Note** : We should classify data as one of seven types to make better models faster. Here are the seven data types:\n\n* Useless \u2014 useless for machine learning algorithms, that is \u2014 discrete\n* Nominal \u2014 groups without order \u2014 discrete\n* Binary \u2014 either\/or \u2014 discrete\n* Ordinal \u2014 groups with order \u2014 discrete\n* Count \u2014 the number of occurrences \u2014 discrete\n* Time \u2014 cyclical numbers with a temporal component \u2014 continuous\n* Interval \u2014 positive and\/or negative numbers without a temporal component \u2014 continuous\n\n\n**Classic Encoders**\nThe first group of five classic encoders can be seen on a continuum of embedding information in one column (Ordinal) up to k columns (OneHot). These are very useful encodings for machine learning practitioners to understand.\n\n* **OneHot** \u2014 one column for each value to compare vs. all other values. Nominal, ordinal.\n* **Binary** \u2014 convert each integer to binary digits. Each binary digit gets one column. Some info loss but fewer dimensions. Ordinal.\n* **Ordinal** \u2014 convert string labels to integer values 1 through k. Ordinal.\n* **BaseN** \u2014 Ordinal, Binary, or higher encoding. Nominal, ordinal. Doesn\u2019t add much functionality. Probably avoid.\n* **Hashing** \u2014 Like OneHot but fewer dimensions, some info loss due to collisions. Nominal, ordinal.\n* **Sum** \u2014 Just like OneHot except one value is held constant and encoded as -1 across all columns.\n\n**Contrast Encoders**\nThe five contrast encoders all have multiple issues that I argue make them unlikely to be useful for machine learning. They all output one column for each value found in a column. Their stated intents are below.\n\n* **Helmert (reverse)** \u2014 The mean of the dependent variable for a level is compared to the mean of the dependent variable over all previous levels.\n* **Backward Difference** \u2014 the mean of the dependent variable for a level is compared with the mean of the dependent variable for the prior level.\n* **Polynomial \u2014 orthogonal polynomial contrasts**. The coefficients taken on by polynomial coding for k=4 levels are the linear, quadratic, and cubic trends in the categorical variable.\n\n**Bayesian Encoders**\nThe Bayesian encoders use information from the dependent variable in their encodings. They output one column and can work well with high cardinality data.\n\n* Target \u2014 use the mean of the DV, must take steps to avoid overfitting\/ response leakage. Nominal, ordinal.

The IQR is the range between the 1st quartile (25th quantile) and the 3rd quartile (75th quantile).

Monotonic means that it increases constantly, or it decreases constantly.\n## Rare Label encoding<a id=\"333\"><\/a> <br>\n**Labels that occur rarely**\n\nCategorical variables are those which values are selected from a group of categories, also called labels. It is not unusual that different labels appear in  the dataset with different frequencies. Some categories may appear a lot in the dataset, whereas some other categories appear only in a few number of observations.\n\nConsider for example a dataset with information about loan applicants for the Lending Club data exercise where one of the variables is \"city where the applicant lives\". We can imagine that cities like 'New York' may appear a lot in the data set just because New York has a huge population. On the other hand, smaller towns like 'Leavenworth' will appear only on a few occasions (if at all, population < 2000 people), just because the population there is very small.\n\nCategorical variables in business datasets very often contain a few dominant labels that account for the majority of the observations and a large number of labels that appear only seldomly. \n\n**Are Rare Labels in a categorical variable a problem?**\n\nRare values can add a lot of information at the time of making an assessment or none at all. For example, consider a stockholder meeting where each person can vote in proportion to their number of shares. One of the shareholders owns 50% of the stock, and the other 999 shareholders own the remaining 50%. The outcome of the vote is largely influenced by the shareholder who holds the majority of the stock. The remaining shareholders may have an impact collectively, but they have virtually no impact individually. \n\nThe same occurs in real life datasets. The label that is over-represented in the dataset tends to dominate the outcome, and those that are under-represented may have no impact individually, but could have an impact if considered collectively.\n\nMore specifically,\n\n- Rare values in categorical variables tend to cause over-fitting, particularly in tree based methods.\n\n- A big number of infrequent labels adds noise, with little information, therefore causing over-fitting.\n\n- Rare labels may be present in training set, but not in test set, therefore causing over-fitting to the train set.\n\n- Rare labels may appear in the test set, and not in the train set. Thus, the machine learning model will not know how to evaluate it. \n\n\n**Note** Sometimes rare values, like outliers, are worth having a look at, in particular, when we are looking for rare instances (e.g., when the target is highly unbalanced). For example, if we are building a model to predict fraudulent applications, which are in essence rare, then a rare value in a certain variable, may be indeed important. This rare value could be telling us that the observation is most likely a fraudulent application, and therefore we would choose not to ignore it.\nSo, let's go ahead and see the effect of Rare Values in Categorical variables on Machine Learning models.","58560d56":"## 6.

The encoding algorithm is slightly different between training and test data set. For training data set, the record under consideration is left out, hence the name Leave One Out. The encoding is as follows for certain value of a certain categorical variable.\n\nci = (\u03a3j != i tj \/ (n \u2013 1 + R)) x (1 + \u03b5i)   where\nci = encoded value for ith record\ntj = target variable value for jth record\nn = number of records with the same categorical variable value\nR = regularization factor\n\u03b5i = zero mean random variable with normal distribution N(0, s)\n\nFor validation data or prediction data set, the definition is slightly different.

It\u2019s simpler definition is as below\n\nci = (\u03a3j tj \/ (n + R))    where\nci = encoded value for ith record\ntj = target variable value for jth record\nn = number of records with the same categorical variable value\nR = regularization factor\n\nFor validation data set, we don\u2019t leave the current record out. As we will see later, all the statistics about target variable for each value of each categorical variable as calculated for the training data set is saved and then used for validation and prediction data set.\n\nThe factor R acts as a regularizer. When the support is low for a particular value of variable i.e when n is low, then the encoded value is not reliable. Regularization factor R remedies the problem. It also ensures that the denominator is always positive for training data set.","8db56cab":" <a id=\"5\"><\/a> <br>\n# 5. Discretisation\n\n**Discretisation** refers to sorting the values of the variable into bins or intervals, also called buckets.

This process is also known as binning, with each bin being each interval.\n**\nDiscretisation methods fall into 2 categories: supervised and unsupervised. \n**\n**Unsupervised methods** do not use any information, other than the variable distribution, to create the contiguous bins in which the values will be placed. \n\n**Supervised methods** typically use target information in order to create the bins or intervals.\n\n**Unsupervised discretisation methods**\n\n* Equal width binning\n* Equal frequency binning\n\n**Supervised discretisation methods**\n\n* Discretisation using decision trees\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.python-course.eu\/images\/binning.png)\nData binning, which is also known as bucketing or discretization, is a technique used in data processing and statistics. Binning can be used for example, if there are more possible data points than observed data points. \n\nAn example is to bin the body heights of people into intervals or categories. Let us assume, we take the heights of 30 people. The length values can be between - roughly guessing - 1.30 metres to 2.50 metres. Theoretically, there are 120 different cm values possible, but we can have at most 30 different values from our sample group. One way to group them could be to put the measured values into bins ranging from 1.30 - 1.50 metres, 1.50 - 1.70 metres, 1.70 - 1.90 metres and so on. This means that the original data values, will be assigned to a bin into wich they fit according to their size. The original values will be replaced by values representing the corresponding intervals. \n\nBinning is a form of quantization.Bins do not necessarily have to be numerical, they can be categorical values of any kind, like \"dogs\", \"cats\", \"hamsters\", and so on.\n\nBinning is also used in image processing, binning. It can be used to reduce the amount of data, by combining neighboring pixel into single pixels. kxk binning reduces areas of k x k pixels into single pixel.\n","c6fd4ea5":"\nBy looking at the plot, we get an intuition that younger people (children) were more likely to survive (see higher survival rates at ages below 10 and 10-15).

Information Value (IV) is the measurement of that relationship\u2019s power. Based on its role, IV can be used as a base for attributes selection.\n![](https:\/\/image.slidesharecdn.com\/gcd-eda-190715044818\/95\/exploratory-data-analysis-on-german-credit-data-7-638.jpg?cb=1563166769)\n\nLogistic regression model is one of the most commonly used statistical technique for solving binary classification problem. It is acceptable in almost all the domains. These two concepts - **weight of evidence (WOE)** and **information value (IV) **evolved from the same logistic regression technique. These two terms have been in existence in credit scoring world for more than 4-5 decades. They have been used as a benchmark to screen variables in the credit risk modeling projects such as **probability of default**. They help to explore data and screen variables. It is also used in marketing analytics project such as customer attrition model, campaign response model etc.\n\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5cKHNKJ.jpg\">\n\n### Weight of Evidence (WOE)\n\nThe weight of evidence tells the predictive power of an independent variable in relation to the dependent variable.\n\nSince it evolved from credit scoring world, it is generally described as a measure of the separation of good and bad customers. \"Bad Customers\" refers to the customers who defaulted on a loan. and \"Good Customers\" refers to the customers who paid back loan.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hrTnEXv.jpg\">\n\nMany people do not understand the terms goods\/bads as they are from different background than the credit risk. It's good to understand the concept of WOE in terms of events and non-events. It is calculated by taking the natural logarithm (log to base e) of division of % of non-events and % of events.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dfosGgc.jpg\">\n\nWOE is typically used as part of the credit scorecard development .The development process consists of four main parts: variable transformations, model training using logistic regression, model validation, and scaling.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lbC7lfU.jpg\">\n\n### Variable Transformations\n\nIf you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything. A standard scorecard model, based on logistic regression, is an additive model; hence, special variable transformations are required. The commonly adopted transformations \u2013 fine classing, coarse classing, and either dummy coding or weight of evidence (WOE) transformation \u2013 form a sequential process providing a model outcome that is both easy to implement and explain to the business. Additionally, these transformations assist in converting non-linear relationships between independent variables and the dependent variable into a linear relationship \u2013 the customer behaviour often requested by the business.\n\n#### Fine classing\n\nApplied to all continuous variables and those discrete variables with high cardinality. This is the process of initial binning into typically between 20 and 50 fine granular bins.\n\n**To summarize create 10\/20 bins\/groups for a continuous independent variable and then calculates WOE and IV of the variable\n\n#### Coarse classing\n\nWhere a binning process is applied to the fine granular bins to merge those with similar risk and create fewer bins, usually up to ten. The purpose is to achieve simplicity by creating fewer bins, each with distinctively different risk factors while minimising the information loss. However, to create a robust model that is resilient to overfitting, each bin should contain a sufficient number of observations from the total account (5% is the minimum recommended by most practitioners). These opposing goals can be achieved through an optimisation in the form of optimal binning that maximises a variable\u2019s predictive power during the coarse classing process. Optimal binning utilises the same statistical measures used during variable selection, such as information value, Gini and chi-square statistics. The most popular measure is, again, information value, although combination of two or more measures is often beneficial. The missing values, if they contain predictive information, should be a separate class or merged to bin with similar risk factors.\n\n**To summarize combine adjacent categories with similar WOE scores\n\n#### Dummy coding\n\nThe process of creating binary (dummy) variables for all coarse classes except the reference class. This approach may present issues as the extra variables requires more memory and processing resources, and occasionally overfitting may arise because of the reduced degrees of freedom.\n\n#### Weight of evidence (WOE) transformation\n\nThe alternative, more favoured, approach to dummy coding that substitutes each coarse class with a risk value, and in turn collapses the risk values into a single numeric variable. The numeric variable describes the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable. The WOE framework is well suited for logistic regression modelling as both are based on log-odds calculation. In addition, WOE transformation standardises all independent variables, hence, the parameters in a subsequent logistic regression can be directly compared. \n\n**Weight of Evidence (WOE)** helps to transform a continuous independent variable into a set of groups or bins based on similarity of dependent variable distribution i.e. number of events and non-events.\n\n**For continuous independent variables** : First, create bins (categories \/ groups) for a continuous independent variable and then combine categories with similar WOE values and replace categories with WOE values. Use WOE values rather than input values in your model.\n\n**For categorical independent variables** : Combine categories with similar WOE and then create new categories of an independent variable with continuous WOE values. In other words, use WOE values rather than raw categories in your model. The transformed variable will be a continuous variable with WOE values. It is same as any continuous variable.\n\n#### Why combine categories with similar WOE?\n\nIt is because the categories with similar WOE have almost same proportion of events and non-events. In other words, the behavior of both the categories is same.\n\n#### Rules related to WOE\n- Each category (bin) should have at least 5% of the observations.\n- Each category (bin) should be non-zero for both non-events and events.\n- The WOE should be distinct for each category. Similar groups should be aggregated. \n- The WOE should be monotonic, i.e. either growing or decreasing with the groupings.\n- Missing values are binned separately.\n\n#### Number of Bins (Groups)\n\nIn general, 10 or 20 bins are taken. Ideally, each bin should contain at least 5% cases. The number of bins determines the amount of smoothing - the fewer bins, the more smoothing. If someone asks you ' \"why not to form 1000 bins?\" The answer is the fewer bins capture important patterns in the data, while leaving out noise. Bins with less than 5% cases might not be a true picture of the data distribution and might lead to model instability.\n\n#### Handle Zero Event\/ Non-Event\n\nIf a particular bin contains no event or non-event, you can use the formula below to ignore missing WOE. We are adding 0.5 to the number of events and non-events in a group.\n\nAdjustedWOE = ln (((Number of non-events in a group + 0.5) \/ Number of non-events)) \/ ((Number of events in a group + 0.5) \/ Number of events))\n\n\n#### How to check correct binning with WOE\n\n1. The WOE should be monotonic i.e. either growing or decreasing with the bins. You can plot WOE values and check linearity on the graph.\n\n2. Perform the WOE transformation after binning. Next, we run logistic regression with 1 independent variable having WOE values. If the slope is not 1 or the intercept is not ln(% of non-events \/ % of events) then the binning algorithm is not good.\n\nBoth dummy coding and WOE transformation give the similar results. The choice which one to use mainly depends on personal preferences.\n\nIn general optimal binning, dummy coding and weight of evidence transformation are, when carried out manually, time-consuming processes. \n\n**WOE Advantage**:\n\nThe advantages of WOE transformation are\n\n**1. Handles missing values**\n\n**2. Handles outliers**\n\n**3. The transformation is based on logarithmic value of distributions. This is aligned with the logistic regression output function**\n\n**4. No need for dummy variables**\n\n**5. By using proper binning technique, it can establish monotonic relationship (either increase or decrease) between the independent and dependent variable**\n\n**WOE Disadvantage**:\n\nThe  main disadvantage of WOE transformation is \n\n**-  in only considering the relative risk of each bin, without considering the proportion of accounts in each bin. The information value can be utilised instead to assess the relative contribution of each bin.**\n\n### Information Value (IV)\n\nInformation value is one of the most useful technique to select important variables in a predictive model. It helps to rank variables on the basis of their importance. The IV is calculated using the following formula :\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/r6ACeFN.jpg\">\n\n  ** IV statistic in credit scoring can be interpreted as follows. **\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cZx3taD.jpg\">\n \nIf the IV statistic is:\n\n- Less than 0.02, then the predictor is not useful for modeling (separating the Goods from the Bads)\n- 0.02 to 0.1, then the predictor has only a weak relationship to the Goods\/Bads odds ratio\n- 0.1 to 0.3, then the predictor has a medium strength relationship to the Goods\/Bads odds ratio\n- 0.3 to 0.5, then the predictor has a strong relationship to the Goods\/Bads odds ratio.\n- 0.5, suspicious relationship (Check once)\n\n#### Important Points\n\n- Information value increases as bins \/ groups increases for an independent variable. We have to be careful when there are more than **20 bins** as some bins may have a very few number of events and non-events.\n\n- Information value should not be used as a feature selection method when you are building a classification model other than binary logistic regression (for eg. random forest or SVM) as it's designed for binary logistic regression model only.","540cd0c8":"Define a binning function for categorical independent variables","8cf4e576":"There is more than one way of determining the lag at which the correlation is significant.

If we have a few categorical variables like this, we would end up with huge datasets. **Therefore, One Hot Encoder is not always the best option to encode categorical variables.**\n\n**If our datasets have a few multi-label variables, we will end up very soon with datasets with thousands of columns or more. And this may make training of our algorithms slow.**\n\nIn addition, many of these dummy variables may be similar to each other, since it is not unusual for 2 or more variables to share the same combinations of 1 and 0s.\n## Count and Frequency Encoder<a id=\"312\"><\/a> <br>\nAnother way to refer to variables that have a multitude of categories, is to call them variables with high cardinality.If a categorical variable contains multiple labels, then by re-encoding them using one hot encoding, we will expand the feature space dramatically.\n\nOne approach is to replace each label of the categorical variable by the count, this is the amount of times each label appears in the dataset .\nOr the frequency, this is the percentage of observations within that category. The 2 are equivalent.\n\n**Pros:**\n* Simple\n* Does not expand the feature space\n**Cons:**\n* If 2 labels appear the same amount of times in the dataset, that is, contain the same number of observations, they will be merged: may loose valuable information\n* Adds somewhat arbitrary numbers, and therefore weights to the different labels, that may not be related to their predictive power\n\nLet's see how this works:\n\t","0d525ad1":"In this case, by dividing Age into bins, we removed some of the noise plotted in the previous graph (a few cells ago) using the untransformed Age. Using the discrete variable Age, we observe as expected that children (<16) had the highest survival chance.\n\nWhat happens to older people is less clear from the discrete variable. It looks like people between 32-40 and 48-56 are more likely to survive, than people from 40-48. This might or might not be true and more research would be needed to determine if this was the case, what the reason behind it was. In addition, it looks like being extremely old, was very favourable for survival (look at the 72-80 bucket). However, most likely, these are consequences of an arbitrary binning strategy. There are very few people in the bucket 72-80, and thus, the fact that 1 of them survived inflates (overestimates) the survival rate for that bucket. And the same is true for the remaining of the bins, the lowest the amount of observations within buckets, the highest the risk of over or underestimating the target (survival in this case). So we begin to see some of the consequences of this binning strategy.\n\n## 2. Equal Frequency Discretisation<a id=\"52\"><\/a> <br>\n\nEqual frequency binning divides the scope of possible values of the variable into N bins, where each bin carries the same amount of observations. This is particularly useful for skewed variables as it spreads the observations over the different bins equally. Typically, we find the interval boundaries by determining the quantiles.\n\nEqual frequency discretisation using quantiles consists of dividing the continuous variable into N quantiles, N to be defined by the user. There is no rule of thumb to define N. However, if we think of the discrete variable as a categorical variable, where each bin is a category, we would like to keep N (the number of categories) low (typically no more than 10).\n\nEqual frequency binning is straightforward to implement and by spreading the values of the observations more evenly it may help boost the algorithm's performance. On the other hand, this arbitrary binning may also disrupt the relationship with the target on occasions. Therefore, whenever possible, it will bring value to examine whether this type of binning is the right strategy, and it will depend on the variable and the algorithm that we want to use to make the predictions.\n\nI will demonstrate how to perform equal frequency binning using the Titanic dataset.","3b7f1a02":"The reciprocal transformation was also not useful to transform Age into a variable normally distributed.\n\n## 3.

This is, instead of returning k-1 binary variables, they will return k, with the option in pandas of dropping the first binary variable and obtain k-1.\n\n**When should you use k and when k-1?**\n\nWhen the original variable is binary, that is, when the original variable has only 2 labels, then you should create one and only one binary variable.\nWhen the original variable has more than 2 labels, the following is important:\n\n**One hot encoding into k-1:**\n\nOne hot encoding into k-1 binary variables takes into account that we can use 1 less dimension and still represent the whole information: if the observation is 0 in all the binary variables, then it must be 1 in the final (removed) binary variable. As an example, for the variable gender encoded into male, if the observation is 0, then it has to be female. We do not need the additional female variable to explain that. \nOne hot encoding with k-1 binary variables should be used in linear regression, to keep the correct number of degrees of freedom (k-1). The linear regression has access to all of the features as it is being trained, and therefore examines altogether the whole set of dummy variables. This means that k-1 binary variables give the whole information about (represent completely) the original categorical variable to the linear regression.\nAnd the same is true for all machine learning algorithms that look at ALL the features at the same time during training. For example, support vector machines and neural networks as well. And clustering algorithms.\n\n**One hot encoding into k dummy variables**\n\nHowever, tree based models select at each iteration only a group of features to make a decision. This is to separate the data at each node. Therefore, the last category, the one that was removed in the one hot encoding into k-1 variables, would only be taken into account by those splits or even trees, that use the entire set of binary variables at a time. And this would rarely happen, because each split usually uses 1-3 features to make a decision. So, tree based methods will never consider that additional label, the one that was dropped. Thus, if the categorical variables will be used in a tree based learning algorithm, it is good practice to encode it into k binary variables instead of k-1.\nFinally, if you are planning to do feature selection, you will also need the entire set of binary variables (k) to let the machine learning model select which ones have the most predictive power.\n\nTo understand the above concept in detail let me show you by training a model on titanic data with **categorical variables re-encoded with One Hot Encoding.**","afcc2633":"#### Now let us visualise median and quantiles for Age feature.Below illustration shows 25%, 50% and 75% are nothing but 25th quantile, median and 75th quantile respectively","7e756ad6":"## 7.

The mean target value for the observed feature value `i`.\n        2. The mean target value (regardless of the feature value).\n    This can be written as::\n        JS_i = (1-B)*mean(y_i) + B*mean(y)\n    The question is, what should be the weight `B`?\n    If we put too much weight on the conditional mean value, we will overfit.\n    If we put too much weight on the global mean, we will underfit.\n    The canonical solution in machine learning is to perform cross-validation.\n    However, Charles Stein came with a closed-form solution to the problem.\n    The intuition is: If the estimate of `mean(y_i)` is unreliable (`y_i` has high variance),\n    we should put more weight on `mean(y)`. Stein put it into an equation as::\n        B = var(y_i) \/ (var(y_i)+var(y))\n    The only remaining issue is that we do not know `var(y)`, let alone `var(y_i)`.\n    Hence, we have to estimate the variances. But how can we reliably estimate the\n    variances, when we already struggle with the estimation of the mean values?!\n    There are multiple solutions:\n        1. If we have the same count of observations for each feature value `i` and all\n        `y_i` are close to each other, we can pretend that all `var(y_i)` are identical.\n        This is called a pooled model.\n        2. If the observation counts are not equal, it makes sense to replace the variances\n        with squared standard errors, which penalize small observation counts::\n            SE^2 = var(y)\/count(y)\n        This is called an independent model.\n    James-Stein estimator has, however, one practical limitation - it was defined\n    only for normal distributions. If you want to apply it for binary classification,\n    which allows only values {0, 1}, it is better to first convert the mean target value\n    from the bound interval <0,1> into an unbounded interval by replacing mean(y)\n    with log-odds ratio::\n        log-odds_ratio_i = log(mean(y_i)\/mean(y_not_i))\n    This is called binary model. The estimation of parameters of this model is, however,\n    tricky and sometimes it fails fatally. In these situations, it is better to use beta\n    model, which generally delivers slightly worse accuracy than binary model but does\n    not suffer from fatal failures.\n   \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    verbose: int\n        integer indicating verbosity of the output. 0 for none.\n    cols: list\n        a list of columns to encode, if None, all string columns will be encoded.\n    drop_invariant: bool\n        boolean for whether or not to drop encoded columns with 0 variance.\n    return_df: bool\n        boolean for whether to return a pandas DataFrame from transform (otherwise it will be a numpy array).\n    handle_missing: str\n        options are 'return_nan', 'error' and 'value', defaults to 'value', which returns the prior probability.\n    handle_unknown: str\n        options are 'return_nan', 'error' and 'value', defaults to 'value', which returns the prior probability.\n    model: str\n        options are 'pooled', 'beta', 'binary' and 'independent', defaults to 'independent'.\n    randomized: bool,\n        adds normal (Gaussian) distribution noise into training data in order to decrease overfitting (testing data are untouched).\n    sigma: float\n        standard deviation (spread or \"width\") of the normal distribution.","13f83707":"**Mode:** \n\nFor categorical feature we can select to fill in the missing values with the most common value(mode) as illustrated below.","dee2344a":"\nAs you can see above that we need only 1 of the 2 dummy variables to represent the original categorical variable Sex.

Instead, we want to flag that observation as different, and therefore we assign a value that is at the tail of the distribution, where observations are rarely represented in the population.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n* Easy to implement\n* Captures the importance of missingess if there is one\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n* Distorts the original distribution of the variable\n* If missingess is not important, it may mask the predictive power of the original variable by distorting its distribution\n* If the number of NA is big, it will mask true outliers in the distribution\n* If the number of NA is small, the replaced NA may be considered an outlier and pre-processed in a subsequent step of feature engineering\n\nThis method is used in finance companies. When capturing the financial history of customers, if some of the variables are missing, the company does not like to assume that missingness is random.

Typically this is because of the following reasons\n\n1. Corrupt data\n2. Failure to load information\n3. Incomplete extraction\n4. Noisy, and inconsistent\n5. Incomplete data\n\nSo it is an important task of a Data scientist to prepossess the data by filling missing values because making the right decision on how to handle it generates robust data models. It is important to be handled as they could lead to wrong prediction or classification for any given model being used. The goal of this article is to cover the basic techniques for handling missing values in a dataset.\n\nReal-world data often has missing values.\nFirstly we cannot simply ignore missing values in a dataset. We must handle them in some way for the very practical reason that most algorithms do not accept missing values.\n\n\"Common sense\" is not sensible here.From my experience the 2 most commonly recommended ways of dealing with missing data actually are not accurate .\n\nThey are:\n\n1. Dropping observations that have missing values\n2. Imputing the missing values based on other observations\n\nDropping missing values is sub-optimal because when we drop observations, we drop information.\n\nThe fact that the value was missing may be informative in itself.We need to understand business deeper to uncover why this information is missing in real world problems.In real time problems we need to make predictions even if some of the features are missing !!!.\n\n\nImputing missing values is sub-optimal because the value was originally missing but you filled it in, which always leads to a loss in information, no matter how sophisticated our imputation method is.\n\n\"<b>Missingness<\/b>\" is almost always informative in itself, and we should tell our algorithm if a value was missing.Even if we build a model to impute our values, we are not adding any real information. You\u2019re just reinforcing the patterns already provided by other features.\n\nBasically, **there are three categories of missing data**. We assume that each record or observation can be divided into an \"observable component\" and an \"unobservable component\". We also assume that the records are independent and identically distributed.\n\n1. **MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)** where the pattern of missinginess is statistically independent of the data record. Example: you have a data set on a piece of paper and you spill coffee on the paper destroying part of the data.\n\n2. **MAR (Missing At Random)** where the probability distribution of the pattern of missingness is functionally dependent upon the observable component in the record. MCAR is a special case of MAR. Example: you have a question on a survey asking if the survey participant is a drug addict and another question which asks if the survey participant has less than one alcoholic drink per year. Assume the answer to the alcoholic drink question is always observable, then the probability that someone fails to answer the drug addict question is most likely functionally dependent upon their answer to the alcoholic drink question.\n\n3. **MNAR (Missing Not at Random)** which is defined as the case which is NOT MAR. In the MNAR case, you can have situations where both the drug addict and alcoholic drink questions are absent in the same record. Another example, is a case where the question is: \"What is your gender?\" Suppose that females are less likely to answer this question than males. This is another example of an MNAR question because the probability that the answer is observable is conditionally dependent upon the unobservable component of the data record.\n\nNow that we know the basic terminology,I like to share some strategies and recommendations\n\n### Important Strategies:\n\n1. We should never insert mean, mode, median, max, min or anything else for missing values. That is, avoid deterministic imputation even though it is widely used and available in most software packages. It underestimates and distorts the statistical regularities (e.g., underestimates variance is one example) present in the data sample. \n\n2. If the data records are MCAR Then you can delete records with missing data.\n\n3. If the data records are MCAR, then sometimes you can stochastically impute the missing values rather than deterministically impute them. So this means that if you specify the marginal probability distribution of a missing value as Gaussian with some known mean and some known variance then you can sample from that distribution to impute values into the data set. We need to be careful and do some additional research  and analysis on data ,understand the business completely and take a judicious decision.\n\n4. If the data is MAR then an algorithm such as Expectation Maximization can be used to handle the missing observations.\n\n5. If the data is MNAR we can include binary indicators in the data record which explicitly identify when a variable is not observable. The challenge with this approach is that a highly nonlinear model needs to be designed to properly integrate this information in an appropriate manner. This might work in a machine learning algorithm where the binary indicators \"disconnect\" the influence of predictors which are not observable. Consequently, the MNAR theory (i.e., the theory of the joint distribution of the complete data record and missing data pattern) is instantiated in the learning machine's probabilistic model of its statistical environment.\n\n\n### Missing numeric data\n\nFor missing numeric data, we should flag and fill the values.\n\n1. Flag the observation with an indicator variable of missingness.\n2. Secondly fill the original missing value with 0 just to meet the technical requirement of no missing values.\n\nBy using this technique of flagging and filling, we are essentially allowing the algorithm to estimate the optimal constant for missingness, instead of just filling it in with the mean.\n\n### Missing categorical data\n\nThe best way to handle missing data for categorical features is to simply label them as \u2019Missing\u2019!\n\n1. We are essentially adding a new class for the feature.\n2. This tells the algorithm that the value was missing.\n3. This also gets around the technical requirement for no missing values.\n\n#### For detailed understanding of missing value treatment please visit my other kernel https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pavansanagapati\/simple-tutorial-how-to-handle-missing-data","836a5060":"## 1.
