There are pandas functions, for example mean(), that exclude NaN values by default; however, other numerical operations consider all values, including missing values, to perform those operations. This will lead to wrong results. Incorrect and invalid data will also result in wrong outcomes. For these reasons, it is vital to tackle these different types of data according to their case.\n\n# -Missing values (NaN values)\nLet's check the NaN values within the entire data frame.
