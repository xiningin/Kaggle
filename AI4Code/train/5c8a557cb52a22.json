The training set is available in the `train\/ folder`, with corresponding landmark labels in train.csv. The test set images are listed in the `test\/ folder`. **Each image has a unique id**. Since there are a large number of images, each image is placed within three subfolders according to the first three characters of the image id (i.e. image abcdef.jpg is placed in a\/b\/c\/abcdef.jpg).\n\n**This is a synchronous rerun code competition.** The provided test set is a representative set of files to demonstrate the format of the private test set. When you submit your notebook, Kaggle will rerun your code on the private dataset. Additionally, this competition also has two unique characteristics:\n\n* **To facilitate recognition-by-retrieval approaches, the private training set contains only a 100k subset of the total public training set.** This 100k subset contains all of the training set images associated with the landmarks in the private test set. You may still attach the full training set as an external data set if you wish.\n* **Submissions are given 12 hours to run, as compared to the site-wide session limit of 9 hours. While your commit must still finish in the 9 hour limit in order to be eligible to submit, the rerun may take the full 12 hours.**\n\n### Loading Libraries","0a90f40b":"### Images of class_id = 20409  (One of the most frequent)\n* Visually it is evident that most of the images are from ancient brick work or some kind of terracota.
