However, ultimately it boils down to a few key factors: total amount planted, the rate of yield, and the revenue per unit sold. It also depends on whether we are looking at the absolute value, or the most value per acre.\n\nThe most planted crops throughout the world are wheat and maize (corn). Rice and soybeans are other key staples. However, these are all relatively low yielding and do not make enough revenue per tonne of product produced.\n\nThe highest yielding crops are sugar cane, sugar beet, and tomatoes. Sugar cane accounts for about 80% of the world\u2019s sugar production, while sugar beet the remaining 20%.\n\nNot surprisingly, the most lucrative cash crops from a value per acre perspective are illegal in many parts of the world. With a higher risk to grow these, there is a higher reward for the farmers. Cannabis has a value of $47.7 million per square kilometre, while coca weighs in at $37.7 million and opium poppies $6 million per sq. km.\n\nThe most lucrative legal crops include tomatoes ($1.4 million per sq. km) and grapes ($625,000 per sq. km). Interestingly, tobacco comes in the middle of the pack with a value of $277,000 per sq. km. Rapeseed (also known as canola) comes in at $60,000 per sq. km.\n\nFrom an absolute value perspective, the world\u2019s most valuable cash crop is cannabis as well. It is followed by rice, maize, and then wheat.","6a2d4a73":"# Pandas Profiling"}}
