There are 60+ predictive modelling algorithms to choose from. We must understand the type of problem and solution requirement to narrow down to a select few models which we can evaluate. Our problem is a classification and regression problem. We want to identify relationship between output (Survived or not) with other variables or features (Gender, Age, Port...). We are also perfoming a category of machine learning which is called supervised learning as we are training our model with a given dataset. With these two criteria - Supervised Learning plus Classification and Regression, we can narrow down our choice of models to a few. These include:\n\n- Logistic Regression\n- KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors\n- Support Vector Machines\n- Naive Bayes classifier\n- Decision Tree\n- Random Forrest\n- Perceptron\n- Artificial neural network\n- RVM or Relevance Vector Machine","3d7aefa8":"## Acquire data\n\nThe Python Pandas packages helps us work with our datasets.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\n\n## Workflow stages\n\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\n\n1. Question or problem definition.\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\n7. Supply or submit the results.\n\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\n\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\n\n\n## Question and problem definition\n\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic).\n\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\n\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\n\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\n## Workflow goals\n\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\n\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https:\/\/en.wikiversity.org\/wiki\/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\n\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\n\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.","70d1d14f":"## Wrangle data\n\nWe have collected several assumptions and decisions regarding our datasets and solution requirements. So far we did not have to change a single feature or value to arrive at these. Let us now execute our decisions and assumptions for correcting, creating, and completing goals.\n\n### Correcting by dropping features\n\nThis is a good starting goal to execute. By dropping features we are dealing with fewer data points. Speeds up our notebook and eases the analysis.\n\nBased on our assumptions and decisions we want to drop the Cabin (correcting #2) and Ticket (correcting #1) features.\n\nNote that where applicable we perform operations on both training and testing datasets together to stay consistent.","06d8ff92":"We can replace many titles with a more common name or classify them as `Rare`.","b4cc235c":"Our submission to the competition site Kaggle results in scoring 3,883 of 6,082 competition entries.

Our training dataset has two missing values.

This can be done with numerical and categorical features which have numeric values.\n\n**Observations.**\n\n- Pclass=3 had most passengers, however most did not survive. Confirms our classifying assumption #2.\n- Infant passengers in Pclass=2 and Pclass=3 mostly survived. Further qualifies our classifying assumption #2.\n- Most passengers in Pclass=1 survived.

Alternatively several passengers shared a cabin.\n- Embarked takes three possible values.

These are candidates for correcting goal.\n\n- Ticket is a mix of numeric and alphanumeric data types. Cabin is alphanumeric.\n\n**Which features may contain errors or typos?**\n\nThis is harder to review for a large dataset, however reviewing a few samples from a smaller dataset may just tell us outright, which features may require correcting.\n\n- Name feature may contain errors or typos as there are several ways used to describe a name including titles, round brackets, and quotes used for alternative or short names.","dc9c021e":"We can use Logistic Regression to validate our assumptions and decisions for feature creating and completing goals. This can be done by calculating the coefficient of the features in the decision function.\n\nPositive coefficients increase the log-odds of the response (and thus increase the probability), and negative coefficients decrease the log-odds of the response (and thus decrease the probability).\n\n- Sex is highest positivie coefficient, implying as the Sex value increases (male: 0 to female: 1), the probability of Survived=1 increases the most.\n- Inversely as Pclass increases, probability of Survived=1 decreases the most.\n- This way Age*Class is a good artificial feature to model as it has second highest negative correlation with Survived.\n- So is Title as second highest positive correlation.","b6332613":"We can not create FareBand.","15582c58":"**Which features are categorical?**\n\nThese values classify the samples into sets of similar samples.

Ordinal: Pclass.\n\n**Which features are numerical?**\n\nWhich features are numerical? These values change from sample to sample. Within numerical features are the values discrete, continuous, or timeseries based? Among other things this helps us select the appropriate plots for visualization.\n\n- Continous: Age, Fare.
