Wine predicted to have poor quality is cheap, and wine predicted to have great quality is expensive.** Then one of my biggest concerns is that the poor quality wine are being misclassified as great and thus priced expensive, which may lead to customer complaints.

For each class k, there is a vector of parameters $\\vec{\\theta}_k$. The softmax score for a sample $\\vec{x}$ is $s_k(\\vec{x})=\\vec{\\theta}_k^T \\cdot \\vec{x}$. The probability of sample $\\vec{x}$ being in class k is:  <br\/>\n<center>\n$\\hat{p}_k=\\sigma(\\vec{s}(\\vec{x}))_k=\\frac{exp(s_k(\\vec{x}))}{\\sum_{j=1}^K exp(s_j(\\vec{x}))}$\n<\/center>\nWhere $K$ is the total number of possible classes. The $\\sigma (\\vec{s})$ function is called a softmax function. Softmax regression takes the class that has the highest probability $\\hat{p}$ as the predicted class. <br\/>\nWhile training, the cost function is the **cross entropy**:\n<center>\n$J(\\mathbf{\\Theta})=-\\frac{1}{m}\\sum^{m}_{i=1}\\sum^{K}_{k=1}y_k^{(i)}log(\\hat{p}_k^{(i)})$\n<\/center>\nWhere $y_k^{(i)}=1$ if sample i belongs to class k, and $y_k^{(i)}=0$ otherwise.
