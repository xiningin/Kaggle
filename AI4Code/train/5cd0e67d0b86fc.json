In this version there is one player (who you'll control) and a dealer. Play proceeds as follows:\n\n- The player is dealt two face-up cards. The dealer is dealt one face-up card.\n- The player may ask to be dealt another card ('hit') as many times as they wish. If the sum of their cards exceeds 21, they lose the round immediately.\n- The dealer then deals additional cards to himself until either:\n    - the sum of the dealer's cards exceeds 21, in which case the player wins the round\n    - the sum of the dealer's cards is greater than or equal to 17. If the player's total is greater than the dealer's, the player wins. Otherwise, the dealer wins (even in case of a tie).\n    \nWhen calculating the sum of cards, Jack, Queen, and King count for 10. Aces can count as 1 or 11 (when referring to a player's \"total\" above, we mean the largest total that can be made without exceeding 21. So e.g. A+8 = 19, A+8+8 = 17)\n\nFor this problem, you'll write a function representing the player's decision-making strategy in this game. We've provided a very unintelligent implementation below:","b91a4862":"## 3. <span title=\"A bit spicy\" style=\"color: darkgreen \">\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f<\/span>\n\nIn the main lesson we talked about deciding whether we're prepared for the weather. I said that I'm safe from today's weather if...\n- I have an umbrella...\n- or if the rain isn't too heavy and I have a hood...\n- otherwise, I'm still fine unless it's raining *and* it's a workday\n\nThe function below uses our first attempt at turning this logic into a Python expression. I claimed that there was a bug in that code. Can you find it?\n\nTo prove that `prepared_for_weather` is buggy, come up with a set of inputs where it returns the wrong answer.","881fab8b":"This very conservative agent *always* sticks with the hand of two cards that they're dealt.\n\nWe'll be simulating games between your player agent and our own dealer agent by calling your function.\n\nTry running the function below to see an example of a simulated game:","d7b2f5c0":"# Keep Going\n\nLearn about **[lists and tuples](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/colinmorris\/lists)** to handle multiple items of data in a systematic way.","a33f79e2":"Our dumb agent that completely ignores the game state still manages to win shockingly often!\n\nTry adding some more smarts to the `should_hit` function and see how it affects the results.","de5f8a9f":"## 2.\n\nWe've decided to add \"logging\" to our `to_smash` function from the previous exercise.","183cdbed":"# Try It Yourself\n\nThink you are ready to use Booleans and Conditionals?
