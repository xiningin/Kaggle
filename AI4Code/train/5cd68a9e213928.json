impact on the survival status.\n\n\n- Number of positive Auxilary nodes seems to be a key feature. \n\n\n- If the number is less than 10, chances of survival seems to be very high.(_from Plot : Total data - Age\/Op. year vs Nodes_)\n\n\n- It can observed that patients of age around 50 (40-60) years , seems to have more nodes than other age groups (_from Plot : Total data - Age vs Nodes_)\n\n\n- Patients around age 50, with more nodes seems to have less chances of survival. (_from Plot : Not survived After 5 years : Age vs Nodes_)\n\n\n\n- It is peculiar to note that operations have been more successful around 1960 than that of 1965. (_from Plots : Age vs Op. year_ ) \n\n       - It could also be because patients with more postive nodes are from around 1965 as can be seen from plots of Op.year vs Nodes\n\n","dabaccf6":"### Bivariate Analysis","831a4efe":"#### Observations\n\n- We can see age and operation_year have a spread of about 10.8 and 3.2 respectively. And the quantiles show they are almost regularly spaced.\n\n\n- For aux_nodes, we can see that it is affected by outliers. \n\n\n    - From percentiles, we can see that last 2% is more than double that of 98%. \n    \n    \n    - Upto 44 percentile that datapoints are zeros\n\n\n    - Also Standard deviation of the aux_nodes is more due to affect of outliers, Median abs deviation(MAD) is low which implies we have very few outliers. \n    \n> Refresher : In the standard deviation, the distances from the mean are squared, so large deviations are weighted more heavily, and thus outliers can heavily influence it. In the MAD, the deviations of a small number of outliers are irrelevant. \n","d883e3e5":"### Statistical Analysis\n","bd03a28e":"### Initial Observations","2c32eeab":"### Univariate analysis","cc8cddbc":"** As part of my course work for Applied AI course","b17bdcd2":"### Conclusions\n\n- Dataset is imbalanced and should be taken care (more skewed towards survived)\n\n\n- No. of positive auxilary nodes seems to be a key feature, but it is affected by outliers\n\n\n- People with less positive auxilary nodes seems high chances of survival.\n\n\n- People around age 40-60 are likely to have more positive auxilary nodes, and therefore less likely to survive.\n\n\n- Operations done around 1965 have more non survival rates.It should also noted that the people have more positive auxilary nodes around same time.","304393f8":"#### Observations\n\n- We have total of 306 datapoints and 3 independent features namely - age, year, node\n\n\n- It is a classificaiton problem. Our objective is to determine 'status' feature value\n\n\n- With almost 3\/4 of the datapoints are from same status class, We can take that data is skewed\n\n\n- There are no null values or any decimal values. All the features including target is given as integer values.\n","950c445e":"#### Observations\n\n- age seems to follow normal distribution.\n\n\n- Auxilary nodes are very highly concentrated at 0 as can been seen from histograms. From CDF we can see that there is a very steep increase at around 0 and saturation after 20\n\n\n- It can be observed that survival rate is more if auxilary nodes are less than 10\n\n\n- People aged around 40-50 have have little chance of surviving\n\n\n- Operations done around year '65 seems to have high non survival rates"}}
