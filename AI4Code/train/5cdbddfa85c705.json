It looks much better to have it as a seperate feature.","9f4bab9c":"## Feature Engineering\nFeature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. For example we are extracting titles from names and see the relations with other data points if it is significant then we can think about adding them as a seperate feature. Also machine learning algorithms can only deal with numbers as long as we're not talking about sequence models, so we'll fix categorical and test based featured as well.\n\nNote: I have applied the same feature engineering to the test data as well otherwise we'll have a feature mismatch while making prediction.","641fa674":"Whoa, a staggering number of females have survived compared to men, which can only mean women and children were given higher preference to get into life boats.","3e448346":"There 4 graphs again reiterate the same fact in much more detail.","10482a85":"Here it looks like passengers from Cherbourg have had the highest chance of survival when compared to Queenstown and Southamptom.","4c96c4b0":"## Loading the Data\nThe first step in any Dat Science workflow is to load the data. It's commonly done using pandas's `pd.read_csv` function. It is also one of the most used functions in Data Science.","e083c4e9":"One interesting observation from the above graph is how Passenger class and their survival are correlated.","7b407794":"### Multi-Layer Perceptron","54766856":"Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that uses predictions from multiple models to build a new model. This model is used for making predictions on the test set. We pick some of the best performing models to be the first layer of the stack while XGB is set at layer 2 to make the final prediction. We use a package called **vecstack** to implement model stacking.  It's actually very easy to use, you can have a look at the [documentation](https:\/\/github.com\/vecxoz\/vecstack) for more information.","3514b05d":"Here it's clear that people with more number of siblings\/spouse onboard had a lesser chance of survival. And people who were alone also had relatively low chances of survival. ","733caaa5":"## Submission Files\nI'm leaving you to play around with this kernel to improve this even further. This is just for illustration purposes still this kernel can score 79\/80 on the public Lb as I've tested. However if you're a leaderboard pixie and want to climb the LB to have some fun (let's accept as beginners we all wanted that), I'm giving you my Personal Best submission file as well.","9c3e3be4":"## Predictions\nNow it is finally time to make predictions on the real world test data. The approach here might look strange to you. You can visit [this link](https:\/\/github.com\/vecxoz\/vecstack\/issues\/4) to understand how it is done.","650fcd66":"We can see clearly that the youth have survived more than elderly men, and they've also lost more lives which means there were more youths onboard. ","d0f94861":"## Model Stacking","355cde16":"More people from unknown cabin have lost their lives, while B, D, and E have the highest survival probability.","fe1a3bc4":"We can see only about 4 titles repeating often so we keep them and name all the others \"rare\"","70463601":"## Fixing Missing Values\nEverything will be pretty much intuitive here except for the way I'm dealing the cabin feature of our data. When a ship sinks and if you're inside, the most important thing that decides whether you live or you die is the cabin you're in. And cabin data is largely unknown. For this reason I havn't imputed cabin's values with the most frequently occuring value, instead we keep unknown cabins as a seperate value as you'll see.","6a1be3a7":"As we have seen before larger families and lone passengers have the least chance of survival.","249efff0":"### Logistic Regression","572c9263":"### Support Vector Machine Classifier","a2bd6031":"We can see a lot of missing values these, we'll go on to fix them later. Before I get started I always like to drop the outliers in the data, if there aren't many of course.","cd18293c":"### If you like this kernel and you've made it so far please give an UPVOTE to show your appreciation.\n\n### **Authored By:**\n[Abhinand](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abhinand05)","13a17f42":"Most people from Southamptom belong to class 3 that's why they have the lowest chances of survival. When you look at Cherbourg there are very less people but most of them are higher class passengers while Queenstown have mostly lower class passengers.","173dad22":"## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nIn statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. We're going to do exactly that in this section, get ready for some cool visualizations.","a8501078":"## Introduction\nThis tutorial is for people who are relatively new to machine learning. I'll get you through all the steps from importing the data to making predictions on the test set. I don't think there is a better way to start machine learning than from the Titanic Survival Prediction Challenge here on Kaggle. It is the first thing you should be able to solve on your own after learning ML. When I first started out I didn't do all that well, infact my first submission scored only 0.36, more than anything I didn't know what to do even after knowing what pandas, sklearn etc.. was all about. If you're in a similar position then it is for you too. If you read through the code you must be able to understand what I'm doing and how it must be done. And don't expect every ML problem to be as simple as this one, this is just to get you started. Anyways what you learn from this notebook may be applicable to some other real-world problems as well. Let's get started. \n\nAnd one more thing,\n\n#### If you find the kernel useful or cool please give an UPVOTE to show your appreciation. \n(I'm sure this kernel would be a lot helpful for beginners)","52ab95d2":"That tiny spike on the left handside shows that more young kids on board survived. I'll leave the rest to you.","60f577a3":"### Linear Discriminant Analysis","745909a3":"### Performance","a59eda36":"Boys, Girls and Women have higher chance of survival where the men have the lowest. Which again makes sense.","948432b0":"## Building, Training and Validating our Models\nThis is where real Machine Learning is done. There must be one thing which must be pretty clear to you now. Machine Learning needs Data Science skills as well. Without the above steps we can't build an accurate model. \n\nI've tuned the hyperparameter based on previous experience, you might have to try and a lot of variables to pick the best performing set of parameters or use something like GridSearchCV.","62a5a279":"### LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting)","89099aa5":"## Detecting and Fixing Outliers\nI wrote a function here to detect outliers. Feel free to use this fuction for your other projects as well. Honestly, we don't always keep writing the same functions over and over again for all projects, we write once and copy if it is ever needed again.","a337dac9":"### If you like this kernel please consider giving it an UPVOTE.","c090330e":"No surprise, first class passengers have survived more than the rest. Unfortunately lower class passengers mostly didn't make it.","fc4f24cd":"### XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)"}}
