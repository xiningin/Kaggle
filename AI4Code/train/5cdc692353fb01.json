machine learning methods but researchers have renewed efforts to update it and develop drop-in replacements that are more challenging for computer vision and original for real-world applications. As noted in one recent replacement called the Fashion-MNIST dataset, the Zalando researchers quoted the startling claim that \"Most pairs of MNIST digits (784 total pixels per sample) can be distinguished pretty well by just one pixel\". To stimulate the community to develop more drop-in replacements, the Sign Language MNIST is presented here and follows the same CSV format with labels and pixel values in single rows. The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion).","61b660a2":"We are droping the label coloumn from the training set","1611e47e":"For deep learning i am using keras library","21093f89":"Each letter indicates a sign produced by our fingers.
