provided did not have enough information for our scope of research of the buildings' utilities and functions. This affected the accuracy of results found and the team had to create certain reasonable assumptions for further analysis. From this lack of information, the team was also unable to deduce the size of each building's rooftop where the green roofs will be implemented. Certain buildings may have different utilities whereby the area stated in the data set is not the actual measurement of the rooftop space. This variable affects the size of green roofs to be implemented, resulting in a different savings amount of chilled water consumption.\n\nAdditionally, the year selected for the hottest temperature in the regions was 2016. However, updated research found that the hottest temperature recorded was in fact 2020. The team utilised 2016 for research as 2020's data was not available in the open data set, and 2016 was the second hottest year to be recorded historically. \n\n**Future Work**\n\nThe next step from our research onwards can include the simulation of green roofs to find out the actual visualisation of these buildings and a further in-depth breakdown of the potential energy savings. The models and methods available consist of white box and black box testing.\n\nWhite Box testing can be used to focus on the code structures, branches, paths, and various conditions. This method checks the internal functioning of the system and software to simulate respective variables of the business idea. Algorithm testing can be utilised here with the inclusion of automation as well. In this case, further programming can be enhanced to see the changes in different paths or conditions set. A wide and deep knowledge of programming is required here for accurate implementation of green roof simulation.\n\nAs for Black Box testing, it is of a higher-level testing as compared to White Box testing. This method of testing focuses on the behaviour of the software from an external or end-user perspective. It can be applied to virtually every level of software testing: unit, integration, system, and acceptance. Additionally, it is not as time-consuming as White Box testing, and the methodology is data-driven with functional testing. External expectations of this model should be laid out for the green roof simulation, along with the requirement specifications. Raw data from the open data set can be used for this method of testing and its regression can also be determined from these.\n\nOur AI department may extend further research to determine the viability and feasibility of the implementation of green roofs on their buildings. They may weigh the initial costs to potential long-term savings from chilled water consumption, contributing to the overall energy consumption of the building. Potential researchers may also delve into other aspects of building energy from the intervention of these green roofs.","5f4b90a6":"After resampling the data, we see that there is a similar trend between the weekday and weekend plots with increasing energy usage as the temperature increases. While weekday energy usage was higher than on weekdays, it was only marginally higher and hence having a green roof will have a great impact on both weekends and weekdays. This will make the investment for our client worthwhile, and is a strategy that can be adopted to convince the client. ","bd896c76":"As seen from the plots, cooling energy usage is consistent among all the seasons and hence academic seasons are not a confounder in cooling energy usage patterns. However, as a sanity check we will also look at the cooling energy usage during the winter break. The steeper the line (for temperature change to consumption), the more effect there is of the greenroof from the increase in temperature. The company would be able to make a stronger pitch to these buildings because only a slight temperature increase can cause a much higher cooling energy consumption. These buildings are the ones that need alternatives (such as green roofs) to help mitigate cooling energy consumption costs.\n","bc31b591":"By sorting the values, we have identified Fox_utility_Marian to be the building that consumes the highest energy for chilled water. \nSorting values will give us the buildings that have the highest consumption in descending order. However, it is necessary to note that identifying the target building by its consumption is not enough.\nTo successfully implement a greenroof, we also need to know how much roof space is available for use, as it might already be filled with other utilities. This makes the sqm measurement less useful as that is not an indicator of the available roof space. \n\nIn addition, the primary space usage of the building is another factor to be considered. As Fox_utility_Marian is a central plant, we are making assumption that the large energy taken by this building was for the purpose of supplying chilled water to the buildings in its vicinity. While it is still viable to propose a greenroof for a central plant building, it would make more sense to propose the greenroof on a user building. Hence, **Fox_lodging_Wallace** was chosen as our main target building as it is next in line on chilled water consumption.","56847496":"By grouping the sites together using their site id, and churning out the max value of each of the columns, this helps to identify the hottest recorded airtemperature of the different sites in 2016.\nThe mean and median value of the air temperature was also churned out as a higher mean temperature also means that the site is on the warmer side most of the time.","cd6a573f":"Our client may argue that usage patterns are different on weekdays and weekends, with students only returning to their lodging at night on weekdays after lessons hence a possible irregular pattern. Meanwhile weekends may have much higher usage as students stay in their lodging. \n\nHowever, we think that energy usage will even out due to the fact students do not have lessons everyday and students may still want to stay in their lodging on weekends. The code below is to investigate whether the day being a weekday or weekend is a confounder and to prove to our clients that the green roof will be a worthwhile investment. ","d4e01037":"In trying to find the suitable building to pitch the greenroof business idea to, these are the considerations:\n1. The hottest region (in terms of reaching the highest temperature recorded). This is to ensure that the greenroofs implemented can withstand the hottest and harshest environment. \n2. The building that uses the highest cooling energy consumption. This is so that a more drastic improvement can be seen by the prospective client, which can significantly boost the sign-on rate for the greenroofs. Starting with a building that uses the highest cooling energy consumption can also help to reduce more energy consumption in relation to other buildings that use lesser energy. ","6fd6cab7":"The general idea of sorting the weather was to first know what was recorded in the weather data. The 'airTemperature' was deemed to be suitable to find the hottest region.","4592c322":"This next part of the report will be deeper analysis into Fox_loding_wallace. Taking reference from Fu Chun's notebook (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/patrick0302\/explorative-data-analysis) we will be making regression plots to find out possible confounders in energy consumption in the building. The team will plot the potential confounders namely energy usage during weekend\/weekdays and different seasons against temperature","0437a484":"**Air Temperature**\n\n2020 was one of the hottest years in recorded history, according to data released by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). By NASA\u2019s reckoning, it tied with 2016 for the hottest year in the books, while NOAA placed it second.\n\nIn 2016, the contiguous United States (CONUS) average temperature was 54.9\u00b0F (12.7\u00b0C).\n\nThe year started with one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1os on record ushering in Pacific moisture and much needed drought relief to parts of the West, in the form of high elevation snowpack and valley rains. Abnormal warmth in the late winter\/early spring period prematurely melted some of the early season snowpack gains across the Sierra. Therefore, exceptional drought conditions remained throughout the year much of the West, and California in particular (National Centers for Environmental Information, 2017).\n\nNational Centers for Environmental Information.

Based on the accompanying published documentation, 'Fox' is located in Tempe, Arizona. Tempe experiences a desert climate with a higher degree of diurnal temperature variation. Knowing this will allow the company to plan the type of greenroof (what kind of plants, irrigation system, etc) to use and propose to the prospective client.  \n\nThe next step would be to look into the chilled water data of buildings that are located in 'Fox'.\n\nThe chilled water data will need to be normalised using the floor area for a fairer comparison between the buildings when finding the building with the highest consumption.\nThe total consumption will be used as indicator for the highest consumption.

Within each semester they were further split into 3 terms (A, B and C.) The investigation we took the start date of term A and the end date of term C for all 3 semester since lessons were ongoing in all 3 terms. \n\nFour separate academic seasons we will be using are:\n* Spring Classes: 2016-01-11 to 2016-04-29\n* Summer Classes: 2016-05-16 to 2016-08-09\n* Fall Class: 2016-08-18 to 2016-12-02\n* Winter Break: 2016-12-03 to 2017-01-09\n\nBy looking at the relationship of usage and weather pattern in each academic season,this helps us to see if the academic seasons are confounders of the chilled water consumption.\n\nThe team thus builds on Fu Chun's Notebook (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/patrick0302\/explorative-data-analysis) which focused on weekday and weekday data difference to resample the data into daily data by their dates and plot the regression table based on academic seasons. ","391482ec":"**Literature Review:**\n\nGreen roofs have several environmental benefits, such as improving building energy efficiency. The simulations on conventional and green roofs in a temperate French climate suggest that green roofs are thermally beneficial for hot, temperate, and cold European climates (Jaffal et al., 2012). In the study, the impact of the green roofs on indoor air temperature and cooling and heating demand was analyzed. With a green roof, the summer indoor air temperature was decreased by 2 \u00b0C, and the annual energy demand was reduced by 6%.\n\nGreen roofs help improve storm water management, as well as reduce air pollution, and noise. They also increase vegetal and animal biodiversity in cities, and reduce a city\u2019s carbon footprint by converting carbon dioxide to oxygen through photosynthesis. They are able to improve building energy efficiency by enhancing the heat transfer through the roofs. At the city level, green roofs contribute to the mitigation of the urban heat island effect. The reduction of the summer temperature around green roofs improves the efficiency of HVAC systems by providing a local free cooling effect to the fluid before it returns to the chiller (Jaffal et al., 2012). A passive cooling effect was observed in the summer, and the daily heat losses through the roof were increased by nearly a factor of three with a green roof. This cooling makes green roofs an effective solution for the enhancement of thermal comfort and the reduction of cooling demand.\n\nThe enhancement of thermal comfort and reduction of cooling demand are more effective when the climate is hot. However, a significant reduction of the heating demand can be observed in cold climates. For hot climates, green roofs can increase the heating demand, but this increase is still minor when compared with the cooling demand reduction. The total energy demand decreases with green roofs in hot, temperate and cold climates. This general improvement makes them an energy-efficient solution for a wide range of European climates.\n\nGHG impacts are dominated by the material production and use phases. Energy impacts are dominated by the use phase, with urban heat island (UHI) impacts being an order of magnitude higher than direct building impacts. The quantification of private and social costs and benefits should help guide green roof policy (Blackhurst et al., 2010).\n\nJaffal, I., Ouldboukhitine, S. E., & Belarbi, R. (2012).
