In an ensemble model, all classifiers (algorithms) are able to estimate class probabilities (i.e., they all have predict_proba() method), then we can specify Scikit-Learn to predict the class with the highest probability, averaged over all the individual classifiers. In a voting classifier setting the voting parameter to 'soft' enables the models to calculate their probability(also known as confidence score) individually and present it to the voting classifier, then the voting classifier averages them and outputs the class with the highest probability. If average probablity of class-1 is greater than class-0, it outputs predicted class is 1 otherwise 0. \n\n**Note:** This soft-voting classifier often work better than hard-voting as it gives more weight to highly confident votes. We Need to specify voting=\u201dsoft\u201d and ensure that all classifiers can estimate class probabilities. One algorithm where we need to be careful is SVC, by default SVC will not give probabilities, we have to specify 'probability' hyperparameter to True.\nSee the table below to understand how soft voting ensemble works.","47848e69":"### 8.1.1 Fare & Survived <a id=\"8.1.1\"><\/a>","df817939":"**Findings:** Bagging can't beat our best base learners.\n\n#### 14.1.2.2 Boosting  <a id=\"14.5\"><\/a>\nBoosting refers to any Ensemble method that can combine several weak learners into a strong learner.

By now, we should have a good idea about the distribution of the variables and the presence of outliers in those variables. For categorical variables mode-imputation is performed and for numerical variable mean-impuation is performed if its distribution is symmetric(or almost symmetric or normal like Age). On the other hand, for a variable with skewed distribution and outliers (like Fare), meadian-imputation is recommended as median is more immune to outliers than mean. \n\nHowever, one clear disadvantage of using mean, median or mode to impute missing values is the addition of bias if the amount of missing values is significant (like Age). So simply replacing them with the mean or the median age might not be the best solution since the age may differ by groups and categories of passengers.\n\nTo solve this, we can group our data by some variables that have no missing values and for each subset compute the median age to impute the missing values. Or we can build a linear regression model that will predict missing values of Age using the features that have no missing values. These two methods may result in better accuracy without high bias, unless a missing value is expected to have a very high variance. We will show the former method of imputation.","bf3eda02":"## 10.4 Encoding Categorical Variables <a id=\"10.4\"><\/a>\nWe would like to use one hot encoding instead of label encoding because algorithm might give weights to higher values if label encoding is used to encode numeric variables.","015cb916":"**Looking at this plot, one thing we can say that a linear decision boundary will not be a good choice to separate these two classes.

In machine learning, visualizing 2 or 3 dimensional data is not that challenging. But we have 47 dimensions (47 input features). That's way too much to visualize. So we need to reduce the dimensionality- may be into 2 or 3 dimensionality. That's where PCA comes into play.**\n\n### **Introduction to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <a id=\"14.2\"><\/a>\nThe main goal of a PCA analysis is to identify patterns in data. PCA aims to detect the correlation between variables. If a strong correlation between variables exists, the attempt to reduce the dimensionality only makes sense. In a nutshell, this is what PCA is all about: Finding the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and project it onto a smaller dimensional subspace while retaining most of the information. PCA is very useful in the following two cases:\n1. When the training process takes too long due to large input dimension of training data.\n2. Reducing dimensions, it make data visualization a breeze.\n\nPCA is often effected if your input features have different ranges. So to make PCA work better we shoud scale the input features. We would use sklearn's StandardScaler to standarize our input features. The idea behind StandardScaler is that it will transform our data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1. **If the variables are correlated, PCA can achieve dimension reduction. If not, PCA just orders them according to their variances.**\n\n**Now let's perform standarization and then PCA to plot decision regions of different trained classifiers.**","e81b5533":"**Interpretation of Chi-square Test:**  Since all the expected frequencies aren't greater than 5, chi-square test result can't be trusted.\n\n### 8.2.5 Parch & Survived  <a id=\"8.2.5\"><\/a>","d13f1211":"**Findings:** Variable Sex is imbalanced as proportion of male vs female in its distribution are not equally represented.

Number of predictor variable in bivariate analysis was one. On the contrary, number of predictor variables for multivariate analysis are more than one.

We will just visualize the impact of different predictor variables (3 variables) at a time on variable Survived.","d66f35fe":"**Findings:** As expected Sex, Embarked, and ticketProcessed have the weakest correlation with Age what we could guess beforehand from boxplot. Parch and familySize are moderately correlated with Age. nameProcessed, Pclass, Cabin, and SibSp have the highest correlation with Age. But we are gonna use nameProcessed and Pclass only in order to impute Age since they have the strongest correlation with Age. So the tactic is to impute missing values of Age with the median age of similar rows according to nameProcessed and Pclass.","d34c597d":"## 9.8 (Pclass, nameProcessed, cabinProcessed) vs Survived <a id=\"9.8\"><\/a>","b4f40d34":"**We can see precision, recall, f1 score and class count for both class (0 and 1) of our two models.**\n## 12.7 Precision-Recall vs Threshold Curve  <a id=\"12.7\"><\/a>\nSometimes we want a high precision and sometimes a high recall depending on our classification problem.

When we simply refer to 'ANOVA', we usually mean the 'one way' ANOVA which is a test for exploring the impact of one single factor on three or more groups (but two groups would also do, as we explain below).\n\nThough one should use either point biserial correlation (if categorical variable is of binary type) or ANOVA method for this problem to find any association between a categorical and a numerical variable, I would perform ANOVA too to have an intuition of how ANOVA works. Though ANOVA is usually prefered if the categorical variable having more than two groups, it is also possible to perform ANOVA for a categorical variable with two groups.\n\nThe one-way ANOVA tests whether the mean of some numeric variable differs across the levels of one categorical variable. It essentially answers the question: do any of the group means differ from one another? The null hypothesis is all of the group means are equal. And the alternate hypothesis is any of the group means differ from one another.","31bae2c3":"**Findings:** RF, DT, ETC, and ABC (in particular) give some features no importance (zero importance). On the other hand, GBC give all the features more or less importance but it doesn't give zero importance to any features. These are the tree based models that have 'feature_importances_' method by default. LR, KNN and SVC don't have this method. In this problem, SVC uses rbf kernel (only possible for linear kernel to plot feature importance), so its not possible to view feature importance given by SVC.

We will plot ROC curve and AUC score together for our two classifiers.","448efe8a":"**Findings:** Among the classifiers, RF and GBC have the highest accuracy after  tunning hyperparameters. So RF and GBC are perhaps worthy of further study on this classification problem. Hence we choose RF and GBC.\n\n**Note:** Please note that if we chose our classifier based on cross validation scores, we would not get RF and GBC as our best classifiers instead we would end up choosing LR and SVC.

Since all of the expected frequencies are greater than 5, the chi2 test results can be trusted. We can reject the null hypothesis as the p-value is less than 0.05(infact p value is almost 0).

Hard voting, stacking and soft voting perform identical and can't beat best base rf. Since bagging performs well for high variance model, we have a feeling that we might have overfitted the training data because cross validation score for bagging is 82.61% and it still scores over 81% on kaggle leaderboard.

To prevent this, we need to use a cross-validation strategy. Fitting an ensemble with cross-validation is often referred to as stacking, while the ensemble itself is known as the Super Learner. So basically in stacking, the individual classification models (or base models) are trained on the complete training set; then, the meta-classifier is fitted on the outputs (predictions) of those base learners. The meta-classifier can either be trained on the predicted class labels or probabilities from the ensemble.\n\n**The basic difference between blending and stacking is therefore that stacking allows both base learners and the meta learner to train on the full data set.The outcome of stacking is improved accuracy which is typical for small and medium-sized data sets, where the effect of blending can be severe. As the data set size increases, blending and stacking performs similarly and hence for large data sets blending is preferred over stacking since stacking takes significant amount of time to train the ensemble. We will use package vecstack to perform stacking that can save you from writing a lot of codes if you implement stacking from scratch.**","781ddbf1":"1. **int data type variables:** Pclass, SibSp, Parch, and PassengerId.\n2. **float data type variables:** Fare and Age, *Survived (due to concatenation)*\n3. **object (numbers + strings) data type variables:** Name, Sex, Ticket, Cabin, and Embarked.\n\n# 4.Univariate Analysis <a id=\"4\"><\/a>\nUnivariate analysis separately explores the distribution of each variable in a data set. It looks at the range of values, as well as the central tendency of the values. Univariate data analysis does not look at relationships between various variables (like bivariate and multivariate analysis) rather it summarises each variable on its own. Methods to perform univariate analysis will depend on whether the variable is categorical or numerical. For numerical variable, we would explore its shape of distribution (distribution can either be symmetric or skewed) using histogram and density plots. For categorical variables, we would use bar plots to visualize the absolute and proportional frequency distribution. Knowing the distribution of the feature values becomes important when you use machine learning methods that assume a particular type of it, most often Gaussian. **Let's starts off with categorical variables:**\n\n## 4.1 Categorical Variables  <a id=\"4.1\"><\/a>\nTo analyse categorical variables, let's create a custom function to display bar chart in absolute and relative scale of a variable in a subplot.","024771a1":"**Looks like, on average, if you pay more for your ticket, you are more likely to survive.

But train accuracy of a model is not enough to tell if a model can be able to generalize the unseen data or not. Because training data is something our model has been trained with, i.e., data our model has already seen it. We all know that, the purpose of building a machine learning model is to generalize the unseen data, i.e., data our model has not yet seen. Hence we can't use training accuracy for our model evaluation rather we must know how our model will perform on the data our model is yet to see.**\n\n## 11.2 Model Evaluation <a id=\"11.2\"><\/a>\nSo basically, to evaluate a model's performance, we need some data (input) for which we know the ground truth(label). For this problem, we don't know the ground truth for the test set but we do know for the train set. So the idea is to train and evaluate the model performance on different data. One thing we can do is to split the train set in two groups, usually in 80:20 ratio. That means we would train our model on 80% of the training data and we reserve the rest 20% for evaluating the model since we know the ground truth for this 20% data. Then we can compare our model prediction with this ground truth (for 20% data). That's how we can tell how our model would perform on unseen data. This is the first model evaluation technique. In sklearn we have a train_test_split method for that.\n\nTrain_test split has its drawbacks. Because this approach introduces bias as we are not using all of our observations for testing and also we're  reducing the train data size. To overcome this we can use a technique called cross validation where all the data is used for training and testing periodically. Thus we may reduce the bias introduced by train_test_split. From different cross validation methods, we would use k-fold cross validation. In sklearn we have a method cross_val_score for calculating k-fold cross validation score.\n\nHowever,  as the train set gets larger, train_test_split has its advantage over k-fold cross validation. Train_test_split is k-times faster than k-fold cross validation. If the training set is very large, both train_test_split and k-fold cross validation perform identically. So for a large training data, train_test_split is prefered over k-fold cross validation to accelerate the training process.\n\n### 11.2.1 K-Fold Cross Validation <a id=\"11.2.1\"><\/a>\nLet's say we will use 10-fold cross validation. So k = 10 and we have total 891 observations. Each fold would have 891\/10 = 89.1 observations. So basically k-fold cross validation uses fold-1 (89.1 samples) as the testing set and k-1 (9 folds) as the training sets and calculates test accuracy.This procedure is repeated k times (if k = 10, then 10 times); each time, a different group of observations is treated as a validation or test set. This process results in k estimates of the test accuracy which are then averaged out.","46b77366":"## 7.2 Impute Age <a id=\"7.2\"><\/a>\nTo impute Age with grouped median, we need to know which features are highly correlated with Age. Let's find out the variables correlated with Age.","b58fa6ac":"**Findings:** Most of the passengers survived and died were from cabin X. But percentage-wise, its category B, D, and E that had impressive chance of survival. People from cabin category X had just 30% chance of survival.","ff12cd61":"**Findings:**\n1. RF, DT, SVC and ETC are just doing okay. Among them, SVC is doing the best in terms of bias-variance tradeoff since svc's train accuracy and cross validation accuracy are almost equal. Since training and validation curves haven't yet converged for these classifiers, adding more instances (rows) might help.\n\n2. On the other hand, learning curve of GBC, ABC, KNN and LR indicates a little bit high bias or low variance (underfitting) and as the curves have already converged, adding more training data just might not help. Rather adding more features (columns) and increasing model's complexity might help.\n\n# 12.More Evaluation Metrics  <a id=\"12\"><\/a>\nWe've so far used accuracy score to evaluate our classifiers. But sometimes accuracy score isn't all enough to evaluate a classifier properly as accuracy score doesn't tell exactly which class (positive or negative) is being wrongly classified by our classifier in case of low accuracy score. **Again for imbalanced classification problem, accuracy score isn't the best metric to choose between different classifiers. To clarify this, in this section, we will calculate confusion matrix, precision score, recall score, specificity, f1 score, classification report for both random forest and gradient boosting classifier. And then we will compare our two best classifiers (rf and gbc) using these calculated metrics to see exactly where one classifier excels the other.**\n\n## 12.1 Confusion Matrix  <a id=\"12.1\"><\/a>\nThe confusion matrix shows the number of correct classifications along with misclassifications when a classifier make predictions for each class (positive or negative). The diagonal elements are correct classification while the off diagonal elements are misscalssifications. Some basic terms associated with confusion matrix:\n1. True positives (TP): These are cases in which we predicted 1(yes), and the actual is also 1(yes).\n2. True negatives (TN): We predicted 0(no), and the actual is also 0(no).\n3. False positives (FP): We predicted 1(yes), but the actual is 0(no). (Also known as a \"Type I error.\")\n4. False negatives (FN): We predicted 0(no), but the actual is 1(yes). (Also known as a \"Type II error.\")","eeab0d97":"**Findings:** Once again, SibSp is not balanced as levels of SibSp(7) are not equally represented in its distribution. 891 passengers were without siblings or spouses.

That's what we will try to do using ensemble method. Ensembles combine predictions from different models to generate a final prediction, and the more models we include the better it performs. Better still, because ensembles combine baseline predictions, they perform at least as well as the best baseline model. Most of the errors from a model\u2019s learning are from three main factors: variance, noise, and bias. By using ensemble methods, we\u2019re able to increase the stability of the final model and reduce the errors caused by bias, variance, and noise. By combining many models, we\u2019re able to (mostly) reduce the variance, even when they are individually not great, as we won\u2019t suffer from random errors from a single source. **The main principle behind ensemble modelling is to group weak learners together to form one strong learner. The most basic ensemble is majority voting rule (where the prediction or vote given by the majority of the models used as final prediction).But there are many other ways to combine predictions, and more generally we can use a model to learn how to best combine predictions.**","1ba039a6":"**So there we have it!

So female survivors were more than double the male survivors. Proportion tells a female has over 74% chance of survival while male has almost 19% chance of survival. So female has the best chance of survival.\n\n***Chi-square Test***: The Chi-square test of independence tests if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables.The data is usually displayed in a cross-tabulation format with each row representing a category for one variable and each column representing a category for another variable. Chi-square test of independence is an omnibus test.That is it tests the data as a whole. This means that one will not be able to tell which levels (categories) of the variables are responsible for the relationship **if the Chi-square table is larger than 2\u00d72. If the test is larger than 2\u00d72, it requires post hoc testing.**\n\n**The H0 (Null Hypothesis): There is no relationship between variable 1 and variable 2.**\n\n**The H1 (Alternative Hypothesis): There is a relationship between variable 1 and variable 2.**\n\nIf the p-value is significant (less than 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis and claim that the findings support the alternate hypothesis. While we check the results of the chi2 test, we need also to check that the expected cell frequencies are greater than or equal to 5. If a cell has an expected frequency less that 5, then the Fisher\u2019s Exact test should be use to overcome this problem.\n\nThe chi2_contingency() method conducts the Chi-square test on a contingency table (crosstab).","fd6a7f4d":"**So what does the  value of skewness suggest?**\n1. If skewness is less than \u22121 or greater than +1, the distribution can be considered as highly skewed.\n2.

Alternatively, If a value is significantly below the expected range, it will drag the distribution to the left, making the graph left-skewed or negative-skewed.\n\nAnother useful plot for visualizing a continuous variable is box plot. Box plot is particularly helpful to understand the spread of the continus data and whether there are potential unusual observations (outliers) in that variable. It presents information of min, 1st quartile, 2nd quartile(median), 3rd quartile, and max of a variable.**We will use IQR method to detect the outliers for variable Age and Fare though we won't remove them.**","777c5d0e":"# Outlines\n\n* [1.Problem Description and Objective](#1)\n* [2.Importing Packages and Collecting Data](#2)\n* [3.Variable Description and Identification](#3)\n   * [3.1 Variable Description](#3.1) [3.2 Categorical and Numerical Variables](#3.2) [3.3 Variable Data Types](#3.3)\n* [4.Univariate Analysis](#4)\n   * [4.1 Categorical Variables](#4.1)\n      * [4.1.1 Survived](#4.1.1) [4.1.2 Sex](#4.1.2) [4.1.3 Pclass](#4.1.3) [4.1.4 Embarked](#4.1.4) [4.1.5 Cabin](#4.1.5) [4.1.6 Name](#4.1.6) [4.1.7 Ticket](#4.1.7) [4.1.8 SibSp](#4.1.8) [4.1.9 Parch](#4.1.9)\n   * [4.2 Numerical Variables](#4.2)    \n      * [4.2.1 Fare](#4.2.1)  [4.2.2 Age](#4.2.2)  [4.2.3 PassengerId](#4.2.3)\n* [5.Feature Engineering](#5)\n   * [5.1 Process Cabin](#5.1) [5.2 Process Name](#5.2) [5.3 Process SibSp & Parch](#5.3)  [5.4 Process Ticket](#5.4)\n* [6.Outliers Detection](#6)\n   * [6.1 Outliers Detection of Age](#6.1)  [6.1 Outliers Detection of Fare](#6.2)\n* [7.Imputing Missing Variables](#7)\n   * [7.1 Impute Embarked & Fare](#7.1)  [7.2 Impute Age](#7.2)\n* [8.Bivariate Analysis](#8)\n   * [8.1 Numerical & Categorical Variables](#8.1)\n      * [8.1.1 Fare & Survived](#8.1.1)   [8.1.2 Age & Survived](#8.1.2)\n   * [8.2 Categorical & Categorical Variables](#8.2)\n      * [8.2.1 Sex & Survived](#8.2.1) [8.2.2 Pclass & Survived](#8.2.2) [8.2.3 Embarked & Survived](#8.2.3) [8.2.4 SIbSp & Survived](#8.2.4) [8.2.5 Parch & Survived](#8.2.5) [8.2.6 nameProcessed & Survived](#8.2.6) [8.2.7 familySize & Survived](#8.2.7) [8.2.8 cabinProcessed & Survived](#8.2.8) [ 8.2.9 ticketProcessed & Survived](#8.2.9)\n* [9.Multivariate Analysis](#9)  \n   * [9.1 (Pclass, Sex, cabinProcessed) vs Survived](#9.1) [9.2 (Pclass, Sex, Embarked) vs Survived](#9.2) [9.3 (Pclass, Sex, SibSp) vs Survived](#9.3) [9.4 (Pclass, Sex, Parch) vs Survived](#9.4) [9.5 (Pclass, Sex, nameProcessed) vs Survived](#9.5) [9.6 (Pclass, Sex, familySize) vs Survived](#9.6) [9.7 (Pclass, Sex, ticketProcessed) vs Survived](#9.7) [9.8 (Pclass, nameProcessed, cabinProcessed) vs Survived](#9.8) [9.9 (familySize, Sex, cabinProcessed) vs Survived](#9.9) [9.10 (Sex, nameProcessed, familySize) vs Survived](#9.10) [9.11 (Sex, nameProcessed, cabinProcessed) vs Survived](#9.11) [9.12 (Sex, nameProcessed, Embarked) vs Survived](#9.12) [9.13 (Sex, nameProcessed, ticketProcessed) vs Survived ](#9.13)\n* [10.Data Transformation](#10) \n   * [10.1 Binning Continuous Variables](#10.1)\n      * [10.1.1 Binning Age](#10.1.1) [10.1.2 Binning Fare](#10.1.2)\n   * [10.2 Dropping Features](#10.2) [10.3 Correcting Data Types](#10.3) [10.4 Encoding Categorical Variables](#10.4)\n* [11.Model Building and Evaluation](#11)   \n   * [11.1 Training Model](#11.1) [11.2 Model Evaluation](#11.2) [11.2.1 Cross Validation](#11.2.1) [11.2.2 Tunning Hyperparameters](#11.2.2) [11.2.3 Model Selection](#11.2.3) [11.3 Retrain & Predict Using Optimized Hyperparameters](#11.3) [11.4 Feature Importance](#11.4) [11.5 Learning Curves](#11.5)\n* [12.More Evaluation Metrics](#12)  \n   * [12.1 Confusion Matrix](#12.1) [12.2 Precision Score](#12.2) [12.3 Recall (or Sensitivity or True Positive Rate)](#12.3) [12.4 Specificity ( or True Negative Rate)](#12.4) [12.5 F1 Score](#12.5) [12.6 Classification Report](#12.6) [12.7 Precision-Recall vs Threshold Curve](#12.7) [12.8 Precision-Recall Curve](#12.8) [12.9 ROC  Curve & AUC Score ](#12.9)\n* [13.Prediction & Submission](#13) \n* [14.Introduction to Ensemble](#14)\n   * [14.1 Hard Voting Ensemble](#14.1) [14.2 Introduction to PCA](#14.2) [14.3 Soft Voting Ensemble](#14.3) [14.4 Bagging](#14.4) [14.5 Boosting](#14.5) [14.6 Blending](#14.6) [14.7 Stacking](#14.7) [14.8 Evaluating Different Ensembles](#14.8)\n* [15.End Note](#15)","f6e00bad":"**Findings:** Though people embarked from Southampton have the most survivors count (219) but proportion-wise it has only nearly 34% chance of survival.
