which is equivalent to 48.5%.** This seems to be a major concern and I think we should try to address this.\n\n**Suggesstions:**\n* Notify frequently with the number of steps left to complete daily quota. Frequency can be increased for people having record of walking less.\n* To develop an algorithm that will notify people at evening or at night to go for an walk if their step count is less than 7500.","d251fbc9":"**Findings:**\n* 9.1% of people sleep less than 4 hours.\n* 3% of people sleep more than 10 hours a day.\n* Overall 12% people either sleep for very less hours or much more.

Death rates declined with more steps taken each day until about 7,500 steps a day, when the benefit leveled off.\n* This information can be used in adververtising to encourage people to buy our smart wearables to help them track steps and complete the daily targets to live healthy.\n* Also, our watch can have the feature notifying people at evening (most preffered time is 5pm since **people are most active from 5pm to 7pm** according to the analysis)to go for a walk or an exercise including sports if their step count for the day is less than 7500.\n\n\n2. **12% people are either sleeping for very less hour or far more hour.** *This percentage grows to **21%** if we consider criteria for minimum sleep hours as 5 hours instead of 4 hours.*\n\nThis is a significant number and these are people unable to use their full potential, as activesness is found to be very low in these people. Through advertisement people can be educated about importance of right sleep hours thereby encouraging them to buy our products for their sleep tracking. People with 6-9 hours of sleep are the found to be most active.\n* We can notify people with less sleep hours to atleast have 6 hours of sleep and encourage people with high sleep hours to reduce to 9-10 hours.\n* High sedentary time is also found to have bad effect on sleep quality. Lower sedentary time is always better but people may have high sedentary time due to various important reasons too. So, **6-9 hours of sleep and 7-13 hours of sedentary time** is found to be best combination for high activeness. This can be our goal set in the watch to notify people if they go out of any matrix in the combination.","17323dec":"##### **Other useful insights and suggestion:**\n* From 12pm to 3pm people tend to become less active. This is most probably due to people starting to feel tired from 12pm.\n\nWe can send notifications around 12pm to do any simple recreational activity (eg. drink water, breathing exercise, recreational break or walk) so people get fresh.","b0c0df0e":"**Findings:**\n* Data is clean and has no wrong or null or duplicate entry.\n* No. of participants=33\n* ActivityHour column data needs to be convert to day and time(will be done in next cell).","dcef1757":"###### Let's find out what percent of people sleep less than 4 hours a day and more than 10 hours a day.

These details can also be included while advertising to help build strong brand value.","6286f67f":"<a id=\"section-six\"><\/a>\n# **Phase 5:Share**\n### **Key Objective:**\n#### **Present the findings with the help of visualizations:**","7b9bb63a":"**Calculation:** Developed a relative matrix named *Active_Score* summing up the different intensity of activeness in the ratio- *very active timing : fairly active timing : lightly active timing =4:2:1*\n\n**Findings:** \n* Positive correlation has been found between Daily steps and calories.\n* Activeness tends to increase with more number of calories burned or with more number of steps.\n* Increase in activeness with increase in calories is observed between 10000-15000 daily steps.

Since, Color tends to fade along y axis.\n* Most active users tend to have sleep between 6-9 hours and have Sedentary time of 7-13 hours.\n\n**Suggesstions:**\n* For users having sleep time less than 6 hours we can send personalized notification to decrease their sedentary time for having good sleep quality.\n* Our goal can be to motivate most people to come under the sweet spot balancing Sleep hours and Sedentary hours which is 6-9 hours of sleep and 7-13 hours of sedentary time.","522c3daf":"###### As Sunday is a holiday let's see if we can find any significant effect of it on people's activity.(Here we will compare mean of all matrices of week days excluding Sunday with that of Sunday).","31318a57":"**Findings:**\n* People generally sleep 40 min extra on Sunday which is equivalent to 9.4% more as compared to other days.","fa3761bf":"**Findings:**\n* On average people are sleeping 30% of total time which comes out to be 7.2 hours which is good.\n* Sedentary time is 51% that is approx 12 hours.

This may due to increased recreational activities in evening.\n\n**Suggesstions:**\n* We can send motivational notification to exercise at around 5pm and 5am.\n* We can also send notification around 12pm to do any simple recreational activity (eg. drink water, breath exercise, recreational break or walk) so people get fresh.","458a0336":"**Findings:**\n1.
