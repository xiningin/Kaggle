Variables that are measured at different scales do not contribute equally to the analysis and might end up creating a bias.\n\nFor example, A variable that ranges between 0 and 1000 will outweigh a variable that ranges between 0 and 1. Using these variables without standardization will give the variable with the larger range weight of 1000 in the analysis. Transforming the data to comparable scales can prevent this problem.\n\nIn this data set we can see the all the variable are in different scale i.e price are in 1000s unit and depth and table are in 100s unit, and carat is in 10s. So its necessary to scale or standardise the data to allow each variable to be compared on a common scale. With data measured in different \"units\" or on different scales (as here with different means and variances) this is an important data processing step if the results are to be meaningful or not dominated by the variables that have large variances.\n\n### But is scaling  necessary in this case? \nNo, it is not necessary, we'll get an equivalent solution whether we apply some kind of linear scaling or not. \nBut recommended for regression techniques as well because it would help gradient descent to converge fast and reach the global minima. When number of features becomes large, it helps is running model quickly else the starting point would be very far from minima, if the scaling is not done in preprocessing.\n\n<b>For now we will process the model without scaling and later we will check the output with scaled data of regression model output.","8ce8a67a":"### Check Multi-collinearity using VIF","8c2b9f25":"#### Observation-3: \nwe can observe there are 697 missing value in the depth column.\nMissing value treatment will be done in section 1.2.","e8e6c57b":"**Linear regression Performance Metrics:**\n\n*  intercept for the model:     -3171.950447307667\n*  R square on training data: 0.9311935886926559\n*  R square on testing data:   0.931543712584074\n* \n*  RMSE on Training data:      907.1312415459143\n*  RMSE on Testing data:        911.8447345328436\n\n\n As the training data & testing data score are almost inline,  we can conclude this model is a Right-Fit Model.\n","b1dab921":"1.1.
