There is a clear demarcation between various grades of channels based on their ranks, thus, the ranks of channels are very good indicators of grade of a channel.\n2.

Generally number of subscribers are low for the channels having very large number of videos uploaded, while for channels having very low number of videos uploaded, there is a large variance.
