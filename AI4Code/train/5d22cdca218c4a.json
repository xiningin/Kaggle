It takes place in the city of Rome under the rule of emperor Nero, c. AD 64.\n\nSienkiewicz studied the Roman Empire extensively before writing the novel, with the aim of getting historical details correct. Consequently, several historical figures appear in the book. As a whole, the novel carries a pro-Christian message.\n\nIt was first published in installments in the Gazeta Polska between 26 March 1895 and 29 February 1896, as well as in two other journals, Czas and Dziennik Pozna\u0144ski, starting two and three days later. It was published in book form in 1896 and has been translated into more than 50 languages. The novel contributed to Sienkiewicz's Nobel Prize for literature in 1905.\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quo_Vadis_(novel)"}}
