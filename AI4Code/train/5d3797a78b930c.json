As Fig. 1 shows, sea ice volume varies a lot over a season. During the Arctic winter, because the sun is down 24 hours a day, ice volume steadily builds up. In the spring, the sun  rises high enough in the sky to initiate the melting season.  Melting continues until September, when cold once again sets in, and ice volume begins to increase.\n\n<p style ='text-align: center;'>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/psc.apl.uw.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/schweiger\/ice_volume\/BPIOMASIceVolumeAnomalyCurrentV2.1_CY.png\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\"\/> \nFigure 1.

(This image is archived and provided by Arctic Data archive System (ADS), which was developed by National Institute of Polar Research, NIPR.)\n<\/p>\n\nOne question for climate scientists concerns _how_ Arctic ice melts seasonally. Is more volume lost at the edges, or through thinning of the entire ice cover? It turns out that if you know sea ice volume _and_ extent, then you can also estimate the _thickness_ of the ice. This follows from simple dimensional analysis: volume has dimension $distance^3$, while extent has dimension $distance^2$. So the ratio between them tells you about the thickness.\n\nIn this CGI, you'll look at some Arctic sea ice data and try to come up with an answer to this question. In doing so, you'll develop familiarity with the seasonal and year-to-year patterns of sea ice growth and melt, as well as skill at visualizing and analyzing the available data.

However, the climate is extremely complicated and understanding climate requires an interdisciplinary effort, with chemistry a key contributor. In this CGI module we will develop chemical ideas, such as the thermodynamics of phase transitions, to help us understand some of the mechanisms of climate change.\n\n\n_Climate connection_  \nHuman activity has changed the composition of the atmosphere in such a way that the temperature of the planet has increased. Polar regions have undergone greater increases in temperature than midlatitudes, a phenomenon called _polar amplification_. Recent research has also shown that this amplified warming has a significant impact on weather at lower latitudes, causing severe episodes of drought and heavy rainfall in North America and Asia.\n\n_Polar connection_  \nSome of the most difficult observations to collect are in the harsh, remote environments of the polar regions. Yet polar observations are crucial because the unique conditions of polar regions lead to amplification of climate change, a phenomenon called _polar amplification_. Polar ampification, in turn, is largely due to a phenomenon called _ice-albedo feedback_, in which ice and snow, which have a high _albedo_ (they efficiently reflect the sun's rays away from the earth's surface), melt to form melt ponds, which have a low albedo (melt ponds absorb  solar radiation quite well). That, in turn,  warms the surface a little more, which causes more melting, and so on: a _positive feedback_. \n\nAll this means that sea ice extent in polar regions is an excellent indicator of climate changes resulting from human activity. To that end, climate scientists have taken careful measurements of the seasonal melting and freezing of ice in polar regions, as well as trends in that melting and freezing from year to year. Here, you will examine some of these datasets.

These images reveal land cover and allow tracking events like hurricanes and fires. This module explores image processing of satellite images in polar regions. The module starts with exploring how images are loaded, plotted, and stored; how they can be manipulated to produce true and false-color and black and white images; and color mapping. Activites also include edge detection, noise removal, determining snow and sea ice extent, and scene identification. \n\n<font size=\"4\">[Ice Cores and Climate Change](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pennyrowe\/ice-cores)<\/font>  \nAs snow accumulates onto ice sheets over hundreds or thousands of years, air bubbles are trapped as the snow is compressed into firn and then ice. Ice cores serve as recorders of past climate and atmospheric concentration. In this module, work with data from ice cores from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and Greenland, in order to explore earth's past climate and glacial cycles. Explore how temperature and CO$_2$ vary over the last 425,000 years, and how this is linked to changes in Earth's orbit.\n\n<font size=\"4\">[Permafrost](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pennyrowe\/permafrost)<\/font>  \nLearn what permafrost is, the implications of permafrost thawing due to climate change, and how to calculate heat diffusion through permafrost. Activities include watching a video about permafrost, checking out a journal article, and downloading, plotting and analyzing permafrost data. Learn how permafrost temperature changes with depth underground, seasonally, and annually, and calculate heat flow through permafrost.\n\n<font size=\"4\">[Polar Spectra](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pennyrowe\/polar-spectra-1-revised)<\/font>  \nLearn about the greenhouse effect by examining a \"forbidden\" rovibrational band in the infrared emission spectra of Earth's atmosphere, recorded from the surface at South Pole Station. By weighting rotational energy degeneracies with a Boltzmann factor, you can simulate the R-branch of the band - the result is a rudimentary estimate of the average temperature of the troposphere above the South Pole. Finally, try a second method of estimating the near-surface temperature, through matching South Polar radiative emission to a Planck Blackbody Spectrum. \n\n<font size=\"4\">[Seasonal Arctic Ice Melt](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pennyrowe\/sea-ice-melt-1)<\/font>  \nLearn about thermodynamics topics through calculation of the amount of heat required to melt Arctic sea ice. Watch an online animation of changing polar ice with time, downloading data of Arctic ice extent and volume. Activities include using thermodynamic principles and equations to plot the phase diagram of water, find the freezing point depression of Arctic sea ice in equilibrium with sea water, and compute the change in the enthalpy of fusion of water resulting from that temperature depression.\n","fe0e6aef":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.nsf.gov\/images\/logos\/NSF_4-Color_bitmap_Logo.png\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" align=\"left\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;margin:0 px 20px\"\/>  This PENGUIN module was created with funding from the National Science Foundation.
