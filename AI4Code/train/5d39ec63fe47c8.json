The same should be done for the cluster that solely holds nuclear membranes.\n* In addition the occurence of seldom target proteins seems to make a cluster assignment more uncertain.

If you take a look at the probability $\\mu$ for Aggresomes in that cluster it's quite low with 18. Perhaps this cluster is not nice shaped and occupied.

Think of cluster 1 again: It's nearly fully occupied by aggresomes but the mu-proability for this target given this cluster is very low with 18 %. That's strange! It's related to the seldomness of the target and could be caused by a shift due to weighted sum during mu calculation. As the sum is taken over all samples, nearby targets (of other components) that still have some higher responsibility for the aggresome cluster can cause a shift of the mu-center of the cluster.

As I'm currently on the way of my learning path to discover mixture models the choice using a Bernoulli mixture model was an easy one.  What's the idea behind it?\n\n*If you are not interested in mixture models and math etc. skip this chapter and jump to results analysis ;-) *\n\nMixture models assume that the data we **observed $X$ was generated by some latent variable $Z$.** In our case this could be the **staining process** of microscope preparates used to obtain the 4 channel images. Perhaps this process is limited and this limitation has caused our target groupings. You have already seen that we were able to reduce the number of target classes by fusing endosomes and lysosomes. Consequently we can say that there are fewer configurations of the latent variable than target classes. \n\n\n### Model description\n\nThese configurations can be seen as $K$ components of the mixture model. We don't know how many of them are actually there and we will have to estimate them during the analysis. Each component tries to explain one target group we are seeking for. And for each sample $x_{n}$ of our $N$ data spots there exists a related latent or hidden variable $z_{n}$ that holds 1 for the component $k$ that generated $x_{n}$ and 0 for all others. Imagine you would already know them, then we could describe the probability density our data as follows:\n\n$$ P(X) = \\sum_{Z} P(X, Z|\\theta |\\theta) = \\sum_{Z} P(Z|\\theta) \\cdot P(X|Z, \\theta)$$\n\nIf you are not very familiar with probabilities: To obtain this equation you need to know the sum and product rules of probabilites. We are now summing over all $K$ configurations of the latent variable Z, hence over $K$ assumed clusters. This formulation is very general. Now image you take a look at one of the components, on one single cluster. How is the target protein data distributed in that group?\n\n<a title=\"Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http:\/\/www.cngcoins.com [GFDL (http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/copyleft\/fdl.html), CC-BY-SA-3.0 (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/3.0\/) or CC BY-SA 2.5 (https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/2.5)]\" href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Ephesos_620-600_BC.jpg\"><img width=\"256\" alt=\"Ephesos 620-600 BC\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4f\/Ephesos_620-600_BC.jpg\"><\/a>\n\nEach target protein $x_{d}$ itself is binary. If we like to describe the distribution of nucleoplasmn it is like one we would obtain by tossing a coin. And for each of the $D=28$ target protein we could flip such a coin, with zero on one side and one on the other. If we assume that  the target proteins are independent within one component $k$ than we can write:\n\n$$ p(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}) = \\prod_{d=1}^{D} \\mu_{k,d}^{x_{n,d}} (1-\\mu_{k,d})^{(1-x_{n,d})}$$\n\nWhereas $\\mu_{k,d}$ stands for the probability to observe the current target protein $x_{n,d}$. This sounds difficult first but let's try to understand it with lysosomes and endosomes again: If we know that they belong to group component $k=2$, for example. Then the probability to observe lysosomes and endosomes within this group could perhaps be $\\mu_{2,lyso} = \\mu_{2,endo} =  0.99$ for both and $\\mu_{2,ER} = 0.4$ for endoplasmatic reticulum. For all other proteins the probability to observe them should be very low, for example $\\mu_{2, k} = 0.01.$ If we now have a sample that fits to this target combination it would yield a high value for $p(x_{n}| \\mu_{2})$. Hence it's probable that it belongs to that group.\n\nOk, we are close to fullfill our model decription. We try to explain our data by the probability density $P(X)$. Imagine that all samples were independently drawn from this distribution. With this assumption we can split into a product over all $N$ samples. \n\n$$ P(X) = \\sum_{Z} P(X, Z|\\theta) = \\sum_{Z} P(Z|\\theta) \\cdot P(X|Z, \\theta) = \\prod_{n} \\sum_{z} p(z|\\pi) \\cdot p(x|z, \\mu)$$\n\nAs there exists one true component $z_{n,k}$ for each sample, we can say that $z_{n}$ is one-hot-encoded and can be described by a multinomial distribution:\n\n$$p(z|\\pi) = \\prod_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k}^{z_{k}}$$\n\nThe same holds for the conditional probability $p(x|z, \\mu)$:\n\n$$p(x|z, \\mu) = \\prod_{k=1}^{K} p(x|\\mu_{k})^{z_{k}}$$\n\nand finally we obtain: \n\n$$ P(X) = \\prod_{n} \\sum_{z} p(z|\\pi) \\cdot p(x|z, \\mu)  = \\prod_{n} \\sum_{k}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot p(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}) = \\prod_{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot \\prod_{d=1}^{D} \\mu_{k,d}^{x_{n,d}} (1-\\mu_{k,d})^{(1-x_{n,d})} $$\n\nWith this model we like to describe our target data. And to make this model fit to what we observe we will maximize this probability density $p(X)$ with respect to our model parameters $\\pi$ and $\\mu$. This maximization is usually performed by taking the log first as it often makes it simpler to take derivarives. But in our case we will stuck....\n\n$$ \\ln p(X|\\mu, \\pi) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\ln \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot p(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}) \\right) $$ \n\nDo you see the problem? The sum over all $K$ components prevents the log to act on $\\pi_{k} \\cdot p(x_{n}|\\mu_{k})$ and consequently we can't make the bernoullis tractable for taking derivatives. :-(  ","67da5667":"And fit multiple models...

A lot of samples do not have them even though all targets of lysosomes and endosomes can be find within that cluster!!!\n* Well you might ask yourself now, why this map helps you: Take a look at the aggresomes for example. It's a seldom target but once you have found the cluster 1 you can definitely say that all of its samples have an aggresome present. :-) Hence if seldom targets have their own nice, little cluster and you have found it, you are done with its targets.

This cases are the 3-couped-targets of that cluster. \n* As there are no 4-coupled-targets we can conclude that there are some combinations that do not really fit to the aggresome cluster. One example: Take a look at the aggresome row again and the microtubule organizing center column. You can see that there are zero couplings of aggresomes with this target.
