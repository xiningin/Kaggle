Kaggle Learn\n2. Coursera\n3. DataCamp\n\nCongratulations **Kaggle**, seems like you are the the top DS & ML Learning Platform in Indonesia.","0aa65b77":"More than **80%** of survey takers are having either Bachelor or Master's or Doctoral degree.  \nHowever, this triggers a curiosity, whether they learn DS & ML in university or not. Let's explore that.","2b2b5fa7":"## Indonesian Survey Takers By Age\n\nNext, let's explore Indonesian Survey Takers by age.","9af0dc81":"## Indonesian Survey Takers By Gender\n\nFirst, let's explore the Indonesian survey takers by gender.","ce1ebfef":"## Indonesian Survey Takers' Hosting\nWhile Kaggle Learn is the top DS & ML Learning Platform in Indonesia, let's investigate if it's also the no. 1 for where Indonesian Survey Taker hosted its notebook.","0c8a0993":"The field is dominated by people below 35 years old that take **83.45%**. If we exclude age range 30-34, that takes **77.24%**. This shows the field is dominated mostly by people in younger age group, probably because the field although not very recent worldwide, it is still considered new field in Indonesia.","8a24b6ed":"The number is not that significant but that doesn't decrease my intention to explore Indonesia data, simply because I am Indonesian.","b79d175a":"The pie chart shows that based on this survey alone, it (ML & DS) is a field dominated by male (**70%**) in Indonesia.","73ebcd38":"# Indonesian Survey Takers Exploratory Data Analysis (Summary: Indonesians Love Kaggle)\nWelcome to this notebook, I aim to explore the Kaggle ML & DS survey for population of Indonesia. \n\nPlease follow the notebook to see the data exploration but to summarize a bit, Indonesian Survey Takers put Kaggle as :\n1. No. 1 DS & ML Learning Platform\n2. No. 2 DS & ML Notebook Hosting Platform\n3. No. 2 DS & ML Application Sharing or Deployment Platform\n\nOf course there're some other things that are explored but the key highlight seems to be Indonesians Love Kaggle.\n\n## Indonesian Survey Takers among World Population\nAccording to [worldometers](https:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/world-population\/indonesia-population\/), Indonesia ranks number 4 in the list of countries (and dependencies) by population. However, based on data of Kaggle survey takers, that's not the case.","9f933234":"Apparently, it's not the case, **Kaggle** is placed no. 2 behind **Google Colab** Notebooks which is the favorite for Indonesian Survey Takers. But the top 2 anyway are far ahead the rest of the pack (although between Kaggle and Colab there's also quite big gap). The interesting thing is the number of people learning using Kaggle platform and using Kaggle Notebooks are similar, perhaps we can do exploration if it's mostly the same people using both Kaggle learn and Kaggle Notebooks. ","c6d0ab06":"Now, let's check where do Indonesian Survey Takers share or deploy their DS or ML applications ? Do we get similar number between hosting of notebooks with deployment or sharing of application ?","a44697e5":"Apparently, Indonesian people use **Github** more than other platforms for hosting or sharing the DS \/ ML Applications. Still, we can see **Kaggle** in second spot sharing place with **Google Colab**. ","02236826":"Apparently, only **20.09%** of survey takers with University Degree that really learn DS & ML from university. This could mean University **has a lot to catch-up** if people need to go to another platform to learn DS & ML while having University degree although we also **can't conclude that 100%** because **in the survey there's no question related to what major the survey takers pursue in university**.  \n\nSo, now another questions pops-up where do the majority of Indonesian survey takers learn DS & ML from ? Let's explore it and this time we will include whole population and not only the ones with University Degree.","0c59d06c":"## Indonesian Survey Takers By Education Level\n\nNext, let's explore by education level.","9d8e7ae9":"## Goodbye\n\nFor now, that's it, hope you enjoy this notebook."}}
