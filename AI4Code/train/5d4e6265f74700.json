It is useful since it can reveal vital patterns and trends in the landscape.  There are many libraries available to analyze such data, but often there is a lot of manual effort involved. Memory management of geospatial data is another issue. This means the magnitude of such data makes it a little difficult to process and analyze it easily.\n\n[Kepler.gl](https:\/\/kepler.gl\/)  is a powerful open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets. Developed by Uber, Kepler.gl is a data-agnostic and high-performance web-based application for large-scale geolocation data sets. You very easily find patterns in a dataset, combine different datasets, perform aggregations and manipulations in real-time. If a dataset has a timestamp, geopoints, and some meta information, Kepler.gl can automatically extract the information and visualize it. \n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n    \n\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f Incase you want to know more, here is an article that goes deeper into the theory behind the library along with other useful resources: [Visualizing India\u2019s Seismic activity](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/visualizing-indias-seismic-activity-4ed390de298c?sk=12befb1ffd589de4bb5251892b161a25)\n    \n<\/div>"}}
