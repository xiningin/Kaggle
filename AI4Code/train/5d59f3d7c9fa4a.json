Comparative genomic analyses identified several gene-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as large-sequence polymorphisms (genomic deletions, tandem duplications, insertion sequences IS6110) both in BCG vaccines relative to virulent strains of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis, and among the different BCG daughter strains. The scheme shows regions of difference (RD), insertions (in), deletions (del), and SNPs, which differentiate the various BCG strains. The brown and blue dashed ellipses indicate tandem duplications DU1 (exclusively restricted to BCG Pasteur) and DU2 (present in the BCG substrains in four possible forms), which enable classification of BCG strains into four major lineages. \n\nNote that in other phylogenies (e.g., ref. 10), BCG China\/BCG Beijing belongs to a cluster closely related to BCG Danish.

As reported in this issue of Molecular Therapy, Zhang and colleagues have now compared phenotypic and genotypic information of 13 different BCG strains with data on their virulence and vaccine efficacy in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and BALB\/c mice, respectively.\n\nThe authors concluded that the distinct levels of virulence of the various strains might be linked to strain-specific duplications and deletions of genomic regions. Moreover, the authors observed a general trend whereby BCG strains showing higher virulence in SCID mice induced better protection against a Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge in BALB\/c mice3 relative to less virulent BCG strains. These observations have important implications for current BCG vaccination programs and are of particular relevance for both ongoing and future alternative TB vaccine development approaches.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4817828\/","2940395b":"BCG, an attenuated anti-TB vaccine, is one of the most well-known examples of globally used vaccines developed in the twentieth century. Originally obtained by Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin in the early 1920s at the Institut Pasteur of Lille by serially passaging a virulent Mycobacterium bovis isolate on potato slices soaked in glycerol and ox bile, it remains one of the most widely used vaccines today (more than 120 million doses each year). \n\nAdditional mutations in some individual BCG strains might also have contributed to the specific virulence phenotypes of certain strains. As an example, the low virulence shown by BCG Glaxo might have arisen from mutations leading to a defect in the synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate and phenolic glycolipids, which are important virulence-associated lipids in tubercle bacilli. \n\nBCG Prague, for example, shows a frameshift mutation in PhoP, and has been found to be one of the least virulent BCG strains tested.\n\n#Although BCG shows good efficacy in preventing disseminated forms of TB in young children, its widespread use has not prevented the #pandemic spread of the disease. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4817828\/"}}
