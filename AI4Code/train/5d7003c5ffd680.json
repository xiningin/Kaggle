There are 2 Stores, Kaggle Mart and Kaggle Rama\n* The stores sell 3 types of goodies - Kaggle Mug, Kaggle Hat and Kaggle Stickers\n* Sales data is recorded from January 01, 2015 to December 31, 2018 for all stores across 3 countries.  \n\nNow that we know what the dataset is, let's study the following questions using interactive Flourish charts:","ee944ead":"The above trend of Hats being in (1st, 2nd, 3rd), Mugs in (4th, 5th and 6th) and Stickers being in last three positions are proven for both the stores that sell Kaggle Goodies.","3509613f":"<h3> Observations made from above analyses <\/h3>\n\nThe following are the observations made from the above study:\n\n* For all of the 3 goodies, Store Kaggle Rama sold the most number of goodies.\n* Kaggle Rama accounted for 63.54% of the total sales of Kaggle Goodies overall.","f6a2c6ae":"From the analysis below, we observe that for all of the Goodies, Norway reported the highest number of sales. Sales were highest in Norway, followed by Sweden and Finland. Also we can observe, in the descending order of sales:\n\n* Hats were amongst in 1st, 2nd and 3rd position\n* Mugs were in 4th, 5th and 6th position\n* Stickers occupied the last 3 positions.\n\n# Question 5: Is this Sequence of Sales present on the Store-level as well?\n\nWe can plot the above data for both of the stores individually to check if the above trend follows or not. Both of these graphs are plotted within an interactive dashboard. (Use the store name to filter the results)","81a476c2":"Seems like people are buying Kaggle Hats the most.

For the next thing, I would be including the date-wise sales comparisons, to understand the sales behaviour better. Also, very much thanks to [Mar\u00edlia Prata](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mpwolke) for letting me know about the event. \n\nWould love to hear your opinions on this notebook. Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/amankumar01\/). It was happy writing this notebook.

Yeah that's some serious demand of data science fashion :)","eefd7371":"<h3> What would be in this notebook? <\/h3>\n\nThis notebook won't be about the best approach to build the forecasting model to get a score as minimum as possible. I'll try to look through this dataset, do some EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and try to build a story using beautiful yet impactful open-source visualization tool - Flourish. Flourish makes it easy to visualize data using easy approaches without need of code. Interactive data dashboarding to analytics storytelling, that's what I wish to explore in the Playground Jan 22' Series.  \n\nThis data doesn't simulates a real-world environment, but data storytelling is a fun thing to do. Let's now navigate to the charts and explore the dataset in much more depth. Hope you have a happy reading :)"}}
