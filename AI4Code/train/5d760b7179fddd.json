The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n## Content\nThe datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on","a49ea348":"### predicting the possibility of diabetes with the help of paramaters such as : \n\nPregnancies\t\nGlucose\t\nBloodPressure\t\nSkinThickness\t\nInsulin\t\nBMI\t\nDiabetesPedigreeFunction\t\nAge","5e26af4f":"\n![1.PNG](attachment:1.PNG)","eec71cc0":"here it does not make sense for Glucose;BloodPressure;SkinThickness;Insulin;BMI\tto have value as zero\n\n-->replacing zero with nan.","e19006c6":"To fill these Nan values the data distribution needs to be understood","3dc1815c":"Evaluation","9a73aeef":"Training and predicting","49afa82b":"Train Test Split\n![2.png](attachment:2.png)","8e35fa0e":"imputing nan values for the columns in accordance with their distribution","642bd69e":"creating logistic regression model"}}
