By combining the approaches into one model.\n\n\n- An example of hybrid recommender systems is Netflix website.\n\n- The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).\n\n\nSome hybridization techniques include:\n\n\n\u2022 **Weighted**: Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically.\n\n\u2022 **Switching**: Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one.\n\n\u2022 **Mixed**: Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.\n\n\u2022 **Feature Combination**: Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.\n\n\u2022 **Feature Augmentation**: Computing a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.\n\n\u2022 **Cascade**: Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.\n\n\u2022 **Meta-level**: One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.","b35a684b":"## **2.1 Data collection** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.1\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- The first step in building a recommendation engine is data collection.\n\n- There are two forms of data collection techniques employed in recommender systems.\n\n- These are **explicit** and **implicit** forms of data collection.\n\n- **Explicit data** is information that is provided intentionally, i.e. input from the users such as movie ratings.\n\n- **Implicit data** is information that is not provided intentionally but gathered from available data streams like search history, clicks, order history, etc.\n\n\n\n### **Examples of explicit data collection include the following**\n\n- Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.\n\n- Asking a user to search.\n\n- Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.\n\n- Presenting two items to a user and asking him\/her to choose the better one of them.\n\n- Asking a user to create a list of items that he\/she likes.\n\n\n\n### **Examples of implicit data collection include the following**\n\n\n- Observing the items that a user views in an online store.\n\n- Analyzing item\/user viewing times.\n\n- Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.\n\n- Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his\/her computer.\n\n- Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.","3eb731ad":"- We will find the user ratings for `Forrest Gump (1994) ` as follows-","13e06616":"- We can see that there are 2 files in the dataset - `ratings` and `movies`.

Cold start**\n\n- Cold start refers to a problem, when for a new user or item there is not enough data to make recommendations.\n\n\n\n#### **2. Scalability**\n\n- To make recommendations, we need to choose from millions of users and products. So scalability means a large amount of computation power is required to make recommendations.\n\n\n#### **3. Sparsity**\n\n- The number of items sold on e-commerce portals are extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.\n\n\n\n- Most famous example of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y). This algorithm is popularized by Amazon recommender system.\n\n- Social network companies like Facebook, originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends and groups by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends.\n\n- The diagram below demonstrates collaborative filtering recommender systems.","c2a8ba01":"There are several other approaches for recommender systems used in practice.

[Collaborative Filtering Recommender System](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Collaborative_filtering)** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- In the [collaborative filtering](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Collaborative_filtering) recommender system, the behaviour of a group of users is used to make recommendations to other users.\n\n- In this case, the system don\u2019t have any knowledge about the product.\n\n- Collaborative filtering approach build a model from a user\u2019s past behaviour (items previously purchased or selected and\/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users.\n\n- This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.\n\n- It recommends based on the user\u2019s rating in the past.\n\n- These systems try to predict the user\u2019s rating or preferences based on past rating or preferences of other users.\n\n- These filters do not require item metadata to make predictions.\n\n- There are two types of collaborative filtering recommender system. They are:-\n\n\n### **1. User-based collaborative filtering**\n\n- In this method products are recommended to a user based on the fact that the products have been liked by users similar to the user.\n\n### **2. Item-based collaborative filtering**\n\n- This method identifies and predict similar items based on users\u2019 previous ratings.\n","8dbcc18c":"### **Beyond measures of accuracy**\n\nResearch on recommender systems is focussed towards finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms. There are a number of factors that are also important. These are discussed below.\n\n- **Diversity** \u2013 Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra-list diversity. For example, items from different artists.\n\n- **Recommender persistence** \u2013 Sometimes, it is more effective to re-show recommendations than showing new items. There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time. May be they do not inspect the recommendations initially.\n\n- **Privacy** \u2013 Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns because users have to reveal sensitive information.\n\n- **User demographics** \u2013 User demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations.\n\n- **Robustness** \u2013 When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed.\n\n- **Serendipity** \u2013 Serendipity is a measure of how surprising the recommendations are. For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate. But it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy.\n\n- **Trust** \u2013 A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system. Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations, and why it recommends an item.\n\n- **Labelling** \u2013 User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labelling of the recommendations.","2251ec6e":"- We will create a new dataframe called `ratings_mean_count` and first add the average rating of each movie to this dataframe as follows-","f1127cd7":"# **9. Introduction to Matrix Factorization** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"9\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- **Matrix factorization** is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms used in recommender systems.\n\n- **Matrix factorization** algorithms work by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices.\n\n- It became widely known during the Netflix prize challenge due to its effectiveness as reported by Simon Funk in 2006.\n\n- The idea behind matrix factorization is to represent users and items in a lower dimensional latent space.\n\n- Matrix factorization can be demonstrated by the following diagram-","98ee02e1":"# **10. Evaluating Recommender Systems** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"10\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- Once we develop a recommender system, we want to evaluate them.\n\n- Evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommender systems.\n\n- To measure the effectiveness of recommender systems, three types of evaluations are available \u2013 \n\n  - 1. user studies, \n  - 2. online evaluations (A\/B tests), and \n  - 3. offline evaluations.\n  \n  \n- The commonly used metrics are the mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error(RMSE).\n\n- The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall are useful to assess the quality of a recommender system.\n\n- Diversity, novelty and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.\n\n- User studies are rather small scale judgement technique. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users\u2019 judge which recommendations are the best.\n\n- In A\/B tests, recommendations are shown to thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. \n\n- The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as conversion rate or click-through rate.\n\n- Offline evaluations are based on historic data. For example, a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.\n\n- The effectiveness of recommendation system is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset.","d491fb3e":"- We can see that the integer values have taller bars than the floating values since most of the users assign rating as integer value i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. \n\n- Furthermore, it is evident that the data has a weak normal distribution with the mean of around 3.5. There are a few outliers in the data as well.","03fdf66a":"- The graph shows that, in general, movies with higher average ratings actually have more number of ratings, compared with movies that have lower average ratings.","8d14fe40":"- We can see from the output that the `ratings.csv` file contains the - `userId`, `movieId`, `ratings` and `timestamp` attributes. \n\n- Each row in the dataset corresponds to one rating. The userId column contains the ID of the user who left the rating. The movieId column contains the Id of the movie, the rating column contains the rating left by the user. Ratings can have values between 1 and 5. \n\n- Finally, the timestamp refers to the time at which the user left the rating.\n\n- There is one problem with this dataset. It contains the IDs of the movies but not their titles. We will need movie names of the movies to recommend. The movie names are stored in the `movies.csv` file. So, let's explore that file.","366ef979":"- From the above plot, we can see that most of the movies have received less than 50 ratings and there are no movies having more than 100 ratings.","16567bc4":"- Now, we will retrieve all the movies that are similar to `Forrest Gump (1994)`. \n\n- We can find the correlation between the user ratings for the `Forest Gump (1994)` and all the other movies using `corrwith()` function as shown below:","e8c8353c":"# **11.

This means that only three users gave same ratings to `Forest Gump (1994)`. \n\n- However, we can deduce that a movie cannot be declared similar to the another movie based on just 3 ratings. This is why we added `rating_counts` column. \n\n- Now, let's now filter movies correlated to `Forest Gump (1994)`, that have more than 50 ratings. \n\n- The following code snippet will do that-"}}
