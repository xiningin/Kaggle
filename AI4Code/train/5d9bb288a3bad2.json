This will be a simple network with one hidden layer.\n\nFirst, we need to set some placeholder variables to define how we want the network to be set up.","99df3ffb":"At this point we're finally ready to train our model! In PyTorch we have to write our own training loops before getting to actually train the model. This can seem daunting at first, so let's break up each stage of the training process. \n\nThe bulk of the function is handled by a nested `for` loop, the outer looping through each epoch and the inner looping through all of the batches of images in our dataset. Each epoch has a **training** and **validation** phase, where batches are served from their respective loaders. Both phases begin by feeding a batch of inputs into the model, which implicity calls the forward() function on the input. Then we calculate the loss of the outputs against the true labels of the batch. \n\nIf we're in training mode, here is where we perform back-propagation and adjust our weights. To do this, we first zero the gradients, then perform backpropagation by calling `.backward()` on the loss variable. Finally, we call `optimizer.step()` to adjust the weights of the model in accordance with the calculated gradients.\n\nThe remaining portion of one epoch is the same for both training and validation phases, and simply involves calculating and tracking the accuracy achieved in both phases. A nifty addition to this training loop is that it tracks the highest validation accuracy and only saves weights which beat that accuracy, ensuring that the best performing weights are returned from the function.","000acda8":"How the tensor is put together is going to be important, so there are some \nbuilt-in commands in torch that allow you to find out some information about the tensor you are working with.","d65c3615":"### PyTorch Training\n\nNow we create an instance of this `NeuralNet()` class and define the `criterion` and `optimizer` we'll use to train our model. \nIn our case we'll use **Binary Cross Entropy Loss**, a commonly used loss function for binary classification problems.\n\nFor the `optimizer` we'll use **Adam**, an easy to apply but powerful optimizer which is an extension of the popular **Stochastic Gradient Descent** method. We need to pass it all of the trainable parameters with `model.parameters()` and the **learning rate** we'll use.","d2e95b29":"### PyTorch Dataset\nOur next step is to create PyTorch **Datasets** for our training and validation sets. `torch.utils.data.Dataset` is an abstract class that represents a dataset and has several handy attributes we'll utilize from here on out. \n\nTo create one, we simply need to create a class which inherits from PyTorch's `Dataset` class and override the constructor, as well as the `__len__()` and `__getitem__()` methods.","bd5b564a":"## What are we looking at?\n\nThis is a fairly small dataset that includes some basic information about an individual's health. \n\nUsing this information, we should be able to make a model that will allow us to determine if a person has diabetes or not. \n\nThe last column, `Outcome`, is a single digit that tells us if an individual has diabetes. \n\nWe need to clean up the data a bit, so let's get rid of the first row with the labels on them.","5cd2bdf1":"Ehhhhhh, that's not bad...\n\nThere's probably a bunch of things we could do to improve accuracy.\n\n**Why don't we have you give it a shot?**\n\n## Make this model better!\n\nThere is no right or wrong way to optimise this model. Use your understanding of Neural Networks as a launching point. You can use the previous code-cells to save some time.\n\nThere are many aspects to this model that can be changed to increase accuracy, like:\n* Make the NN deeper (increase number of layers)\n* Change the learning rate\n* Add more hidden units\n* train for more epochs\n* and a whole bunch more!\n\n[Just Do It](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZXsQAXx_ao0?t=2)","189e1e22":"## Tensors\n\nTensors live at the heart of `PyTorch`.\n\nYou can think of tensors as an $N$-dimensional data container similar to the containers that exist in `numpy`. \n\nBelow we have some *magical* tensor stuff going on to show you how to make some tensors using the built-in tensor generating functions.","c4e8316a":"### PyTorch Model\n\nWe need to define how we want the neural network to be structured, \nso let's set those hyper-parameters and create our model.","fa220327":"Now, let's train!\n\nTo train, we combine all the different parts that we defined into one for loop.","f33c7c1c":"Next, we are going to define what our model looks like.
