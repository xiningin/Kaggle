Since knowing BldgType tells us more about how GrLivArea relates to SalePrice, we should consider including BldgType in our feature set.\n\nThe trend lines for MoSold, however, are almost all the same. This feature hasn't become more informative for knowing BldgType.","b8afe024":"In this step you'll investigate possible interaction effects for the BldgType feature. This feature describes the broad structure of the dwelling in five categories:\n\nBldg Type (Nominal): Type of dwelling\n\n1Fam    Single-family Detached   \n  \n2FmCon    Two-family Conversion; originally built as one-family dwelling\n  \nDuplx    Duplex\n\nTwnhsE    Townhouse End Unit\n\nTwnhsI    Townhouse Inside Unit\n\nThe BldgType feature didn't get a very high MI score. A plot confirms that the categories in BldgType don't do a good job of distinguishing values in SalePrice (the distributions look fairly similar, in other words):","3199cdd3":"#Examine MI Scores\n\nDo the scores seem reasonable? Do the high scoring features represent things you'd think most people would value in a home? Do you notice any themes in what they describe?","8fd78170":"Still, the type of a dwelling seems like it should be important information. Investigate whether BldgType produces a significant interaction with either of the following:\n\nGrLivArea  - Above ground living area\n\nMoSold     -  Month sold","9fd25108":"#The trend lines being significantly different from one category to the next indicates an interaction effect.","877a80b3":"#Examine the scores using the functions in this cell. Look especially at top and bottom ranks.","769f1069":"Some common themes among most of these features are:\n\nLocation: Neighborhood\n\nSize: all of the Area and SF features, and counts like FullBath and GarageCars\n\nQuality: all of the Qual features\n\nYear: YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd\n\nTypes: descriptions of features and styles like Foundation and GarageType\n\nThese are all the kinds of features you'll commonly see in real-estate listings (like on Zillow), It's good then that our mutual information metric scored them highly. On the other hand, the lowest ranked features seem to mostly represent things that are rare or exceptional in some way, and so wouldn't be relevant to the average home buyer.","927ec6ac":"#Understanding Mutual Information\n\nBased on the plots, which feature do you think would have the highest mutual information with SalePrice?\n\nBased on the plots, YearBuilt should have the highest MI score since knowing the year tends to constrain SalePrice to a smaller range of possible values. This is generally not the case for MoSold, however. Finally, since ScreenPorch is usually just one value, 0, on average it won't tell you much about SalePrice (though more than MoSold) .\n\n\n\nThe Ames dataset has seventy-eight features -- a lot to work with all at once! Fortunately, you can identify the features with the most potential.\n\nUse the make_mi_scores function (introduced in the tutorial) to compute mutual information scores for the Ames features:"}}
