The blockage is most often a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries).\n\nThe plaque eventually breaks away and forms a clot. The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.\n\nA heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal, but treatment has improved dramatically over the years, however the diagnosis for heart diseases are expensive and complex. \n\nThe tests you'll need to diagnose your heart disease depend on what condition your doctor thinks you might have. No matter what type of heart disease you have, your doctor will likely perform a physical exam and ask about your personal and family medical history before doing any tests. Besides blood tests and a chest X-ray, tests to diagnose heart disease can include[1]:\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG).\nHolter monitoring. \nEchocardiogram. \nStress test. \nCardiac catheterization.\nCardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan. \nCardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n[1]https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/heart-disease\/diagnosis-treatment\/drc-20353124\n\nLets see how Machine Learning Models are used in predicting Heart Attack in human.\n\nContext\nThis database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The \"goal\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.\n\nContent\n\nAttribute Information: \n*  age \n* sex \n* chest pain type (4 values) \n* resting blood pressure \n* serum cholestoral in mg\/dl \n* fasting blood sugar > 120 mg\/dl\n* resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)\n* maximum heart rate achieved \n* exercise induced angina \n* oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest \n* the slope of the peak exercise ST segment \n* number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy \n* thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect"}}
