For details, please see [The Three-Headed Dragon: Electricity, Trading, Analysis](https:\/\/www.mbureau.energy\/articles\/three-headed-dragon-electricity-trading-analysis-first-head-electricity).\n\nThe significant turnover share of the Electricity Wholesale Market of Russia comes from the so-called day-ahead market. In 2018, the day-ahead market made up 75% of the turnover. On the day-ahead market, a consumer buys its electricity consumption plan for the following day. Note, the plans are being traded. Later, when actual consumption values are received from measurement systems, the consumer buys or sells deviation between the day-ahead plan and actual volume. In Russia, this deviation market is called the balancing market; it made up 5% of turnover in 2018.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at consumer deals. Assume the consumer planned to consume 100 MWh between 0:00 and 1:00. This is a forecast. In reality, it consumes 99 MWh, which is slightly less than the plan. The consumer will buy 99 MWh the following way:\n* First, buy 100 MWh on the day-ahead market by day-ahead price.\n* Second, sell 1 MWh on the balancing market by a **minimum of two prices**: day-ahead price and balance market price.\n\nIn a different reality, when the consumer consumes more than plan, for example 101 MWh, the deals look the following way:\n* First, buy 100 MWh on the day-ahead market by day-ahead price.\n* Second, buy 1 MWh on the balancing market by a **maximum of two prices**: day-ahead price and balance market price.\n\nAs you can see, the pricing mechanism for deviations is organized in a way to push the consumer to plan as accurately as possible: the higher the consumption deviation, the higher total cost of electricity and vice versa.\n\nThe positive side of the electricity market is that we can easily calculate the reduction of electricity cost, which comes from the improvement of the short-term consumption forecast accuracy by 1 MWh within the year. This is what I call **\u00abbenefit from improving\u00bb**.\n\n**Assess the benefit from improving**\n\nInput data are the day-ahead and balancing market prices. In my dataset, I upload the prices for the so-called United Energy System. The United Energy System is a large area (remember Russia is vast itself), the whole country comprises seven systems. The prices are available for three: UES_Northwest, UES_Siberia, UES_Center.\n\nNote that balancing market price is called an indicator because it\u2019s an auxiliary variable to define the deal price.\n\n","454c599a":"**The benefit from Improving for 2017-2019**\n\nAs a result, we may see that our benefit from improvement for the Northwest part of Russia is around 10,000\u201313,000 euros per year. For the Center of Russia, the European part of the country mainly, the benefit is from 8,500 to 9,500 euros per year. And for Siberia, the benefit is from 7,500 to 9,000 euros per year.\n\nIt does make sense to invest in math here!","ba3ead7d":"Function to calculate an electricity cost on the market."}}
