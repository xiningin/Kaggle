We will explore using Z Test and F Test (Anova). \n- Combining both MarketSize and Promotion indicates the same results as a statement above.\n- Calculating a number of marketing campaigns of each MarketSize for each Promotion shows Medium campaigns is the highest, followed by Large and then Small. It makes sense as Small MarketSize concentrating on old stores where people knew really well. Large MarketSize concentrating on new stores where people barely knew, so if marketing those places would generate huge profit. However Medium MarketSize received a lot of marketing campaign but return a little revenue.","fbe3a736":"### Analysis of the Target feature (SaleInThousands)","4c83a774":"# INTRODUCTION\n- Analyze marketing campaign based on sales, location, and other key metrics\n- Figure out which channels, campaigns, or anything help us predict sale from customers \n\n# Scenario\nA fast food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.\n\nOur first major focus on 3 size of Market campaign:\n- Small\n- Medium\n- Large\n\nOur second major focus on 3 promotional strategies:\n1. Collectibles - Fast food companies can drive sales through collectibles, particularly those that kids enjoy. For instance, a popular animated film, dolls, glasses or other mementos that are related to the movie. The owners decided to provide one free item for the purchase of the vegan patty burger. This fast food marketing strategies entices people to come back until they have all the collectibles.\n\n2. Societal Marketing - It includes volunteering or collecting money or items for charity. Consumers who relate to our ideas and values due to our charitable work may, in turn, patronize our fast food restaurant.\n\n3. Loyalty Programs - Frequency card programs are a popular type of loyalty program for fast food restaurants. The owners plan to invite people to fill out an application and reward them according to the frequency in which they order the particular product. They planned on giving a free drink after their first four orders, then free fries after their next four orders. Ultimately, a customer could earn a free meal after 12 orders.\n\nDetailed description of dataset content is described in the following link:\nhttps:\/\/www.ibm.com\/communities\/analytics\/watson-analytics-blog\/marketing-campaign-eff-usec_-fastf\/","818e0cdf":"# CREDITS\nThis work is inspired by multiple greate sources done before:\n\n- https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/hypothesis-testing-in-machine-learning-using-python-a0dc89e169ce\n- https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/inferential-statistics-series-t-test-using-numpy-2718f8f9bf2f\n- https:\/\/rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com\/365114_c8b996abd737463fa7f952e96ab34480.html\n- https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/communities\/analytics\/watson-analytics-blog\/marketing-campaign-eff-usec_-fastf\/","0fb33f84":"##### Obvervation\n- We figure out which promotion is different from others.\n- p-value between promotion 1 and 2 is so small, indicating a strong evidence against null hypothesis.\n- p-value between promotion 1 and 3 is greater than 0.05, indicating a strong evidence of null hypothesis.\n- p-value between promotion 2 and 3 is so small, indicating a strong evidence against null hypothesis.\n- We know promotion 1 and 3 outperform promotion 2, and the difference between  promotion 1 and 3 is not statistically different.","244b6a07":"# Result from the Study\n- A particular MarketSize appear with 1 LocationID\n- Most Sale come from medium and large market which receive a large number of marketing campaign as well. \n- However the average sale is more important to consider when it show that Large and Small MarketSize display a significant sales.\n- Promotion 1 and 3 are quite at the same sales figure level.\n- The majority of store age is young.\n- Sale in all weeks are the almost same.\n- Conducting A\/B Test on Promotion to find out if all promotions are alike.\n- Modeling the whole dataset in linear regression model as a way to comfirm all statements above is right.","f7e5b337":"# Performing A\/B Testing","5228bf62":"# DATA EXPLORATION","dbd36fbb":"#### MarketID and MarketSize\n- Any MarketID is accompanied by only one MarketSize\n- MarketID with MarketSize of Large and Small place on the top Sales, while those with MarketSize of Medium come last.","88c6bf9e":"#### AgeOfStore\n- Most Age of Stores cluter on the left side.","96f4bdcb":"# A\/B Test for Marketing Campaigns\n### Vu Duong\n#### June, 2020","afd59b4b":"### F-Test and Z-Test overview\n- Threshold that reject the Null is usually less than 0.05.\n- P-Value is close to 0 which suggests that there is good evidence to REJECT the Null Hypothesis, leading a statistical difference between the two groups.\n- Sample size is greater than 30.
