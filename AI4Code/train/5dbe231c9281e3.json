citizens perceive themselves to be. The World Happiness Report 2020 for the first time ranks cities around the world by their subjective well-being and digs more deeply into how the social, urban and natural environments combine to affect our happiness.\n\nIn July 2011, the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 65\/309 'Happiness: Towards a Holistic Definition of Development' inviting member countries to measure the happiness of their people and to use the data to help guide public policy. On April 2, 2012, this was followed by the first UN High Level Meeting called Wellbeing and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm, which was chaired by UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon and Prime Minister Jigme Thinley of Bhutan, a nation that adopted gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product as their main development indicator.\n\nDrawing international attention, the report outlined the state of world happiness, causes of happiness and misery, and policy implications highlighted by case studies. In 2013, the second World Happiness Report was issued, and since then has been issued on an annual basis with the exception of 2014. The report primarily uses data from the Gallup World Poll. Each annual report is available to the public to download on the World Happiness Report website\n\n\n\n## METHODS AND PHILOSOPHY\n\nThe rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The report correlates the results with various life factors. In the reports, experts in fields including economics, psychology, survey analysis, and national statistics, describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations, and other topics. \n\nEach report is organized by chapters that delve deeper into issues relating to happiness, including mental illness, the objective benefits of happiness, the importance of ethics, policy implications, and links with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) approach to measuring subjective well-being and other international and national efforts.\n\nhttps:\/\/worldhappiness.report","d4491e46":"**Pearson** product moment correlation: evaluates the linear relationship between two continuous variables. A relationship is linear when a change in one variable is associated with a proportional change in the other variable.","a310c900":"### Heatmap of correlations\n\nThe darker red the square, the stronger the positive correlation, and obviously, variables will have a correlation of 1 with each other. We can see that happiness score is really strongly correlated with GDP and Healthy Life Expectation, followed by Social Support and Freedom. Thus, in our model, we should see that reflected when finding the coefficients. \n\nWhile trust and generosity to not have a strong positive correlation\u200a\u2014\u200awe can see that they do have a negative correlation to happiness score, so it would be beneficial to observe these variables in our model as well.\n\nObviously, there is an inverse correlation between \u201cHappiness Rank\u201d and all the other numerical variables. In other words, the lower the happiness rank, the higher the happiness score, and the higher the other seven factors that contribute to happiness.","852c5332":"Thats how our data ended up. ","db72cae8":"It looks like GDP, Family, and Life Expectancy are strongly correlated with the Happiness score. Freedom correlates quite well with the Happiness score, however, Freedom correlates quite well with all data. Government Trust still has a mediocre correlation with the Happiness score.\n\nMoving on, now that we have a bit of an understanding of the relationship between variables, we can start to use SkLearn to construct a model. First, we drop any categorical variables, and the happiness rank as that is not something we are exploring in this report. (That being said, we can create dummy variables to look at relationships for countries).","255c4266":"It's quite intereresting to see that the Top 10 Economies are distributed all across the Rank. I see that even though a high GDP per capta is assumed to bring happiness, the reality shows something diffetent. \n\nIn a next session I'll check how is the data correlated.","709535f8":"### Lasso regression\n\nIt is a type of linear regression that uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point, like the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). This particular type of regression is well-suited for models showing high levels of muticollinearity or when you want to automate certain parts of model selection, like variable selection\/parameter elimination.","7d2935a1":"### WHAT DOES MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY?\n\n* Is this GDP per capita which makes you happy ?\n* Is this Perception of Corruption about Government, which make you sad?\n* Is this Freedom of Life Choices which makes you happy ?","3b0387b2":"### Multiple Linear Regression\n\nA simple linear regression is a function that allows someone to make predictions about one variable based on the information that is known about another variable. Linear regression can only be used when one has two continuous variables\u2014an independent variable and a dependent variable. The independent variable is the parameter that is used to calculate the dependent variable or outcome. A multiple regression model extends to several explanatory variables.","b80c53a4":"**WHAT DOES MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY?**\n\nIs this GDP per capita which makes you happy ?\nIt seems like the common criticism for \"The World Happiness Report\" is quite valid. A high focus on GDP and strong attention to features like as family and life expectancy.\nCommon wisdom says that money makes you happy up to a certain threshold. Having a good social net is important and family tends to provide that. High life expectancy and health make you worry less about how you'll survive and focus more in things that make you happy\n\nIs this Perception of Corruption about Goverment, which make you sad?\nThe data about the perception of corruption is quite inconclusive because seems like everybody hates ther government. It can be a reflex of how information is difused nowadays and people are paying more attention to this subjec. \n\n\nIs this Freedom of Life Choises which makes you happy ?\nAs seen in the data, freedom correlates well with all other features. One of human basic needs is freedom, and that plays a central role in social process. Human development means to expand human choices, which it required to freedom concept.The idea of freedom is complex, and it must be redefined and defended by each generation. Moreover, the value of freedom can only be understood and appreciated by those who have a sense of the past and a highly developed understanding of human nature. All too often, people who live in freedom tend to ignore its fragility and take it for granted. Conversely, people who have not been raised within a long-standing tradition of freedom have trouble understanding and implementing it in their society.\n\n\n\n\n","14b8acec":"Last, but not least, let's take a look at the quartile  groups (4:'Top',3:'Top-Mid', 2:'Low-Mid', 1:'Low') and check how they're distributed across the world.","db669150":"### Linear Regression\n\nLinear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.","d5ec3ff5":"### Prediction\n\nI will implement several machine learning algorithms to predict happiness score. First, we should split our dataset into training and test set. Our dependent variable is happiness score, and the independent variables are family, economy, life expectancy, trust, freedom, generosity, and dystopia residual.","5a71683c":"In terms of GDP, African countries show a critical score for GDP as result of Several long-standing challenges that hold back progress. Around 640 million people currently live without electricity in Africa \u2013 210 million of which are in fragile and conflict-affected countries.  Public debt levels and debt risk are rising, which might jeopardize debt sustainability in some countries; the availability of good jobs has not kept pace with the number of entrants in the labor force; fragility is costing the subcontinent a half of a percentage point of growth per year; and gender gaps persist and are keeping the continent from reaching its full growth and innovation potential. More than 416 million Africans still live in extreme poverty.","9e6e7516":"### LETS TAKE A LOOK AT THE FEATURES OF EACH DATAFRAME\n\nAlso, select the columns needed.","eb88ef4b":"When people trust government institutions (the public service), they\u2019re more likely to take part in government processes.
