We can also use the validation data set to test the general accuracy of our model.","340d4a14":"Although it may not seem like it, we can also extract some useful information from the name column. Not the actual names themselves, but the title of their names like Ms. or Mr. This may also provide a hint as to whether the passenger survived or not. Therefore we can extract this title and then encode it like we did for Sex and Embarked.","c237310e":"<a id=\"p8\"><\/a>\n# **8. Evaluating Model Performances**\nAfter making so many models and predictions, we should evaluate and see which model performed the best and which model to use on our testing set.","69ebc2c0":"<a id=\"p3\"><\/a>\n# **3. Dealing with NaN Values (Imputation)**\nThere are NaN values in our data set in the age column. Furthermore, the Cabin column has a lot of missing values as well. These NaN values will get in the way of training our model. We need to fill in the NaN values with replacement values in order for the model to have a complete prediction for every row in the data set. This process is known as **imputation** and we will show how to replace the missing data.","82f72481":"This feature scaling may allow for higher accuracy for our models because of the reduced weight of their magnitudes!","2b0663e2":"There are 3 values for Embarked: *S*, *C*, and *Q*. We will represent these with numbers as well.","dc5a2eb0":"<a id=\"p5\"><\/a>\n# **5. Feature Engineering**\nBecause values in the Sex and Embarked columns are categorical values, we have to represent these strings as numerical values in order to perform our classification with our model. We can also do this process through **One-Hot-Encoding**.","ed0ff40a":"**GaussianNB Model**","526d4298":"Here is one final cumulative graph of a pair plot that shows the relations between all of the different features","7c2a44e4":"<a id=\"p7\"><\/a>\n# **7. Model Fitting, Optimizing, and Predicting**\nNow that our data has been processed and formmated properly, and that we understand the general data we're working with as well as the trends and associations, we can start to build our model. We can import different classifiers from sklearn. We will try different types of models to see which one gives the best accuracy for its predictions.","994e6fd7":"Wow! Cabin has a lot of missing values. Also, it seems as though the Ticket feature is too noisy to be useful. We can probably drop both features without it impacting the performance of our model.","f20472d4":"# **Machine Learning to Predict Titanic Survivors **\nHi, I'm a current undergraduate student interested in the Data Science and Machine Learning field. In this Kernel, I will step by step process messy data and build a ML model  to predict the survival of each passenger aboard the Titanic. This guide is meant for people starting with data visualization, analysis and Machine Learning. If that sounds like you, then you're in the right place! It is not as difficult as you think to understand.\n\n*Please upvote and share if this helps you!! Also, feel free to fork this kernel to play around with the code and test it for yourself. If you plan to use any part of this code, please reference this kernel!* I will be glad to answer any questions you may have in the comments. Thank You! \n\n*Make sure to follow me for Future Kernels even better than this one!*","32b66664":"**RandomForest Model**","44634130":"**Class**","40d808f9":"<a id=\"p4\"><\/a>\n# **4. Plotting and Visualizing Data**\nIt is very important to understand and visualize any data we are going to use in a machine learning model. By visualizing, we can see the trends and general associations of variables like Sex and Age with survival rate. We can make several different graphs for each feature we want to work with to see the entropy and information gain of the feature. ","e3a03c4f":"**KNeighbors Model**","b3af0f15":"This data looks very messy! We're going to have to preprocess it before it's ready to be used in Machine Learning models.","74a2f79d":"Nice! No more missing values. Now let's take a look at our imputed data.","2fcbe55a":"> **Note:** The numbers printed above are the proportion of male\/female survivors of all the surviviors ONLY. The graph shows the propotion of male\/females out of ALL the passengers including those that didn't survive.","350caac5":"<a id=\"p1\"><\/a>\n# **1. Importing Libraries and Packages**\nWe will use these packages to help us manipulate the data and visualize the features\/labels as well as measure how well our model performed. Numpy and Pandas are helpful for manipulating the dataframe and its columns and cells. We will use matplotlib along with Seaborn to visualize our data.","4d993bd2":"It appears that class also plays a role in survival, as shown by the bar graph. People in Pclass 1 were more likely to survive than people in the other 2 Pclasses.","81f16e22":"**SVC Model**","42ac0f10":"We can combine SibSp and Parch into one synthetic feature called family size, which indicates the total number of family members on board for each member. ","4ebf7474":"Gender appears to be a very good feature to use to predict survival, as shown by the large difference in propotion survived. Let's take a look at how class plays a role in survival as well.","935278a0":"<a id=\"p6\"><\/a>\n# **6. Feature Rescaling**\nIf you take a look at the Age and Fare features above, you can see that the values deviate heavily from the other features. This may cause some problems when we are modelling, since it may make these features seem more important than others. It would be beneficial to scale them so they are more representative. We can do this with both a MinMaxScaler or a StandardScaler. I will do this with a StandardScaler. The steps are shown below.","1ec629af":"Now, the next step for you would be to take a look at regression, the other type of supervised Machine Learning. I have written a kernel on another competition hosted by Kaggle, House Price Prediction. If you would like to read it and gain an understanding of regression, please click [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/samsonqian\/house-price-prediction-preprocessing-validation).","23064c6c":"## *Creating Synthetic Features*\nSometimes it is useful to create synthetic features that we think may help us predict the target value. ","5b4a9b31":"**XGBoost Model**","335c8ad1":"We change Sex to binary, as either 1 for female or 0 for male. We do the same for Embarked. We do this same process on both the training and testing set to prepare our data for Machine Learning."}}
