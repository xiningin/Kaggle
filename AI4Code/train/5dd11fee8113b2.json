As many people, you may have the urge to work with unique values. However, some books appeared on this list for over a year.

Probably, with that measure, the number of clients with Prime Subscription has increased significantly in this period. And that's another possible explanation on why the average number of reviews per book has increased more than 138% in two years.","121ff554":"Even though non fiction books are significantly more expensive, they are more popular? Do you have any theory on why this happened?","66ee3b72":"As you could see during this analysis, I tried to look at this data from a different perspective and I surely brought up more questions than answers. However, I belive that, when it comes to data analysis, it is really important to be curious and ask as many questions as you can!","11f21caf":"As you can see, there is a strong negative correlation of these two factors, as we expected. That means that when the price goes up, the number of the reviews tend to decrease. However, the correlation only is not enough. It is important to analyse the p-value. Basically, \"when you perform a statistical test a p-value helps you determine the significance of your results in relation to the null hypothesis\". In this case, p-value is high, so we can't trust the result. If you wanna learn more about p-value, there is a link below:\n\n* https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/p-value.html\n","462ce6b3":"As you can see, in 2014 there were more fiction books in that list than no fiction. However, in the following year, the difference between these two genres increased greatly, with non fiction books in the lead. Does it mean that Amazon's clients regreted reading that much non fiction books in the preview's year?

Do you have any possible explanation for why this happened?**","3b2a2775":"The histogram shows how the data is distributed. It's important to know that the data is divided in intervals, called bins. In the graph above, we can see that the most common user ratings are between 4.6 and 4.7.
