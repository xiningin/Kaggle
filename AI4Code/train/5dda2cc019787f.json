Write a query to get the average number of riders per station for each year in the dataset and order by the year so you can see the trend.

You can use the public Austin bike share dataset from the `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` table. You predict the number of rides based on the station where the trip starts and the hour when the trip started.

(Optional)\nGROUP BY ... (Optional)\n```\n\nThe `model_type` and `optimize_strategy` shown here are good parameters to use in general for predicting numeric outcomes with BQML.\n\n**Tip:** Using ```CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL``` rather than just ```CREATE MODEL``` ensures you don't get an error if you want to run this command again without first deleting the model you've created.","2680696e":"## 3) Exercise: Create and train the model\n\nBelow, write your query to create and train a linear regression model on the training data."}}
