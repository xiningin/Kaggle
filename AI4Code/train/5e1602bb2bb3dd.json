At its core is the FFmpeg program itself, designed for command-line-based processing of video and audio files, and widely used for format transcoding, basic editing (trimming and concatenation), video scaling, video post-production effects, and standards compliance (SMPTE, ITU).\n\nFFmpeg includes libavcodec, an audio\/video codec library used by many commercial and free software products, libavformat (Lavf),[7] an audio\/video container mux and demux library, and the core ffmpeg command-line program for transcoding multimedia files.\n\nFFmpeg is part of the workflow of hundreds of other software projects, and its libraries are a core part of software media players such as VLC, and has been included in core processing for YouTube and iTunes. Codecs for the encoding and\/or decoding of most audio and video file formats is included, making it highly useful for the transcoding of common and uncommon media files into a single common format.\n\nThe name of the project is inspired by the MPEG video standards group, together with \"FF\" for \"fast forward\".[8] The logo uses a zigzag pattern that shows how MPEG video codecs handle entropy encoding.[9]\n\nFFmpeg is published under the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1+ or GNU General Public License 2+ (depending on which options are enabled).[10]"}}
