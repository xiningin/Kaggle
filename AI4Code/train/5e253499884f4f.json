Learning how and when shoppers will research and purchase goods online is important to businesses as they can use customer behavior insights to target advertising, marketing, and deals to potential customers to further increase their sales and revenue. \n\n\n\n\n![ShoppingImage](https:\/\/images.pexels.com\/photos\/749353\/pexels-photo-749353.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=paper-bags-near-wall-749353.jpg&fm=jpg =250x150)\n\n\n**The Data:**\n[Link](http:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset#)<br>\nThe data set is a set of 18 features: 10 numerical and 8 categorical. This dataset has 12330 entries, split into 10,422 entries where the shoppers did not purchase and 1908 entries where the shoppers did purchase. Each entry is based on unique users in a 1-year period to avoid any trends specific to a specific campaign. \n","1a9e74bc":"## Feature Cleaning\n\nWe will try classification prior to any feature engineering to see a baseline classification based on our features. In order to prepare our data, we need to switch our labels to the correct format. We have a few features that need to be adjusted.\n\nFirst, we drop the month column. The 'Month' column only has 10 unique types, which indicates that it is missing two month's of data. Each month has varying numbers of entries, which could unfairly bias our data to prefer classification by month. We can see below the distribution of each month in the 'Month' column. Additionally, time-sensitivity is already contained in the 'SpecialDay' column, which influences buying decision, so the month column is slightly redundant.","2b40a525":"We can see here that the 'Month' column is missing January and April. We can see visually that several months have many samples (May, Nov) and a couple have very few samples (Feb, June). We will remove this column.\n\nNext, let us take a look at the 'OperatingSystems' and 'Browser' columns.","6fbb977a":"Seeing these feature importances, we want to simplify our model to only use features that may heavily contribute to our classification. Using our feature importance chart, we will take the top 5 most impactful features: PageValues, ExitRates, ProductRelated_Duration, BounceRates, ProductRelated. In addition, after creating the simplififed model, we want to measure the effectiveness of our model by using cross validation.","9a4fe75a":"Browser choice is even more polarizing than Operating System. Here we see that a large majority of users use browser 2, with a smaller number of users using browser 1. All other browsers represent a small subsection of online users. We will not use this as it does not contribute much to our model.\n\nThere are several other columns that we leave out:\n\n'Region': We leave regionality out because the regionality may be slightly tied to purchase likelihood, but we want to train our model on a smaller set of features if possible.\n\n'TrafficType': We leave this column out because Traffic sources are not quite useful for calssifying if a user will make a purchase. It usually aids website owners in gauging traffic sources and can assist with determining where they should invest in advertisement.\n\n'Weekend':There is weak correlation between days of the week and online shopping. https:\/\/blog.workarea.com\/trends-when-do-people-shop-online asserts that Sundays and Mondays have the highest traffic for eCommerce, but only by 16% of weekly revenue, and mostly on Monday, which is not classified as a weekend.","6ae99d3c":"Here we can see that there are no null values in the dataset. \nWe do not need to fix or replace any null values in the dataset.","69858b6b":"## Random Forest Classifier","dd822be1":"We can see that the number of entries where the customer ended up not purchasing is much higher that the number of entries where the customer ended up completing a transaction.
