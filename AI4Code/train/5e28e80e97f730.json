Although Kernel resources were increased recently we still can not train useful CNNs without GPU. The other main problem is that Kernels can't use network connection to download pretrained keras model weights. This dataset helps you to apply your favorite pretrained model in the Kaggle Kernel environment.\n\nHappy data exploration and transfer learning!"}}
