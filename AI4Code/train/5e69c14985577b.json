I go into a bit more detail as to why this is useful and how much it improves results in this post.\n\n#### What did you not understand about this process?\nWell, everything provides in the competition data page. I've no problem while working on it. If you guys don't understand the thing that I'll do in this notebook then please comment on this notebook.\n\n#### What else do you think you can try as part of this approach?\nLook at a notebook which presents feature engineering (based on the insights of this EDA) and a linear model which makes use of the features.","e1d8f6ca":"#### What are you trying to do in this notebook?\n- Importing Libraries\n- Loading the data\n- Preprocessing\n- Hyperperameter Optimization\n- Model Training\n\n#### Why are you trying it?\nWhen reading in our files, we can pass the 'date' column in a list in the parse_dates argument. This transforms the column's datatype from str to datetime64 and allows us to extract more information from the dates later.\nInstead of using a single 'date' feature, we will split it up into three separate features of 'year', 'month' and 'day'. We can also derive some useful information from the dates, like whether is falls on a weekend, what quarter it's in, and so on. Lastly, we will add a time-step feature that counts the days that have passed since the first date in the dataset. Thank you to @siukeitin for his help with the last one.\nWe will be using Optuna to find optimal hyperparameter values and add regularization to combat overfitting.\nAs we are dealing with time series, we can't use regular Kfold cross-validation. If we did, we would train our model on future data and predict past data, resulting in data leakage. Instead, we need to make sure predictions are made only on folds that come after the folds used for training. Luckily, scikit-learn offers a time series cross-validator, called TimeSeriesSplit."}}
