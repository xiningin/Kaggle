The reason is that interpolating the right way isn't easy or either obvious.\n\nYou could use a linear interpolation (connect points with a line) or a binomial interpolation (connect three points with a piece of polynom) or (sometimes the best for sound) use a Fourier transform and interpolate in the space of frequency. Since fourier transform isn't something you want to re-write by hand, if you want a good subsampling\/supsampling, See the following picture for two curves of upsampling using a different algorithm from scipy. The \"resampling\" function use fourier","8e983ac0":"# **Thankyou For Reading**","038cab03":"![](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/93KOf.png)","6fafe729":"![](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/ptACM.png)"}}
