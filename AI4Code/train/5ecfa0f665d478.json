First we create a Keras Sequential model which is nothing but a stack of layers.\n\n2.) Next we have to add the convolutional and the pooling layers to our model. The number of convolutional layers as well as the number and position of a pooling layer is a hyperparameter which we need to decide. Also we have other hyperparameters such as the 'activation function','stride','padding','the number as well as the size of the filter' and etc... .\n\n  Note that in a ConvNet the convolution layer generally has the padding of zeros so that the spatial dimesnions of input volume and output volume are same. Hence we have used the 'padding='same'' arguement. Whereas in a pooling layer the padding is not applied in general.\n  \n  Also note that we have other types of pooling operations also but MaxPooling layer is known to perform better in most cases.\n\n3.) To further improve the model performance we can use the batch normalization. In our model I have used the batch normalization after each convolutonal layer but that depends on us.\n\n4.) In order to further prevent overfitting we can use the 'Dropout' technique. The dropout randomly drops nodes from the network and thus reduces the dependency on any one neuron. Because of this each neuron learns better and the whole network's performance is expected to get better. To use Dropout we need to set the 'DroputRate' which  is the fraction of the neurons to drop at random from each layer in the network. Note that Dropout is in general applied after the MaxPooling operation.\n\n5.) After this what follows is fully connected layers similar to what we would expect in the artificial neural network. Since it expects 1D input we add a Flatten layer to precede it.\n\n6.) Note that we can add as many fully connected layers as we want and can use Batch Normalization and Dropout here too.\n    The number of the units and the activation function('relu' used here) are the hyperparameters as usual.\n\n7.) Lastly what follows is the output layer. The output units in the output layer equals the number of categories in which we want to classify the target.The activation funtion used is 'softmax' since we have a multi-classification problem.","33ac51c5":"Data augmentation is a really powerful technique. It helps in increasing the size of the training set by just making modifications to the images. In this way the size of the training set is increased and hence further reduces chances of overfitting.\n\nIn order to avoid overfitting problem, we need to expand artificially our handwritten digit dataset. We can make your existing dataset even larger. The idea is to alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations occuring when someone is writing a digit.\n\nFor example, the number is not centered The scale is not the same (some who write with big\/small numbers) The image is rotated...\n\nApproaches that alter the training data in ways that change the array representation while keeping the label the same are known as data augmentation techniques. Some popular augmentations people use are grayscales, horizontal flips, vertical flips, random crops, color jitters, translations, rotations, and much more.\n\nBy applying just a couple of these transformations to our training data, we can easily double or triple the number of training examples and create a very robust model.\n\nBelow I have used the ImageGenerator class from Keras I order to augment the data.","6fbfcaf1":"Finally we need to fit our model on the data or rather the 'augmented data'.

In this way for a 'n' class classification problems our target variable will have n classes and hence after one hot encoding we shall have n labels with each label corressponding to a particular target class.\n\nHere we have 10 digits (or target classes) ie from 0--->9 and so we one hot encode the target using 10 classes.","b0609e6f":"<a id=\"content4\"><\/a>\n## 4 ) Modelling ","3938ccbd":"<a id=\"content5\"><\/a>\n## 5 ) Making Predictions on the Validation Set","281495d0":"Note that the neural networks are quite sensitive towards the scale of the features.
