Energy and loudness of the tracks are directly proportional, means if the loudness of a track increases then chances of it being energetic are quite higher. On contrary, a high pich track reducess the acousticness (A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.)","f464b2fd":"As we can see Post Malone and XXXTENTACTION's 6 tracks eacch have made it to the top 100 hits of this year on Spotify. Whereas Eminem's just 1 song is in the top 100 (may be it will be title track of 'Venom', we will see). \n\nBut, number of tracks wonn't gaurantee you Grammy! May be Childish Gambino, whose not even 1 song could make to the top 100s list, could tell you more about it :P  "}}
