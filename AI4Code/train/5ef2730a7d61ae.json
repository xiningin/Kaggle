I did not submit the result from this kernel but if I did, it would score 100% on Kaggle's leaderboard. I performed kNN k=1 with Kaggle's 28,000 \"test.csv\" images against MNIST's original dataset of 70,000 images in order to see if the images are the same. The result verifies that Kaggle's unknown \"test.csv\" images are entirely contained unaltered within MNIST's original dataset with known labels.
