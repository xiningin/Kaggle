course. We can see concentration of raters at the bottom between 0 to 50,000 subscribers.\n* Sparse number of courses with both very high number of subscribers and high ratings are mostly paid courses.\n* A very high number of unpaid courses with less than 50,000 have good ratings ranging from 3.5 to 5.0, which I find impressive.","ad021457":"## Number of Reviews vs Paid\/Free courses","38c7e83c":"From my observation, it is only logical for discounts and price details to be null, if payments were not made for those courses (where is_paid is False).","77eaf695":"The vast majority of courses with good ratings of 4.0 are priced around 20 and 120 dollars(deeper shade of green).

However, we can see a large number of courses within the range of 0 to 200 published lectures having better chances of ratings above average.","5a059562":"## Price Amount vs Published Practice Tests","8fffa525":"## Published Practice Tests vs Rating","d7153afe":"# Overview\nThis dataset is a compilation of all the development related courses ( 13 thousand courses) which are available on Udemy's website. Under the development category, there are courses from Finance, Accounting, Book Keeping, Compliance, Cryptocurrence, Blockchain, Economics, Investing & Trading, Taxes and much more each having multiple courses under it's domain.\n\nThe end goal of this notebook is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis, as well as show other data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.\n\n#### Main Question\nWhich feature(s) affects the ratings of courses on Udemy?","201415d3":"## Number of Published Lectures vs Rating","116f38b0":"## Price Amount vs Rating","09ab348b":"# Key Takeaway\n\nFollowing this exploratory analysis, there were a few things that stood out about Udemy ratings:\n* Majority of free courses with lesser pushlished lectures tend to have better ratings (above average) compared to paid courses.\n* The number of subscribers does not ultimately signify good ratings. There were indeed, low subscribed courses with very good ratings over 3.5. Like the saying goes, \"quality over quantity\".\n* From a course instructor's standpoint, it should be noted that the number of published tests does not guarantee very good rating for a course. We could see a vast majority courses with 0 tests climbing the ratings ladder with excellent points.\n* After analysising variables affecting ratings, I can come to a conclusion that the pricing of courses have adverse effect on rating of courses. Courses around 10 - 20 dollars seemed to have impressive ratings over a handful of more expensive courses. However, there is a caveat but before diving into that, we should bear in mind that most courses on Udemy are discounted and offered at the 10 - 20 dollars rate which makes sense in my conclusion above. A reviewer rating a 10 dollars course will have different expectations compared to when rating a more expensive course. This can have a biased effect on overall ratings and public impression on a course.","c0024e17":"# Data Cleaning Process and more visuals","1e98ea89":"Majority of free courses have better ratings(above 3.5) compaired to paid courses. Also, the higher the number of reviews, the greater chance of an above average rating.","e804745e":"## Number of Subscribers vs Rating","edf14bee":"Price of a course being too low or high does not affect the number of subscribers. We have a good number of subscribers on courses priced around 120 dollars.","4faf386b":"## Number of Subscribers vs Paid\/Free courses","f50cc34e":"# Visualizations","2d3ef797":"Based on this graph, it will be wise to drop one of the above feature since they are linear and have similar data."}}
