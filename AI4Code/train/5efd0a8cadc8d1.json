The number prefix tells you how many bonds there are between the two atoms; the last two letters are the two elements involved. For example, 1JHC, means that the coupling is between one hydrogen and one carbon atom, and there is only one bond between them. \n\nSince the coupling strength is inversely proportional to the number of bonds, 1JHN and 1JHC have the strongest coupling. \n\nAll of the coupling constants are positive except for 2JHH, which is negative. \n\nNote that since the maximum number of bonds is three, there are at most two atoms in between the atoms of interest.
