Histograms plot binned quantitative data while bar charts plot categorical data. Bars can be reordered in bar charts but not in histograms.**\n\nNote that there are no spaces between the bars of a histogram since there are no gaps between the bins. An exception would occur if there were no values in a given bin but in that case the value is zero rather than a space. On the other hand, there are spaces between the variables of a bar chart.\n\nThe bars of bar charts typically have the same width. The widths of the bars in a histogram need not be the same as long as the total area is one hundred percent if percents are used or the total count if counts are used. Therefore, values in bar charts are given by the length of the bar while values in histograms are given by areas. Wikipedia includes examples of histograms with bars of unequal width such as in Figure 1.\n\n![https%20_blogs-images.forbes.com_naomirobbins_files_2012_01_histogram_unequal.jpg](attachment:https%20_blogs-images.forbes.com_naomirobbins_files_2012_01_histogram_unequal.jpg)\n\nAlthough histograms are made up of bars, they are not bar charts.
