Data Science jobs stay open days longer than the more traditional job postings.\n\nCompanies are competing to acquire the best candidates and usually figuring out what the key tasks of a specific role would be is not straightforward.\n\nMonzo, in their [article about its Data team](https:\/\/monzo.com\/blog\/2019\/11\/04\/how-we-scaled-our-data-team-from-1-to-30-people-part-1) says:\n> Adding an ML component to our data roles also meant we changed our titles to \"Data Scientist\". And based on some anecdata, this helps us attract more people to our roles. A few years back we A\/B tested different titles for open data roles. And by changing the titles from Data Analyst to Data Scientist (without changing the job description), we could attract close to twice as many applications, of significantly higher quality too!\n\nIt's obvious that Data Scientist roles can vary significantly from company to company - data professionals usually have difficulty in finding what's the best type of company for them. \nA common dilemma when trying to decide which working environment suits you best is whether to focus on small or larger companies to apply. This is sensible; a Data Scientist's profile, role, and responsibilites might end up being quite different in start-ups or big corporations.\n\nSo, what should you expect when aiming for a role in a small company?
