However, the second-place product (H2O Driverless AI) did much better vs. the rest of the products in both segments. Such an obervation, if matched with the picture as of 2021, demonstrates that H2O Driverless AI was quite instrumental at converting those who just started exploring their product into solid paying customers. Therefore they grew more extensively from 2020 to 2021 vs. Databricks AutoML and DataRobot AutoML (although the latter ones demostrated certain growth in 2021, too).\n\n**Note:** We can see once more that freeware AutoML tools were used by much more users than the commercial enterprise-level Cloud AutoML products, as of 2020 (in every ML expenses segment).

Just a few things to be the same as of 2021 as well as of 2020 are listed below\n\n- Young and relatively unexperienced males (students or junior-level professionals with less then 5 years of programming experience) to predominate the Kaggle community\n- India to be the country with the biggest Kaggler community across the globe (as well as the country where the gap between male and female Data Science\/ML practioners diminishes in the fastest way vs. the rest of the countries across the globe)\n- USA to display the biggest community of the industry veterans (that is, the survey participants with 10+ years of ML experience and\/or 20+ years of programming experience)\n- China to still be underrepresented in Kaggle (as oppose to the actual level of research and industrial contributions from its scientific and business organizations in the area of ML and AI)\n- Python and R to be the preferred programming languages among the Kagglers\n- More and more users starting to use AutoML technologies from year to year (and yet the large fraction of the survey participants still reporting they do not use AutoML in their daily activities)\n- Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and MS Azure to be the leading Cloud Computing providers ('3 Giants') in the industry, well overcoming the rest of the known cloud platforms across the globe\n- Kaggle learning courses to be the great source of learning for students and entry-level junior professionals, with more senior and experienced professionals looking for knowledge and skills masterring eslewhere (Coursera, Udemy, Udacity, video blogs on Youtube, printed articles and blog posts etc.)\n- Etc. (the full list of what has not changed on Kaggle in 2021  vs. 2020 could take several pages of plain text typing, in fact)\n\nHowever, as W. Donovan, the foundeer to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), said, \"life is just a series of conformity tests\". Therefore Kaggle community had to face (and pass) a series of 'conformity tests' imposed on it by the evolution of the entire AI Industry in 2021. The major challenges that have driven such 'conformity tests' in 2021 arrived from the areas of\n\n- Cloud Computing impact on AI and ML technologies\n- Prolifiration of commercial Cloud ML platforms\n- Additional progress in AutoML technologies (especially wider adoption of commercial AutoML products and SaaS cloud-based platforms)\n\nMy article on KDNuggets (one of the leading global Data Science, ML and AI portals) in Jan 2021 ([\"Cloud Computing, Data Science and ML Trends in 2020\u20132022: The battle of giants\"](https:\/\/www.kdnuggets.com\/2021\/01\/cloud-computing-data-science-ml-trends-2020-2022-battle-giants.html)) got quite a big traction within the reader audience (it was respectively awarded with the Golden blog post bage as of Jan 2021). Therefore I was quite sure the further changes in Cloud Computing, Cloud ML and AutoML technology areas would affect both the  Kaggle community and the structure of questions in Kaggle 2021 Survey.\n\nOne more topic to investigate in the context of Cloud Computing, Cloud ML, AutoML and BigData impact on ML\/AI industry in general and Kaggle community in particular was strengthening of *Databricks* on the market (see Appendix A.2 below for the brief history of *Databricks*). With this company having the investments from all of three Cloud Computing giants (Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) as of Feb 2021 as well as recieving the largest valuation vs. its competitors as of Aug 2021, it becomes a really strong challenger to the industry. From this perspective, *Databricks* products\/offerings can potentially\n\n- partially cannibalize other BigData, Cloud ML and AutoML products of Big 3 Cloud Computing providers (AWS, MS Azure, Google Cloud Platform)\n- make a strong competition to the challenger products in Cloud ML and enterprise AutoML segments (H20.ai, DataRobot etc.)\n\nOn the *'sociological'* side of the research, I noticed a significant internal driver that could potentially re-shape Kaggle community, moving forward  (that is, the advent of the  strata of Data Scientists with 1-3 years of programming experience as one of the four largest groups of Kagglers as of 2021). \n\nTherefore I decided to compose this notebook as a series of separate data-driven 'mini-essays' having their separate questions to be answered (and the respective pieces of the survey data to be investigated). You will find them in the  subsequent chapters below\n\n1. **'Cloud ML: Databricks breaks the wall'** will outline where the Kaggle community (and the AI\/ML industry in general) evolves in terms of using the novel Cloud ML tools and products.\n2. **'AutoML Paradigm Change'** will draw insights on how the patterns of using AutoML changed in 2020-2021, and what we can expect from 2022 on, in terms of AutoML. The special attention will be paid to the commercial Auto ML product challengers (Databricks, DataRobot, H2O) that try to compete with the rival products from Big Three Cloud Giants (Amazon, Google, MS Azure)\n3. **'Advent of Junior Data Scientists'** will discuss the implication of this group of Kagglers to become one of the dominants in the community\n4. **'Forecast: Opportunities and Threats to Kaggle Community in 2022'** will present my subjective IMHO on the opportunities and threats to Kaggle Community in 2022 (with some inferences from the data of this survey)\n\nHowever, for ease of your digesting the key takeaways from this research, I put together the most tangible insights and findings in **Executive Summary** section that follows immediately below.\n\nLast, but not least, I prepared some supplementary materials in the Appendix below. They cover\n\n- References to my onw EDA notebooks with exhaustive analytics for Kaggle Survey 2020 and 2021 datasets\n- References to the  external articles and reports relevant in the context of this notebook\n- The brief summmary on the history of *Databricks* company\n- The brief summary of the differences between Kaggle Survey 2020 and Kaggle Survey 2021 in terms of the structure of their questions and option answers","6b7a2ece":"# <div style=\"color:white;background-color:#1d1545;padding:3%;border-radius:50px 50px;font-size:1em;text-align:center\">Appendix<\/div>","97a00921":"## <div style=\"font-size:20px;text-align:center;color:black;border-bottom:5px #0026d6 solid;padding-bottom:3%\">A.1.

These are\n\n- Computers\/Techology\n- Academia\/Education\n\nAccounting\/Finance industry, which takes the third place as of 2021, is far below the two leading industries in terms of the number of AutoML users.\n\n**Notes:** \n- We can see the AutoML products listed in the survey for 2021 to be Cloud AutoML products in fact (non-cloud-based products that were present in the respective section of the survey for 2020 have been dropped in the one for 2021)\n- Unfortunately the similar by-industry analysis for 2020 is not possible due to lack of the respective questions in the questionnaire of the Kaggle Survey 2020.","8ef77e8d":"We find that\n\n- Google Cloud AI Platform \/ Google Cloud ML Engine lead the ML cloud products usage 'nomination' as of 2020\n- The second and third best were Amazon SageMaker and Azure Machine Learning Studio, respectively\n- Data Scientists were the top users of cloud ML products (for every product investigated)\n- There was a huge chunk of responders who indicated they do not use cloud ML products at all - this indicates the market is under-saturated, and there is a good growth potential, subject to resolving the marketing and end-user barries on the way\n- Additionally, we see the professionals with programming experience of 3-5 years and 5-10 year to use the cloud ML products the most, as of 2020\n\nIf we consolidate the observations in 2020 and 2021 respectively, we see that\n\n- Google's move toward consolidating all of their Cloud ML products under the new unified platform (that is, Google Cloud Vertex AI) in 2021 did not yield the increase in the Google's market share in the enterprice (commercial) Cloud ML market;\n- Moreover, the major Cloud ML rivals within the Big Three Cloud Giants - Amazon SageMaker and Azure ML Studio - improved their positions, and they became the ultimate market leaders as of 2021 (with Amazon SageMaker taking the first place, being slightly ahead of Azure ML Studio)\n- Azure Congnitive Services have been excluded from the survey in 2021 so it is hard to estimate the  changes in its market position among the Kagglers vs. 2020\n- It is hard to estimate the market position changes for the challenger Cloud ML products (DataRobot, Databricks, Dataiku, Alteryx, Rapidminer) in 2021 vs. 2020 since they were not listed in the  survey for 2020 \n- However, we can see Databricks to take the third position in the Cloud ML product ranking as of 2021 (it is above Google Cloud Vertex AI, and it is slightly below Amazon SageMaker and Azure ML Studio)\n- other Cloud ML challenger products (DataRobot, Dataiku, Alteryx, Rapidminer) are well below Databricks and Google Cloud Vertex AI\n- Still, a large fraction of the respondents indicate they do not use Cloud ML in their daily activities at all (the side note is, 'None' for 2020 and 'None' for 2021 could have quite differnt meaning, due to the drastical difference in the list of Cloud ML products exposed as the survey options in 2020 and 2021, respectively)\n\nIf we try to interpret the observations above, matched with the major business development, fund raising, and publicity progress of Databricks achieved in Feb - Aug 2021 (see Appendix A.3 below for more details), we can tell that\n\n- Databricks has a strong offensive on Google's unified AI platform in 2021 (so the recent decision of Google to invest in Databricks was probably the trigger to good growth of Databricks market share in 2021)\n- Cloud ML industry leaders - Amazon SageMaker and Azure ML Studio - maintain the strong position vs. Databricks and Google Cloud Vertex AI as of the end of 2021\n- The further prolification of Databricks as a Cloud ML product in 2022 could be affected by the ongoing discussion whether doing ML on top of Spark is a good idea or not (while Spark ML is incredible powerful when it turns to the BigData-scale datasets, certain API drawbacks of Spark and Databricks leave some space for the criticism)\n- Azure ML Studio offerings is quite protected from the 'Databricks offencive' as Azure Cloud platform used to 'contain' Databricks as a solely BigData Engineering tool (with Azure Databricks service running in this role for a few years already)\n- the game changer in the Google Cloud ML ecosystem in 2022 could be the  massive promotion for their newest BigQuery ML offering; since it can be a real alternative to the BigData-scale ML offering of Databricks, it may change the landscape in Cloud ML tools in the upcoming year\n","357a4b1e":"**2021**","553b39cc":"Does it sound captivating?

These are as follows\n\n- any references to freeware open-source AutoML tools (like Tpot, Auto-Keras, Auto-Sklearn, Auto_ml, Xcessiv, and MLbox) have been eliminated in the structure of the respective survey questions in 2021\n- in turn, additional commercial AutoML products from Big Three Cloud Providers (namely, Azure Automated Machine Learning and Amazon Sagemaker Autopilot) appeared in the survey in 2021, and they occupied the second and the third positions in the top product list (with Google Cloud AutoML keeping its leading position both in 2020 and 2021)\n\n**Note:**  Due to the changes in the structure of the survey question regarding AutoML products, the semantics of 'None' answer is most likely to be quite different in 2020 and 2021; in 2020, it could be really indicative of the professionals not using AutoML in reality; in 2021, in turn, it could indicate the  professionals have not used any of the commercial AutoML products represented by the survey (however, they could still use some freeware products in this domain - like Tpot, Auto-Keras, Auto-Sklearn, Auto_ml, Xcessiv, MLbox, AutoViML etc.)\n\nWith that said, it makes sense to look at the success factors and growth barriers for the major AutoML products listed in 2021 charts.\n","fcbf68db":"As for the usage of Cloud AutoML tools by the companies in the different ML spending segments, we can see quite an interesting picture.\n\nIn the segment of the **king-size ML spendings (USD 100k+ annually)**, we see quite a tight competition. Although Google Cloud AutoML and H2O Driverless AutoML are slightly ahead of the competitors, the rest of the rival products are not far behind the leaders. It indicates every product listed in the 2021 survey has its own well-established market niche. \n\nIn the segment of the **middle-level ML spendings (USD 10000-99999 annually)**, we can see Google Cloud AutoML to be ahead of the competitors, with Azure Automated Machine Learning taking the second place. Amazon SageMaker Autopilot and H2O Driverless AutoML are on a par in the third tier of products within this spending category. The rest of the competitors are behind.\n\nIt looks like Google Cloud AutoML, Azure Automated Machine Learning, Amazon SageMaker Autopilot, and H2O Driverless AutoML to have good chances to improve their revenue from the companies in the middle-level ML spendings tier in 2022 (and H2O Driverless AutoML should do it elegantly, the way it did in the 2021 - see below for the comments regarding 2020 data).\n\nIn the **small-level ML spending segments**, Google Cloud AutoML and Azure Automated Machine Learning have the most users.","418a6191":"We can note that\n\n- Amazon SageMaker was among the leaders for all of the ML adoption groups as of 2020 (equally as in 2021)\n- Google' legacy AI products seemed to be a little more popular cumulatively vs. the level of popularity of the newest unified Cloud ML product (that is, Google Cloud Vertex AI) in 2021","ab22ee91":"Now, let's review how Cloud ML products mentioned in the **2020** survey have been used by the survey participants (with the breakdown by their occupation and programming experience).","68497329":"As of 2021, H2O Driverless AI is the most popular in India and USA. However, its national-level positions in these countries is quite different. \n\nIf India concerned, H2O Driverless AI is slightly above Azure Automated Machine Learning and well below Google Cloud AutoML.\n\nConversly, H2O Driverless AI takes the first place in the US rank of enterprise Cloud AutoML solutions. It is above both Google Cloud AutoML and Azure Automated Machine Learning. Since the US AutoML market is one of the biggest in terms of the budgets, such a position of H2O Driverless AI helps it to generate consistent revenue streams.\n\nThe rest of the countries is quite behind the leaders.","78aac67c":"We find quite an interesting insights for Cloud ML popularity in companies with the different level of ML adoption as of **2021**.\n\nIn terms of the Cloud ML user number, below are the top three groups of the organizations as of 2021\n- organizations that just explore ML methods\n- organizations with well-established ML methods\n- organizations that started using ML methods recently\n\nSo, the majority of the organizations represented by the Kaggle 2021 survey participants have been doing active practical steps on AutoML tools implementation\/usage frontiers. \n\nIt is interesting to indicate that in every of the threee groups above, the most respondents indicated 'None' as for the Cloud AutoML product used. It can be indicative of either *(1)* such respondents not involved in ML implementation\/usage, or *(2)* them got confused with the  question.\n\nFor  organizations with **well-established ML processes\/practices**, three top Cloud ML products are\n\n- Google Cloud AutoML\n- H2O Driverless AI\n- Azure Automated Machine Learning and Amazon SageMaker AutoPilot (these two products have almost the same user base amoung the survey participants)\n\nThe rest of the products listed in the survey are well behind the leaders in this group.\n\nFor  organizations that **started to use ML processes\/practices recently**, three top Cloud ML products are almost at the same level of popularity. However, with slight difference in the number of users, you can see them as follows\n\n- Google Cloud AutoML\n- Azure Machine Learning Studio\n- Amazon SageMaker AutoPilot\n\nH2O Driverless AutoML and the rest of the products are well behind the leaders in this group\n\nFor organizations that just **explore ML methods**, the most popular products are\n\n- Google Cloud AutoML\n- Azure Automated Machine Learning\n- Amazon SageMaker and DataRobot AutoML\n\nThe rest of the products (Databricks AutoML and H2O Driverless AutoML) are well behind the leaders in this group.\n\nIt is also intersting to note that the organizations that just use ML to generate some insights use Google Cloud AutoML the most. The rest of the products is much less popular with them.","0385ddf9":"## <div style=\"font-size:20px;text-align:center;color:black;border-bottom:5px #0026d6 solid;padding-bottom:3%\">1.4.

Forecast: Opportunities and Threats to Kaggle Community in 2022<\/div>\n\nThis section contains my subjective IMHO on what can happen to Kaggle community in 2020 based on the insights in both this research and my EDA-style notebooks published earlier (see the references in *Appendix A.1 References* below).\n\n## <div style=\"font-size:20px;text-align:center;color:black;border-bottom:5px #0026d6 solid;padding-bottom:3%\">4.1. Strive for Ethical Kaggling<\/div>\n\nUnfortunately the community here at Kaggle will keep suffering from the rude behaviour of some of the community members trying to hunt for the medals without following the ethical conduct in 2022 (as it was observed in 2020-2021).\n\nI may have some explanations on why such a non-ethical behaviour prolifirates here in Kaggle though. It comes from the very beginning of humanity, and it has its social and psychological roots in so called 'Young Male Syndrome' (https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/016230958590041X , https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6473461\/ etc.).\n\nIf you think about demographics of Kagglers as of 2021 (see my detailed EDA-style notebook referred in *Appendix A.1 References* below), you will find the community to be pre-dominated by young and relatively unexperienced males still (as it was in 2020, btw). Therefore it is very vulnarable to such effects that often embrace competitiveness, risk taking, and violence. Young unexperienced folks (males, especially) despretely strive to stand out of the crowd to demonstrate their competitive advantage, and it sometimes leads to violent activities (in this case, it is the violation of the ethical conduct here at Kaggle in attempt to earn more credits on his\/her own contributions).\n\nHowever, this is an explanation rather then a cause to excuse it. We should definitely evolve. The part of such a kaggler 'evolution' should be about getting the head around the ethical behaviour concepts. Therefore my mini-essay on [Tao of Ethical Kaggling](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/general\/239003) will remain relevant in 2022.\n\nMore actions will probably be required on the Kaggle product level to cope with the non-ethical conduct even more.\n\n## <div style=\"font-size:20px;text-align:center;color:black;border-bottom:5px #0026d6 solid;padding-bottom:3%\">4.2. New Training Opportunities<\/div>\n\nThe advent of **junior Data Scientists with 1-3 years of programming experience** who grew up with Kaggle is one of the biggest community changes as of 2021. They became one of the significant subpopulations within the Kaggle community as of 2021. \n\nIt opens the avenue for building more advanced training courses to specifically target such a subpopulation of Kagglers. It will help to retain the audience of such juniors on the platform more.\n\nThe side effect to such a community change could be increased demand for the public events\/panels\/disucssions with more senior-level professionals where such aspiring professionals would have a good forum to  learn from the seasoned experts in the industry.\n\n**Note:** As shown in my EDA-style notebooks for both 2020 and 2021 survey data (see *Appendix A.1 References* below for more details), more experienced professionals look for training and learning opportunities outside Kaggle (Udemy, Udacity, professional blogs etc.) as they need more advanced content vs. what currently provided by Kaggle Learning Courses. So there is a threat to loose attention of such Junior\n\n## <div style=\"font-size:20px;text-align:center;color:black;border-bottom:5px #0026d6 solid;padding-bottom:3%\">4.3. Attempts to 'Egalitarize' AutoML and Deep AutoML Technologies<\/div>\n\nAs justified by *'State of AI Report 2021'* (**{1}**), ML\/AI industry becomes more and more elitistic in a sense that it clearly separates the market\/community participants into two unequal 'buckets' \n\n- **Small-size 'Elite'**: employees of big companies and staff\/students of the top-notch universities that have access to the large R&D bugdets, extra-powerful hardware and novel Data Science\/ML\/AI technologies.\n- **Rest of the community'**: the rest of the professionals and students who mostly operate with commodity-level AI\/ML technologies\n\nWe can support the statement from *'State of AI Report 2021'* with the data from Kaggle 2021 survey indirectly. We draw the evidence of some of the most progressive Cloud, BigData, Cloud ML, and AutoML technologies, along with the most powerful hardware adapted to Data Science\/ML use cases to be utilized within the small fraction of the organizations having big spendings in ML as well as having a big number of employees.\n\nHowever, as we all know, such sepatation always leads to [\"Prometheus Phenomenon\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prometheus). That is, we will see more and more attempts of seasoned industry professionals and even corporations to bridge the gap between the 'elitist' and 'commodity' worlds by delivering totally freeware products in AutoML and Deep AutoML that are  on a par with the  top enterprise-level rivals in terms of the capabilities and the resulted model accuracy. \n\nActually, we have already started seeing such 'egalitarian' (counter-'elitist') actions as of 2021, with the advent of the products like [Auto ViML](https:\/\/github.com\/AutoViML\/Auto_ViML), [Deep Auto ViML](https:\/\/github.com\/AutoViML\/deep_autoviml), [Light AutoML](https:\/\/github.com\/sberbank-ai-lab\/LightAutoML) etc. It will continue to do it the same way, with Kaggle (and especially Kaggle Notebooks) becoming the ideal platform to demonstrate capabilities of such products as well as further popularize AutoML within the wider audiences of Kaggles outside  the 'elitist bucket'.","2d31a4f3":"We find that \n\n- A lot of organizations in every  industry do not use Cloud ML products as of 2021\n- The companies in Computers\/Technologies use Cloud ML the most, with organizations in Academia\/Education taking the second place, nand Accounting\/Finance taking the third one\n- For every Cloud ML product under review, the most of the users are in Computers\/Technologies industry\n- For Azure Machine Learning Studio and Google Cloud Vertex AI, the second most popular industry is Academia\/Education\n- For Amazon SageMaker and Databricks, the second most popular industry is Accounting\/Finance\n\n**Note:** unfortunately we cannot compare it to 2020 since the industry details were not the part of Kaggle 2020 survey questions.","3f4c4931":"As with ML adoption levels, we saw Amazon Sagemaker to clearly take the leading role in every ML spendings category as of 2020.\n\nAzure ML Studio and one of then-Google Cloud ML products (Google Cloud AI Platform\/Google Cloud ML Engine) were almost on the par to take the second place after  Amazon Sagemaker, as of 2020.","776159be":"We can draw the following insights from the spacial data on **DataRobot** \n- India occupies the first place in terms of the number of the product users (although the popularity of DataRobot is much lower there, vs. Amazon SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning Studio, and Google Cloud Vertex AI)\n- USA takes the second place (like in India, the popularity of DataRobot is much lower there, vs. Amazon SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning Studio, and Google Cloud Vertex AI)\n- Other countries are well behind India and USA\n- Japan takes the third place (however, China and Nigeria are quite close to it)","98980d51":"## <div style=\"font-size:20px;text-align:center;color:black;border-bottom:5px #0026d6 solid;padding-bottom:3%\">2.4.
