id=\"2.7\"><\/a> <br>\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/2936\/1*jbncjeM4CfpobEnDO0ZTjw.png)\n\nThe main idea of boosting is to add additional models to the overall ensemble model sequentially. Previously with bagging, we averaged each individual model created. This time with each iteration of boosting, a new model is created and the new base-learner model is trained (updated) from the errors of the previous learners.\n\nThe algorithm creates multiple weak models whose output is added together to get an overall prediction. This is ensemble modelling from earlier. The now boosted gradient shifts the current prediction nudging it to the true target, in a similar fashion to how gradient descent moves toward the true values. The gradient descent optimization occurs on the output of the varies models, and not their individual parameters.\n\nThere are different methods to optimize boosting algorithms.\nUnlike the bagging examples above, classical boosting the subset creation is not random and performance will depend upon the performance of previous models. As, each new subset which is iterated upon contains elements which could have been misclassified by previous models. We will also be using the same hard voting we used previously to ensemble the models together.","6d6a1ae9":"In all but one of the classifiers, we had lower variance as shown above . As well, the accuracy of classifiers all increased except for SVC. Looks like this bagging thing actually works. \n\nSo our bagged individual classifiers are (mostly) better, but which one do we choose?\n\n**Let\u2019s Vote!**\n\nSklearn\u2019s **VotingClassifier** allows you to combine different machine learning classifiers, and perform a vote on what the predicted class label(s) are for a record.\n\nThere are two types of voting you can do for classifiers: hard and soft.\n\nWith hard voting, you just need a majority of classifiers to determine what the result could be. As with the image below, the various bagged models are shown with H, and the results of the classifiers are shown on the rows. On the far right, H1 and H3 vote for the first record to be \u201cno\u201d (purple) while H2 votes for \u201cyes\u201d (yellow). Because 2 of the models vote for \u201cno\u201d, the ensemble classifies that record as a \u201cno\u201d.\n\n\nWith soft (weighted), we compute a percentage weight with each classifier. A predicted class probability from each model for each record is collected and multiplied by the classifier weight, and finally averaged. The final class label is then derived from the class label with the highest average probability.\n\nIn reality weights are hard to find if you\u2019re just providing your best guesses to which model you think should be weighted more or less. To counter this subjective process, a linear optimization equation or neural net could be constructed to find the correct weighting for each of the models to optimize the accuracy of the ensemble.","fa9cae58":"**Parameters**\n\n**nthread**\n\n* This is used for parallel processing and the number of cores in the system should be entered..\n* If you wish to run on all cores, do not input this value. The algorithm will detect it automatically.\n\n**eta**\n\nAnalogous to learning rate in GBM.\nMakes the model more robust by shrinking the weights on each step.\n\n**min_child_weight**\n\n* Defines the minimum sum of weights of all observations required in a child.\n* Used to control over-fitting. Higher values prevent a model from learning relations which might be highly specific to the particular sample selected for a tree.\n\n**max_depth**\n\n* It is used to define the maximum depth.\n* Higher depth will allow the model to learn relations very specific to a particular sample.\n\n**max_leaf_nodes**\n\n* The maximum number of terminal nodes or leaves in a tree.\n* Can be defined in place of max_depth. Since binary trees are created, a depth of \u2018n\u2019 would produce a maximum of 2^n leaves.\n* If this is defined, GBM will ignore max_depth.\n\n**gamma**\n\n* A node is split only when the resulting split gives a positive reduction in the loss function. Gamma specifies the minimum loss reduction required to make a split.\n* Makes the algorithm conservative. The values can vary depending on the loss function and should be tuned.\n\n**subsample**\n\n* Same as the subsample of GBM. Denotes the fraction of observations to be randomly sampled for each tree.\n* Lower values make the algorithm more conservative and prevent overfitting but values that are too small might lead to under-fitting.\n\n**colsample_bytree**\n\n* It is similar to max_features in GBM.\n* Denotes the fraction of columns to be randomly sampled for each tree.","5aaa8041":"**Soft Voting:** In soft voting, the output class is the prediction based on the average of probability given to that class. Suppose given some input to three models, the prediction probability for class A = (0.30, 0.47, 0.53) and B = (0.20, 0.32, 0.40). So the average for class A is 0.4333 and B is 0.3067, the winner is clearly class A because it had the highest probability averaged by each classifier.","06a08a27":"**Adaptive boosting** or **AdaBoost** is one of the simplest boosting algorithms. Usually, decision trees are used for modelling. Multiple sequential models are created, each correcting the errors from the last model. AdaBoost assigns weights to the observations which are incorrectly predicted and the subsequent model works to predict these values correctly.\n\nBelow are the steps for performing the AdaBoost algorithm:\n\n* Initially, all observations in the dataset are given equal weights.\n* A model is built on a subset of data.\n* Using this model, predictions are made on the whole dataset.\n* Errors are calculated by comparing the predictions and actual values.\n* While creating the next model, higher weights are given to the data points which were predicted incorrectly.\n* Weights can be determined using the error value. For instance, higher the error more is the weight assigned to the observation.\n* This process is repeated until the error function does not change, or the maximum limit of the number of estimators is reached.","8ef2aed4":"So in summary Weighted averaging is a slightly modified version of simple averaging, where the prediction of each model is multiplied by the weight and then their average is calculated. \n\n## 2.4 Stacking <a id=\"2.4\"><\/a> <br>\n![](https:\/\/d1m75rqqgidzqn.cloudfront.net\/wp-data\/2020\/05\/21160015\/shutterstock_1159836664-696x464.jpg)\nStacking is an ensemble learning technique that uses predictions from multiple models (for example decision tree, knn or svm) to build a new model. This model is used for making predictions on the test set.\n\nStacking, also known as Stacked Generalization is an ensemble technique that combines multiple classifications or regression models via a meta-classifier or a meta-regressor. The base-level models are trained on a complete training set, then the meta-model is trained on the features that are outputs of the base-level model. The base-level often consists of different learning algorithms and therefore stacking ensembles are often heterogeneous. Here is a diagram illustrating the process\n\nBelow is a step-wise explanation for a simple stacked ensemble:\n\n![](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/324552457\/figure\/fig3\/AS:616245728645121@1523935839872\/An-example-scheme-of-stacking-ensemble-learning.png)\n\nStep 1:The train set is split into 10 parts.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/image-11-300x217.png)\nStep 2:A base model (suppose a decision tree) is fitted on 9 parts and predictions are made for the 10th part. This is done for each part of the train set.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/image-10-300x249.png)\nStep 3:The base model (in this case, decision tree) is then fitted on the whole train dataset.\n\nStep 4:Using this model, predictions are made on the test set.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/image-2-300x225.png)\nStep 5:Steps 2 to 4 are repeated for another base model (say knn) resulting in another set of predictions for the train set and test set.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/image-3-300x224.png)\nStep 6:The predictions from the train set are used as features to build a new model.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/image12-292x300.png)\n\nStep 7:This model is used to make final predictions on the test prediction set.\n\n\nIn order to simplify the above explanation, the stacking model we have created has only two levels. The decision tree and knn models are built at level zero, while a logistic regression model is built at level one. Feel free to create multiple levels in a stacking model.\n","a5b3a331":"Now let us recheck the missing values to see our LotFrontage missing values are imputed successfully.","3847699c":"Now we will use pipeline to chain multiple estimators into one.

Answer is defenitely a big NO right?\n    \n![](https:\/\/thumbs.dreamstime.com\/b\/car-sale-4167169.jpg)\n    \nSo what we do is first decide whether which car to buy ,whether it is a new or used car ,type of car,model and year of manufacture, look for list of dealers ,look for discounts\/offers ,customer reviews,opinion from friends and family, performance ,fuel efficiency and obvious any car buyer will for the best price range etc.\n    \n![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSC0-mqf3xqr3MESGW-mGwaWQkkBjwJGbNFsQ&usqp=CAU)\n    \n In short, you wouldn\u2019t directly reach a conclusion, but will instead make a decision considering all the above mentioned factors before we decide on the best choice.\n    \n**Ensemble models** in machine learning operate on a similar idea.\n![](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/474x\/d7\/c7\/9b\/d7c79b0c7abc5a34e17710fe596f6834.jpg)    \nEnsemble Learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models to improve predictive performance compared to a single model. \n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/L2Jaqm8.png)\n    \n# 2. Ensemble Techniques <a id=\"2\"><\/a> <br>\n\n## 2.1 Max Voting \/ Voting Classifier <a id=\"2.1\"><\/a> <br>\n\nThe **max voting** method is generally used for classification problems. In this technique, multiple models are used to make predictions for each data point. The predictions by each model are considered as a \u2018vote\u2019. The predictions which we get from the majority of the models are used as the final prediction.\n\nA **Voting Classifier** is a machine learning model that trains on an ensemble of numerous models and predicts an output (class) based on their highest probability of chosen class as the output.\nIt simply aggregates the findings of each classifier passed into Voting Classifier and predicts the output class based on the highest majority of voting. The idea is instead of creating separate dedicated models and finding the accuracy for each them, we create a single model which trains by these models and predicts output based on their combined majority of voting for each output class.\n\nNow let us use the IRIS dataset to demonstrate the Voting Classifier","7f883206":"#### Finally to calculate the average weights let us look at the following code","53f9500d":"Now let us focus on some of the categorical features with major count of missing values and replace them with 'None'","3daa1c9e":"In practical the output accuracy will be more for soft voting as it is the average probability of the all estimators combined, as for our basic iris dataset we are already overfitting, so there won\u2019t be much difference in output.\n\n## 2.2 Averaging <a id=\"2.2\"><\/a> <br>\n\nMultiple predictions are made for each data point in averaging. In this method, we take an average of predictions from all the models and use it to make the final prediction. Averaging can be used for making predictions in regression problems or while calculating probabilities for classification problems.\n\nThe simplest way to develop a model averaging ensemble in Keras is to train multiple models on the same dataset then combine the predictions from each of the trained models.\n\nWe will use a small multi-class classification problem as the basis to demonstrate a model averaging ensemble.\n\nThe scikit-learn class provides the make_blobs() function that can be used to create a multi-class classification problem with the prescribed number of samples, input variables, classes, and variance of samples within a class.\n\nWe use this problem with 500 examples, with input variables to represent the x and y coordinates of the points and a standard deviation of 2.0 for points within each group. We will use the same random state to ensure that we always get the same 500 points.","6c5ae0ca":"## 2.5 Blending <a id=\"2.5\"><\/a> <br>\n\nBlending follows the same approach as stacking but uses only a holdout (validation) set from the train set to make predictions. In other words, unlike stacking, the predictions are made on the holdout set only. The holdout set and the predictions are used to build a model which is run on the test set. Here is a detailed explanation of the blending process:\n\nStep 1: The train set is split into training and validation sets\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/image-7-300x226.png)\n\nStep 2: Model(s) are fitted on the training set.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/image-5-300x228.png)\n\nStep 3: The predictions are made on the validation set and the test set.\n\nStep 4: The validation set and its predictions are used as features to build a new model.\n\nStep 5: This model is used to make final predictions on the test and meta-features.\n\n\nThe difference between stacking and blending is that Stacking uses out-of-fold predictions for the train set of the next layer (i.e meta-model), and Blending uses a validation set (let\u2019s say, 10-15% of the training set) to train the next layer.\n\nWe\u2019ll build two models, decision tree and knn, on the train set in order to make predictions on the validation set.\n","396f3a15":"Now let us focus on some of the categorical features with fewer missing values and replace them with the most frequently occured value which is the mode of that feature.","59caf080":"LotArea is a continuous feature so it is best to use panda's qcut method to divide it into 10 parts.","9012508e":"Let us concatenate both the training and test datasets into a single dataframe for ease of data cleaning and feature engineering.'Id' feature has no significance to our modelling since it is a continuous variable ,so dropping this feature on both train and test datasets.","e1a57d55":"## 2.6 Bagging <a id=\"2.6\"><\/a> <br>\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/700\/1*DFHUbdz6EyOuMYP4pDnFlw.jpeg)\n\n**Bagging**, is shorthand for the combination of bootstrapping and aggregating. Bootstrapping is a method to help decrease the variance of the classifier and reduce overfitting, by resampling data from the training set with the same cardinality as the original set. The model created should be less overfitted than a single individual model.\n\nA high variance for a model is not good, suggesting its performance is sensitive to the training data provided. So, even if more the training data is provided, the model may still perform poorly. And, may not even reduce the variance of our model.\n\nBagging is an effective method when you have limited data, and by using samples you\u2019re able to get an estimate by aggregating the scores over many samples.\n\nThe simplest approach with bagging is to use a couple of small subsamples and bag them, if the ensemble accuracy is much higher than the base models, it\u2019s working; if not, use larger subsamples.Using larger subsamples is not guaranteed to improve your results. In bagging there is a tradeoff between base model accuracy and the gain you get through bagging. The aggregation from bagging may improve the ensemble greatly when you have an unstable model, yet when your base models are more stable \u2014 been trained on larger subsamples with higher accuracy \u2014 improvements from bagging reduces.\n\nOnce the bagging is done, and all the models have been created on (mostly) different data, a weighted average is then used to determine the final score.\n\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/866\/1*JksRZ1E72Rsx2s8lQbNR1w.jpeg)\n\nThere are three main terms describing the ensemble (combination) of various models into one more effective model:\n\n* **Bagging** to decrease the model\u2019s variance;\n* **Boosting** to decreasing the model\u2019s bias, and;\n* **Stacking** to increasing the predictive force of the classifier.\n\nThe idea behind bagging is combining the results of multiple models (for instance, all decision trees) to get a generalized result. Here\u2019s a question: If you create all the models on the same set of data and combine it, will it be useful? There is a high chance that these models will give the same result since they are getting the same input. So how can we solve this problem? One of the techniques is bootstrapping.\n\nBootstrapping is a sampling technique in which we create subsets of observations from the original dataset, with replacement. The size of the subsets is the same as the size of the original set.\n\nBagging (or Bootstrap Aggregating) technique uses these subsets (bags) to get a fair idea of the distribution (complete set). The size of subsets created for bagging may be less than the original set.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/image20-768x289.png)\n\nStep 1: Multiple subsets are created from the original dataset, selecting observations with replacement.\n\nStep 2: A base model (weak model) is created on each of these subsets.\n\nStep 3: The models run in parallel and are independent of each other.\n\nStep 4: The final predictions are determined by combining the predictions from all the models.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screenshot-from-2018-05-08-13-11-49-768x580.png)","5f969f01":"let us impute the missing values of LotFrontage based on the median of LotArea and Neighborhood.
