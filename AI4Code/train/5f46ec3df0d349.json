Now this data-set is some what idealistic in a sense that we already have quantified images, i.e. images are already represented in a pixaleted form via matrix (as explained in the link). So only thing that we need to think about is some pre-processing and building the model. Other more realistic data-set that we are going to analyse is the [Humpback-whale](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/humpback-whale-identification) data set. Goal is pretty straight-foreward: Given an image of a tail of a whale, predict its unique id. Now this is a bit specific competition since we have only a few images for every id.

Now in this data set one row is one picture, but is actually a 784 (28*28*1) dimensional vector.

In the begininng we should learn rather quickly but as we more towards the optimum (of the loss function) we should decrease the learning rate.

Reason being is that we only have black-white images. When we translate it to numerical values this coresponds to one gray-level where pixel values can take values between 0 and 255 (depending on the position). We can normalize these values to speed up the algorithm.","41355047":"Cool, now we can start thinking about building a model (cNN!) now we already discussed theoretically what woud it look like.
