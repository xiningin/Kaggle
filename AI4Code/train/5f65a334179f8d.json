They are based on applying [Bayes' Theorem](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bayes%27_theorem) and are 'naive' in that they assume independence between features.

Precision is also called Positive Predictive Value. It is a measure of a classifier's exactness. Low precision indicates a high number of false positives.\n* **Recall** is the number of true positives divided by the number of positive values in the test data. Recall is also called Sensitivity or the True Positive Rate. It is a measure of a classifier's completeness. Low recall indicates a high number of false negatives.\n* **F1-Score** is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n* **Support** is the number of true results for each class.","37a7f4c3":"#### Text Pre-processing and Downsampling\nBecause we have an imbalanced dataset we will downsample the majority class to equal the size of the minority class.
