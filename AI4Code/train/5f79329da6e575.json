The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia. As of April 2021, India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with more than 17 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and 211,853 deaths as of 30 April 2021\n\nThe first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported in the towns of Thrissur, Alappuzha and Kasargod, all in the state of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan. Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. By mid-May 2020, five cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time. In July 2020, India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said that the country's case fatality rate was among the lowest in the world at 2.41% and was \"steadily declining\". Infection rates started to drop significantly in September, and the number of daily new cases and active cases started to decline rapidly. Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, and came down to below 15,000 in January 2021 before rising again under a second wave from March 2021. On 19 January 2021, nearly a year after the first reported case in India, Lakshadweep became the last region to report its first case. The second wave of cases was much larger than the first, and there were shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medicines in various parts of the country.\n\nIndia began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021, in what was described by The Hindu as the largest in the world. India has authorised the British Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield), the Indian BBV152 (Covaxin) vaccine, and the Russian Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use","8f9ad5a7":" ## Maharashtra","3397df99":"### Karnataka","f22da43a":"### Statewise Deaths","2cdb6825":"# **COVID-19 pandemic in India**","28b87fa0":"# **Statewise Analysis**"}}
