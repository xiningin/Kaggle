Overall city hotel has the most bookings every month, naturally the biggest proportion of people travelling to the hotels tends to be city hotel. The exceptions being African countries and northern European countries. This be indicative of business\/leisure purpose for travelling. ","8758db17":"**Pre-processing and feature selection**","181b40e4":"A solver warning usually appears for the LogisticRegression model, after many attempts at testing and fine tuning I was sick of seeing the message so I set a default number of iterations to prevent the warning displaying any more. I tested all the way to 4000 iterations but it had very little impact on the final result, therefore, we will keep the run time low","2d1bf543":"Next, we create our connection to sqlite3 which returns a connection object that represents a database, \nthen run a quick column query to see what kind of information we are interrogating.","19c5d10b":"This gives us an ordered list of correlation weighting.","d0e704aa":"Use chi2 from SelectKBest to determine the statistical weight of each category. We have alot of unique categories to consider in the data so we will change default (k=10) to k=20.","0449982d":"We can see we have some arrival_months and not others, for the sake of generality we will keep all the arrival_months in for the actual model. The only category where all sub-categories were not selected is Meal. Everything else will be kept for generality.","22ecd1ba":"Investigating the cancellations further, considering only bookings that resulted in cancellations of what proportion of those bookings were first time cancellations and what proportion had 1 or more previous cancellations (repeat offenders)","ff757870":"Next we choose some classifer models to test on our data.","d83946cc":"**Model evaltuation and cross validation scores**\n\n\nNow we develop the full model for training and testing the data bearing in mind the results from the feature selection method.","7c7353af":"Import libraries to begin with.","bdb5181d":"There is data from the following years","7fe4630c":"## Analysis of hotel booking data\n\n\n**Hotel bookings EDA**\n1.

We have ignored country and reservation status date data as one hot encoding will produce many columns. Actually I didn't ignore these first time around and it took 10 minutes to print the figure with the new columns on. Woops.\n Also, reservation status has been taken out, if that's included the canceled status far outweighs all over features, obviously.","eb2399c6":"Investigation into the effect of the length of the waiting list on cancellations. ","b3cf2e57":"We can see the data is taken from two separate hotels.","5ee6cb2d":"If we look back at the feature selection data we can see that the deposit type 'Non Refundable' has the greatest correlation with a cancellation being made which is the opposite of what I would have expected. \nThis relationship has been confirmed by Susmit Vengurlekar and Marcus Wingen in their discussions also. This paper https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/310504011_Predicting_Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_to_Decrease_Uncertainty_and_Increase_Revenue dated before the paper given in this dataset is produced by the same authors and relates to the same hotel dataset and determines the correlation, in regards to booking type and cancellation, to be the opposite of what we have been finding in our dataset which leads me to believe that the data has been labelled incorrectly by the authors in the most recent paper.\n\nFinally, this is my first notebook and my first attempt at machine learning, so, if you have time, please voice any constructive critisicms in the comments as I would appreciate any and all input.\n","17f1c3ae":"Prepare the data for analysis.\n\n1) Look for NaNs\/NULLs\n\n2) Check for 'unknown' values and blanks\n\n3) Inspect the data for any other anonmalies that may affect analysis and act as unecessary outliers\n\n4) Replace all values (meaningfully)","15a56f12":"**Final points about the dataset**","a785a398":"From the figure above we see the majority of cancellations for both hotels were first time cancellations, with ever decreasing number of total cancellations as the number of previous cancellations increases.","15331905":"Lets consider how the average price per person of the hotels changes over the time frame of the data","4286f4cf":"Build the pipepline for the numeric and categorical data.
