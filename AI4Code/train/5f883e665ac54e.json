uncertain, at best, while thousands of prospective immigrants still stand to suffer the consequences.\n\nAlthough the suspension was filled with broad exemptions and does not include current visa holders or those already in the U.S., the Migration Policy Institute estimates 26,000 would-be green card applicants would be blocked each month.\n\nOver the weekend, a coalition of advocacy groups filed an emergency request to halt Trump\u2019s directive. It was the latest move in a 2019 case, stemming from when the White House sought to ban immigrants who couldn\u2019t prove their ability to acquire.\nAttorneys with the American Immigration Lawyers Association requested a hold on the recent suspension order while the courts continue to decide the fate of the health insurance restrictions.\n\nThe White House framed the immigration suspension as a vital component of helping the economy and American workers recover, but it could have the opposite effect.\n\nImmigrants already in the U.S. and those who already have certain visas can still obtain permanent residency. The suspension applies only to green card applicants from outside the country and primarily targets to those looking to settle down in the U.S. permanently through a family connection, according to MPI estimates.\n\nThat leaves the possibility of employment-based visa slots opening up as a result of the suspension.\n\n\"President Trump claims he signed it in order to protect the economy in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, but the reality is that our economic recovery will depend on immigrants,\" said Esther Sung, a senior attorney involved in the 2019 case.\n\nThat view is shared, in part, by Rutgers economics professor Jennifer Hunt. She told ABC News that an influx of workers into critical sectors of the economy could boost per capita GDP.\n\n\"It would be kind of a shot in the arm,\" Hunt said.\n\nOn-going travel restrictions and the closure of foreign visa offices still pose the greatest barrier to legal immigration in the age of coronavirus. Economists and labor experts, including Hunt, say those factors would override any attempt to assess the economic impacts of the restrictions.\n\n\"It\u2019s very hard for me to see the direct correlation in terms of immediate and practical positive impact on displaced U.S. workers,\" said Caroline Tang, an Austin-based attorney who advises companies on work authorization for immigrants.\n\nTang said the bar for employers to obtain work authorization for visa holders is already high enough, referring to specific requirements for prioritizing U.S. citizens.\n\nResearchers have identified some connection between more immigrants settled in the country and economic growth under normal circumstances, but the results are mixed.\n\nFor example, a 2017 report by the economics firm Moody Analytics and ProPublica found that for every 1% increase in the U.S. population, the gross domestic product rises by 1.5%. While a 2018 study from Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution confirms that \"positive relationship\" generally, but found variations and some negative impacts to U.S.-born employment rates in its state-by-state review.\n\nResearchers studying the large population of foreign-born workers in South Africa said it likely had a positive impact on per capita GDP.\n\n\"Foreign-born workers also generated additional employment for native-born workers,\" according to the 2018 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Politics##################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################\n\ntext_2 = \"\"\"Disputes have already broken out within the new political alliance that is working to end 36 years of rule by the Socialist Party (PSOE) in Spain\u2019s southern region of Andalusia.\n\nJust hours after the far-right Vox agreed to support the Popular Party (PP)\u2019s candidate to head the region, Juan Manuel Moreno, its demand for a specific regional department for family affairs is running into opposition from Ciudadanos (Citizens), the third party involved in the government change.\n\nThese early clashes suggest it could be difficult to export the model to other parts of Spain\n\nThe PP and the liberal Ciudadanos have reached their own governing agreement in the wake of an election that undermined the Socialists\u2019 hold on power, but they need support from Vox\u2019s 12 newly elected lawmakers to make it a reality.\n\nCiudadanos has refused point-blank to meet with Vox representatives, but the PP has struck its own parallel deal with the far right to ensure its support at the investiture debate, which will take place on January 15 and 16.\n\nOn Friday morning, Juan Mar\u00edn of Ciudadanos said that there are no plans for a separate family affairs department within the government structure they have devised with their PP partners, and which does not include Vox.\n\nThe reform party has insisted that the Vox-PP deal does not affect them at all, and Ciudadanos\u2019 national leader, Albert Rivera, said on Thursday that Vox \u201chas had to take a step back, correct itself, and sheathe its sword,\u201d alluding to the fact that Vox has dropped some of its most radical demands such as the deportation of 52,000 undocumented migrants.\n\n Vox national leader Santiago Abascal (c) and Andalusian leader Francisco Serrano (r).\nVox national leader Santiago Abascal (c) and Andalusian leader Francisco Serrano (r). REUTERS\nBut Vox insists on a family department, and said it will expect loyalty from the PP on this issue. Meanwhile, Ciudadanos has also warned it will not support the PP-Vox proposal to change the historical memory law for a \u201cconcord law.\u201d\n\nThese early clashes suggest it could be difficult to export the model to other parts of Spain, where local and regional elections are scheduled to be held this year. The PP president, Pablo Casado, said on Thursday that their separate deals with Ciudadanos and Vox in Andalusia are \u201ca preamble of what\u2019s going to happen in May in Spain.\u201d\n\nThe PP is anxious to win back power in regions like Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Castilla-La Mancha, Arag\u00f3n and Cantabria, and to retain it in Madrid, Murcia, La Rioja and Castilla y Le\u00f3n.\n\nParliamentary debate\nThe PSOE has already digested the fact that it is losing its hold on Spain\u2019s most populated region. \u201cWe will conduct a responsible opposition, and remain vigilant about defending self-government and Andalusia\u2019s presence in Spain,\u201d said the party\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, Mario Jim\u00e9nez.\n\nThe Socialists will not be putting forward a candidate, now that the PP nominee has enough support for an absolute majority in the first round. The debates will take place on January 15 and 16, followed by a vote, said Speaker Marta Bosquet.\n\nThe sum of the PP, Ciudadanos and Vox votes is four above the 55 required for a majority. The PSOE lost 14 seats at the December 2 election, down to 33.

The findings are published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\u201cPeople who developed dementia were more likely to combine highly processed meats with starchy foods like potatoes, alcohol, and snacks like cookies and cakes,\u201d study author Cecilia Samieri, PhD, of the University of Bordeaux in France, told Healthline. \u201cIn spite of not being consumed in higher quantity, processed meat appeared very central in their diet, that is, connected with many foods.\u201d\n\nThe study looked at over 200 people with an average age of 78 living with dementia and compared them with a group of 418 in the same age range without the condition.\n\nAll participants received a medical checkup every 2 to 3 years and completed food questionnaires recording what foods they ate and how frequently for the previous 5 years.\n\nDiet in midlife may influence brain disease risk\nResearchers analyzed data from the food questionnaires to compare what foods were frequently eaten together by those with and without dementia.\n\nSamieri points out they could only draw conclusions from a narrow age range.\n\n\u201cThe main limitation is the use of a single dietary survey,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that diet over time, starting in midlife and probably even before, likely influences the risk of brain diseases later in life. Here, we had an evaluation of diet after age 65 only.\u201d\n\nAlso, it wasn\u2019t the amount of \u201cunhealthy\u201d food that seemed to increase the risk of dementia, but instead, not eating other healthier foods, suggest the findings.\n\nSamieri pointed out that in this kind of study, the assumption was that \u201cthe diet people adopt at this age is a good representation of the diet followed over the years preceding the interview.\u201d\n\nAnother limitation was that diets were recorded only once, years before the onset of dementia, so changes in diet over time were unknown.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Entertainment##################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################\n\ntext_4 = \"\"\"\nC\u00e1diz is in style: it has just been included in The New York Times\u2019 list of 52 Places to Go in 2019.

But one year later, he placed the Tesla Semi fourth on a list of priorities for the company, behind the upcoming Model Y compact SUV and an electric pickup truck. This week, Daimler executed a move many years in the making by announcing its own big rig (albeit diesel-powered) outfitted with semi-autonomous technology. And others are following suit.\n\nThe German automaker also committed to manufacturing the truck this summer, with deliveries scheduled for later this year. It pledged 500 million euros over the next few years to the continued development of an autonomous big rig, and said it has hired hundreds of employees to move the tech forward. And just like it did when it unveiled the prototype version in 2015, Daimler gave us a ride in the truck to get a taste of what the near future of trucking will look like.\n\n \nWhile there are a few Tesla Semi prototypes on the road now, and a dozen or so big name companies have placed preorders for the trucks, it doesn\u2019t look like a production version is coming any time soon. Tesla still hasn\u2019t said where or exactly when it will build the trucks, and would likely need to raise more money (or sell a hell of a lot more Model 3s) to fund the project.\n\nDAIMLER FIRST SHOWED OFF A PROTOTYPE IN 2015\nThis has left the door wide open for companies like Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz. Daimler announced it was working on its own self-driving big rig in 2015 when it showed off a working prototype called the Freightliner Inspiration Truck. The automaker went big, debuting the truck on the Hoover Dam and offering test rides at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show, Daimler returned to Las Vegas to make good on its promise with a production version of that prototype truck.\n\nThe new Cascadia is not much more advanced than the prototype was in 2015. In fact, the technology is still pretty limited. Daimler says it\u2019s the first Class 8 commercial truck with Level 2 autonomy (referring to the Society of Automotive Engineers\u2019 scale for self-driving definitions), meaning the driver is in control, but is supported heavily by the truck\u2019s technology in certain situations. In that sense, the new Cascadia essentially has the same basic driver assistance technology many modern cars offer, including automatic lane centering, adaptive cruise control, and emergency braking.\n\n \nThe Freightliner Inspiration Truck at the event in 2015.\nBut the new Cascadia is doing this with a limited set of sensors. There\u2019s a forward-facing camera, a forward-facing radar, a second radar sensor on the right side of the truck. That package pales in comparison to the dozens of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radars you\u2019d find powering Autopilot, let alone the Tesla Semi, which is supposed to have a beefed-up version of this same sensor suite.\n\nThis helps keep costs down, but means the technology is more in line with what you\u2019d find powering something like Nissan\u2019s ProPilot driver assistance feature as opposed to Autopilot, or even Audi\u2019s supposedly Level 3 system, which uses similar tech, but relies on LIDAR as well.\n\nDAIMLER\u2019S TRUCK HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH NISSAN\u2019S PROPILOT SYSTEM THAN TESLA\u2019S AUTOPILOT\nKeeping with a theme of less is more, there\u2019s also no camera-based monitoring system in the truck to make sure the driver pays attention while using the Level 2 features. Instead, the Cascadia uses a system similar to the one found in Tesla\u2019s cars.\n\nA sensor in the steering column measures resistance applied to the steering wheel. If the driver takes their hands off the wheel while using the lane centering feature, the instrument cluster will, after about 15 seconds, surface a warning that tells them to place their hands back on the wheel. If the driver doesn\u2019t do that, the warning changes from yellow to red. After another 60 seconds, if the driver still hasn\u2019t put their hands back on the wheel, the truck will come to a stop on the side of the road.\n\n  \n \nThe new Cascadia is a far cry from a fully autonomous truck, but based on my brief ride, Daimler has refined the technology compared to the prototype version. The prototype swayed on the highway during my two-mile demo ride in 2015, ping-ponging between the lane markers. The new truck, meanwhile, felt locked to the center of the lane during this week\u2019s ride, which followed the same exact route from a few years ago.\n\nA Daimler representative also told me that, while lane centering is on, the driver can even choose where the system places them in the lane. (For example, if a driver is on a tight one-lane highway and wants to avoid clipping oncoming traffic, they could tell the truck to hug the right lane line.) This is another sign that system is maturing from what debuted in 2015, though it\u2019s a small one.\n\nRELATED\n\nThis is what it\u2019s like to ride in Daimler\u2019s self-driving semi truck\nDaimler promised some other modern technologies are coming the new Cascadia, though none of it was on display in the preproduction trucks being used for the demonstration. The company plans to offer an optional 10-inch touchscreen in the dashboard, and a 12-inch digital cluster behind the steering wheel. The truck will be able to receive over-the-air software updates, too.\n\nThe Cascadia won\u2019t be as stuffed with tech as the Tesla Semi, nor is it as sleek. But it will be available later this year. Daimler has argued that bringing automation to trucking will help squeeze better fuel efficiency out of the millions of miles that its big rigs cover every year. It would decrease the toll those miles take on the drivers. Most importantly, it could help reduce the some 4,000 fatalities that result from crashes involving these massive hunks of machinery. If all goes well, we might have a sense by the end of this year of whether any of that is true.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Sports##################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################\n\ntext_7 = \"\"\"\nSpain has agreed to host the soccer final of the Copa Libertadores between Argentina teams River Plate and Boca Juniors.

When the cage door is opened, the animal makes a run for it, but is shot at by men armed with rifles who are waiting by the cage.\n\nThe release of the video, which has had 255,000 views, coincided with the launch of PACMA\u2019s campaign against the start of fox-hunting season in Galicia. \u201cFox-hunting season in Galicia has started: hunts that hide behind environmental excuses, championships in which the only reason to compete is to kill. The hunters will be entitled to pursue and kill thousands of foxes in the countryside,\u201d states PACMA.\n\nAs it notes on its website, PACMA is the only political group that opposes hunting, and it is currently demanding a nationwide ban. \u201cNo animal should die under fire,\u201d say the group. \u201cWe will fight tirelessly until hunting becomes a crime.\u201d\n\nNo animal should die under fire. We will fight tirelessly until hunting becomes a crime\n\nPACMA\n\nThe animal rights group is preparing a report to send to the regional government of Galicia against fox hunts. \u201cWe are working hard to make it the first Spanish region to assign resources to protecting foxes instead of killing them,\u201d says a source at PACMA.\n\nLast month, a Spanish hunter who was filmed while he chased and tortured a fox was identified by the Civil Guard in the Spanish province of Huesca. The man, aged 35, is facing charges of crimes against wildlife.\n\nAnd in November, animal rights groups and political parties reacted with indignation over a viral video shot in C\u00e1ceres province of 12 hunting dogs falling off a cliff edge, followed by the deer they were attacking.\n\n\"\"\"\n","e8c8bf4b":"def predict_from_text(model, text):\n\n    text = filter_text(text, stop)\n    test_vec = tfidf.transform([text])\n    cat = ['Crime','Politics','Science']\n    code = [0,1,2]\n    dic = dict([(code[x], cat[x])for x in range(3)])\n\n    prediction = dic[model.predict(test_vec)[0]]\n    \n    return prediction","992861ae":"texts = [text_1, text_2, text_3, text_4, text_5, text_6, text_7, text_8, text_9, text_10]\n\npredictions = pd.Series(texts).apply(lambda x : predict_from_text(model_stack, x))\n\npredictions","cdbd37f7":"# Introduction \n## Data\n* The input data comprises of files within the folders with class labels as their name.\n* The textual data are emails written from one journalist to another or to their source, regarding a story.\n* Emails can be seen labelled under multiple classes which would mislead the model.\n\n# Methodology\n* Text Cleaning and EDA was discussed [here]('https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dipankarsrirag\/loading-and-cleaning-text-email-topic-modelling')\n* To clean our data and obtain some meaningful insights, we first need to make sure our data is properly labelled and stored\n* To do so:\n    1.
