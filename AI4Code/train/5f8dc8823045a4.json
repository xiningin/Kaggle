There is no difference in their distribution by gender. Additionally, there is no difference in senior citizen status by gender.","b1d9d837":"**4. ADA Boost**","188cfe29":"2. Lets now explore the churn rate by tenure, seniority, contract type, monthly charges and total charges to see how it varies by these variables.","727ea265":"### E.) Finally, let's take a look at out predictor variable (Churn) and understand its interaction with other important variables as was found out in the correlation plot. ","e41f30cd":"**ii.) Churn by Contract Type**: Similar to what we saw in the correlation plot, the customers who have a month to month contract have a very high churn rate.","b67c5d5c":"**v.) Churn by Total Charges**: It seems that there is higer churn when the total charges are lower.","a9ac2d99":"After looking at the above output, we can say that there are 11 missing values for Total Charges. Let us replace remove these 11 rows from our data set","a03a5ad1":"## Data Exploration\n\nLet us first start with exploring our data set, to better understand the patterns in the data and potentially form some hypothesis. First we will look at the distribution of individual variables and then slice and dice our data for any interesting trends.","62669951":"In our data, 74% of the customers do not churn. Clearly the data is skewed as we would expect a large majority of the customers to not churn. This is important to keep in mind for our modelling as skeweness could lead to a lot of false negatives. We will see in the modelling section on how to avoid skewness in the data.","0215d062":"Interestingly most of the monthly contracts last for 1-2 months, while the 2 year contracts tend to last for about 70 months. This shows that the customers taking a longer contract are more loyal to the company and tend to stay with it for a longer period of time. \n\nThis is also what we saw in the earlier chart on correlation with the churn rate. ","c4139366":"**2. Contracts:** To understand the above graph, lets first look at the # of customers by different contracts. ","8a4bbe11":"**Observations**\n\nWe can see that some variables have a negative relation to our predicted variable (Churn), while some have positive relation. Negative relation means that likeliness of churn decreases with that variable. Let us summarize some of the interesting features below:\n* As we saw in our EDA, having a 2 month contract reduces chances of churn. 2 month contract along with tenure have the most negative relation with Churn as predicted by logistic regressions\n* Having DSL internet service also reduces the proability of Churn\n* Lastly, total charges, monthly contracts, fibre optic internet services and seniority can lead to higher churn rates. This is interesting because although fibre optic services are faster, customers are  likely to churn because of it. I think we need to explore more to better understad why this is happening. \n\nAny hypothesis on the above would be really helpful! ","a93c44f4":"**Observations:**\n\n* From random forest algorithm, monthly contract, tenure and total charges are the most important predictor variables to predict churn.\n* The results from random forest are very similar to that of the logistic regression and in line to what we had expected from our EDA","13b813e3":"**Let us read the data file in the python notebook**","3c4b3dec":"### D.)

Tenure:**  After looking at the below histogram we can see that a lot of customers have been with the telecom company for just a month, while quite a many are there for about 72 months.

Thus based on the contract they are into it could be more\/less easier for the customers to stay\/leave the telecom company.","7acdd7d0":"Interestingly with XG Boost I was able to increase the accuracy on test data to almost 83%.
