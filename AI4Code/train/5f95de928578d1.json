(Otherwise these exercises will be pretty confusing!) -- Rachael ","78d263ce":"## Linear Regression\n\nYour dataset is quite large. BigQuery is especially efficient with large datasets, so you'll use BigQuery-ML (called BQML) to build your model. BQML uses a \"linear regression\" model when predicting numeric outcomes, like the number of riders.\n\n## 1) Training vs testing\n\nYou'll want to test your model on data it hasn't seen before (for reasons described in the [Intro to Machine Learning Micro-Course](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-machine-learning). What do you think is a good approach to splitting the data? What data should we use to train, what data should we use for test the model?","f35e60c9":"You'll want to inspect your data to ensure it looks like what you expect. Run the line below to get a quick view of the data, and feel free to explore it more if you'd like (if you don't know how to do that, the [Pandas micro-course](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/pandas)) might be helpful.","f3d1f11c":"# 9) Next steps\n\nGiven what you've learned, what improvements do you think you could make to your model?

Write a query to get the average number of riders per station for each year in the dataset and order by the year so you can see the trend. You can use the `EXTRACT` method to get the day and year from the start time timestamp.

","3b07a1d5":"## 2) Exercise: Query the training data\n\nWrite the query to retrieve your training data. The fields should be:\n1. The start_station_name\n2. A time trips start, to the nearest hour.
