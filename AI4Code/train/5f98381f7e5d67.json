For Whites, it is 2.2. This means that African Americans were more likely to flee upon encounters, maybe because they are more scared.\n\nThis might be the reason for the higher shooting rate, as during a flee situation, there might be some misfiring on the police's part.\n\nHence, we can't be very confident as to whether the police are racist (we could have been if this plot hadn't shown anything peculiar).\n\nLet's also see if there was anythign Peculiar with the Mental Illness Datapoint","23eb286b":"Surprisingly, the range is a lot thicker than I thought. I was expecting the plot to be thickest at around mid 20s, and then narrow down quickly, but it turns out that the age range of victims is quite large.\n\n# Which State has The Most Shootings?\n\nLet's also look at which state has the most shootings","32823b10":"Looking at the ratios again (of True to False), we see that for African Americans, it is 0.165, whereas for Whites, it is 0.4. This shows us the opposite, that Whites that were shot were more likely to have been mentally ill. This also doesn't account for the increased percentage of African American deaths, but we still can't be certain because the Fleeing datapoint showed the same increased percentage.\n","58bcd036":"This graph also doesn't suggest anything out of the ordinary, such as one race having a much higher chance of having a weapon as compared to another.\n\nNow let's also do it for the last category on fleeing. If we see no signs here, then it is possible that the police is racist.","2e12e33c":"The percentage of African Americans (labeled B) in America is 13.4%. So if the police shot randomly, about 13.4% should be African Americans. Here we see that this number is 26.5%, which is disproportionately large!\n\nLet's look at Hispanics - about 18.3% of the population is Hispanic. This is roughly what we see here, so there doesn't seem to be a bias in this direction.\n\nTo complete this claim, let's look at the threat level as well.","34919a24":"# How old are the Victims?\nNow let's look at the Distribution of the age of victims","0995f7c9":"We can see that a lot of the rows have the name TK TK, so it is quite likely that this is a placeholder for NaN.","a77c4ebb":"# A Peculiarity in the Data","8cd7e4a7":"The ratio of Attack to others for whites is 2.207, and for African Americans is 2.05.\nThis means that African Americans are not more dangerous than Whites, yet the percentage of African Americans killed was higher as compared to population.\n\nUnfortunately, this shows signs that the police MIGHT be racist.\n\n\nLet's do the same for weapons, and see if anything odd pops up there, which may prove the above statement wrong.\n","c2ccaa57":"This graph has to be interpreted Carefully. We cannot just take it at the face value and say that California has the most shootings. We should also consider population.\n\nRoughly 12% of the population lives in California, so 14% is a bit high. On the other hand, even though New York and New Jersey have a similar percentage of shootings, they have a 1% difference in population. So New Jersey actually has much less shootings as compared to New York.\n\nTo make this graph more readable, you could try to include the population, but I couldn't find any organized data, and just googled it for a few places.","da9d6f22":"Let's see the snippet again","4ca6add8":"These are not repeat rows since the dates, manner of death, and every data point is different.\n\nSince this is not clarified in the data explanation, my guess would be that this is just a fill value inplace of Unknown Name.\n\nLet's try to confirm this by showing a few rows where age is unkown.","34808457":"First thing that is obvious is the name. This is most likely the name of the victim, but the name TK TK repeats quite a lot. In fact, let's check out how many are of this name.","cb490fd9":"# Are the Police Racist? - The Data Can't Say for Sure","5aec06f6":"Looking at this small snippet, we can already see some peculiarities. I have made a separate section at the end for this.\n\nFirst, Let's answer the most obvious question - is the police racist."}}
