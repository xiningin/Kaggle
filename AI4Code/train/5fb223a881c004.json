In order to use the \"Titles\" data, I will have to turn it into numerical data for any classifier to use. I will do this by using categorical values. This assigns each unique element a number, therefore maintaining the distinction between the data while also allowing for the data to become numerical.\n\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/996\/1*K5JbqxIwwPmtiSNQhjLPRg.png)","ab432035":"This looks like a much cleaner breakdwon. In the other pie chart, all of the special names became jumbled together, making it harder for the classifier to learn the difference between them and their impact on the survival rate of the person. Instead here, we have grouped them together, to help create a bigger sample size for the classifier to learn from.","0a37f8b4":"Seems like the percentages of this is very small and insignificant, but still could be an important factor.","48ab32db":"It seems like most of the names are following the pattern of \"LastName, Title. FirstName\" with some of them having a parentheses. The second name in the parentheses may mean something else, but we can't tell for sure until we do more digging. But still, there is plenty of data we can pull from just their name. \n\nFirst, let's take a look at their title. I will extract the title by finding the index of the comma in the name, adding two to it to get the index of the first letter of the title, and then finding the period. I will then index the string, with the beginning and ending index, to get the titles.","01f8452e":"# **Tickets**","85ce1531":"This may not be the best feature for us to use because most of the data is considered null (or 0). But there seems to be clustered around 5 and a little past 10, which could indicate similar types of people.","339473ec":"For both of these graphs, we can see a high percentage of people having 0 parents, children, spouses, or siblings. Therefore, these may not be the best discriminating factors. ","c32aac3c":"As you can see, we worked this out pretty nicely. But there is still a couple things we have to sort through. For the prefix list, there are a lot of very similar prefixs that could be due to spelling errors, such as A\/5 vs A.\/5. I will combine all these by taking out all punctuation in the strings and then making them all uppercase. (Note: The '' denote that there are no prefixes in the string.)"}}
