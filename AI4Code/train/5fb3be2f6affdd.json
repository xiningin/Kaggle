Also, we can't determine exactly the number of infected people since the COVID-19 is characterized by a great number of assymptomatic people. When someone dies, the tests tend to be executed with a higher probability than for those who are infected with no symptoms.\n\nOk. So, imagine we have an exponential function:\n\n$$ f(x) = K.e^x $$\n\nWe can easily calculate the average value of the function:\n\n$$ \\overline{f}(x) = \\int_{x = 0}^{x = T_{final}} f(x) $$\n\nThis will lead us to a value with the same units of \"f(x) = y\". Alright. Let's follow a similar approach to calculate the average value of \"x\" instead of \"y\":\n\n$$ \\overline{x} = \\frac{\\int_{x = 0}^{x = T_{final}} x.f(x)}{\\int_{x = 0}^{x = T_{final}} f(x)} $$\n\n> You can imagine that the average value of a function is a weighted average of the function along the time axis with all different times having the same weight.
