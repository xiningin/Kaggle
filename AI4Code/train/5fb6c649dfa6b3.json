Our best CV model - gradient boosting, turned out to be the best on hold-out dataset as well (and it is also faster than random forest).","766671c2":"Up to this moment we have got best result using numerical features + their logs + age_clipped+ dummy variables + distances to the largest cities.\nLet's try to generate new features","300011bf":"We can visually see that distribution is skewed and not normal. Also it seems that the values are clipped somewhere near 500 000. We can check it numerically.","dfcb2953":"Let's prepare cross validation samples.\nAs far as there are not a lot of data we can easily divide it on 10 folds, that are taken from shuffled train data.\nWithin every split we will train our model on 90% of train data and compute CV metric on the other 10%.\n\nWe fix the random state for the reproducibility.","1b573e02":"We have done a lot but the results surely can be improved, at least one could try:\n\n- feature engineering: polynomial features, better distances to cities (not Euclidean ones, ellipse representation of cities), average values of target for the geographically closest neighbours (requires custom estimator function for correct cross validation)\n- PCA for dimensionality reduction (I have mentioned it but didn't used)\n- other models (at least KNN and SVM can be tried based on data)\n- more time and effort can be spent on RF and LGB parameters tuning","b4a49179":"To sum up, we have got the solution that can predict the mean house value in the block with RMSE \\$46k using our best model - LGB. It is not an extremely precise prediction: \\$46k is about 20% of the average mean house price, but it seems that it is near the possible solution for these classes of model based on this data (it is popular dataset but I have not find any solution with significantly better results). \n\nWe have used old Californian data from 1990 so it is not useful right now. But the same approach can be used to predict modern house prices (if applied to the resent market data).","5819ac6e":"### Random forest","a7db3f23":"So our baseline is RMSE = $68 702 we will try to improve this results using everything we have discovered during the data analysis phase.\n\nWe will do the following steps:\n    - Use scaled features\n    - Add log features \n    - Add NaN and age clip indicating features\n    - Add city-distance features\n    - Generate several new features\n    - Try to predict log(target) instead of target\n    - Tune some hyperparameters of the model","efd03c71":"With the relatively small effort we have got a significant improvement of results. Random Forest results can be further improved by higher n_estimators, let's find the n_estimators at witch the results stabilize. ","46df20c3":"Obviously our linear regression approach is much better. Let's train our model on whole train dataset and apply it to the rows with blanks. But preliminary we will \"remember\" the rows with NaNs, because there is a chance, that it can contain useful information.","d61d5b21":"This graph looks much better, the only non-normal parts are clipped high prices and very low prices. Unfortunately we can not reconstruct clipped data and statistically the distribution it is still not normal - p-value = 0, the null hypothesis of distribution normality can be rejected.\n\nAnyway, predicting of target_log instead of target can be a good choice for us, but we still should check it during model validation phase.","a7c04675":"To deal with log of target we need to create our own cross validation or our own predicting model. We will try the first option","9a410a82":"### Gradient boosting","aacd2565":"Now we will analyse correleation between features and target variable","2319f80c":"And finally let's scale all this features","bd4df8c4":"We have got 5 new good features. Let's update our X variable","9040502a":"We will add new features one by one and keeps only those that improve our best score","fa3e3cd1":"LGBMRegressor has much more hyperparameters than previous models. As far as this is educational problem we will not spend a lot of time to tuning all of them. In this case RandomizedSearchCV can give us very good result quite fast, much faster than GridSearch. We will do optimization in 2 steps: model complexity optimization and convergence optimization. Let's do it.","1e30fef8":"*median_house_value* is our target feature, we will use other features to predict it.\n\nThe task is to predict how much the houses in particular block cost (the median) based on information of blocks location and basic sociodemographic data","a9b2ebeb":"Lets sum up the results of our project. We will compute RMSE on cross validation and holdout set and compare them.","662d0f87":"## 1. Data description"}}
