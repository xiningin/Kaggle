SURVEY REPORT 2019\n\nThe household listing and enumeration identified 56,922 individuals, of whom 32.6% were children under five who were not eligible to participate. Of the 38,353 who were eligible to participate, 29,495 (76.9%) actually participated in symptom interview and\/or CXR screening. This was 86.8% of the desired sample size. Of the participants, 10,884 (36.9%) were eligible for sputum collection based on symptoms, abnormal CXR or inability to perform CXR.\n\nOf the sputum tested in the field, 115 participants had positive results, while 52 had a positive central culture result; 18 had a positive central Xpert result and four had both positive central Xpert and central culture result. In all, 138 participants had positive bacteriological results, but 119 fit the original survey case definition. A revised case definition during the analysis brought this up to 123 individuals. \n\nApplying multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting, the final prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed TB in Namibia is 465 per 100,000 (95%CI, 340-590), which is within the range previously estimated by WHO. The prevalence is higher in males (643\/100,000) than females (304\/100,000). According to this survey, the prevalence of TB in Namibia falls within the range previously estimated by the World Health Organisation confirming Namibia\u2019s high TB-burden status. The higher prevalence in males suggests a male-driven TB epidemic, as has been observed in other studies. Targeted interventions need to specifically address TB in males, given both the high prevalence and their lower participation in health-seeking activities. Additionally, the country should invest in strategies to find and treat undiagnosed TB patients, as the majority of TB cases found during this survey were not on\ntreatment.http:\/\/www.mhss.gov.na\/documents\/119527\/120633\/Namibia+TB+Prevalence+Survey+Report+2019.pdf\/d787e607-ccd6-4919-9eef-6cf0307e8cc6","8bf085be":"#Tuberculosis case holding\n\nThe treatment success rate for new bacteriological positive TB cases in Namibia improved from 64% in 1997 to 87% for the 2016 cohort. In the 2016 cohort, 5% of the patients died while on treatment, 2% failed treatment and 5% were declared lost to follow-up. \n\n#TB\/HIV\n\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) contributes significantly to the high prevalence of TB in Namibia. The estimated HIV prevalence rate for the general population aged 15-64 years was 12.6% in 2017.(ICAP, MoHSS and CDC, 2018) HIV prevalence among TB patients peaked at 67% in 2006 gradually reducing to 36% in 2017.\n\nAll public health facilities offer access to HIV counselling and testing, with a high coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for those eligible. ART coverage has improved to 96% in 2017 owing to revisions to the eligibility criteria for starting ART in HIV-infected TB patients over the years. Figure 8 shows the trends on coverage of HIV care services for TB patients from 2007 to 2017 in Namibia.\n\n#Drug Resistant Tuberculosis\n\nThe first anti-TB drug resistance survey conducted in 2008-9 showed a Multi Drug resistant-TB (MDRTB) prevalence of 3.8% (95% CI: 2.8%-5.1%) among patients newly diagnosed with TB and 16.5% (95% CI: 13.0%-20.8%) in patients previously treated for TB.\n\nThe second survey in 2014-15 showed the prevalence of MDR-TB to be 3.9% (95% CI: 3.1%-4.7%) among patients newly diagnosed with TB and 9.2% (95% CI: 7.1%-10.3 %) among patients previously treated for TB. In 2017, Namibia reported 417 confirmed DR-TB cases. This is higher than cases reported in earlier years, which may be attributed to improved diagnosis as the new diagnostic algorithm for TB\nintroduced in 2017 allows more sensitive rapid molecular tests (Xpert MTB\/RIF) to be performed on the first sample from all presumptive cases.http:\/\/www.mhss.gov.na\/documents\/119527\/120633\/Namibia+TB+Prevalence+Survey+Report+2019.pdf\/d787e607-ccd6-4919-9eef-6cf0307e8cc6","6b6610ab":"#Codes from Taha07 https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/taha07\/car-price-prediction\/comments","c84a02e7":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSAlwhvTHnxzGhu54C8LIdIZQT8h7Poe9Tuij1pTvjb&s)https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/tb\/worldtbday\/default.htm#:~:text=It's%20TIME!,that%20causes%20tuberculosis%20(TB).","858cc3bb":"#About 300 people marched through Oshakati to commemorate World TB Day under the them \"It's time to End TB\".\n\n![](https:\/\/d2v9ipibika81v.cloudfront.net\/uploads\/sites\/132\/DSCN1581-web.jpg)https:\/\/na.usembassy.gov\/world-tb-day-commemoration","3c817499":"Figure above\n\n`new_sp_coh`: Outcomes for new pulmonary smear-positive (and\/or culture-positive) cases: cohort size \n\n`new_sp_cmplt`: Outcomes for new pulmonary smear-positive Completed\n\n`new_sp_fail`: Outcomes for new pulmonary smear-positive failed\n\n`new_sp_def`: Outcomes for new pulmonary smear-positive defaulted\n\n`c_new_sp_tsr`: Treatment success rate for new pulmonary smear-positive (and\/or culture-positive) cases, percent\n\n`ret_coh`: Outcomes for previously treated patients, cohort size. \n\n`ret_cur`: Outcomes for re-treatment cases: cured \n\n`c_new_tsr`: Treatment success rate for all new cases percent\n\n`c_ret_tsr`: Treatment success rate for re-treatment cases percent.","50f8e7bd":"#Burden of tuberculosis in Namibia\n\nTuberculosis notifications\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease of major public health significance in Namibia. The disease is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization in public health facilities. Namibia ranked ninth highest in the estimated incidence rate of TB in the world after South Africa, Lesotho and Kiribati, which were top three respectively (Figure 1) (World Health Organization, 2017).\n\nThe estimated incidence of TB in Namibia has been on the decline from 2004 to 2016. Despite this decline, Namibia did not reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Stop TB target of reducing incidence by 50% relative to the 1990 levels.

The MoHSS Strategic Plan (2017\/2018 to 2021\/2022) highlights the reduction in the incidence and prevalence of communicable diseases. The key guiding principles to realise this reduction are: equity, accessibility, availability, affordability, community involvement, sustainability, inter-sectoral collaboration and quality of care. In 2017, the NTLP launched its Third Medium Term Strategic Plan (MTP-III) for TB and Leprosy 2017\/2018 to 2021\/2022. The plan is designed to accelerate Namibia\u2019s progress towards national and international TB targets and is closely aligned to the End TB Strategy.\n\nNamibia has decentralized provision of health care services with four levels of care (national, regional, district and community). The MoHSS has 14 regional health directorates and 35 health districts. The NTLP operates within this hierarchical management framework. The public health system comprises a national referral hospital, intermediate hospitals, district hospitals, health centers, clinics, outreach points,social welfare service points and Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) points.

gap between notified cases reported by the NTLP and the incidence estimated by WHO suggested that Namibia was missing approximately 30% of TB cases when the survey was conceived. The missed TB cases are generally responsible for the growing spread of TB. Consequently, the high number of TB cases places a burden on health and social services infrastructure.\n\nCurrently, TB cases in Namibia are primarily detected through passive surveillance with infrequent active surveillance among selected groups. While the number of people diagnosed and reported through the country\u2019s surveillance system for TB is well documented, the number of people with active TB at any given time is unknown. There is limited or no data on the following groups:\npatients with TB treated outside the public health sector, patients with symptoms compatible with TB at any given time, including the proportion who are being appropriately investigated, and patients with TB but have not accessed the available health services.\n \nA prevalence survey is the best tool currently available to measure a country\u2019s true TB burden, critical for informing resource allocation and public health interventions. It was, therefore, pertinent that Namibia conducts a TB prevalence survey in order to address knowledge gaps that existed in addressing the national TB burden.http:\/\/www.mhss.gov.na\/documents\/119527\/120633\/Namibia+TB+Prevalence+Survey+Report+2019.pdf\/d787e607-ccd6-4919-9eef-6cf0307e8cc6","9d87dc09":"Tuberculosis (TB) is endemic in Namibia, and people with untreated infectious TB are the source of transmission. Unless TB is considered when individuals attend healthcare services, diagnosis will be delayed or missed altogether, and effective TB\ninfection control (IC) measures (including effective treatment) might not be in place.\n\nDue to the various afflictions often associated with HIV infection, people living with HIV tend to attend health facilities more frequently than other patients. This factor, plus the fact that they are more susceptible to developing TB if they become\ninfected, necessitates the establishment of measures to protect them from infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) \n\nThe first edition of the Tuberculosis Infection Control Guidelines was developed in 2009, and has been crucial in establishing a programme for the implementation of control measures in health facilities, especially at treatment sites for drug-resistant TB. This, the second edition of the guidelines, provides updates based on new knowledge and lessons learnt during implementation of the first version. These guidelines are complementary to the overall infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) and are meant to assist in the establishment of a framework for TB infection control (TB-IC)\nin health facilities, as well as in those congregate and community settings where the potential for transmission of TB is likely to be high. They provide both technical and operational guidance and also detail and prioritize the necessary managerial activities and administrative controls at all levels of the health system.https:\/\/www.challengetb.org\/publications\/tools\/country\/Namibia_Infection_Control_Guidelines.pdf"}}
