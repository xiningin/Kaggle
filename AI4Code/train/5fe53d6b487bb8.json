But we can get a estimate (Estimate within the people of different racial groups and how many of them were considered dangerous)\n\nThe data doesnt dissapoint. Yes, most of the people were considered dangerous and hence were shot down ( The truth However is yet to be seen #BlackLivesMatter)","3a93a079":"## Is Race a deciding variable?\n","44a759aa":"## The role of mental illness in the threat level (percived threat level) and The manner they were killed\n\nYES! I have seen a lot of Mindhunter, so genuinely I was curious to see if Mental Illnesses have any effect on the nature of killings and the threat that they have been seen as","7d0dd41c":"Now comes the meat and the very reason for my analysis to answer the age old question is Police Racist?","1d655ef0":"# Conclusion\n","0ea4c303":"# Missing Values","22b77ece":"## What infereneces could be drawn?\nJust by looking at this data we can see the police is anything but racist. \n\nBut then why was there a recent uprising of #BlackLivesMatter?\n\nWell the answer is very simple. This data that we have here is biased. There is no problem in the data itself but the total amount or rather the propotion of the population belonging to each Racial Profile is missing. \n## What does that mean?\n\n\nWell, in a country like America there are more White people than African American. So, we really should not derive any conclusion just on the basis of number. We Have to factor in the population belonging in each racial profile before we can answer the Question is Police Racist?","6859be38":"Here we see the different types of values stored in each column","5ef7a156":"# The states VS the number of shootings","3874eb39":"So, I was curious about this dataset because of the sheer volume of information it contains.

One thing however I saw that the number of people who were mentally ill were majorly shot down and not tasered (Which is a good thing I guess?)","2089a2fd":"Just a simple check to see which column has how many missing values.

How were they Fleeing?)","270d34e7":"As it turns out most of the people who were shot were in the age group of 20-40. So, young people are more nefarious.","a0341471":"# Date time changes\n","4b15674f":"# Racial Profiling of the data","ff81cbc7":"So, I wanted to see how many people who were killed were young or old.

Here I wanted to answer the question of how were each of the indviduals killed and what gender did they belong to.
