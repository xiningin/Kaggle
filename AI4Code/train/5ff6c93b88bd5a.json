It explains the process and flow of automation, standardization, processing, and analysis of data. In the *second kernel*, the first component of the solution pipeline : data integration and processing is implemented. It processes both core level data as well as department level data. In the *third kernel*, this pipeline is executed and run for several departments. After all the standardized and clean data is produced, it is analysed with different formats of the Analysis Framework in 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 kernels. In *kernel 4.1*, core analysis is done along with link with crime rate and poverty data. In *kernel 4.2*, core analysis is done along with statistical analysis. In *kernel 4.3*, officer level analysis is done. \n\n<hr>\n\nThis kernel, is the fourth of the series.

Key Highlights <hr><\/font>\n\nOfficer level data is not shared by every department, but if shared it can be used to analyse the racial bias from a different perspective - officer attributes. In this kernel, I have shared the analysis done from the officer level attributes. Following are the key highlights of the analysis: \n\n- Officers having age less than 30 have used force more on blacks than whites among the total subjects which they encountered.  \n- Recently recruited officers tend to show some level of racial bias, as their use-of-force on blacks is much higher than that of whites.  \n- More experienced officers have used force more on whites than blacks, indicating that this agegroup does not shows very high racial bias specifically on black population.  \n- Use of force severity is highest on hispanics, followed by blacks and then whites.  \n- The most significant factors that affects the severity of use of force are about race of the subject and years of experience of the officer.  \n\n\n\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2. Racial Bias : Officer Level Analysis <hr><\/font>\n\nAll the analysis is first done at high level and then by controlling the socio-econometric or demographic factors of the area which the department serves. As the first step, we set the department and load the processed datasets that were produced from the data processing and analysis pipeline. ","8e5e360b":"<a id=\"2.7\"><\/a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.7 Disparity Score : A Naive Model (Example) <hr><\/font>\n\nCPE can infact use these statistics at the first level to come up with a racial disparity score of every department. **Ofcourse, this is calculated from the officer level attributes but the idea is that such statistics can be calculated from other attributes as well.** For example, Police Activity Statistical Measures : total count of use of force, use of force on blacks, difference in blacks and whites etc.   \n\nA simple naive model can be built by obtaining the normalized score of these statistical measures. For example, the first statistics : percentage of UOF on blacks is more than whites. I created a following table (which can be fine tuned with iterative runs and domain knowledge) which can be used to normalize the statistical scores, for example in this case, the percentage of officers whose UOF on blacks is more than whites is 62%, so it turns out to be 8.5\n\n<table>\n    <tr><td>**Statistical Measure** <\/td> <td> **Range** <\/td> <td> **Normalized Score** <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 0 - 10 <\/td> <td> 1 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 10 - 20 <\/td> <td> 3 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 20 - 30 <\/td> <td> 5 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 30 - 40 <\/td> <td> 6 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 40 - 50 <\/td> <td> 7 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 50 - 60 <\/td> <td> 8.0 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 60 - 70 <\/td> <td> 8.5 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 70 - 80 <\/td> <td> 9 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 80 - 90 <\/td> <td> 9.5 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 90 - 100 <\/td> <td> 10 <\/td>  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\nSimilar tables can be developed and improved for other statistics as well. And finally, weights can be decided for every statistics. For example - \n\n<table>\n    <tr><td>**Statistical Measure**<\/td> <td> **Weight** <\/td> <\/tr>\n    <tr><td> UOF_officers : blacks > whites <\/td> <td> 0.40 <\/td> <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : only_on_blacks <\/td> <td> 0.30 <\/td> <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : whites > blacks <\/td> <td> 0.20 <\/td> <\/tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : large_difference <\/td> <td> 0.10 <\/td> <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\nSo in this case, the normalized racial score for Indianapolis department can be calculated as following: \n\nnormalized scores : 8.5 for UOF_officers : blacks > whites, 6 for UOF_officers : only_on_blacks, 7 for UOF_officers : whites > blacks, and 4 for UOF_officers : large_difference\n\n8.5 ( 0.40 ) + 6 ( 0.35 ) + 7 ( 0.20 ) + 4 ( 0.10 ) = 7.3 \n\n## Racial Disparity Score (Indianapolis) = 7.3 \/ 10 \n\nA similar score can be calculated for other departments and can be shared in their reports which help the departments understand where and till what level's they need to improve. \n\n<a id=\"2.8\"><\/a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.8 Measuring Racial Bias : Use of Force Severity <hr><\/font>\n\nOne insight to measure racial bias in the department can be about Severity of Force Used and checking it which race has the highest severity on an average. However, this variable is not directly available, so we can quantify it using following weighing scheme. I refered one of the CPE report to came up with this type of weighing. \n\n<table>\n    <tr> <td>** Use of Force Type** <\/td> <td> **Severity Score** <\/td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Physical Use of Force<\/td> <td> 1 <\/td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Canine<\/td> <td> 2 <\/td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Use of CS\/OC <\/td> <td> 3.5 <\/td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Less Lethal <\/td> <td> 5 <\/td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Lethal Handgun <\/td> <td> 8 <\/td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Lethal Vehicle <\/td> <td> 10 <\/td> <tr>\n<\/table>\n\nBased on this weighing, we can plot the average severity of use of force by different race of the subjects. \n","64185d57":"> - The above dataframe is the officer profile database, in this table every row is a profile of an officer which shows the aggregated analysis of the officer and the subjects handelled by them in the past.  \n> - The main columns are \"uof_count\" : Total number of times force used, \"black\/white\/hispanic_subjects_per\" : percentage of force used on black\/white\/hispanic subjects, and \"difference_b_w\" : Difference between the force used percentages of black subjects and white subjects.\n> - Officer profiling will help us to evaluate the department. \n\n<a id=\"2.5\"><\/a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.5 Department Level : Extent of Racial Disparity <hr><\/font>\n\nIn order to understand the extent of racial disparity that exist in a department. We analyse the number of officers having more black subject encounters than whites. If this number turns out to be very high, then levels of racial disparity are also higher. We now analyse the number of black vs white subjects encountered by number of officers. ","d3aab0f2":"**Graph Interpretation**\n\n*The first plot indicates that population proportion of black people is about 28% while it is about 61% for whites. The second graph represents the percentage of subjects who received force from the police officers of different age. The Y axis represents the percentage of subjects, X axis represents the officer age. Additionally, we observe the percentage of two groups of subjects - blacks and whites*  \n\n**Inference**\n\n> - Though there is a big difference in the population of blacks and whites, the force used by police officer of different age groups shows different distributions. \n> - We can observe is that when **officer age is less than 30, then height of black bars is more than that of white bars**. This indicates that officers having age less than 30 have used force more on blacks than whites among the total subjects which they encountered. This reflects **a form of racial disparity.**  \n> - Also, we can observe that officers aged more than 30 have higher white bars than black bars (mostly all of them). This indicates that **officers with 30+ age tend to use force more on whites than blacks**. This also aligns with the population propotions of whites and blacks in the areas, thus reflecting a very low or no racial disparity.  \n\n<a id=\"2.2\"><\/a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.2 Experienced Vs Junior Officers : Use of Force <hr><\/font>\n\nNext, we analyse how much disparity exist when we observe the officer subject's encountered separated by different years in service served by them. ","29db07e9":"**Inferences**  \n\n> - The most significant variables that affects the severity of use of force are : \n\n        - is_black_subj : If the subject is Black  \n        - is_hispanic_subj : If the subject is Hispanic  \n        - OFFICER_YEARS_ON_FORCE : Number of years an officer has served in the department  \n\nThough, the model may be suffering from multicollineartiy problems but if we concentrate only on the significant variables, it can be stated that being a black or hispanic increases the chances that officers will be using force, that too more severe. \n","94e905a6":"<a id=\"2.1\"><\/a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.1 Force Used by Officer Age <hr><\/font>\n\nFirst, we look at the proportion of force used by police on black subjects and white subjects distributed the offier age. We try to find if there exist some level of racial disparity in the force used by police by police officers of different age-groups. This will help to identify which age group has high racial bias characteristics. ","191e4564":"**Inferences**  \n> - **Recently recruited officers tend to show some level of racial bias**, as their **use-of-force on blacks is much higher than that of whites**.

We will plot a co-occurance matrix in order to visualize it.
