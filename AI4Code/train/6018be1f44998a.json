One is \"ds\" as datastamp and another is \"y\" as value that we want to forecast.\nAfter we fit dataframe to model we make a forecast. As a result we are given dataframe with predicted values. Among those values are the boundaries of the uncertainty interval (lower and upper).\n","330370ec":"## Historical Price\n\n### Candlesticks \nHistorical Price chart are often represented in candlestick charts which are used to show traders \"emotion\" by visually representing the size of price moves with two different colors. Traders are using those charts to to make trading decisions based on occurring patterns.\n\nThere are two main patterns that are used in candlestick charts. One is bullish and another one is bearish. \nBullish patters indicate that price of the stock is likely to rise, while Bearish patter indicate fall in the stock price. However one must remember that candlestick charts and its patterns are representing only tendencies in price movement.\n\nHere's image I made that explains Candlestick's\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/BztW98W\/Bearish-Redish.png\" alt=\"Bearish-Redish\" border=\"0\" \/>\n\n\n","1635d3e0":"## Introduction\nIn this kernel I will deliver EDA and Forecast for Stock Prices from Spanish Stocks Historical Data. <br>\nDataset which will be primary focus of the work is about the company named <b>Repsol S.A<\/b>\n\nRepsol is Spanish energy company that hires over 24,000 of employees world-wide.
