The marketing team is\n   preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get\n   more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends.\n\n   They would like me to take a look at the recent data and get some insights.\n   The possible questions that we can ask ourselves is:\n   * Characteristics of the most viewed boat listings in the last 7 days\n   * Is it the most expensive boats that get the most views? \n   * Are there common features among the most viewed boats?\n","0bfe8562":"* **Let's look at the year of manufacture of the most_viewed boats, Materials used**","65b5ad80":"* Characteristics of the most viewed boat listings in the last 7 days\n   - They can or cannot have high prices, as from the above analysis, price is not a factor on the views a boat gets. Along with that there are all the other factors such as 'Type': most of the boats are **Used and are Unleaded**. \n   \n* Is it the most expensive boats that get the most views?\n    - Definitely not, as we seen earlier, the price of the boat has nothing to do with the popularity it gets. The most viewed boat was not that expensive compared to other entries in the data set.\n\n* Are there common features among the most viewed boats?\n    - Yes there are some common features. For example, most of the popular boats had **'GRP'** as their build material. Also they are **Unused Boats, Unleaded**. "}}
