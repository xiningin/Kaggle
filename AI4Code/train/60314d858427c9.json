So open a new window by clicking on [this link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/home-data-for-ml-course).  Then click on the **Join Competition** button.\n\n![join competition image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wLmFtH3.png)\n\nNext, follow the instructions below:\n1. Begin by clicking on the blue **Save Version** button in the top right corner of the window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n2. Ensure that the **Save and Run All** option is selected, and then click on the blue **Save** button.\n3. This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **Save Version** button.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen.  Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**.  This brings you into view mode of the same page.
