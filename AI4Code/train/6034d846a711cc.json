Since he has been elected, no real change in the compound positivity\/negativity can be seen.\n\nI searched on Wikipedia to see if something special happened to him in the year 2011 and this is what I found:\n\nTrump speculated about running for president in the 2012 election, making his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011 and giving speeches in early primary states. In May 2011 he announced that he would not run.\n\nTrump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time. Before the 2016 election, The New York Times speculated that Trump \"accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world\" after Obama lampooned him at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April 2011.\n\nIn 2011 the then-superintendent of the New York Military Academy, Jeffrey Coverdale, ordered the then-headmaster of the school, Evan Jones, to give him Trump's academic records so that he could keep them secret, according to Jones. Coverdale said he had been asked to add to hand the records over to members of the school's board of trustees who were Mr. Trump's friends, but he refused to give the records to anyone and instead sealed Trump's records on campus. The incident reportedly happened days after Trump demanded the release of President Barack Obama's academic records.\n\n<strong>Trump launched his political career in 2011 as a leading proponent of \"birther\" conspiracy theories alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.<\/strong> In April 2011, Trump claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later saying this made him \"very popular\". In September 2016, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S. and falsely claimed that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign. <a href = \"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump\">source<\/a>\n\n","4f1c3978":"There is a high correlation between retweets and favorites, but the correlation between compound and the two others is quite low.
