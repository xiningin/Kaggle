This number is obtained through DHC Primary Research. Licensed beds for Health Systems are equal to the total number of licensed beds of individual Hospitals within a given Health System.\n\n \n\n**Number of Staffed Beds:**  is defined as an \"adult bed, pediatric bed, birthing room, or newborn ICU bed (excluding newborn bassinets) maintained in a patient care area for lodging patients in acute, long term, or domiciliary areas of the hospital.\"  Beds in labor room, birthing room, post-anesthesia, postoperative recovery rooms, outpatient areas, emergency rooms, ancillary departments, nurses and other staff residences, and other such areas which are regularly maintained and utilized for only a portion of the stay of patients (primarily for special procedures or not for inpatient lodging) are not termed a bed for these purposes.  Definitive Healthcare sources Staffed Bed data from the Medicare Cost Report or Proprietary Research as needed. As with all Medicare Cost Report metrics, this number is self-reported by providers. Staffed beds for Health Systems are equal to the total number of staffed beds of individual Hospitals within a given Health System.  Total number of staffed beds in the US should exclude Hospital Systems to avoid double counting.  ICU beds are likely to follow the same logic as a subset of Staffed beds.\n\n \n\n**Number of ICU Beds - ICU (Intensive Care Unit) Beds: ** are qualified ICU based on definitions by CMS, Section 2202.7, 22-8.2. These beds include ICU beds, psychiatric ICU beds, and Detox ICU beds.\n\n\n\n**Adult ICU Beds (Legacy):** In an emergency situation, hospitals may use additional intensive care beds to supplement an influx of patients.  This number consists of all ICU beds, burn ICU beds, surgical ICU beds, or trauma ICU beds minus any pediatric, premature or neonatal ICU beds.\n\n\n\n**Pediatric ICU Beds:** are a combination of neonatal, pediatric and premature ICU beds.\n\n\n\n**Average Ventilator Usage:** is the average number of patients on a ventilator per week based on an analysis of 2016-2019 Medicare & commercial claims volumes by Definitive Healthcare.\n\n \n\n**Bed Utilization Rate:**   is calculated based on metrics from the Medicare Cost Report: Bed Utilization Rate = Total Patient Days (excluding nursery days)\/Bed Days Available\n\n\n\n**Potential Increase in Bed Capacity:** This metric is computed by subtracting \u201cNumber of Staffed Beds from Number of Licensed beds\u201d (Licensed Beds \u2013 Staffed Beds). This would provide insights into scenario planning for when staff can be shifted around to increase available bed capacity as needed. \n\n \n\n**Hospital Definition:**  Definitive Healthcare defines a hospital as a healthcare institution providing inpatient, therapeutic, or rehabilitation services under the supervision of physicians. In order for a facility to be considered a hospital it must provide inpatient care. ","52a628db":"**Reading Data**"}}
