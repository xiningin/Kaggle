However, there is  a pattern of housing prices according to location and amenities provided by facility. AirBnB tries to predict these prices to negotiate with facility hosts to keep prices in check and offer better services to customers which is a win-win deal for both hosts and customers.\n\nIn this project we will,  build a price prediction model for AirBnB facilities in New York and for future listings.\n\n![AirBnB](http:\/\/https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/997\/1*8Zz18eO-oIGQwZIAESgWJg.jpeg)","8d1e171d":"### Room type analysis","565cf1dc":"## Gradient Boosting","14b53114":"### Price wise analysis of rooms","d1a2de57":"### Area wise visualization of availability of listings","f03367f5":"**Observation:**\n1.

It sets up prices of listing according to multiple parameters and provides independence to listing owners to decide their own prices.

Since, it is a linear model regression problem, we will use explained variance score,mean-squared-error, and R^2  score for evaluation .\n\n3. How will this predictive model help the client?\nAns. The client can predict prices according to location and condition of facility and negotiate with host with a range of prices. This will help in building a better and affordable listing for customers and set right expectations for customers at affordable prices. If prices are set high by host, then it would be a loss outcome for all-host,airbnb and customer.","e06f6b7e":"### Correlation among variables","42fac08b":"**Observation:**\n1.
