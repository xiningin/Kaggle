10 courses on Coursera are not present in the top 5 organizations list with highest rating.\n- There is no Computer Science course in the top 10 highest rated courses on Coursera. (Please prove me wrong!)\n- Course difficulty does affect the number of students enrolled. There are more students enrolled in Beginner and Mixed level of difficulty courses than Intermediate and Advanced.\n- Course difficulty does not affect course rating.\n- Course certificate type does impact the number of students enrolled in that course. More number of students tend to enroll for Professional Certificate courses than just \"COURSE\" certificate.\n- Certificate type does not impact course rating.\n- There is no strong relation to prove that if more number of students are enrolled in a course, the course rating is a higher.","c44ba3c6":"## Data Pre-processing\nAs we can see that the column course_students_enrolled is of the type object. That is due to the \"k\" or \"m\" after the number. We need to deal with that before starting any analysis.","4d41f873":"## Does course difficulty affect rating?\nDo courses with advanced level of difficulty get lower rating? Is there any relation between the two?","666f03ce":"Well, there are more number of students enrolled per Mixed difficulty level course rather than Beginner.","e47d500b":"## Top 5 courses on Coursera\nLet's look at the top 5 courses on Coursera by course rating","fdd263fc":"You see, there is a very small positive correlation, hence its not enough to prove our assumption that more number of students enrolled in your course does lead to higher rating.","cfdd8da6":"Now, its fine. We can start with data analysis!","e8e4b1e4":"Still, no difference.","cc142a70":"As you can see, none of these organizations belong to that group who have more than 10 courses.","b300d8fb":"## Which organization has the highest course rating?\nWhat do you think? Will the organization with highest course rating have more than 10 courses?","5191c1ff":"## Does certificate type impact number of students enrolled?\nThis could be a very important question for Coursera and for the organizations who are making courses. What type of certificate should be there for maximum student enrollment and how should Coursera optimize the course recommendations based on the type of certificates?","c94424a2":"As you can see, there is a very little difference between the average course rating of all these organizations. Hence, they don't focus on just quantity.","99f4eedd":"Nope, very less difference in the ratings.","21976c03":"## Average course rating of the organizations with more than 10 courses\nHere, we want to see whether these organizations produce quality courses or is it just quantity over quality?","606d1fec":"## Does certificate type impact course rating?\nDo professional certificates have a higher rating because they are accepted everywhere or is there still no impact?","aeba6d3b":"University of Pennsylvania dominates here, with just about 60 courses, followed University of Michigan who has just over 40 courses on Coursera!","1bf34ce2":"Yes! More number of students on an average enroll in Professional Certificate courses followed by a specialization.","dcc44c39":"There is a small datapoint at the bottom which says that less number of students meaning low rating, but this does not prove our assumption as there is no strong relation. We can check how strong is the relation by finding correlation between the two.","e1899f12":"## Number of students enrolled vs. course rating\nLast but not the least, if there a large number of students enrolled in your course, does that impact the course rating?","41b839cc":"## Does course difficulty affect number of students enrolled?\n\nFor this we will check the average number of students enrolled grouping by difficulty.","5ead1f49":"## Which organization has the most number of courses?\nHere, we want to check two things. First, which organization has the most number of courses on Coursera. Next, which all organizations have more than 10 courses on coursera.
