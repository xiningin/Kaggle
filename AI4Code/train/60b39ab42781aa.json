For example, if you built a classifier to detect spam emails vs. normal emails, then you should consider classification performance metrics, such as average accuracy, log-loss, and AUC. If you are trying to predict a score, such as Google\u2019s daily stock price, then you might want to consider regression metrics like the root mean-squared error (RMSE). If you are ranking items by relevance to a query, such as in a search engine, then you'll want to look into ranking losses such as precision-recall (also popular as a classification metric), or NDCG. ","78bceeaa":"# <a id='3'>3. Why do we want to use Turi Create<\/a>\n\nThere are many machine learning libraries in Python, most of which cannot be easily scaled to large datasets. Turi Create enables us to create a wide range of ML models, without having to install additional packages. It is easy to use, contains useful plotting options, and is flexible regarding the data you might want to use.\nTuri Create can accomplish many ML tasks, most without the need of additional libraries.\n\nBenefits -\n\n* Easy-to-use: Focus on tasks instead of algorithms\n* Visual: Built-in, streaming visualizations to explore your data\n* Flexible: Supports text, images, audio, video and sensor data\n* Fast and Scalable: Work with large datasets on a single machine\n* Ready To Deploy: Export models to Core ML for use in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps","4f87ce91":"# <a id='1'>1. Introduction<\/a>\n\nTuri Create is a open source contribution by Apple.It boasts of easy-to-use creation and deployment of machine learning models for complex tasks such as object detection, activity classification, and recommendation systems.\n\nI remember that void that when Turi (the company that created GraphLab Create \u2013 an amazing machine learning library) was acquired by Apple. Everyone in the data science industry had been waiting for this kind of explosion to happen!\n\nTuriCreate is developed specially for python. One of the best features that TuriCreate provides is its easy deployability of machine learning models to Core ML (another open source software by Apple) for use in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps\n","d0f42580":"# <a id='6'>6. Regression<\/a>\n\nLinear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x)","c8ebe38b":"# <a id='5'>5. Text Classification<\/a>","49e154cb":"## Create a simple regression model ","79b51241":"# <a id='4'>4. Image Classification<\/a>\nLet's see how we can easily create simple image classfier model using Turi Create.\n\nThe CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 color images of 32 x 32 pixels in 3 channels divided into 10 classes. Each class contains 6,000 images. The training set contains 50,000 images, while the test sets provides 10,000 images. This image taken from the CIFAR repository ( https:\/\/www.cs.toronto.edu\/~kriz\/cifar.html ). This is a classification problem with 10 classes(muti-label classification). We can take a view on this image for more comprehension of the dataset.\n\n","1983ca10":"### So this is how the image classification done using Turicreate.If you want your app to recognize specific objects in images, you can build your own model with just a few lines of code.","088e9d73":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","443145af":"#### Here are the predictions done by our model","3378c11c":"Training a text classifier is really important when you want to tune the model to your data set to take advantage of vocabulary that is particular to your application. The text classifier in Turi Create is currently a simple combination of two components:\n\n* feature engineering:  a bag-of-words transformation\n* statistical model:  a LogisticClassifier is used to classify text based on the above features\n\n\n### Bag of Words (BOW)\n\nBag of Words is a method to extract features from text documents. These features can be used for training machine learning algorithms. It creates a vocabulary of all the unique words occurring in all the documents in the training set.\n\nIn simple terms, it\u2019s a collection of words to represent a sentence with word count and mostly disregarding the order in which they appear.\n\nBOW is an approach widely used with:\n\n* Natural language processing\n* Information retrieval from documents\n* Document classifications","3c064b59":"# SFrames\n\nSFrames are the primary data structure for extracting data from other sources for use in Turi Create.\n\nSFrames is a scalable data frame. They are disk backed data frames. So you can eaisly work with datasets that are larger than your available RAM.","5eaf82bb":"Text classification - commonly used in tasks such as sentiment analysis - refers to the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract subjective information such as the polarity of the text, e.g., whether or not the author is speaking positively or negatively about some topic.\n\nLet's now take a look at a simple example of sentiment analysis where I am using [customer review](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/vigneshwarsofficial\/reviews) dataset from kaggle.Here I will be predicting sentiment from customer reviews.\nThe dataset consists of 1000 rows and 2 columns. Review Column consist of customer reviews and like column consist of 0 and 1. If the review is positive, 1 and if negative, 0.\n","3c54371a":"Here I am using dataset contains [house sale prices](http:\/\/https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/harlfoxem\/housesalesprediction) for King County, which includes Seattle.
