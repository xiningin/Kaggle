For rural migrants without nearby family, childcare can be a major problem. However, an ELC placement was a dream come true for Thuy. Then, over a month ago, the preschool closed as part of Vietnam\u2019s efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThis week Thuy shared a note to her 3-year-old daughter Van with ELC teachers. Van has been taken to the countryside to stay with grandparents until school opens again.\n\nThuy writes below. https:\/\/onesky.org\/coronavirus-schools-vietnam-childcare\/","9effa99b":"#Attention in the Map below: locationmode='country names' Country names isn't a column name.

In the context of the pandemic and in the post-pandemic, this problem can become worse.\n\nMaintaining the current pace, 17.5 per cent of young people who are now 16 years old will not complete basic education (pre-school, elementary and high school). The survey measured the total social cost of each young person without basic education in four dimensions:\n\n1- employability and remuneration of young people; 2- effects that young people's remuneration has for society, which are called externalities; 3- longevity with quality of life; and 4 - violence.\n\nInitially, the survey calculated how many young people will not complete basic education, maintaining the current pace. Then, what would be the consequences, in monetary values, per young person in the four dimensions. Finally, it's estimated the total cost for the country.\n\nThe result is that, annually, the country loses R$ 372 thousand per young person who does not finish basic education. This is because young people who have completed basic education spend, on average, more of their productive lives occupied and in formal jobs, with higher remuneration; have higher quality life expectancy - it is estimated that each young person with basic education will live four years longer than a young person who has not finished school -; and they tend to be less involved in violent activities, such as homicides - the estimate is that evasion represents a loss of 26 per cent of the value of a young person's life.\nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/monitormercantil.com.br\/brasil-perde-r-214-bi-por-ano-com-evasao-escolar-de-jovens&prev=search&pto=aue","9431907f":"#It doesn't matter what level of Incomes Countries\/Regions have.
