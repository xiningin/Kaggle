For the geographical zone North-West (NW) of France, two different masks are stored in a netCDF file:\n\n* the **land-sea mask**, stored in the ```lsm``` field. The values are binary : 0 for sea and 1 for land.\n\n* the **relief mask**, stored in the ```p3008``` field. The values are in meters.\n\n\nThe spatial resolution is 0.025\u00b0. \nThese data are constant fields which come from the fine-mesh french weather model called 'AROME'. \n\nFor more information about data, cf [documentation](https:\/\/meteofrance.github.io\/meteonet\/english\/data\/land-relief-masks\/).","01afc500":"Open the netCDF file :","8c1b0ca4":"## Exploring the xarray grid format\nOverview of the data and metadata : ","654e6de0":"## Plotting the masks with Cartopy","61593480":"Print information about the coordinates (latitude and longitude):","b7245b92":"## Simple plots"}}
