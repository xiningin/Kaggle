Although we can't prove that PCA or SVD has been applied, we can't rule it out either\n* Applying PCA or SVD on categorical data makes it hard to see that the data was originally categorical after the transform. For example, there are no bands\/stripes in the cross plots to suggest discretisation. It looks pretty difficult to recover any categories from the transformed data\n* PCA features typically have a mean close to zero. The Santander features do not.
