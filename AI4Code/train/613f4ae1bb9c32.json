It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.","be1e871d":"plotting the histogram of dataset","242a7fe0":"Finally, generate y_pred (predicted values for x_test) and calculate the accuracy for the model.
