Each item of clothing is in a 28x28 greyscale image. You can see some examples here:\n\n![alt text](https:\/\/github.com\/zalandoresearch\/fashion-mnist\/raw\/master\/doc\/img\/fashion-mnist-sprite.png)","35b4269a":"### Exercise 2: \nLet's now look at the layers in your model. Experiment with different values for the dense layer with 512 neurons. What different results do you get for loss, training time etc? Why do you think that's the case? \n\n","fa79d02c":"### Exercise 4: \n\nConsider the impact of training for more or less epochs. Why do you think that would be the case? \n\nTry 15 epochs -- you'll probably get a model with a much better loss than the one with 5\nTry 30 epochs -- you might see the loss value stops decreasing, and sometimes increases. This is a side effect of something called 'overfitting' which you can learn about [somewhere] and it's something you need to keep an eye out for when training neural networks. There's no point in wasting your time training if you aren't improving your loss, right! :)","70af3982":"What does these values look like? Let's print a training image, and a training label to see...Experiment with different indices in the array. For example, also take a look at index 42...that's a a different boot than the one at index 0\n","9c260a9d":"Once it's done training -- you should see an accuracy value at the end of the final epoch. It might look something like 0.9098. This tells you that your neural network is about 91% accurate in classifying the training data. I.E., it figured out a pattern match between the image and the labels that worked 91% of the time. Not great, but not bad considering it was only trained for 5 epochs and done quite quickly.\n\nBut how would it work with unseen data? That's why we have the test images. We can call model.evaluate, and pass in the two sets, and it will report back the loss for each. Let's give it a try:","ea6ca5ec":"You'll notice that all of the values in the number are between 0 and 255. If we are training a neural network, for various reasons it's easier if we treat all values as between 0 and 1, a process called '**normalizing**'...and fortunately in Python it's easy to normalize a list like this without looping. You do it like this:","6ee53fed":"### Exercise 3: \n\nConsider the effects of additional layers in the network. What will happen if you add another layer between the one with 512 and the final layer with 10. \n\nAns: There isn't a significant impact -- because this is relatively simple data. For far more complex data (including color images to be classified as flowers that you'll see in the next lesson), extra layers are often necessary.

That doesn't mean it's always a case of 'more is better', you can hit the law of diminishing returns very quickly!","dae1c14b":"**Sequential**: That defines a SEQUENCE of layers in the neural network\n\n**Flatten**: Remember earlier where our images were a square, when you printed them out? Flatten just takes that square and turns it into a 1 dimensional set.\n\n**Dense**: Adds a layer of neurons\n\nEach layer of neurons need an **activation function** to tell them what to do. There's lots of options, but just use these for now. \n\n**Relu** effectively means \"If X>0 return X, else return 0\" -- so what it does it it only passes values 0 or greater to the next layer in the network.\n\n**Softmax** takes a set of values, and effectively picks the biggest one, so, for example, if the output of the last layer looks like [0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1, 9.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], it saves you from fishing through it looking for the biggest value, and turns it into [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] -- The goal is to save a lot of coding!\n","8118196b":"The next thing to do, now the model is defined, is to actually build it. You do this by compiling it with an optimizer and loss function as before -- and then you train it by calling **model.fit ** asking it to fit your training data to your training labels -- i.e. have it figure out the relationship between the training data and its actual labels, so in future if you have data that looks like the training data, then it can make a prediction for what that data would look like.
