Maxine Waters attacked President Trump about 27 seconds into her speech to  homeless LGBTQ youth  at the Ali Forney Center in New York City earlier this month.She began her speech with:  Wow, what a moving evening this is. I m sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about Ali even though I never met him. And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight,  she said, pumping her fist as the crowd roared with approval.On Monday, Waters offered no apologies for her promise to  take out  Trump during an interview with CNN s  New Day,  and instead doubled down on her commitment to impeach the president. Those words have been interpreted as an attempt on the president s life,  CNN s Chris Cuomo told Waters.  How did you intend them? That s absolutely ridiculous, nobody believes that,  Waters said.  A 79-year-old grandmother who is a congresswoman and who has been in Congress and politics for all these years talking about doing any harm. The only harm I may be doing to the president is I want him impeached,  Waters said.She alleged the folks who oppose her efforts to unseat the president, and the people who want her out of office, are racists. And those people who are so opposed to my leadership on impeachment are organizing the right wing, the white nationals, the KKK, they have organized an effort to try and, of course, defeat me in my election coming up and to discredit me,  Waters said. Everybody knows that I m on the front lines not talking about any physical harm to anybody, but I am talking about impeachment and I m not going to stop. She then went on to name all the reasons she hates Trump, though none of them include a legal justification for removing the president. I believe this president is not worthy,  she said.  I believe this president should not be representing our country. He has alienated our allies. He continues to lie, day in and day out. He creates controversy. He can t get along with the members of Congress. He needs to be impeached. I want him impeached. And I m going to continue my efforts to call for his impeachment. Cuomo pointed out that Waters  comments represent  ugly talk,  and questioned whether those who oppose Trump should  be the change that you want to see and have   a high level of decency in how you discuss those whom you want to criticize, especially when it s the president of the United States. Waters alleged she s been  extremely responsible in laying out the case for why this president should be impeached. The problem is racists, she said. I know that the right wing, the white nationalists, all of those who have organized around this president, do not like this. And people are not accustomed to a woman, in particular an African American woman, taking this kind of leadership,  she said.  How dare me challenge the president of the United States, but we have never witnessed a president who has been as irresponsible and as dangerous as this president. And I think that we need to step up to the plate and tell the truth and speak truth to power and that s what I m doing and that s what I m going to continue to do. Waters has used every platform available to her to continue her crusade against President Trump It s only making her look totally unhinged.\"\n","e75cee68":"Actual=\"But this was one of my first shoots, about 6 years ago \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0160 https:\/\/t.co\/w9Aua3q5qb\"","d7647022":"true=\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign role, saying it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely limited\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office declined to comment. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.\"","d7427cc7":"trump=\"Build your own Fake Trummp Tweets in Seconds!
