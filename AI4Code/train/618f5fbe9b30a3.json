In this notebook, you'll learn how to make your first submission.\n\n# Step 1: Import helpful libraries\n\nWe begin by importing the libraries we'll need.  Some of them will be familiar from the **[Intro to Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-machine-learning)** course and the **[Intermediate Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intermediate-machine-learning)** course.","63ee87ac":"# Step 4: Train a model\n\nNow that the data is prepared, the next step is to train a model.  \n\nIf you took the **[Intro to Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-machine-learning)** courses, then you learned about **[Random Forests](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/random-forests)**.  In the code cell below, we fit a random forest model to the data.","1eb55d85":"Once you have run the code cell above, follow the instructions below to submit to the competition:\n1. Begin by clicking on the **Save Version** button in the top right corner of the window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n2. Ensure that the **Save and Run All** option is selected, and then click on the **Save** button.\n3. This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **Save Version** button.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen.  Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n4. Click on the **Output** tab on the right of the screen.  Then, click on the file you would like to submit, and click on the **Submit** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n\nYou have now successfully submitted to the competition!\n\nIf you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your code and repeat the process. There's a lot of room to improve, and you will climb up the leaderboard as you work.","81782201":"# Step 6: Keep Learning!\n\nIf you're not sure what to do next, you can begin by trying out more model types!\n1. If you took the **[Intermediate Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intermediate-machine-learning)** course, then you learned about **[XGBoost](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/xgboost)**.  Try training a model with XGBoost, to improve over the performance you got here.\n\n2. Take the time to learn about **Light GBM (LGBM)**, which is similar to XGBoost, since they both use gradient boosting to iteratively add decision trees to an ensemble.  In case you're not sure how to get started, **[here's a notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/svyatoslavsokolov\/tps-feb-2021-lgbm-simple-version)** that trains a model on a similar dataset.","551e8191":"In the code cell above, we set `squared=False` to get the root mean squared error (RMSE) on the validation data.\n\n# Step 5: Submit to the competition\n\nWe'll begin by using the trained model to generate predictions, which we'll save to a CSV file.","15c41e9b":"The next code cell separates the target (which we assign to `y`) from the training features (which we assign to `features`).","1bfc4c4f":"# Step 2: Load the data\n\nNext, we'll load the training and test data.  \n\nWe set `index_col=0` in the code cell below to use the `id` column to index the DataFrame.

In this notebook, we'll use ordinal encoding and save our encoded features as new variables `X` and `X_test`."}}
