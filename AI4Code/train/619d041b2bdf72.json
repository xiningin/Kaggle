Our estimated value of 291,310 is within 7% of the actual number, which is pretty good considering our original data came from United Nations (and might differ slightly from CIC data).\n\nAs a side note, we can observe that immigration took a dip around 1993 - 1997. Further analysis into the topic revealed that in 1993 Canada introcuded Bill C-86 which introduced revisions to the refugee determination system, mostly restrictive. Further amendments to the Immigration Regulations cancelled the sponsorship required for \"assisted relatives\" and reduced the points awarded to them, making it more difficult for family members (other than nuclear family) to immigrate to Canada.

For example, we might want to perform a side by side comparison of the box plot with the line plot of China and India's immigration.\n\nTo visualize multiple plots together, we can create a `figure` (overall canvas) and divide it into `subplots`, each containing a plot. With **subplots**, we usually work with the **artist layer** instead of the **scripting layer**.\n\nTypical syntax is :\n\n    fig = plt.figure() # create figure\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(nrows, ncols, plot_number) # create subplots\nWhere\n\n* `nrows` and `ncols` are used to notionally split the figure into (`nrows` * `ncols`) sub-axes,\n* `plot_number` is used to identify the particular subplot that this function is to create within the notional grid. `plot_number` starts at 1, increments across rows first and has a maximum of `nrows` * `ncols` as shown below.\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nWe can then specify which subplot to place each plot by passing in the `ax` paramemter in `plot()` method as follows:","05802965":"Step 2: Plot the data.

Let's do that using a `bubble plot` of immigration from Brazil and Argentina for the years 1980 - 2013. We will set the weights for the bubble as the *normalized* value of the population for each year.","02e13425":"**Question**: Create a scatter plot of the total immigration from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden to Canada from 1980 to 2013?","5cb8aab3":"We can observe that, while both countries have around the same median immigrant population (~20,000), China's immigrant population range is more spread out than India's.

In one of the previous labs, we observed that China and India had very similar immigration trends. Let's analyize these two countries further using box plots.\n\n**Question**: Compare the distribution of the number of new immigrants from India and China for the period 1980 - 2013.\n\n**Step 1**: Get the dataset for China and India and call the dataframe **df_CI**.","0b1d3482":"Import `Matplotlib`.","7afc051d":"The size of the bubble corresponds to the magnitude of immigrating population for that year, compared to the 1980 - 2013 data. The larger the bubble, the more immigrants in that year.\n\nFrom the plot above, we can see a corresponding increase in immigration from Argentina during the 1998 - 2002 great depression. We can also observe a similar spike around 1985 to 1993. In fact, Argentina had suffered a great depression from 1974 - 1990, just before the onset of 1998 - 2002 great depression.\n\nOn a similar note, Brazil suffered the Samba Effect where the Brazilian real (currency) dropped nearly 35% in 1999. There was a fear of a South American financial crisis as many South American countries were heavily dependent on industrial exports from Brazil. The Brazilian government subsequently adopted an austerity program, and the economy slowly recovered over the years, culminating in a surge in 2010. The immigration data reflect these events.","e5062d9c":"Let's download and import our primary Canadian Immigration dataset using *pandas* `read_excel()` method.

Scatter Plots <a id='SP'><\/a>\n\nA `scatter plot` (2D) is a useful method of comparing variables against each other. `Scatter` plots look similar to `line plots` in that they both map independent and dependent variables on a 2D graph. While the datapoints are connected together by a line in a line plot, they are not connected in a scatter plot. The data in a scatter plot is considered to express a trend. With further analysis using tools like regression, we can mathematically calculate this relationship and use it to predict trends outside the dataset.\n\nLet's start by exploring the following:\n\nUsing a `scatter plot`, let's visualize the trend of total immigrantion to Canada (all countries combined) for the years 1980 - 2013.","8b3729dd":"Note how the box plot differs from the summary table created.
