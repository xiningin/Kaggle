For that I will use the Google trends tool via pytrends, in order to relate the number of searches for the terms '5G' and '4G' in the last years\/months.**","f76b3386":"**Thanks to this plot, we can see that the 5G research trend is accelerating from the beginning of the year 2019 until today.

The number of searches for a keyword associated with a date corresponds to the rate of use of this keyword compared to the rate of use of this same keyword during the period when it is most used (= value of 100). In other words in our example: the keyword '5G' in July 2019 (= value of 20) was used five times less than in December 2020 (= value of 100)**\n\n**Now, in order to analyze this plot, we are going to isolate three distinct periods during which we can observe a significant increase in google searches :**\n\n**-The month of February 2019 marks the start of the growth of the 5G trend in France. Indeed, it was during this period that the first 5G deployment schedule was published. In addition, the Mobile World Congress, which took place at the same time, was marked by the Orange communication (the leader of telecommunications operators in France) almost entirely devoted to 5G. It is therefore natural that the media began to discuss 5G, wondering in particular about its impact on our daily lives.**\n\n**-Then, it was during the month of April 2020 that the four main French operators (Orange, SFR, Bouygues, Free) obtained official authorization to open a 5G network in France.**\n\n**-Finally, it is in October 2020 that the 5G trend increases a lot until it takes over the 4G trend. Indeed, the 5G frequency auctions were conducted during this period. After, the number of searches continues to increase and should not stop for several months.**"}}
