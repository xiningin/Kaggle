Find out what is in here that is not in the other dataset, and vice versa.\nThen I should think of a way to extract features from here that would be usable in conjunction with the training data. \nWith a separate dataset like this, I am curious to see if any information is also in the testing data. If there is not then maybe looking in this sessions dataset is not very useful since there is no way to join the information to the other dataset other than to build heuristics.
