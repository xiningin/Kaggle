This is my first time dabbling in a data science competition - any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\n# 1. Competition Details\n\n## Background\n\nAt Shopee, we strive to ensure our customers' highest satisfaction for their shopping and delivery experience - fast and accurate delivery of goods. This can be better achieved if we have key address elements for each user address which allows us to accurately geocode it to obtain geographic coordinates to ship the parcel to our customers. These key address elements include Point of Interest (POI) Names and Street Names. However, most addresses that Shopee receives are unstructured and in free text format, not following a certain pattern. Thus it is important for us to develop a model to precisely extract the key address elements from it.\n\n## Task\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll work on addresses collected by us to build a model to correctly extract Point of Interest (POI) Names and Street Names from unformatted Indonesia addresses.\n\nParticipants are expected to build their own model for this competition, submissions by teams which directly call any third party APIs on the test set will not be taken into consideration.","48cf104f":"# 6. Evaluation\n\nWe can evaluate the accuracy of our model by viewing evaluation metrics such as the f-score.","7bafd7a5":"# 4. Predictions\n\nGenerate predictions on the test dataset.\n\n## Limitations\n\nI've been unable to perform subword completion on incomplete addresses accurately. I've tried to create dictionaries of known vocabulary mappings, e.g. \"smk karya pemban\u201d -> \"smk karya pembangunan\" and expanding the incomplete addresses as a post-processing step, but these experiments have failed to achieve a higher accuracy on the public leaderboard.","aa27976a":"# 3. Training\n\nThe NER model is trained using spaCy.\n\n## Dropout\n\nTo prevent overfitting, a random fraction of nodes is dropped according to a given probability. After experimenting, it was found that a decaying dropout rate that starts high and moderates to a lower value as training progresses was most effective.","40873029":"# 5. Output\n\nGenerate the submission.csv required for the competition.","7a508203":"# 2. Preprocessing\n\n## Labelling\n\nHere, we will label the POI and street entities in the training dataset. The result is a list of raw addresses and their corresponding extracted entities. \n\n## Incomplete Addresses\n\n> The word \u201cpembangunan\u201d in raw_address \u201csmk karya pemban, pon\u201d is not complete. The correct POI will be \u201csmk karya pembangunan\u201d and the returned result should be:\nsmk karya pembangunan\/pon\n\nSome raw addresses may be incomplete. We will attempt to map the incomplete address elements to the complete POI \/ street data in the training dataset."}}
