Founded in 1630, it\u2019s one of the oldest cities in the U.S. The key role it played in the American Revolution is highlighted on the Freedom Trail, a 2.5-mile walking route of historic sites that tells the story of the nation\u2019s founding. One stop, former meeting house Faneuil Hall, is a popular marketplace. Boston is one of the oldest cities in the United States, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England. It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Siege of Boston. Upon gaining U.S. independence from Great Britain, it continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture. The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation. Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year. Boston's many firsts include the United States' first public park (Boston Common, 1634), first public or state school (Boston Latin School, 1635) and first subway system (Tremont Street Subway, 1897).\n\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\/wp\/2018\/01\/lance-anderson-393963-1000x667.jpg\">","7cccd967":"## Getting the data","a1359192":"## Relationship between Year and District (Number of crimes)","7f4ffbfa":"## Some interesting information\n\nHere we can extract some relevant information, such as the most violent neighborhoods, the most common crimes, the year with the highest number of crimes, the most frequent time, among other things.
