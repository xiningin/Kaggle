The video, urging people to stay home, was only published after 1 month from the first local case. And more shockingly, government is lifting restriction when daily cases are increasing day-by-day. After seeing the data and graph, I think government actions are not enough to contain the COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, I believe lifting the restrictions will make the situation worse. \n\nReference;\nUS embassy in Mexico\nhttps:\/\/mx.usembassy.gov\/health-alert-mexico-covid-19-update-06-11-2020\/\nWorld Health Organization\nhttps:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019\/events-as-they-happen","50be1a52":"Note: This 'df' is actually a cumulative information. \n\nJune 12, 2020 shows the total cases since initial date.\n\nBelow code is the day-to-day increase in cases."}}
