The idea is to use the dataset features to try and separate train and test samples.\n\nSo you would create a binary target that would be 1 for train samples and 0 for test samples and fit a classifier on the features to predict if a given sample is in train or test datasets!\n\nHere we will use a LogisticRegression and a TF-IDF vectorizer to check if text features distributions are different and see if we can separate the samples. \n\nThe best kernel on this is certainly [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/konradb\/adversarial-validation-and-other-scary-terms) by [Konrad Banachewicz](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/konradb)\n\nOther resources can be found [on fastML](http:\/\/fastml.com\/adversarial-validation-part-one\/)\n","6b2166c5":"Convert vocab dictionnaries to list of words"}}
