These will store data at intermediate steps which will come in handy later.\n\nNow, let's walkthrough the code for this algorithm. We will specifically look at the `fit()` method as this method is used to run our algorithm.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. We first initialize our data points randomly to clusters. The parameter `k` is the number of clusters hyperparameter. Each data point in our dataset is randomly assigned to one of k cluster ids.\n2. We also define a variable `new_clusters` to store the new cluster assignments after the minimum distance between the data point and each cluster is computed.\n3. We now setup an infinite loop using `itertools.count()`. and begin iterating.\n4. The cluster means are computed. Note that if a particular cluster id fails to be randomly assigned to a data point, we take a random data point and assign it to be the mean of that cluster.\n5. We then assign the new clusters to each data point based on the minimum squared euclidean distance between a data point and each cluster means.\n6. Lastly, we check if any of the data points have changed clusters. If they have then we assign the new clusters to serve as the input for computing the cluster means. \n7. We repeat steps 4-6 until no data point changes clusters.\n","8a4a6208":"<a id=\"section-two\"><\/a>\n## Algorithm Overview","95ef2772":"<a id=\"section-six\"><\/a>\n## Next Steps","da7d2a98":"<a id=\"section-four\"><\/a>\n## Implementation","a1b095d6":"## Table of Contents\n\n#### 1.

One important note is that the algorithm only works for numerical data. There are, however, variant which also work with categorical data.","6703d8ec":"You can implement your own version of the k-means algorithm using the code. For example, you could use a different stopping condition for the infinite loop. Or, you could use a different distance metric to compute similarity between data points.
