Given the market (open, close prices, returns etc...) and news data (headlines of stories, reports concerning different companies & markets etc...) we are supposed to predict the 10-day return of a given asset (stock). Detailed description can be found at [Outline](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/two-sigma-financial-news). Reader should also read rules and the framework of this competition before proceeding. There are basically two different datasets.

But to be sure we can consult some other service provider and check that these are actually measurament errors. (bloomberg, yahoo finance etc). Now that we are sure that there are errors. We need to know which ones. But how do you define it? In other words whats the value (falling or rising one) the next day that can be classified as an error. Its a bit subjective, but I suppose that consensus can be reached at lets say +- 100% difference. There will be times when higher values are considered normal, hence a further analysis of this cut-off value should be performed. First of a \"crisis cut-off\" value could be 20%, where we can say that turbulance is big","fc5ed6bc":"Good news is we already have some information. Like the severity of the news, region etc..

We can quantify that with standard deviation of the difference between open and close prices. And then plot it to see where standard deviation is highly unusual (different than the average around 1 point std)","b223143e":"Now let us see which time span(month) has the most unusual behavior. And does it coincide with financial crisis.","6c8f460c":"**MICE** MICE has become an industry standard way of dealing with null values while preprocessing data. It is argued that by simply using fill values such as the mean or mode we are throwing information away that is present in other variables that might give insight into what the null values might be. With that thought in mind, we predict the null values from the other features present in the data. Thus preserving as much information as possible. If the data is not missing at random (MAR) then this method is inappropriate.","fb16f102":"<a id=\"5\"><\/a> <br>\n#  **5-News data**\nI think this is the **main point** of this competition. To predict (mainly) using news data with suplementation of market data stock movement. Hence we will focus more on this aspect\n\nThere is one interesting (general) consensus among finance community. **Under the efficient market hypothesis (EMH)**, the price of a asset should react almost instantaneously to relevant news. Consider the example where we (or our model) is surveying the data immediately before the market open. There has been very impactful news in the last 24 hours, and we hope our model will predict a price shift because of this.\n\nThe problem, though, is that everyone else in the market will have also seen this news and adjusted their buys and sells accordingly. This will change the open price, and absent of any drift (which generally there should be none if markets are efficient), the price will not change further. After this point, any further shifts in price over the next 10 days will happen for reasons unrelated to the original news article. In short, by the time the news article comes out, we're already too late.\n\nOf course company 2sigma must know this but they still believe that there are some smart way to use news data in order to predict stock movement.","54fe2377":"**Skewness** I ommited, these are all returns. We plotted all of them together (above no arbitrage!) and we saw all of them are around 0, likely normally distributed.\n\n**Outliers** We already handled them in the EDA section, we also made an assumption that 2008 and 2009 were the outlier years, and we proceede with our analysis further. I did check and there were single digits outliers still to be found but these fall into normally abnormal behaviour of every distribution function.","c1085ac8":"**Assumption**\nData before 2010 will be droped. There is simply to much noise concerning the 2008 crisis. **ALSO** Since this kernel can not submit anymore and it has a learning character, in order to have sufficient memory, we will take an even smaller subsample of data.\n","959bab28":"\n**Skewness and outliers**","b23efc9d":"LEts do a higher analysis of the words that could be interesting, not just guess them. For that we will need to analyse the \"headline column\" a bit deeper, wordcloud. More specifically a world cloud that stands for positive return and world cloud for negative return. That will help us build additional features. First we need to filtrate it.\n\n\nWhat could be the indicator that tells us that a sentiment was positive. There are 3 columns in news dataframe: sentimentNegative\tsentimentNeutral\tsentimentPositive. These are are all** probabilites** that sentiment will have a certain infulence on the stock movement. Let us use that to subset the headline column and plot these 2 wordclouds.","d863cb36":"What do we do with outliers? there are some pretty sophisticated imputation techniques that ought to be considered with a larger number of outliers. Here we can be satisfied with mean or median prices to imputat the outliers with. Carefull, we do decrease volatility of our data with it.
