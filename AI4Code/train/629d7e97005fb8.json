It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable but this is not always the case in real life. There are very less scenarios where this assumption holds true. Multiple Regression also suffers from multi-collinearity, auto-correlation, and heteroskedasticity.\n\nThe interpretation of the linear coefficient is that it represents the mean change in the dependent variable for 1 unit change in the independent variable when all the other independent variables are held constant.\n\nNow suppose that there are two correlated independent variables (A and B) and we are aiming to find the right coefficient for these independent variables. When the coefficient for A is calculated, will that coefficient be accurate? No, it won\u2019t be right because changes in A are associated with shifts in B, and as we have already discussed that all the other variables need to be held constant, B can\u2019t be held as a constant because A and B are correlated. This is known as Multicollinearity and it is one of the disadvantages of Linear Regression.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, we use various regularization techniques (l1, l2 etc) or other kind of regression techniuques like Elastic Net Regression, Lasso and Ridge Regression which automatically takes care of multicollinearity.\n\nCheck this [blog](https:\/\/medium.com\/gdg-vit\/overcoming-the-drawbacks-of-linear-regression-497fffcdd2d8) for better understanding","e053e5ab":"We can observe that there is almost **a linear relationship between Living Area and the Sale Price**.

We expect that the variability in the dependent variable doesn't increase as the value of the independent increases, which is the assumptions of equal variance, also known as Homoscedasticity. We also assume that the observations are independent of one another(No Multicollinearity), and a correlation between sequential observations or auto-correlation is not there.\n\nNow, these assumptions are prone to happen altogether. In other words, if we see one of these assumptions in the dataset, it's more likely that we may come across with others mentioned above.
