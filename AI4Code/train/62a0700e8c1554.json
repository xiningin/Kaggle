Changing binary and lowercase didn't result in any changes.\n* 256 units was the sweet spot for accuracy without overfitting. \n    * Any units above would give me less accuracy as the model continued to train as well as overall performing worse, and less units just gave me worse accuracy overall.\n    * I also discovered that adding any additional layers to the model resulted in a loss of accuracy, even when I kept the number of layer units small.\n\n","32bffd54":"# Simple Regression with sk-learn\nWe were curious about framing the problem as a linear regression one, so this was our following exploration of that.","83e025ac":"# Classification with Keras\n* Neural networks usually scale very well with lots of data, and that's exactly what we have here (150,000 training examples, 50,000 test examples).

However, keras plays with this much data very nicely.\n* While we are sticking to a simple NN in this kernel, other types of NN architecture can deal with natural language processing problems very well (long short term memory models, other types of recurrent networks).\n* Keras gives us lots of freedom to play with hyperparameters and design a network that would be best suited for our data.","7f5c8a4d":"Taking a random sample of 5000 reviews for training our kclusterer on.","5630eceb":"The not-so-useful reviews seem much more negative.

This is a very similar approach to vectorization as the TDIF explained above. \n* This vectorizer is also set to not add in very common words such as \"and\" and \"the\" as features. This is specified in stop_words.","17edc62c":"We will apply random forests for the purpose of sentiment analysis of reviews. The obvious starting question for such an approach is how can we convert the raw text of the review into a data representation that can be used by a numerical classifier. To this end, we will use the process of vectorization. By vectorizing the 'review' column, we can allow widely-varying lengths of text to be converted into a numerical format which can be processed by the classifier.\n\nThis is achieved via the TI-IDF method which involves creating tokens (i.e. individual words or groups of words extracted from the text). Once the list of tokens is created, they are assigned an index integer identifier which allows them to be listed. We can then count the number of words in the document and normalize them in such a way that de-emphasizes words that appear frequently (like \"a\", \"the\", etc.). This creates what is known as a bag (multi-set) of words. Such a representation associates a real-valued vector to each review representing the importance of the tokens (words) in the review. This represents the entire corpus of reviews as a large matrix where each row of the matrix represents one of the reviews and each column repreents a token occurence.\n\nTerm-Frequency Inverse Document-Frequency (TF-IDF) is a way of handling the excessive noise due to words such as \"a\", \"the\", \"he\", \"she\", etc. Clearly such common words will appear in many reviews, but do not provide much isight into the sentiment of the text and their high frequency tends to obfuscate words that provide significant insight into sentiment. More details about the method can be found on [wikipedia](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tf%E2%80%93idf).\n\nThe main limitation of this approach is that it does not take into account the relative position of words within the document. Here we are only using the frequency of occurence. Nevertheless, it works pretty well for this data set.","c1ea0a52":"I was just curious if testing by alphabetical order gave any sort of insight into what words or numbers were contributing the most to model accuracy.","3a8c2973":"The idea behind this function was to see how the accuracy between different clusters and features differs.\n","b7a1741a":"* I experimented with different numbers of epochs and batch sizes as well, and found roughly 6 epochs and a batch size of 128 to be optimal. \n* Anything more than 6 epochs resulted in the model beginning to overtrain and lose accuracy.\n* Before running preprocessing on the reviews by eliminating symbols, the validation accuracy stayed around 84%. Now it scores a perfect 100% on the 100 examples.","273be70d":"We can see that a more complicated classifier gets us a roughly 8% increase in the accuracy of our classifier.","7c5510f1":"**This information is really useful!
