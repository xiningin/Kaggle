The director\nof marketing believes the company\u2019s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,\nour team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,\nour team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives\nmust approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data\nvisualizations.\n\nThree questions will guide the future marketing program:\n\n  1.

I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to\nanswer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze,\nshare, and act. \n\n## Characters and teams\n*Cyclistic:* A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself\napart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with\ndisabilities and riders who can\u2019t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about\n8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to\ncommute to work each day\n\n*Lily Moreno:* The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns\nand initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n\n*Cyclistic marketing analytics team:* A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and\nreporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy\nlearning about Cyclistic\u2019s mission and business goals \u2014 as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic\nachieve them.\n\n*Cyclistic executive team:* The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the\nrecommended marketing program.\n\n## About the Cyclistic \nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that\nare geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and\nreturned to any other station in the system anytime.\n\nUntil now, Cyclistic\u2019s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.\nOne approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,\nand annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers\nwho purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\nCyclistic\u2019s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the\npricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will\nbe key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a\nvery good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic\nprogram and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs\n\nMoreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to\ndo that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why\ncasual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are\ninterested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends."}}
