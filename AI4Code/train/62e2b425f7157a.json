Comparison of Both Algorithms","36f885f7":"<font color=\"blue\">\nHierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters.\n\nStrategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types:[1]\n\n1.Agglomerative: This is a \"bottom-up\" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.\n\n2.Divisive: This is a \"top-down\" approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.\n\nIn general, the merges and splits are determined in a greedy manner. The results of hierarchical clustering[2] are usually presented in a dendrogram.","dfc15806":"<font color=\"blue\">\nWe can easily check the centroid values by averaging the features in each cluster as follows","b67707aa":"## 1.

How KMeans Clustering Works:","62b3d181":"<font color=\"blue\">\nIn the step 1 in the algorithm, each observation is randomly assigned to a cluster.\n\nIn the step 2a in the algorithm,the cluster centroid for each cluster is computed, which are shown as large colored disk as shown top-right of the figure.\n\nInitially these centroids are almost overlapping as we can see from the figure because initial cluster assignments are chosen randomly.\n\nIn the step 2a in the algorithm(bottom-left of the figure above), each observation is assigned to the nearest centroid.\n\nIn bottom-center of the figure above, step 2a once again is performed which lead to new cluster centroids.\n\nWe basically keep repeating these steps until there is no new cluster which means data points are being reassigned to a new cluster centroid.\n\nAt the bottom-right, we have the results obtained after about 10 iterations","78fcd1a6":"<font color=\"blue\">\n2.2.
