A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 \u00d7 5 or 5 \u00d7 1, involve 5 itself. However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers (2 \u00d7 3) that are both smaller than 6. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.","9006fd22":"**Problem statemet**  \n\nYou are provided a list of cities and their coordinates in cities.csv. You must create the shortest possible path that visits all the cities. Your submission file is simply the ordered list in which you visit each city. Paths have the following constraints:\n\nPaths must start and end at the North Pole (CityId = 0)\nYou must visit every city exactly once\nThe distance between two paths is the 2D Euclidean distance, except...\nEvery 10th step (stepNumber % 10 == 0) is 10% more lengthy unless coming from a prime CityId."}}
