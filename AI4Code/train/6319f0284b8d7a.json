Both the initial histogram and the log-price histogram indicated that the data may be multimodal, but at this stage it is unclear. Multivariate analysis could help determine whether or not there are subpopulations in the dataset that are causing multiple modes in the price variable.","291a65cc":"__Non-graphical EDA:__\n\nThe mean avocado price is \\$1.41, slightly above the median of $1.37, and the variance of the data is ~ 0.16.

It represents retail scan data for the average price of a single avocado in cities and regions in the US between 2015 to 2018. There was a minor issue of duplication of information, as summary information for the entire US was included in the table, but this was easily removed and seems to be the only carpentry needed."}}
