Introduction\n\nJupyter Notebook Created by Shardav Bhatt\n\nData (as on 16 June 2020)\nReferences: \n1. Vadodara: https:\/\/vmc.gov.in\/coronaRelated\/covid19dashboard.aspx\n2. Gujarat: https:\/\/gujcovid19.gujarat.gov.in\/\n3. India: https:\/\/www.mohfw.gov.in\/\n4. Other countries and World: https:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/coronavirus\/\n\nIn this notebook, I have considered data of COVID-19 cases at Local level and at Global level. The aim is to determine whether there is a significance difference between Global scenario and Local scenario of COVID-19 cases or not. The comparison is done using Pie charts for active cases, recovered cases and deaths.","1a70a4f2":"# My Observations:\n\n1. Death rate in Vadodara city is less compared to state and nation. Death rate of Gujarat is almost double compared to the nation. Death rate of India is less compared to the global death rate.\n\n2. Recovery rates of Vadodara and Gujarat are higher compared to national and global recovery rate. The recovery rate of India and of World are similar.\n\n3. Proportion of active cases in Vadodara and Gujarat is lower compared to national and global active cases. Proportion of active cases of India and world are similar. ","4190dae9":"# 2.

Germany, Chile, Turkey, Iran, Italy, Mexico have recovery rate above 75%. These countries are comming out of danger.\n\n3. Russia, India, Peru, Brazil, France, USA have have recovery rate below 53%. These countries needs to recover fast. \n\n4. Proportion of active cases is least in Germany, Italy, Turkey is least."}}
