Introduction\n\n### #1. Why do we do this?\n\n> **Pulmonary = lung | fibrosis = scar tissue => Scarring in the lungs.** Over time, scarring can destroy the normal lung and make it hard for oxygen to get into your blood. [Pulmonary fibrosis isn\u2019t just one disease. It is a family of more than 200 different lung diseases that all look very much alike.](https:\/\/www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org\/life-with-pf\/about-pf)\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org\/images\/default-source\/default-album\/normal-and-impaired-gas-exchange.png?sfvrsn=c3b0918d_0\" width=600>\n\n### #2. Evaluation\n\n**Laplace Log Likelihood (modified version)**: useful to evaluate a model's confidence in its decisions.\n\nThe error is thresholded at 1000 ml to avoid large errors adversely penalizing results, while the confidence values are clipped at 70 ml to reflect the approximate measurement uncertainty in FVC. The final score is calculated by averaging the metric across all test set Patient_Weeks (three per patient). \n\n*Note that metric values will be negative and higher is better.*\n\n### #3. Code Competition\n\nCode Competitions seem more fair to me. Keep in mind:\n* CPU runtime <= 9 hrs\n* GPU runtime <= 4 hrs\n* NO internet access (for inference, but can be used during training)\n* Submission file name: `submission.csv`\n\n### #4. Competition aim:\n> Predict how severe is going to decline the lung capacity in the lungs based on a CT (Computerised Tomography) scan + metadata of the patient. CTs can show soft tissues, blood vessels, and bones much more detailed than normal X-rays.\n\n**Lung Function**: assessed based on a spirometer output which measures the FVC (forced vital capacity), meaning how much air is exhaled.\n\n\n### Libraries \ud83d\udcda\u2b07","365ec7a7":"## #2.6 Correlations between Variables\ud83e\uddec\n\n> **\ud83d\udcccRemember**: \n* There is high correlation between FVC and Percent: when the volume of air increases, the Percent increases as well (when you exhale more, you get closer more to 100%)\n* There is no correlation between FVC\/Percent and Age, meaning that Age has no influence on the volume of exhaled air.","6821dc4a":"## 3.4 GIF from Images \ud83c\udf14\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf16\n\n> **\ud83d\udcccRemember**: Patients have various number of CT scans: the more scans\/patient, the more information we have about well ... their lungs.
