But after 6 revives per player, the winning percentage decreases or a specific pattern can't be observed. This may be because you are being knocked out more often than not would make you a NOOB !","702223e9":"So what I did in the above line is basically, all those players who have dealt more than 500 damage to enemies in solo match but still managed to have a winPlacePerc of 0.0. Is this badluck or a case of outliers ?","b78ded12":"## 1.12 RideDistance\n","0c5519a1":"![Assists](http:\/\/cdn3-www.gamerevolution.com\/assets\/uploads\/2018\/09\/pubg-mobile-cant-play-with-friends.jpg)","279412a5":"There isn't much that can be said about killstreaks since we can't really see a pattern ! I mean, I would expect someone with a killstream of 5 or above to have better chances of winning ! But the data doesn't follow the same intuition ! A lot of data who had 8 as killstreak only has < 0.3 as winPlacePerc","710de8a6":"1. Boosts have a higher correlation with winPlacePerc even more than heals.\n2. KillPlace and winPlacePerc have high negative correlation which is something we saw above !\n3. DamageDealt,Heals,Kills,KillStreaks,LongestKill,RideDistance,WeaponsAcquired all of these have considerable correlation with winPlacePerc as well.\n4. WalkDistance seems to have the highest correlation with winPlacePerc which can prove to be useful in a prediction model !","3d1f0429":"VehiclesDestroyed : The number of vehicles destroyed by a single player !","0219649d":"Majority of the people use less than 6 boosts per game !

But this helps us with two things. Our model won't overfit with keeping just boosts as the prime feature winPlacePerc is based on and also heals and boosts combined together will make for a more robust prediction ! You can see afterwards if just keeping boosts instead of our new feature health has more impact on our predictions or not !","514cf055":"## 1.8 Kills","97182178":"## 1.13 RoadKills\n","cf51a2b6":"But that decreases after 8-9 assists. This could potentially represent players who are good only at assists than  killing and winning !
