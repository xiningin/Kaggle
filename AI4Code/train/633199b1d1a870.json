We cannot also seperate the groups based on the year of operation.\n2. Most of the patients of both the status 1 and status 2 were diagnosed in the year range of 1958 - 1969. \n3. There are some outliers in the data for those patients which both status 1 and status 2. For example, there are around 1% of the patients who were diagnosed in the year 1972. It is a very small percentage.\n4. In addition to this, there are also some other patients (say 1%) who are diagnosed in the year 1956 for both status 1 and status 2.","03ca9a4f":"It looks like there seems to be not a good relationship between age and the year at which they were diagnosed as you can see below.

But there seems to be no clear separation of data. Let us explore the data further.","66dd16b6":"**Conclusion**\n\nWe tried to find the features that could be separated easily. We first tried to see the features like age, year of diagnosis, axial nodes and the status and tried to find the relationship between them. \nWe found that the most significant feature that could give us an idea about the status of a patient is the number of axial nodes.\nWe have plotted the distribution of the axial nodes and saw how the data is spread","7935dd07":"**Observations**\n\n1. We see that 1st value and 25tht percentile of the data have almost equal values.\n2. But when we move to the 50th and 75th percentile, there is a significant variation in the values (axil nodes) of patients.\n3. This implies that there is more tailedness in the data of patients with axil nodes and having a disease (status 2).\n\n\n","74c9c990":"**Observations**\n\n1. We see that 95th percentile of patients who do not have the disease (status 1) have axil node value of 14.\n2. We see that 95th percentile of patients who have the disease (status 2) have axil node value of 23. \n3. We can see from the above that axil node values of patients who have the disease (status 2) seems to be more spread out as compared to axil nodes of those who do not have the disease (status 1).","a3984aa9":"**Observations**\n\n1. It seems that there is no linearly separable boundary between age and status as their distribution is close.\n2. The mean of those patients who do not have the disease is centered somewhere around 55 years of age.\n3. The mean of those patients who have the disease is centered somewhere around 50 years of age.\n4. The variance of age of those patients who do not have the disease is quite higher than those patients who have the disease.\n5. The variance of age of those patients who have the disease has more tailedness which means that there are some outliers in the data.","eb9437ba":"Having a look at the distribution of axil nodes of patients who do not have the disease (status 1)","4bcb339d":"We are going to divide the data into two parts namely haberman_1 and haberman_2.

We see that there are very few outliers in the axil nodes of patients who do not have the disease (status 1). Mean would be affected by such outliers but not the median.\n2. We also see quite a few outliers in the axil nodes of patients who have the disease (status 2). ","cec39fe3":"**Observations**\n\n1. There seems to be a possible separation between the data points in the above plot. \n2. Around 70 percent of the patients who did not have the disease (status 1) have axil nodes of range (-2) - 5.\n3. Around 70 percent of the patients who did have the disease (status 2) have axil nodes in the range (-5) - 20.\n4. There are some outliers at the far end in the axil nodes of patients who do not have the disease (status 1) as seen from the tailedness of the curve with status 1 (blue).\n5. There is also very less data points where the patients have axil nodes in the range 50 - 60 with status 2.","545cbc96":"We can see from the above that there seems to be not much seperation between the ages for those with status 1 and 2. There are few age groups below the age say 35 who have a status of 1. However, there are also groups of status 1 in the age of range75 - 80 years. So it is not possible to linearly seperate the data points based on age.","4215144f":"**Observations**\n\n1. We also see the distribution plot along with box plot (sort of). \n2. This is the violin plot that gives rise to box plot and distribution plot. ","f03cfbc1":"**Exploratory Data Analysis of Haberman Dataset**\n\nThis is a dataset that is quite easy to understand and it is the first step in machine learning.

We import various standard libraries that are necessary to implement the algorithm\n\nWe use various plotting tools like boxplot, violin plot and so on.

The mean of the patients who have the disease is quite higher (7.5) those who do not the disease (2.8). \n2.
