This could mean that the 6.5 earthquake of October 30 may have opened new rifts in the tectonic plate.","dffc7d51":"On August 24, 2016, at 3.36am, the center of Italy was hit by a 6.0 magnitude earthquake. There have been 299 deaths, entire villages were destroyed and thousands were left homeless. From that day, tens of thousands of minor earthquakes hit the area with a frequency of about 5 minutes.\nThe surrounding area has a notorious fame for geological instability, as Italy lies near the fault line that exists between Eurasian and African tectonic plates. Earthquakes happen when one of these plates scrapes, bumps or drags along another plate.\nIn this notebook we will carry out some basic analysis and visualizations of this dataset. \n\nA little disclaimer before we begin. I know nearly nothing about earthquakes and geology. I'm just having fun doing some very basic data analysis and visualization, so the things I might say and the thoughts I might have about earthquakes should be taken with a (big) grain of salt.\n\nYou can find the full post about this notebook [here][1].\n\n\n  [1]: http:\/\/www.thedataware.com\/post\/italys-recent-earthquakes-a-look-at-the-data","01503003":"Obviously, this forecasting technique was very simple and should not be considered reliable. However, it is an example of the importance of forecasting and time series prediction in general.","988ec896":"From this plot, we can clearly see that there was a spike between October and November. In fact, a 6.5 magnitude earthquake hit on October 30. It also seems like the days preceding that event were characterized by a lower activity. We can see see this better if we average the values over one day, instead that 2 days of the previous plot.","87b420b2":"### Depth\nLet's take a look at the depth now. By plotting a histogram of the different values, we can see a nicely shaped bell curve centered at 10km. We can model this with a gaussian distribution of parameters (mu=10, sigma=2.25) and begin to answer some simple questions like: what is the probability of an earthquake having a depth less than 5km?\nUsing this rule, this probability is (approximately) 2.3%. Of course, this value is only related to this event, it is not a fact about earthquakes in general.","55f9a2a2":"There does not seem to be a significant difference between hours of the day. Thus, in line with the fact the earthquakes are unpredictable, we can conclude that there isn't a particular time of the day in which they are more likely to happen.There does not seem to be a significant difference between hours of the day. Thus, in line with the fact the earthquakes are unpredictable, we can conclude that there isn't a particular time of the day in which they are more likely to happen.","0293f513":"I'm not saying that every earthquake is preceeded by a lower activity in the previous days, it may very well be a coincidence, but it kind of highlights a possible pattern which might deserve future analysis.","b4aada50":"### Magnitude Rolling Mean\nAnother possible way of visualizing the magnitude is the rolling mean, or moving average. Here, instead of taking the mean of each day, we take the mean of a fixed window of n elements. Also, we take only earthquakes with magnitude 3+.","13a4a237":"Another interesting question we might try to answer is if earthquakes are more likely to happen at a specific time of day. The 6.0 happened at 3.36am, the 6.5 happened at around 7.50am, so this might be a reasonable thing to search for. Maybe earthquakes are more likely to hit in the morning, or maybe it was just a coincidence. Let's visualize it.","2387aee4":"### Magnitude\nThe simplest numeric measure of an earthquake strenght is the magnitude.\nThe magnitude of an earthquake is usually measured by the [Richter Scale][1]. You can check the wikipedia page for more info.\n\n  [1]: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richter_magnitude_scale"}}
