Sr\u0161en used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. \n\nBy 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. \nBellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and\nconsistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.\n\nSr\u0161en knows that an analysis of Bellabeat\u2019s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.","ed5a368c":"**Way Forward for Bellabeat:**\n\n* The Bellabeat App is designed to empower women and make them more aware about their fitness and health by installing good habits.\n\n* According to CDC, minimum 8,000 daily steps taken are associated with 51% less risk for all-cause mortality. The Bellabeat app will set the target of daily steps to be completed and inform the user time to time about the progress. \n\n* We have observed that a particular day has higher number of steps compared to others. This can be equalised with daily step target.\n\n* To ensure women have complete sleep, the app can set an alarm reminding her about the sleeping hours. This can put sleeping schedule to the normal.\n\n* Evening hours are most active hours according to the data. The app can schedule the fitness routine before the start of the day to help the user ease into their task.\n\n* Reward points, fitness ratings, coupons can be introduced by the App to make the app more popular among its users.","52d4e2d2":"# Data Processing","44fcdd1a":"**The number of 'TotalSteps' taken are highest on the Saturday.
