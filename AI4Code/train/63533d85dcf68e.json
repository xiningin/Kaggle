The three most popular ways to win in an MMA fight are:\n\n### **1. DEC:**  Decision (Dec)  is a result of the fight or bout that does not end in a knockout in which the judges' scorecards are consulted to determine the winner; a majority of judges must agree on a result. A fight can either end in a win for an athlete, a draw, or a no decision.\n\n### **2. SUB: ** also referred to as a \"submission\" or \"tap out\" - is often performed by visibly tapping the floor or the opponent with the hand or in some cases with the foot, to signal the opponent and\/or the referee of the submission\n\n### **3. KO\/TKO:**  Knockout (KO) is when a fighter gets knocked out cold. (i.e.. From a standing to not standing position from receiving a strike.). Technical Knockout (TKO) is when a fighter is getting pummeled and is unable to defend him\/herself further. The referee will step in and make a judgement call to end it and prevent the fighter from receiving any more unnecessary or permanent damage, and call it a TKO.","445434ae":"### Age is a big factor in any sport, moresoever in MMA where you must have combination of strength, agility and speed (among other skills).

I know Age and Height are important features in any combat sport and they have handful of missing values. \n\nWe will address the missing values in age and height. We can simply delete rows with missing values, but usually we would want to take advantage of as many data points as possible. Replacing missing values with zeros would not be a good idea - as age 0 will have actual meanings and that would change our data.\n\nTherefore a good replacement value would be something that doesn't affect the data too much, such as the median or mean. the \"fillna\" function replaces every NaN (not a number) entry with the given input (the mean of the column in our case).

Introduction<\/a>\n\n**Background**\n\n### MMA stands for Mixed Martial Arts. It is a combat sport where one trains in punching, kicking, clinching and grappling by amalgamating different styles\/systems such as Western Boxing, Muay Thai, Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), Wrestling, etc. The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts organization based in Las Vegas, Nevada and is the largest MMA promotion in the world and features the top-ranked fighters of the sport. Based in the United States, the UFC produces events worldwide that showcase twelve weight divisions and abide by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. Due to increase in popularity and love for the game we decided to create a prediction model for obtaining the results of a MMA fight. It has many real life applications such as gambling, journalism and improvement of player performance by scrutinizing the advantages of the other opponents and refining his own performance in accordance to that data. Today, the popularity of the UFC has exceeded all other fighting sports and now consistently achieves more pay-per-view (PPV) buys than boxing and even rivalling the WWE and hence we have settled on UFC for our prediction model. \n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n****\n"}}
