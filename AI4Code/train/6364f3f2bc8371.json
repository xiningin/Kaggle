The dataset contains the various patient-reported outcome measures that can be used to measure the outcome along these two dimenions:\n- Oxford Knee Score (OKS): a 12-item questionnaire that assess daily functioning c.q. disability due to knee osteoarthritis. Items are scored from [0,4], where higher is better (no disability).  \n  - OKS question on pain and night pain, both on scale from [0,4]\n  - OKS , higher is better. The OKS is a 12-item questionaire that assess daily functioning c.q. disability.\n- EQ5D: generic quality of life PROMs along 5 dimensions on a 3-point Likert scale [1,3], lower is better. Dimensions are problems activity, anxiety, discomfort, mobility and self-care.\n- EQ-VAS: general reported health on a scale from [0,100], higher is better.\n\nWe will explore the PROMs data to see which target variable Y is meaningful to assess the outcome of knee replacement. Note PROMs are measured at T0 (prior to surgery) and T1 (six months after surgery).\n- [NHS PROMs methodology](https:\/\/github.com\/dkapitan\/jads-nhs-proms\/blob\/master\/references\/nhs\/proms_guide_v12.pdf)\n- [NHS PROMs data dictionairy](https:\/\/github.com\/dkapitan\/jads-nhs-proms\/blob\/master\/references\/nhs\/proms_data_dictionary.pdf)","ab6366e8":"#### Display datatypes","1099ebae":"# Background to osteoarthritis case study\n\n_taken from [narrative seminar Osteoarthritis by Hunter & Bierma-Zeinstra (2019) in the Lancet](https:\/\/github.com\/jads-nl\/execute-nhs-proms\/blob\/master\/references\/hunter2019osteaoarthritis.pdf)._\n\nHip and knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability and source of societal cost in older adults. Global prevalence of osteoarthritis is increasing and the burden of the disease will rise. The medical cost of osteoarthritis in various high-income countries has been estimated to account for between 1% and 2.5% of the gross domestic product of these countries, with hip and knee joint replacements representing the major proportion of these health-care costs.\n\nJoint replacement surgery is a clinically relevant and cost-effective treatment for end-stage osteoarthritis. The characteristics of end-stage osteoarthritis include joint pain, which disrupts normal sleep patterns and causes a severe reduction in capable walking distance and marked restriction of daily activities. Hence, the aim of knee and hip replacements is to alleviate pain and disability in daily functioning.\n\nHowever, up to 25% of patients presenting for total joint replacement continue to complain of pain and disability 1 year after well performed surgery. With data available on thousands of patients, the question arises to what extent it is possible to predict treatment success. This could be useful in supporting doctors in deciding whether knee replacement is indicated, and could help give patients a more personalised assessment of what to expect of treatment.","16a8b91d":"#### Handling and replacing missing values in pandas\nUp to now, pandas used several values to represent missing data: `np.nan` is used for this for float data, `np.nan` or `None` for object-dtype data and `pd.NaT` for datetime-like data. An experimental, new `pandas.NA` feature is introduced in version 1.0. Note that Google Colab still uses version 0.25 (as of 2020-03-15).\n\n`.loc` and `.iloc` are the recommended way to access parts of a `pd.DataFrame`. Note that this **always returns as copy**. Hence, to replace values, best practice is to:\n- make a new copy\n- do the replacements in the copy with explicit assignment\n\nNote that [pandas can handle missing values in integer columns recently](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/user_guide\/integer_na.html) (since version 0.24). This is still experimental, so be aware!
