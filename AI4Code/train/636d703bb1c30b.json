But it draws attention in the context of the blackout of female careers \nin the pandemic.\n\nAmong women of less privileged conditions, the decision to quit their job, which is no longer simple, was imposed more harshly.\n\nThey are choices in cruel contexts. Many of the women who were forced to quit their jobs stayed at home depending on the government's financial assistance, because they had no one to leave their children with or because they would have to leave them alone to work, and still at risk of becoming infected - points out the Insper researcher.\n\nA recent study by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea) gives a dimension of the challenge.\nThe drop in participation in the labor market affected men and women in the pandemic, but it was more intense among them. Not only were women the ones who left the market the most, but they also stopped looking for jobs. Those who earn less and have lower schooling were more affected. And this has further increased inequality in the job market https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/revistapegn.globo.com\/Dia-a-dia\/noticia\/2020\/10\/na-pandemia-trabalhar-e-ser-mae-voltou-ser-um-dilema.html&prev=search&pto=aue","94241a6f":"#Jobs or kids?

They analyzed the labor market participation rate of men and women in the second quarter of 2019 and in the same period this year.\n\nIn comparison, the drop in male participation was 6.3%. That of women, 7.1%. Among those who have children up to 10 years old at home, the reduction reached 7.7%.\n\nThey speak of mothers, but also of sisters, aunts, grandparents, because the care (of other people) ends up more attributed to the women in the household . The brands of the pandemic will be lasting for these people, for companies and the economy as a whole. But for those who have to leave work during a recession it is scarred. Even when they manage to re-enter the market afterwards, they tend to have a more difficult trajectory than those who have not been there.https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/revistapegn.globo.com\/Dia-a-dia\/noticia\/2020\/10\/na-pandemia-trabalhar-e-ser-mae-voltou-ser-um-dilema.html&prev=search&pto=aue","a6ab6221":"#Fores codes by Marie  https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mariapushkareva\/wine-reviews-spacy-bert","0c219ecd":"#In the pandemic, working and being a mother again became a dilemma\n\nFall in female participation in the labor market was greater for those living with children up to ten years old.\n\nAt first, the company seemed open to this dynamic at first. But over time, the schedules got more and more complicated, the meetings extended, the calls were out of hours. And the child wanted to eat, wanted attention and cried. The routine became exhausting. How would we lock ourselves up to work and leave our sons alone? Better thinking about the post-pandemic trajectory.\n\n It's frustrating because it was years of college, internship and work to grow and have a career, and women had to stop because they didn't feel supported, because they are mothers. It's not just the break in their careers that upsets, it's people's lack of empathy. It seems that we still live in the last century, having to give up work in favor of the child, the family.\n\nPrinting back in time is not mistaken. In some pandemic months, researchers point to a 30-year setback for female participation in an already unequal job market.\n\nWhen everything was \u201cnormal\u201d, the responsibility for household chores and the care for the people in the house already fell more on women. The confinement only reinforced this burden. https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/revistapegn.globo.com\/Dia-a-dia\/noticia\/2020\/10\/na-pandemia-trabalhar-e-ser-mae-voltou-ser-um-dilema.html&prev=search&pto=aue","d8e81ed0":"#Codes from Carl MacBride Ellis https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/carlmcbrideellis\/absolute-beginners-titanic-eda-using-dabl","1b23505b":"#Health x employment\n\nThe side effects of the health crisis have challenged women and mothers in different professions, social classes and family arrangements around the world, accentuating an existing reality. And, in an unprecedented way, they led to a situation in which the majority of Brazilian women aged 18 or over are out of the job market today.\n\nMany women lost their jobs because they were the majority in occupations most affected by the pandemic, such as domestic and personal care services. Others describe themselves as forced to give up their jobs due to the accumulation of tasks at work, at home and in the care of their children, who are not going to daycare or school.\n\nFor some women, it became a matter of losing sanity or job. It is not about their less commitment or ability, but about this division of labor between men and women in which they also bear the burden of invisible, unpaid work, and often not even considered work. https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/revistapegn.globo.com\/Dia-a-dia\/noticia\/2020\/10\/na-pandemia-trabalhar-e-ser-mae-voltou-ser-um-dilema.html&prev=search&pto=aue","0e401936":"##Codes by Pooja Jain https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jainpooja\/av-guided-hackathon-predict-youtube-likes\/notebook","b71e5a1a":"#The COVID-19 job market is leaving Millennial women behind, by Caroline Fairchild\n\nExperts say this could be because Millennial women \u2014 many who are now at the age where they have young children \u2014 are assuming more family responsibilities during this crisis.
