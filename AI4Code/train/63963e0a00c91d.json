Instead, the indexing unit will be an abstract or each of the paragraphs of the full text (as marked in JSON files).\n\nThis could take several minutes.","17a69707":"Once we have the schema, we can create an index.

Create an index for the paper retrieval system <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"index\"><\/a>\n\nThe first component of the system that we are going to develop in our approach is the information retrieval system. An information retrieval system is a tool that searches for  documents that are relevant to an information need from a collection of documents. This system has two main modules: the indexing system and the query system. \n\nThe first module is in charge of creating the primary data structure for the system, which is the index. The second component is the one with which users interact submitting a query based on their information need, and based on this query and using the index, retrieves documents. In this section we will create an index, and in the next section, we will develop the query system. For the implementation of these modules, we will use [Whoosh library](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/Whoosh\/), which contains functions for indexing text and then searching the index.\n\nThe index is a data structure that makes it possible to search for information in a document collection in a very efficient way. In short, it lists, for every word, all documents that contain it.\n\nIn order to create an index, we must define the schema of the index. The schema lists the fields in the index. A field is a piece of information for each document in the index, for example, id, path of the document, title and text. We define the type of these last two fields as \u201cTEXT\u201d, which means that they will be searchable. As it is common practice, we also define to apply the Stemming Analyzer to these text fields. Applying this analyzer all the text will be tokenized, then all the tokens will be converted to lowercase, a stopword filter will be applied in order to remove too common words, and finally, a stemming algorithm will be applied.","6a4746e2":"## 1.

In that way, we filter out those papers that do not include any of the synonyms. From now on, we will consider only the papers that we keep after filtering. \n\nThis filtering is also necessary for another reason. We are going to index the papers in the next step, and in order to store the index that includes all the papers in the metadata, we would need more than 5GB of disk space that we have available for this notebook.\n","98aa13ab":"## 4.

Then, we run the query and get the most relevant documents on the index (*n_docs* documents at maximum). We create a new dataframe with the results.\n\nThe output of the function is this dataframe, where the following data is stored for each relevant paragraph: id, date, journal, title, text and score.","c4d6643e":"# Less is more - using neural textual Question Answering for CORD19\n\n## Task: What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?\n\n## Our goal\n\nOur goal is to build a system which tries to fight information overload. For this purpose the system returns short replies, and only answers when the quality of retrieval and answers is satisfactory. The user could access the whole paragraphs and documents if further details were needed. We use neural textual Question Answering (QA) techniques to directly find specific answers to the scientific questions listed in [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge). We adapted the scientific questions given in each task description to be more amenable towards current technology. The system is not tailored towards specific questions, and can be readily used to answer any other question. \n\n\n\n## Approach\n\nWe only use the freely available [CORD-19 dataset](https:\/\/pages.semanticscholar.org\/coronavirus-research), which contains metadata of over 51,000 scientific papers (full text is also available for around 40,000 of them) about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses.\n\nAs we are mostly interested in papers related to COVID-19 (and not other coronaviruses), we filter out papers that are about coronaviruses other than COVID-19 (for example, SARS-CoV and MERS).\n\nThe implemented system has three main components. The first component is an Information Retrieval system (IR), based on the classical BM25F search algorithm. This system indexes abstracts and paragraphs on the full text of the papers.\n\nThe second component of the system is a QA system that, given a question in natural language and a paragraph returns the answer to the question in the paragraph or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d otherwise. The implemented system is based on neural network techniques. More specifically, we have used the [SciBERT language representation model](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1903.10676), which is a pretrained language model based on [BERT](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1810.04805), but trained on a large corpus of scientific text, including text from biomedical domain. BERT has shown successful results in many NLP tasks, such as QA, but SciBERT is more adapted to our current domain. We explored several option to fine-tune SciBERT for QA for this challenge: (1) the [SQuAD2.0 dataset](https:\/\/rajpurkar.github.io\/SQuAD-explorer\/), which is a reading comprehension dataset widely used in the QA research community; (2) the [pre-processed](https:\/\/github.com\/dmis-lab\/bioasq-biobert) version of [BioASQ](http:\/\/bioasq.org\/) 6b\/7b - Phase B datasets that were proposed for a  large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering competition; (3) the [QuAC dataset](http:\/\/quac.ai\/), which is a conversational QA dataset containing a higher rate of non-factoid questions than previous ones. On inspection of the produced answers we observed that: SQuAD2.0 produced good quality for questions seeking short answers, and a combination of SQuAD2.0 and QuAC produced better quality for questions which require longer answers; fine tuning on BioASQ does not seem to be effective. We thus used the SciBERT model that has been fine-tuned first on SQuAD 2.0 and then on QuAC.\n\nFinally, the third component aggregates the results of the QA system. For each task, it runs the IR and QA systems over all questions. The IR system returns top-20 paragraphs for each query, so there are 20 answers per question. In order to fight information overload, we took the following decisions: (A) discard paragraphs where the QA system returns \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d; (B) return the best answer for each of the best five paragraphs, that is, five answers per question (but we highlight the best 3 answers in the text); (C) discard questions which don\u2019t seem to be amenable for the current technology, estimated as those questions which receive more than %85 of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d answers.  \n\nNote that the system is identical for all the tasks. Given a set of questions related to a task, returns answers for those questions without any additional tuning.\n\n\n## Pros and cons\n\nPositive aspects of the system:\n* The system tries to fight information overload: A) returns specific answers to the questions. B) returns answers only when relevant, trying to avoid low quality answers. \n* Given the questions, it is completely automatic and does not need any tuning. The better the questions quality, the better the answers the system provides. \n* The system can be used to easily explore other tasks and information needs, as it directly returns answers to the document collection via new questions.\n* We experimented with different fine-tuning strategies according to two broad types of questions. \n* The system is complementary to labor-intensive information extraction techniques that try to find answers to specific tasks using hand-annotation or manually built rules.\n\nLimitations and possible improvements (cons):\n* The interface could be richer, allowing more in-depth exploration in cases where the user would like to explore additional documents and answers. \n* Currently the system relies only on the information available in the metadata file and full texts of the CORD19 dataset. We have not used any external source or other related dataset.\n* The speed can easily be improved. It is limited by the 5Gb of storage space available, which makes the system slow in getting abstracts and full documents. Producing larger and richer indices will speed up the system considerably.\n* The system can be easily improved with a more sophisticated Information Retrieval module (see to-dos)\n* The system can be easily improved by incorporating domain-specific annotated development data (see to-dos) and a continuous learning component to keep learning thanks to the feedback of some hand-selected expert users (see to-dos)\n* We also plan to improve the system with a confidence measure in the answers. In the future we would like to introduce an improved confidence measure that combines the IR and QA scores into a unified measure that automatically assesses the quality of the answers (see to-dos).\n\nSome of the limitations are software-engineering tasks which do not add to the technical and scientific part of our system. We thus will focus on the more challenging and hopefully effective improvements of the next to-dos:\n* We will test more sophisticated IR modules for paragraph retrieval (we plan to evaluate on the [TREC-COVID challenge](https:\/\/ir.nist.gov\/covidSubmit\/))\n* We plan to collaborate with third parties to exploit domain-specific development data ([COVID-QA project](https:\/\/github.com\/deepset-ai\/COVID-QA\/tree\/master\/data\/question-answering)) \n* We plan to add a continuous learning component to keep learning thanks to the feedback of hand-selected expert users, using Human In The Loop strategies.\n* We also plan to improve the system with a confidence measure in the answers.\n\n\n## Steps\n1.
