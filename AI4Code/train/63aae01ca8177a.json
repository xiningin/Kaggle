However, it has 17690 rows meaning that a installation_id (or a player) can take many assessments. Are the players with record in train_labels all we need?. Let's dig a little deeper into the players that has **no record** on the train_labels data. ","2982df6a":"So most of them have fall in group 0. Also, observe that we have 1066 different session on players that have record in train_labels. However, the output is only 27 in total. This shows that not all players assessment is recorded, even with those who have their record on train labels.","b1b1f7a8":"Observe that more than half players finish the game less than 5 seconds. This may be a good idicator that they don't even try (I actually played the game and 5 seconds is super fast for a kid.). Less look at the train set to see if we have that much percentage of players finish a game within 5 seconds.","4154fe52":"We can safely ignore the (13386-628=12758) people who have never taken the assessment for now since every player in the test set has taken the assessment **at least** once. A simpler explaination is that if we take these people and categorize them as group 0, then it has no beneficial for our training set since their game_time on the assessment is always zero and their is no event_code recorded. \n\nHowever, we still are still not sure if we can use the group of 628 players to categorize them as 0. Let's investigate their time spent on the assessment.","ebd6c6e3":"Less take a step further to see which group these kids fall into"}}
