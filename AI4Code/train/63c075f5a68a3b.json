","fbf61a37":"I think several interesting things pop out by looking at this data. First is the specialTeamsResult of 'Non-Special Teams Result.' This would be something like a fake extra point or a fake field goal attempt (as in they set up as if they were going to kick the ball but actually did something else). These plays could likely be ignored for parts of later analysis, although the initial setup of players in these plays could offer some insight as to when teams are likely setting up to go for it. \n\nFrom there, blocked kick attempts tend to have more rows, which makes sense as players would try to return the ball. Kickoff\/punt returns also seem to yield longer plays and more rows. \n\nAs expected, normal extra point\/field goal attempts and non-returned kickoffs generally have the least nnumber of rows.

","fdfb99a7":"It makes sense that extra points and field goals are fairly close and the lowest two as generally they are over the quickest as once the ball is hit the play usually doesn't last much longer (only long enough for the ball to go through\/miss the uprights). While I do find it interesting that punts would have that many more rows than kickoffs, I suppose the hangtime of punts and the possible greater likelihood of a touchback for kickoffs would account for this.
