Explain how a missing value could occur in the data, what policy would you choose to deal with it, and why.","1459c211":"In our data, there are no missing values. \n\nIf there are missing values, we can use multiple strategies to fix that. For example, if data is very large and removing some of the rows doesn't cause any problem\/deficiencies in analysis, we can delete the rows. Or we can also add zero or median\/average based on our scenario. \n\n### num_of_prev_attempts\n\nIn this case, `num_of_prev_attempts` can be empty\/null and it can be becase system is not being updated yet. Also, data can have some anomaly.\n\n**My Solution**\nI'll add `0` where `num_of_prev_attempts` are missing\/null. Because in my opinion, it is okay to mark that student as `num_of_prev_attempts` zero.\n\n\n### final_result\n\nIf `final_result` is empty, it can have many meanings. For example, may be student final result is not updated yet. Or may be student left the school and that student record is being updated anymore. It really depends on the situation.\n\n**My Solution**\nIn this case, I'll not mark student as `pass`, `fail` etc. Because it can effect our results. So, I'll delete it to not consider this student in our data analysis. ","51a23b6a":"**Hypothesis** I'm going to analyse is as follow:\n\nStudents with **previous attempts** in a course are **likely to pass** than a student taking the course first time.","8e5497d4":"I don't see any outliners in this case.

Explain what do the outliers signify in your case, what policy would you choose to deal with them, and why.","226e111a":"As you can see, there are very few students where `pre_attempts` is 6. It can have this implication that many courses or department doesn't allow more than 5 attempts. And this data is there by mistake or something. \n\nBased on my argument, I'll delete those rows because too less records for a class is not good in data analysis. "}}
