For each category, ask the user for a number of things in that category. You should print something for each category that states the category and the three things in that category.\n\nHere is what running your final program should look like:\n\n```\nWould you like to do another category? Yes\nEnter a category: animals\nHow many would you like to list? 3\nEnter something in that category: cheetah\nEnter something in that category: pelican\nEnter something in that category: red panda\nanimals: cheetah pelican red panda\n\nWould you like to do another category? Yes\nHow many would you like to list? 3\nEnter a category: noises\nEnter something in that category: vroom!\nEnter something in that category: whirrr!\nEnter something in that category: whooosh!\nnoises: vroom! whirrr! whooosh!\n\nWould you like to do another category?
