And a large part of losses is caused by a small number of serious accidents. Reducing traffic accidents, especially serious accidents, is nevertheless always an important challenge. The proactive approach, one of the two main approaches for dealing with traffic safety problems, focuses on preventing potential unsafe road conditions from occurring in the first place. For the effective implementation of this approach, accident prediction and severity prediciton are critical.\nIf we can identify the patterns of how these serious accidents happen and the key factors, we might be able to implement well-informed actions and better allocate financial and human resources. \n\n### Objectives\n\nThe first objective of this project is to recognize **key factors affecting the accident severity**. The second one is to develop a model that can **accurately predict accident severity**. To be specific, for a given accident, without any detailed information about itself, like driver attributes or vehicle type, this model is supposed to be able to predict the likelihood of this accident being a severe one. The accident could be the one that just happened and still lack of detailed information, or a potential one predicted by other models. Therefore, with the sophisticated real-time traffic accident prediction solution developed by the creators of the same dataset used in this project, this model might be able to further predict severe accidents in real-time.\n\n### Process\n\nData cleaning was first performed to detect and handle corrupt or missing records. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and feature engineering were then done over most features. Finally, Logistic regression, Random Forest Classifier, and EasyEnsemble were used to develop the predictive model.   \n\nIt is worth noting that the severity in this project is \"**an indication of the effect the accident has on traffic**\", rather than the injury severity that has already been thoroughly studied by many articles. Another thing is that the final model is dependent on only **a small range of data attributes** that are **easily achievable** for all regions in the United States and before the accident really happened. \n\n### Key Findings\n* Country-wide accident severity can be accurately predicted with limited data attributes (location, time, weather, and POI).\n* **Minute(frequency-encoding)** is the most useful feature. An accident is more likely to be a serious one when accidents happen less frequently at this time.\n* Spatial patterns are also very important. For small areas like **street** and **zipcode**, severe accidents are more likely to happen at places having more accidents while for larger areas like **city** and **airport region**, at places having less accident.\n* **Pressure** is top fourth important feature in the random-forest model and there is negative correlation between pressure and severity.\n* If an accident happens on **Interstate Highway**, there is a 2% chance that it will be a serious one, which is about 2.3 times of average and higher than any other street type. \n* An accident is much less likely to be severe if it happens near **traffic signal** while more likely if near **junction**.\n\n### Dataset Overview\n\nUS-Accident dataset is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers **49 states of the United States**. It contains more than **4 million cases** of traffic accidents that took place from **February 2016 to December 2020**. In this project, however, only the data of accidents that happened after **February 2019** and were reported by *MapQuest* was finally used in exploration analysis and modeling so that irrelevant factors can be eliminated to the greatest extent.\n\nLink for kaggle dataset: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sobhanmoosavi\/us-accidents\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMoosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, and Rajiv Ramnath. \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1906.05409\">A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset.<\/a>\u201d, 2019.\n\nMoosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Radu Teodorescu, and Rajiv Ramnath. \"<a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1909.09638\">Accident Risk Prediction based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data: New Dataset and Insights.<\/a>\" In proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, ACM, 2019.\n\n### Refrences\n\nI found these notebooks really helpful:\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/usa-accidents-data-analysis-d130843cde02\">USA Accidents Data Analysis<\/a>\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sobhanmoosavi\/us-accidents\/discussion\/113055\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/deepakdeepu8978\/how-severity-the-accidents-is\">how Severity the Accidents is ?<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/trivenisaraswathi\/severity-prediction-in-sfo-bay-area\">Severity Prediction in SFO Bay Area<\/a> \n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/phip2014\/ml-to-predict-accident-severity-pa-mont\"> ML to Predict Accident Severity_PA_Mont<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/suyash0010\/severity-and-time-wasted-analysis\"> severity and hours wasted<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/nikitagrec\/usa-accidents-plotly-maps-text-classification\"> USA Accidents Plotly maps + text classification <\/a>\n\n","d4aec004":"Then we can do some exploratoty analysis on resampled data.

For 'Description', the POI features have already been extracted from it by dataset creators. Let's get rid of these features first.\n\n","c9bfac4d":"Two differences are obvious in the above plots. The first is that the overall duration and impacted distance of accidents reported by *Bing* are much longer than those by *MapQuest*. Second, same severity level holds different meanings for *MapQuest* and *Bing*. *MapQuest* seems to have a clear and strict threshold for severity level 4, cases of which nevertheless only account for a tiny part of the whole dataset. *Bing*, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have a clear-cut threshold, especially regards duration, but the data is more balanced. \n\nIt is hard to choose one and we definitely can't use both.
