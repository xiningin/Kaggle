OverallQual\nmost people have shown a preference for a medium quality house in the quality range of 5-8 may be because their price range is also in  affordable range for most people.\n\n##Garage Cars\nAgain most people prefer a medium range of garage in car capacity (2-3) at affordable price.\n\n##Garage Area and GrLivArea is almost equally scattered over all ranges indicating that people are not quite worried about these variables, though there is a kinda linear rise in the  sale price among the different types.\n\n\n","db6874d2":"##### KDE Plot described as Kernel Density Estimate is

warranty deed , sale price will be high.\n##from Kitchen Quality, a high quality kitchen is preferred which leads to a higher house price.\n## paved street is preferred by most people which considerably increases our target saleprice.\n##poured concrete foundation is preferred by people that again increases the price.\n##Vinyl siding is preferred for exteriors which is quite costly thereby hiking the house price.\n## House with all utilities are preferred though it dosent make much difference in the price range.\n##Lotshape is something thats not specifically considered by people and it d not show much variation in price as well.\n## there is a hike in price if sale condition is normal or partial.\n","09fe56c8":"## distribution of Saleprice is almost normal as per the

roofstyles are prefered over all other styles and their sales price mostly range between less than 200000 and 400000.\n\n##ROOF MATERIAL\nstandard composite shingle roof material is prefered over all others(almost exclusively) and their price range between 100000 and 400000.\n\n##EXTERIOR1st\nvinyl siding is the most preffered exterior covering on the house followed by metal siding and wood siding.\nsalePrice is slightly higher for Vinyl siding when compared to metal n wood siding.\nleast preferred exterior covering are asphalt shingles,cinder block and imitation stucco whose saleprice range within 200000.\n\n##EXTERIOR2nd\npreferences of people for their  outer exterior covering on house  is almost same as that of the first exterior covering.\n","578b692c":"\n## Here rather than

100000 and 200000.\nleast prefferred is commercial zone inspite of having a lower saleprice .\n\n##Foundation:\nMost residents almost exclusively prefer poured concrete closely followed by cinder block above all other foundations inspite of a higher price for poured concrete. probably people want to be quite adamant about the strong foundation of the house upon which they build up their  dreams.\n\n##Street\nThis clearly shows that Pave street has more Saleprices as compared to Grvl and very Interesting thing Most of the people(99.59%) prefer Pave Street as compared to Grvl and in Pave section also most of the Houses cost under 400,000. \n## Lotshape\nalmost all lotshapes are equally preffered and their saleprices are almost the same which makes this attribute a low preferred attribute for our analysis.\n##Utilities\nHouses with all public utilities are unanimously favoured by people and i should say that thee is no much difference in the price as well.\n\n##Heating\nGas A and Gas W are preferred over other types of heating and they fall within a medium price range of 100000 to 200000.\n##Dwelling type\nmost preferred dwelling type is single family dettached and there is no much variation in price among the different types.\n\n##House style\nMost preffered style is 2 Story followed by 1 story and 2.5story -second lvel finished.there is no much variation among the price so house style is not an attribute required for this analysis. \n##Kitcchen Qual\nSeems like people are not ready to compromise in the quality of kitchen since excellent kitchen quality is
