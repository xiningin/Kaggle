The objective of Ward's linkage is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. ","9f554aa7":"**Dendogram**\n\nThe agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms available in this program module build a cluster hierarchy\nthat is commonly displayed as a tree diagram called a dendrogram. They begin with each object in a separate\ncluster. At each step, the two clusters that are most similar are joined into a single new cluster. Once fused,\nobjects are never separated.\n\nThe horizontal axis of the dendrogram represents the distance or dissimilarity between clusters. The vertical axis\nrepresents the objects and clusters. The dendrogram is fairly simple to interpret. Remember that our main interest\nis in similarity and clustering. Each joining (fusion) of two clusters is represented on the graph by the splitting of\na horizontal line into two horizontal lines. The horizontal position of the split, shown by the short vertical bar,\ngives the distance (dissimilarity) between the two clusters. "}}
