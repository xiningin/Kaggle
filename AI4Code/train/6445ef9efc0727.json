Now we are going to take a closer look at some columns with missing values and try to figure out what might be going on with them.","33eba554":"## Figure out why data is missing<a id=\"3\"><\/a>\nThis is the point at which we get into the part of data science that I like to call \"data intution\", by which I mean \"really looking at your data and trying to figure out why it is the way it is and how that will affect your analysis\". It can be a frustrating part of data science, especially if you're newer to the field and don't have a lot of experience. For dealing with missing values, you'll need to use your intution to figure out why the value is missing. One of the most important question you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this : \n\n**Is this value missing because it wasn't recorded or because it dosen't exist?**\n\nIf a value is missing because it doens't exist (like the height of the oldest child of someone who doesn't have any children) then it doesn't make sense to try and guess what it might be. These values you probably do want to keep as NaN. On the other hand, if a value is missing because it wasn't recorded, then you can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row. (This is called \"imputation\" and we'll learn how to do it next! :)\n\nLet's work through an example. Looking at the number of missing values in the df dataframe, I notice that the column `TimesSec` has a lot of missing values in it:","5dda7c58":"By looking at the documentation, I can see that `TimeSec` column has information on the number of seconds left in the game when the play was made. This means that these values are probably missing because they were not recorded, rather than because they don't exist. So, it would make sense for us to try and guess what they should be rather than just leaving them as NA's.\n\nOn the other hand, there are other fields, like `PenalizedTeam` that also have lot of missing fields. In this case, though, the field is missing because if there was no penalty then it doesn't make sense to say which team was penalized. For this column, it would make more sense to either leave it empty or to add a third value like \"neither\" and use that to replace the NA's.\n\n**Tip** : This is a great place to read over the dataset documentation if you haven't already! If you're working with a dataset that you've gotten from another person, you can also try reaching out to them to get more information.","df224a76":"That seems a lot!!! It might helpful to see what percentage of the values in our data set wer missing to give use a better sense of the scale of the problem.","4e862a14":"We've lost quite a bit of data, but at this point we have successfully removed all the NaN's from our data.","86a08512":"## Take a first look at your data<a id=\"1\"><\/a>\nThe first thing we'll need to do is load in the libraries and datasets we'll be using.

Let's see how many we have in each column.","fff756cd":"## Drop missing values<a id=\"4\"><\/a>\nIf you're in a hurry or don't have a reason to figure out why your values are missing, one option you have is to just remove any rows or columns that contain missing values. (Note: I don't generally recommend this approch for important projects! It's usually worth it to take the time to go through your data and really look at all the columns with missing values one-by-one to really get to know your dataset.)\n\nIf you're sure you want to drop rows with missing values, pandas does have a handy function, `dropna()` to help you do this. Let's try it out on our NFL dataset!","c34fddda":"I could also be a bit more savvy and replace missing values with whatever value comes directly after it in the same column. (This makes a lot of sense for datasets where the observations have some sort of logical order to them.)","65ea2ad1":"## Filling in missing values automatically<a id=\"5\"><\/a>\n\nAnother option is to try and fill in the missing values.
