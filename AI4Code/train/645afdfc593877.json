TPUs, and how to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n\nWe won't cover the code in detail here, but if you'd like to dive into the details, you're encouraged to check out the [tutorial notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ryanholbrook\/create-your-first-submission).\n\nBegin by running the next code cell to set up the notebook.","2378359e":"## Create Distribution Strategy ##","326517ec":"## Train Model ##","bbfb32fb":"---\n**[Deep Learning Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/deep-learning)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

You must accept the competition rules in order to participate. These rules govern how many submissions you can make per day, the maximum team size, and other competition-specific details. Click on **\"I Understand and Accept\"** to indicate that you will abide by the competition rules.\n\n# Commit your Notebook #\n\n**Committing** your notebook will run a fresh copy of the notebook start to finish, saving a copy of the `submission.csv` file as output.\n\nFirst, click on the **Save Version** button in the upper right.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ebMUMSq.png\" alt=\"The blue Save Version button.\" width=300>\n<\/figure>\n\nChoose **Advanced Settings**.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sx9l1fL.png\" alt=\"Advanced Settings in the Version menu.\" width=600>\n<\/figure>\n\nSelect **Run with TPU for this session** from the dropdown menu and click the blue **Save** button.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/1cB5ykf.png\" alt=\"The Accelerator dropdown menu.\" width=600>\n<\/figure>\n\nSelect **Save & Run All (Commit)** and click the blue **Save** button.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YeJLsNG.png\" alt=\"The Save Version menu.\" width=600>\n<\/figure>\n\nThe commit may take a while to finish (about 10-15 min), but there's no harm in doing something else while it's running and coming back later.\n\nThis generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook. After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **Save Version** button. This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen. Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**. This brings you into view mode of the same page.
