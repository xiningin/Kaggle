Conclusions\n\n    \n    Initial Considerations:\n    \n    * Price increase usually happens when there\u00b4s product shortage or demand increase, following the supply and demand law. Price devaluation, on the other hand, usually happens when there\u00b4s product excess in the market or demand decrease.\n    \n    * Volatile markets are usually characterized by wide price fluctuations and heavy trading. High volatility often results from an imbalance of trade orders in one direction (for example, all buys and no sells), or it could be due to more speculation, meaning short sellers and institutional investors. It\u00b4s a riskier market, with the potential to bring higher profits or losses.\n    \n    * A positive correlation may indicate the crops share common price-determining factors. Common price determinants for Soybeans and Corn for example are substitutability, demand, biofuels, the value of the U.S. dollar, weather, and crude oil. It\u00b4s also important to notice that investors looking to build a well-diversified portfolio will often look to add stocks with such a negative correlation so that as some parts of a portfolio fall in price, others necessarily rise.\n    \n    * It\u00b4s important understanding & discussing within the business team those behaviors and what we could expect to the future.\n    \n    \n    1. Agricultural\n        1.1 Most valuable products in 1980 were Cocoa beans at $ 3,167, Olive Oil at $ 2,272 and Groundnuts peanuts at $ 980, while in 2016 were Olive Oil at $ 4,546, Cocoa beans at $ 2,916 and Groundnuts peanuts at $ 1,830.\n        1.2 Highest prices increase in all historical series happened in Bananas at 162%, Soft Sawnwood at 125% and Olive Oil at 100%. At the same time, the highest prices devaluations were in Coffee Robusta at -50%, Sugar European at -26% and Cotton at -25%.\n        1.3 Products with the highest standard deviation% were Cocoa beans at 59%, Olive Oil at 35% and Bananas at 8%. On the other hand, the most stable products prices were Sugar European and Sugar Import at 0%, followed by Sugar Free Market at 1%.\n        1.4 Most positively correlated prices were found in Soybeans vs Maize corn at 93%, Barley vs Maize corn at 92% and Barley vs Soybean Oil at 90%. However, most negatively related prices were in Coffee Robusta vs Soft Logs and Soft Sawnwood at -43%, and Coffee Robusta vs Olive Oil at -29%.\n\n\n    2. Livestock\n        2.1 Most valuable products in 1980 were Fishmeal at $ 987, Wool fine at $ 684 and Wool coarse at $ 553, while in 2016 were Fishmeal at $ 1,456, Wool fine at $ 1,017 and Wool coarse at $ 957.\n        2.2 Highest prices increase in all historical series happened in Poultry chicken at 231%, Hard Sawnwood at 162% and Wool coarse at 73%. At the same time, the highest prices devaluations were in Lamb at -18%, Fish salmon at -18% and Shrimp at -17%.\n        2.3 Products with the highest standard deviation% were Fishmeal at 50%, Hard Sawnwood at 34% and Wool coarse at 14%. On the other hand, the most stable products prices were Fish salmon and Shrimp at 0%, followed by Poultry chicken at 2%.\n        2.4 Most positively correlated prices were found in Fishmeal vs Wool coarse and Beef vs Fishmeal at 85% and Hard Sawnwood vs Poultry chicken at 82%. However, most negatively related prices were in Swine - pork vs Hard Sawnwood at -46%, Lamb vs Swine - pork at -40%, and Lamb vs Fish salmon at -35%.\n\n\n    3. Metal\n        3.1 Most valuable products in 1980 were Tin at $ 16,974, Nickel at $ 6,585 and Copper at $ 2,593, while in 2016 were Tin at $ 15,610, Nickel at $ 6,585 and Copper at $ 2,593.\n        3.2 Highest prices increase in all historical series happened in China import Iron Ore Fines 62% FE spot at 280%, Zinc at 121% and Copper at 77%. At the same time, the highest prices devaluations were in Aluminum at -25%, Uranium at -16% and Tin at -8%.\n        3.3 Products with the highest standard deviation% were China import Iron Ore Fines 62% FE spot at 123%, Uranium at 82% and Lead at 71%. On the other hand, the most stable products prices were Aluminum at 28%, Zinc at 50% and Tin at 58%.\n        3.4 Most positively correlated prices were found in Copper vs Lead at 94%, Nickel vs Zinc at 89% and Copper vs China import Iron Ore Fines 62% FE spot at 86%. However, most negatively related prices were in Aluminum vs Tin at 45%, Aluminum vs China import Iron Ore Fines 62% FE spot at 47%, and Tin vs Zinc at 50%.\n\n\n    4.
