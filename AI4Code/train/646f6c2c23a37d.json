The serverless architecture allows end user to purely focus on the individual functions in the code.\n\nIn `Google BigQuery` end user does not have to worry about the underlying hardware, virtual machine, and number of nodes or instances etc. The user simply writes an SQL query and executes it.

","3f542aff":"## Introduction to BigQuery ML\n\nBigQuery ML enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using standard SQL queries. BigQuery ML democratizes machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using existing SQL tools and skills. BigQuery ML increases development speed by eliminating the need to move data.\n\nIt supports standard SQL dialect which is ANSI:2011 compliant. Model is created and deployed automatically as part of the training job. One of the biggest advantages is that the data is not required to be moved out of the data warehouse thereby saving an extra step. Traditionally as part of the training process , the data is moved out of the data store to be pre-processed for feature engineering step. BigQuery handles the feature engineering and pre-processing automatically out of the box. Due to it\u2019s serverless architecture, the training process is automatically scalable.\n\nAs of now BigQuery supports following models:\n\n    1. Linear Regression\n    2. Binary logistic regression\n    3. Multiclass logistic regression for classification\n    4. K-means clustering for data segmentation\n    5.
