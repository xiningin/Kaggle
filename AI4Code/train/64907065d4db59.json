This is called single cell variability (SCV), and has been observed across images in HPA and been described in numerous scientific publications. The phenomenon of how genetically identical cells can show functional heterogeneity (for example in response to drug treatment), is poorly understood. We want to study this observed variation to better understand the functional heterogeneity of cells. Therefore a single cell classifier is more helpful than a whole image classifier (as developed in the previous challenge). This competition is a weakly-labeled challenge: based on the image level label, you build models to predict labels for each individual cell. For this competition, we specifically annotated every single cell in a subset of images (mostly private\/never published, and some public images) with higher SCV compared to public HPA images, to act as test set. In other words, **the test set will have higher SCV than the training set.**\n\nWe also want to clarify that there is a public test set (for public leaderboard) and private test set (private leaderboard). **There are NO images in the private test set that were ever published.**\n\nHere are some examples to demonstrate the SCV (scroll down for **SCV and multi-localization examples** section).

Vesicles and punctate cytosolic patterns\n\nThis class includes small circular compartments in the cytosol: Vesicles, Peroxisomes (lipid metabolism), Endosomes (sorting compartments), Lysosomes (degradation of molecules or eating up dead molecules), Lipid droplets (fat storage), Cytoplasmic bodies (distinct granules in the cytosol). They are highly dynamic, varying in numbers and size in response to environmental and cellular cues. They can be round or more elongated.\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/images.proteinatlas.org\/6964\/22_B1_1_selected_medium.jpg\">\n  <br><br>\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/ENSG00000122705-CLTA\/cell\/U-251+MG\">Vesicles<\/a> |\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/ENSG00000115425-PECR\/cell\/A-431\">Peroxisomes<\/a> |\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/ENSG00000185722-ANKFY1\/cell\/A549\">Endosomes<\/a> |\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/ENSG00000075785-RAB7A\/cell\/U-2+OS\">Lysosomes<\/a> |\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/ENSG00000177666-PNPLA2\/cell\/A549\">Lipid droplets<\/a> |\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/ENSG00000038358-EDC4\/cell\/U-2+OS#img\">Cytoplasmic bodies<\/a> \n<\/p>","32f4344e":"# 11. Mitotic spindle\n\nThe mitotic spindle can be seen as an intricate structure of microtubules radiating from each of the centrosomes at opposite ends of a dividing cell (mitosis). At this stage, the chromatin of the cell is condensed, as visible by intense DAPI staining. The size and exact shape of the mitotic spindle changes during mitotic progression, clearly reflecting the different stages of mitosis.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/images.proteinatlas.org\/5487\/1825_A5_31_cr5ac33e6e0739c_selected_medium.jpg\">\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/ENSG00000088325-TPX2\/cell\/HEL#img\">More examples<\/a> \n<\/p>  ","ec9de0fd":"\nThe model will be graded on mean Average Precision score for each matched cell passing segmentation IoU threhold of 0.6 (See [Evaluation tab](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/hpa-single-cell-image-classification\/overview\/evaluation)). \n\nIn short, the submission format is\n<pre><code>ImageAID,ImageAWidth,ImageAHeight,LabelA1 ConfidenceA1 EncodedMaskA1 LabelA2 ConfidenceA2 EncodedMaskA2 ...\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n- Predicted masks are run-length encoded\n- Please note that there are multilabeled cells (more than one class for each cell).
