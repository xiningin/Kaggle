This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.\n\nVideo games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.\n\nThe first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s are simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game is the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The quickly-growing industry suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.","84d28742":"Platform and shooter games are the most played game genre in Europe","77543321":"**Sales of different genre in North America**","0d276919":"**Global Sales over the years**","8a3fc2e7":"**Importing the data file**","6470169f":"**Top 5 rows of the dataset**","f7cf3f9e":"**Removing the rows with empty cells**","a593d50a":"2009 has the highest numberof game releases","293bdf9a":"PS2 has recorded highest sales globally","f368f138":"**Finding out if there are any empty cells**","40d6c538":"**Decriptive Statistics of the dataset**","2cd7530a":"**Sales of different genre in other Regions**","77ac623f":"**Finding out the game with minimum sales globally**","a2830cbe":"![](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=video+games+&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiF5t6__o_0AhXinUsFHQAJBh0Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=video+games+&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIICAAQgAQQsQMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6BggAEAgQHjoECAAQGFDbCVjbCWDYDGgAcAB4AIAB3AGIAagDkgEDMi0ymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=PuGMYYXPLeK7rtoPgJKY6AE&bih=627&biw=1325&client=opera-gx&hs=jPp#imgrc=2qNLo2rMozNZ_M)","339015ba":"# Video Game Sales EDA"}}
