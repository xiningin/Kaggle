Thanks to that, I can focus almost exclusively on creating a better agent. The first exercises suggests to create an agent that looks one move ahead to take a decision, which feels a good greedy approach (take the best move available now, defined as the one that gives the highest immediate reward).\n\nIntuitively, I think it should not be difficult to then extend this to looking several moves ahead. \n\nLet's go with order, the first example creates an agent that either picks a winning move, if available, or a random one. To do that, we need to simulate the board one step ahead and test if it is a winning board.","e118382e":"So it wins just a bit more often against leftmost and it wins solidly against random. Good for winmove!\n\nLeftmost seems to be the easiest player to beat but apparently it is still outsmarting my agent.

It feels I need to look further, but then the problem would present itself again when meeting an agent that looks 3 steps further and so on. The tutorial suggests another way to tackle the problem\n\n# Heuristics\n\nThis approach assigns points to game boards and make the move that gives the better score. I am guessing that the quality of my agent will heavily depends on how the points are assigned.\n\nThe first agent I will build following the tutorial is still looking only one step ahead, but it is also scoring how valuable is, for example, to get to 3 pieces in a row. With the right point assignment, the effect might reproduce better a player that is forecasting the game a bit more than by only one move.\n\nFirst, I need a function that creates a board after a piece is dropped, and we have that in `drop_piece` defined above. Then I need a function that counts how many pieces my agent and its opponent have in a specified window of the board.\n","828c4260":"In other words\n\n* if we reached the maximum depth (e.g. when we look a predetermined number of steps ahead) or when the game is over, get the heuristic and thus score the board\n* if we are trying to maximize the score, for every valid move, call recursively the function by reducing depth at each step and maximize the value of the board\n* otherwise (e.g. when guessing the opponent's move) do the same but minimize the score\n* note that in the recursion, we alternate the times we try to maximize or minimize the score (simulating one move per player)\n\nBefore continuing, it is not difficult to imagine that this algorithm will run for a long time. To speed up, I can also implement [the alpha-beta pruning](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning). It is a pruning method and it aims to stop evaluating nodes when there is a proof that those moves are worse than a move previously evaluated.","edf8e058":"# Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nSo far, I can see I can tell my agent how to pick a move. In principle, I can look ahead dozens of moves to pick the best move but it will be increasingly slow and the strategy might be very inefficient.\n\nThe basic concept of reinforcement learning I can leverage is instead to let the agent play the game, record if it wins or loses, and backpropagate this information to inform future games and have it making better decisions.\n\nIn this way, I would only need to score wins, losses, and draws rather than every possible configuration of the board.\n\nI must say I am not a comfortable jumping into deep learning right now as it is not clear to me how to train and monitor what my agent is going to do. Google can help me finding the basic concept (or what looks like a building block of what I want to achieve).\n\n## Q-Learning (and simpler games)\n\n[Q-Learning](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Q-learning) is a technique to learn the value of an action in a particular state. The goal is thus to create a policy that, given the configuration of the environment, tells what is the best action to take. The interesting thing is that it does not require a model of the environment. The algorithm works by looking several steps ahead (for example, it can just look till the end of the game), receive a reward for the outcome of those steps, and backpropagate this information to each of the steps.\n\nIn other words, \n* I create a dictionary Q that, for each possible state, has a value for each of the possible actions. At first the values are random (or 0)\n* I let the agent play and record each state and action. \n* At the end of the game, I know if the agent won or lost and give it a reward accordingly.\n* I update the dictionary by using the [Bellman equation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bellman_equation) to essentially pass the information that *with this set of actions in these situations you won\/lost the game*\n* Eventually, the iterative process converges to the optimal policy, e.g. for each configuration there is an optimal action to win the game.\n\nThe simplest application of this concept I could find is to create an agent able to solve a small grid world puzzle. The rules are simple, there is a world on a grid. You start on a cell, you win if you end up on another cell, you lose if you end up on yet another cell, and there might be cells that are simply unaccessible. A well trained agent should be able to reach the winning cell via the shortest path.\n\n[The code](https:\/\/github.com\/lucabasa\/reinforcement_learning_training\/tree\/main\/GridWorld) is inspired by [this article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/reinforcement-learning-implement-grid-world-from-scratch-c5963765ebff) and hidden for readibility.","72d20273":"There we go. This is however not quite I wanted. I want an agent that maps the state of the board to an action. Here I can finally implement Q-learning for this problem.","93d17a82":"Our new agent is often winning against our previous champion. I want to start making some submissions for the LB.","7e47b72e":"Which is basically scanning the board for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal patterns, counting how many times it finds a given number of pieces in each window and returning the count. The window size is always of size 4 (given that we need to create 4 in a row) and `num_disc` is telling the function how many pieces of a given player to look for.","9a20e6db":"However, this method has a big problem: in the game I want to solve the number of states is very high (4 quadrillion or something), there is no way I can really map each of them to a set of actions.\n\n## Deep Q-Learning","0b11dbed":"Apparently yes, good to know. Moving on, what is this environment?","9b6de130":"Ok, with order because there is a lot going on here.\n\nThe board is a list of numbers, we reshape it to make it 2 dimensional","518f8f48":"Let's see how it plays","834cd794":"In other words,\n\n* For each valid move, start by simulating the new board \n* Score the new board (1 step ahead) with the minmax algorithm. This will simulate the opponent move and then one more move for the player (because we made it look 3 steps ahead).\n* Return the score of each valid move and pick the move with the highest score\n\nSo MinMax is still scoring the next move, but it is looking ahead a given amount of steps to do so.","3ef70e89":"Alright, the config is just a dictionary coming from the environment, nothing special there. The board is simply a representation of the board as list, making a move corresponds to putting numbers in the list, 1 for a player, 2 for the other. Therefore, the first 7 zeros correspond to the top row of the board and thus it makes sense that a move is available if those entries are 0 because that would mean that the column is not full.\n\nI am curious about how to break this. Let's say I want to overflow the first column","e3785c7e":"Before diving in how to make my agent learn, it is worth to explore a more complex use of heuristic\n\n# MinMax algorithm\n\nIf I start making my agent looking ahead one step, I wonder then how to make it look several steps ahead. This will likely include guessing what the opponent will do after my agent's move. Moreover, I wonder how to enforce a strategy that not only picks the best move at this moment (which is what I did so far), but also the best move to eventually win the game.\n\nThe **MinMax algorithm** choses the moves that increases the score of the agent the most and assumes the opponent will chose the move that lowers the score the most.\n\nLet's start with a simple heuristic.","092454be":"And I can find the code of these agents in the file `connectx.py`, nice. In this context, the agent is a python function that we program or train to take decisions given the situation, which is the essence of RL.\n\nThe agents must take 2 arguments, \n\n* `obs`, which has information about the board (`obs.board`) and the player (`obs.mark`, either a player or the other)\n* `config`, which defines the board (rows and columns) and the rule to win (in this case, 4 in a row)\n\nThe agent will return the column number where the next piece will be played. Therefore, I expect the environment to know where the pieces are and to put the new piece in the only available spot given the column number.\n\nSo the random agent takes a random valid move.
