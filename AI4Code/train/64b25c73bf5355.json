The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people.\n\nSo daily level information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community.\n\n\n### Content\n2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it\u2019s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - CDC\n\nThis dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.\n[](http:\/\/)\nThe data is available from 22 Jan, 2020.\n\n### Column Description\nMain file in this dataset is covid_19_data.csv and the detailed descriptions are below.\n\ncovid_19_data.csv\n\nSno - Serial number<br>\nObservationDate - Date of the observation in MM\/DD\/YYYY<br>\nProvince\/State - Province or state of the observation (Could be empty when missing)<br>\nCountry\/Region - Country of observation<br>\nLast Update - Time in UTC at which the row is updated for the given province or country. (Not standardised and so please clean before using it)<br>\nConfirmed - Cumulative number of confirmed cases till that date<br>\nDeaths - Cumulative number of of deaths till that date<br>\nRecovered - Cumulative number of recovered cases till that date<br>\n2019_ncov_data.csv<br>\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nJohns Hopkins University for making the data available for educational and academic research purposes<br>\nWorld Health Organization (WHO): https:\/\/www.who.int\/","95acf4d9":"## 2. import and explore the Data","f37ca595":"![](http:\/\/)"}}
