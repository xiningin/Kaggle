When IC is lowest (1\/2 pA), it is rare for more than 1 channel to be open. As IC increase, so does ion channel freedom to open. At IC = 2.5pA, we see up to 10 open channels.\n\nOther notebooks have shown that given the mode, the state of open channels are gaussian distributions. We also make the assumption that after initial comb filtering (Drift removal) that our signal also has a gaussian distribution.
