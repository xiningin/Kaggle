So, we need to find a \"sweet spot\" between underfitting and overfitting.","50fb4460":"Regularization:\n- it is a form of regression, that regularizes or shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero.\n- adds an additional penalty term in the error function or cost function","cdebf36e":"### What is Overfitting in ML models","8727c15d":"Bias and variance are complements of each other. The increase of one will result in the decrease of the other and vice versa. Hence, finding the right balance of values is known as the Bias-Variance Tradeoff. An ideal algorithm should neither underfit nor overfit the data.","1bc6726c":"Noise: \nNoise is meaningless or irrelevant data present in the dataset. It affects the performance of the model if it is not removed.\n\nBias: \nit is error in the prediction, or simply it is the difference in Predicted values and Actual Values","19a671c3":"Data Augmentation:\n- it is a data analysis technique\n- it is an alternative of adding more data to avoid overfitting\n- We simply modify the original data instead of adding more data\n- it makes data sample slightly different every time it is processed by the model. Hence each data set appears unique to the model and prevents overfitting.","cd633647":"- An overfitted model has low bias and high variance.","32fdade2":"Below are some popular ways to avoid overfitting in ML models\n- Early Stopping\n- Train with more data\n- Feature Selection\n- Cross-Validation\n- Data Augmentation\n- Regularization","2983e94e":"- Overfitting occurs when the model fits more data than required, and it tries to capture each and every datapoint fed to it. Hence it starts capturing noise and inaccurate data from the dataset, which degrades the performance of the model.\n\n- For example, if the model shows 85% accuracy with training data and 50% accuracy with the test dataset, it means the model is not performing well.","c3dfb362":"Feature Selection:\n- it is way of selection the most contributing features and removing less affecting features\n- redundant and less important features are removed\n- some model comes with inbuilt feature selection, otherwise we can do this manually\n- there are various features selection techniques","2b2f78c7":"- A statistical model is said to be overfitted if it can\u2019t generalize well with unseen data.\n- possible causes of overfitting are impurities, noisy data, outliers, missing data, or imbalanced data etc","04055aac":"If a model works well with unseen data, then it is said to be well Generalized"}}
