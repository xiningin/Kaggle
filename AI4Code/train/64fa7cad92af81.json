So many poeple are relying on **Kaggle, blogs and Youtube channels**. This can be seen as a very good opportunity for experienced ones to spend time on making online profile because new commers will be looking at them through their Kaggle notebooks, blogs, youtube channels. It can help many to learn from their experiences.","955bfaff":"### Do these countries have more Young Respondents of experienced ones?","ef58c6d4":"### What hardware type is being used ?","b88dd538":"As India has more young or aspiring data engineers, India has more CPU users than USA.

This may give an indication of rising demand for AI in both countires and also we can see that as India has more young data scientists, may be, we will see a tremendous increase in AI in India in the comming years. So that's a big path for young ones to invest their time in it.","944f4c4a":"Both countries has more Male Developers than female Developers.<br>\n1) What's the pattern of people in AI? <br>\n2) For how many years people are there in Machine Learning? <br>\n3) What is their highest formal education ?","c6873211":"More people are moving towards online Courses instead of university degree. But USA has almost double the number of respondents who has University degree in comparison to India. It has been observed earlier that people in USA mostly have Master's Degree which adds on this observation that people like going to college and have degree. <br>\n\nBut does that mean people in USA are less active to knowledge from online sources than India ? Let's see about that.","251643ec":"So, Jupyter is most lovable among people of India and USA but India has more jupyter lovers than USA and India has more young engineers too.

It can be due to simple, flexible style of programming. And people also like R but m=most people recommend Python and Jupyter as their IDE.","9e04987d":"This graph shows that many Indians have salary less than 1,000 (USD) but in USA, people have salary greater than $100,000.
