The main take aways from this table are:\n* The **Oxford\/AstraZeneca** and **Pfizer\/BioNTech** vaccines are the most widely used across the globe.\n* The use of many vaccines appear to be proximity-based, in that certain vaccines seem to cover landlocked or neighbouring countries (i.e the **Oxford\/AstraZeneca** vaccine, by itself, covers most of the African continent).\n* The **Oxford\/AstraZeneca** vaccine is more widely used in third world countries. This makes sense, as this vaccine is manufactured at cost - and is therefore free of charge, meaning the countries with a lower GDP can recieve the vaccine.\n* The **Covaxin** vaccine is currently only being rolled out and used in India, which means that particular vaccine hasn't been approved in any other territory yet.\n* *China* (**Sinopharm\/Beijing, Sinopharm\/Wuhan, Sinovac**) and *Russia* (**EpiVacCorona, Sputnik V**) are the only countries that aren't currently utilising vaccines developed overseas.\n* According to this table, the *United Arab Emirates* and *Hungary* currently have the most vaccines being rolled out, each originating from a total of five different providers.","d536c6df":"# Bonus questions and analysis","7857f383":"That's strange, why and how has Israel and the Seychelles supposedly vaccinated *over 100%* of its population?

Let's just assume that its the latter, as that is probably the more realistic justification.","affb29cd":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic shocked the world in early 2020, grinding the world to a halt. Many people's lives were changed, as governments and scientists around the world ordered people to change their way of living and stay at home, in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 disease.

You may notice some arguments and parameters, these are basically telling difflib how lenient to be when selecting the values, allowing for me to find not just the name of the vaccine itself (i.e 'Oxford\/AstraZeneca'), but the name within other values with multiple names (i.e. Oxford\/AstraZeneca, Pfizer\/BioNTech, Sinovac, Sputnik V')","3f7775fe":"Once we have varified that all of the countries previously identified have been removed, we can now merge the two datasets ('covid_vaccine_data' and 'covid_country_data') using pd.join.","d2d778e8":"Those numbers look promising, but note that the top five countries also happen to be the most populous, and the ratio of those vaccinated to those that are not really matters when considering the rate of transmission, emergence of new variants, and, consequently, a third wave of COVID-19 cases.

Most vaccinated countries per percentage of the population?\n\nSo, what are the most vaccinated countries when taking into account the population said country (i.e. the percentage that are vaccinated)?","01bd970c":"**Plotting this data to see the progression in daily vaccinations over time**\n*(code is hidden below)*","c33a737a":"# Reading, cleaning & pre-processing the data","74ab493e":"There are many different pharmaceutical companies worldwide, and a number of them have been responsible for many of the vaccines distributed throughout the globe, and many are still being developed whilst being rolled out, whilst others are waiting approval. Many countries, such as the United Kingdom, have opted to use multiple vaccines from multiple provided to subside the amount of vaccines needed for the population. \n\nBut which vaccines are used where? ","38a2aac1":"However, these findings only tell is what combination is the most common; it doesn't quantify what the most common singular vaccine is across the world, and it could be misleading as an uncommon vaccine may be intepreted as common due to its place on the graph, despite being used in very few countries. This graph probably isn't very helpful if we were to compare the popularity of a single vaccine. So let's find out what the most common vaccine is (in isolation).\n\nThe hidden cell and output below shows us all of the vaccines (unique values) found in the dataset. As you can see, many vaccines have their own value (i.e. *'Pfizer\/BioNTech'*) whilst also being part of another value (and not wholly representing that value e.g. *'Moderna, Oxford\/AstraZeneca, Pfizer\/BioNTech'*).","69337e5d":"(There appears to be a substantial amount of missing values\/data (i.e. NaN) in this dataset, most likely from when either vaccinations weren't started yet, or weren't recorded - most likely the former. We will deal with each missing value accordingly, most likely as part of each analytical process.) ","a6c0e36a":"Many pharmaceutical companies across the world have contributed to the pool of vaccines available today worldwide, but which vaccines (or combination of vaccines) are used the most by each country?","080bb1bd":"# COVID-19 Global Vaccination Data Analysis\n*an Exploratory Data Analysis by Tariq Hussain*","2fe6eeb7":"# Which countries are making the best recoveries (i.e. had the highest death toll, but has the highest amount of daily vaccinations)?","cf2e03b7":"Looks good! For the most part, the results look pretty similar to the previous results from the previous analysis. However, we now have the ability to analyse each vaccine on a country by country basis, without any augmentation from other vaccines. We can see that Oxford\/AstraZenca is still the most common vaccine with use in 118, followed by Pfizer\/BioNTech (92 countries) and Moderna with a huge gap in third place (36 countries). All of these vaccines were the earliest vaccines reported to be in development. \n\nLet's plot this dataframe on a bar graph.","9f4b714c":"Since these two datasets came from the same source (and most likely, the same author(s)), let's merge these two datasets together by using the *pd.join* function, setting the newly renamed 'iso_code' column as the index and, afterwards, confirming that the join was successful.","a6bd7d5c":"In the lists of column names for each datasets above, we can see that there are many duplicates or alternate spellings for the same type of data. For example, all of the datasets have a column for the iso codes for each country, but *covid_country_pop_data* and *covid_19_by_country_data* refer to them as 'CountryAlpha3Code', whilst *covid_vaccine_data* does not.\n\nLet's rectify this mistake by renaming the columns using pandas, so that it makes it easy to classify columns later in the process:","3877e74a":"Wow, China has really increased their vaccination rates exponentially in recent days, particularly in comparison to other countries in the top ten - the United States aren't far behind, either. India also saw big increases in their daily vaccinations, whilst the UK\/England are vaccinating their populations slowly but steadily - similarly to Russia. We can also see that the lines for India, Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil end much eariler than any other country. Why is that? Are there some discrepancies in the data (i.e. missing data)? Did they not vaccinate people over a number of days? Have their supplies run out? With the spread of the virus possibly slowing vaccine product, the blocking of the Suez Canal and other obstacles, its most likely that they have run out of supply or had shipments delayed - as countries that manufacture their vaccines domestically (i.e. the US, Russia and China) don't appear to have slowed down, or stopped, vaccinating their populations.","bfde6536":"# 3. Which countries have the most effective vaccination programme?","27c16bd2":"As part of data preparation and pre processing, we need to verify each column of each dataset to check for any discrepancies or irregularities. Here, pandas is being told to retrieve and print (via Python) the names of each column of each dataset as a list.","87272620":"# Start of Exploratory Data Analysis\n# \n\n# 1. What vaccines are used in which countries?","145bbfbd":"Now the mismatches have been renamed, let's check for any countries that appear in *covid_country_data* but not in *covid_vaccine_data*. It would be unnecessary to keep country data for countries that don't have (or haven't recorded yet) any vaccine data.","ed8c1a65":"We've seen the vaccination numbers for each country, and they get increasingly greater as the population number grows. But what about if we analyse from a different perspective, irrespective of population numbers? Are recovery rates related to the success of a vaccination program, and is that dependent of what kind of country it is economically (i.e. first, third-world, developing)?\n\nLet's find out:","a02401ac":"*covid_country_pop_data* only has two columns, and thus implies a smaller dataset, so we'll just take a closer look by just displaying the entire dataset thusly, before moving on:","32cbe412":"We can see a pattern emerging within the countries that seem to be the best performing; the pattern being the countries which have a bigger population, more infrastructure and resources and bigger vaccine supply, appear to be vaccinating at speed, and thus becoming more vaccinated as the days go by. However, GDP is not a factor here, as many of the majority of the countries in the top ten are either developing or third-world countries - which is also interesting.","9861753d":"It appears that the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine deems the most popular, being used in a substantial amount of countries in isolation, with many other uses in other countries alongside other vaccines from different providers. This is most like because: a) the Oxford\/AstraZeneca is manufactured at cost, meaning it is free for those who order it, and b) it is manufactured in many different sites across the globe (India and the Netherlands both have development sites, for example), making distribution across the world much easier.","427f830f":"Vaccines for COVID-19 have been in clinical trials since mid-late 2020, and were officially rolled out and in use from December 2020, and have been implemented in more and more countries over time. \n\nThe question is, regardless of population, which countries have inoculated the most people?","43d7d4df":"As a UK resident, it is the norm to hear about the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine, as it was one of the first vaccines to enter clinical trials, is developed in the UK, and was regularly mentioned by the UK Government's Chief Scientific Officers, as well as cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister himself. Recently, the vaccine has come under fire from the European Union and participating countries after claims that the vaccine causes blood clots (venous thromboembolism). It was later rebutted by many independent scientists, the Chief Executive from the Medical and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency, who later said there is no evidence to suggest that the vaccine increases chances of blood clots. Germany have since then, however, have suspending the vaccine's use in over-60s. On the 07\/04\/21, following the reports of blood clots in women under 60 and 13 related deaths, other European countries, such as France, Spain and Italy, have also responded in a similar way by only giving the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine to a particular age group. The UK's MHRA have issued guidance on this vaccine, declaring that any 18-34 year old will be given a choice of an alternate vaccine (i.e Moderna or Pfizer).\n\nDespite this, how many countries (that aren't part of the United Kingdom, including its devolved administrations) still use the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine?","f5df6248":"# Is the recovery rate of a country related to their vaccination numbers?","143c5ab4":"From the output above, we can see that the dataset has a unique data entry every time the vaccination data  of a country is updated. Whilst it's good to see progress over time, it wouldn't be desirable to process and analyse what are essentially duplicates for each country. So, in order to only focus on the most up to date vaccination data from each country, let's drop (or filter) out the 'older' entries.","05374217":"# Apart from the United Kingdom, who else uses the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine?","c99f75de":"# Preparatory work","393aa415":"# Introduction"}}
