It has applications in almost every industry in the world. Let\u2019s consider an unconventional application that you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily encounter.\n\nNew York City is a thriving metropolis. Just like most other metros its size, one of the biggest problems its citizens face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and cramped geography leads to a huge number of parking tickets.\n\nIn an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department has collected data for parking tickets. Of these, the data files for multiple years are publicly available on Kaggle. We will try and perform some exploratory analysis on a part of this data. Spark will allow us to analyse the full files at high speeds as opposed to taking a series of random samples that will approximate the population. For the scope of this analysis, we will analyse the parking tickets over the year 2017. \n\nNote: Although the broad goal of any analysis of this type is to have better parking and fewer tickets, we are not looking for recommendations on how to reduce the number of parking tickets\u2014there are no specific points reserved for this.\n\nThe purpose of this case study is to conduct an exploratory data analysis that will help you understand the data. Since the size of the dataset is large, your queries will take some time to run, and you will need to identify the correct queries quicker. The questions given below will guide your analysis."}}
