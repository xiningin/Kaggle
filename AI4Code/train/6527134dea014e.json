SUMMARY San Francisco International Airport Report on Monthly Passenger Traffic Statistics by Airline.\n\nB. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET Airport data is seasonal in nature, therefore any comparative analyses should be done on a period-over-period basis (i.e. January 2010 vs. January 2009) as opposed to period-to-period (i.e. January 2010 vs. February 2010). It is also important to note that fact and attribute field relationships are not always 1-to-1. For example, Passenger Counts belonging to United Airlines will appear in multiple attribute fields and are additive, which provides flexibility for the user to derive categorical Passenger Counts as desired.\n","a2d088a6":"## This Kernal is not Yet done on the next vesion of this kernal i will be comming up with full analysis for this Kernal \n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/everydaycodings\/Simpsons-Character-Image-Recognition\/master\/images\/progress.jpg)","3a3686c1":"# Analysing The Data to Get some Insides of The Data.","ae419059":"## Relation Between Published Airlines and Passenger Count with hue Price Category Code","569c8ca5":"## Relation Between Operating Airline and GEO Summary","d109fd29":"## Importing Important Libraries","2d6e307c":"## Reading the Data","d5e0a231":"# Surprise\n\n## If you are Doing Data Analysis On your daily Basis Please Try These Open Source Web App.\n## This can analysis data in multiple formates(csv, txt, xls, xlsx, ods, odt) and gives shows you the analysis in the most informative way.\n## Features Of Data Analysis Web App\n- Supports **Multiple file formates**(csv, txt, xls, xlsx, ods, odt).\n- Gives a **detailed overview** of your data.\n- You have the option to **plot graphs** for your data.\n- You can see **Outliers** in your data in a visulization way.\n- You can *drop* *multiple columns* and *rename columns*.\n- You can *drop* **multiple categorical Rows** and **Numerical Rows** by giving **multiple conditions**.\n- You can **download\/export** your edited data.\n\n\n### Check out the live demo: https:\/\/data-analysis-webapp.herokuapp.com\/\n\n### Source Code: https:\/\/github.com\/everydaycodings\/Data-Analysis-Web-App\n\n### Video Demo:\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/everydaycodings\/Data-Analysis-Web-App\/master\/presentation\/vedio.gif)\n\n### We need your Feedback for this web app if you face an issue tell us by github or if you want us to add some more features plese tell us by creating an issue on github we come with that feature as soon as possible.
