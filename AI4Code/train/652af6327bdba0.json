A value 1 means perfect positive correlation.\n\n**NEGATIVE CORRELATION**: If an increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated. A value -1 means perfect negative correlation.\n\nNow lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as MultiColinearity as both of them contains almost the same information.\n\nSo do you think we should use both of them as one of them is redundant. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n\nNow from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated.

There are some default parameter values for this Black-Box, which we can tune or change to get a better model. Like the C and gamma in the SVM model and similarly different parameters for different classifiers, are called the hyper-parameters, which we can tune to change the learning rate of the algorithm and get a better model.

Money Wins!!!.\n\n**Age**: Children less than 5-10 years do have a high chance of survival. Passengers between age group 15 to 35 died a lot.\n\n**Embarked**: This is a very interesting feature. The chances of survival at C looks to be better than even though the majority of Pclass1 passengers got up at S. Passengers at Q were all from Pclass3.\n\n**Parch+SibSp**: Having 1-2 siblings,spouse on board or 1-3 Parents shows a greater chance of probablity rather than being alone or having a large family travelling with you.","bf85da05":"We can see the important features for various classifiers like RandomForests, AdaBoost,etc.\n\nObservations:\n\n1)Some of the common important features are Initial,Fare_cat,Pclass,Family_Size.\n\n2)The Sex feature doesn't seem to give any importance, which is shocking as we had seen earlier that Sex combined with Pclass was giving a very good differentiating factor. Sex looks to be important only in RandomForests.\n\nHowever, we can see the feature Initial, which is at the top in many classifiers.We had already seen the positive correlation between Sex and Initial, so they both refer to the gender.\n\n3)Similarly the Pclass and Fare_cat refer to the status of the passengers and Family_Size with Alone,Parch and SibSp.","f365eab5":"### Observations:\n \n1)The survival chances are almost 1 for women for Pclass1 and Pclass2 irrespective of the Pclass.\n\n2)Port S looks to be very unlucky for Pclass3 Passenegers as the survival rate for both men and women is very low.(Money Matters)\n\n3)Port Q looks looks to be unlukiest for Men, as almost all were from Pclass 3.\n\n\n### Filing Embarked NaN\n\nAs we saw that maximum passengers boarded from Port S, we replace NaN with S. \n\n","38cd3012":"Random Forests","6ead00b1":"The classification accuracy can be sometimes misleading due to imbalance. We can get a summarized result with the help of confusion matrix, which shows where did the model go wrong, or which class did the model predict wrong.","f388410f":"**Stochastic Gradient Boosting**\n\nHere too the weak learner is a Decision Tree."}}
