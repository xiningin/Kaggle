We can immediately see that:\n\n- Going to\/from airports results in on-average more expensive fares. (also see https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/breemen\/nyc-taxi-fare-data-exploration for an excellent discussion on fixed fare airport taxi fares)\n- Going from the main city centre areas of NY (Midtown, Upper East Side) are generally more expensive.\n- Taxis are far more likely to go to Brooklyn\/Queens then going from it.\n\n# Future work\n\n- Demonstrate that adding cluster labels results in improved models. \n- Provide visual data for cheapest taxi fares as well as the most expensive.","7ceb8b74":"## Combining cluster and fare information.\n\nWe would like to see if there are certain pickup or dropoff locations that are potentially more expensive. To do this, we can start with a heatmap, plotting pickup against dropoff clusters.","a0c6b773":"We can clearly see from the heatmap that there are strips of rows and columns that are more prominent than others. This suggests that certain locations on the map result in more expensive taxi journeys either if you start from these clusters, or finish in these clusters.\n\nLet's take the 4 most expensive cluster areas on average in which to take a taxi journey.","d7279fdd":"## Initial data processsing\n- Filter any rows with missing values\n- Use a bounding box to discard any outliers (Thanks to https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/breemen\/nyc-taxi-fare-data-exploration\/notebook)\n- Filter any negative fare amounts or anything beyond a certain threshold ($200)\n- Filter any journeys with no passengers.\n\nWe split the data into two:\n- One contains solely coordinate data for further manipulation\n- One contains data that would be used for training a model.","cc4f68b9":"# Preparation of data","b3731460":"If we plot it on a map then:\n- Cluster 1 corresponds approximately to the upper east side area of NY\n- Cluster 2 corresponds to JFK airport\n- Cluster 3 corresponds approximately to Midtown in NY\n- Cluster 5 corresponds to LaGuardia airport","d78fb5f6":"## Map plotting\n\nOnce we have generated the clusters we can then plot this against a NYC map defined by `BB` boundaries (the image itself is obtained from img export in open street map)\n\nInterestingly, there seem to be clusters for the dropoff coordinates that are centered around Brooklyn and Queens that are not present in the pickup coordinates. Assuming this isn't a bias in the way the data has been collected, it suggests that people are more likely to call a taxi to get them back to the suburbs, but are less likely to start a journey from there.","65c4df91":"We can also do the same with dropoff areas:\n\n- Cluster 1 corresponds approximately La Guardia airport and the surrounding brooklyn area\n- Cluster 3 corresponds to JFK airport\n- Cluster 8 corresponds approximately to Newark airport\n- Cluster 12 corresponds to south brooklyn (around the NY aquarium area) [see here](https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Upper+East+Side,+New+York,+NY,+USA\/@40.6023071,-74.001599,13z\/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258bf08488f6b:0x618706a9142daa0d!8m2!3d40.7735649!4d-73.9565551)","e8a62662":"# Finding fare hotspots using KMeans Clustering\n\nThis aim of this kernel is to use KMeans to divide up the coordinate information present in the data set into clusters.
