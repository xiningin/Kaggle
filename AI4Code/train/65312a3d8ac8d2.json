North York has second heighest number of Italian restaurants present. Looking at the nearby venues, the optimum place to put a new Italian Restaurant is in Victoria village,North York(cluster-1) as their are many Neighborhoods in that area but a little number of Italian Restaurants therefore, eliminating any competition.The second best Neighborhoods that have a great oppurtunity would be in areas such as Queen's Park which is in Cluster 4.Having 70 neighborhoods in the area with no Italian Restaurants gives a good oppurtunity for opening up a new restaurant. This concludes the optimal findings for this project and recommends the entrepreneur to open an authentic Italian restaurant in these locations with little to no competition. Nonetheless, if the food is authentic, affordable and good taste, I am confident that it will have great following everywhere.\n\n**Here we take an Italian Restaurant as an example. We can do the same process to find the best place or neighborhood**\n- to open a start up company \n- to stay on rent for bachelors\n- to start a side business for middle class people\n- to open a camp for any kind of servey\n- to release a new product for checking the success rate\n  ","7fba7959":"Lets check how many venues are there per neighborhood","ac91239c":"Now  data is cleaned and all the requirements are met.
