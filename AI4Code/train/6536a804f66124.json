Out of the 9 features 8 are independent variables and 1 is a dependent variable.\n#### Variables :-\n* Serial Number \n* GRE Scores ( out of 340 ) \n* TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )\n* University Rating ( out of 5 ) \n* Statement of Purpose (SOP) and Letter of Recommendation(LOR) Strength ( out of 5 )\n* Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 ) \n* Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 ) \n* Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 ) (**Dependent Variable**)\n\n## Before moving ahead with the analysis it is always a great move to get  a proper understanding about the domain we are dealing with.\n\n### What are GRE and TOEFL ?\nThe GRE is a graduate school entrance exam while the TOEFL is a test of your English language skills. Schools want to see GRE scores to make sure you can handle graduate-level coursework, and they want to see TOEFL scores to make sure your English skills are strong enough to do well at an English-speaking school. \n\n### What is Letter of recommendation (LOR) ? \nA \"letter of recommendation\" is required explicitly by an academic programme and should be sent directly to the university by the professor or employer without you seeing it. The document should be 300-400 words long and should present your character, accomplishments and abilities from an objective perspective.\n\n### What is Statement of purpose (SOP) ?\nAn SOP is a long essay that is often asked by universities abroad. Usually about 1000 words, this essay seeks to understand the candidate\u2019s life, the motivations for the chosen career path and his\/her goals. There are many elements to a Statement of Purpose or an SOP as it is famously referred to. The Universities could ask question-based essays or simply to present your statement of purpose. Until and unless categorically asked, an SOP must include your goals, the career path you have taken up so far as well as your academic progress. Other elements that are further important to the SOP are also the personal motivations that lead you to choose the university\/course you have applied to as well as how you intend to use that experience to achieve that goal.\n\nLets start with the analysis.\n\n**Note : I wont explain too much what the graphs are trying to convey, cause most of the graphs are simple to understand and self explanatory.**","d2b7f2d2":"> We can see that most of the students have more than 0.50 probability that they will get an  opportunity to study abroad. But if you think logicaly is getting probability more than 0.50  okay ? No, it is not. According to me if the chance of admit is more than 0.80 , then the student is on a more safer side that he or she will get an opportunity to perceive masters from abroad. Because it is not easy to get into a foreign university . If a student has probability between 0.50 to 0.79 , you may get admission in a foreign university or you may not.","65f6b417":"### Data types of each variables :","79503b2c":"## Chance of admit according to SOP and LOR","b5feb528":"> **There are three variables which highly correlate with ' CHANCE OF ADMIT ' :**\n* CGPA (0.88)\n* GRE Score (0.81)\n* TOEFL Score (0.79)\n\n > If you notice one pattern in this , CGPA plays a more important role than GRE score and TOEFL score .\n CGPA is not just a number,  CGPA can tell how excellent or how consistent a student is in studies and how  well will the student perform in future. Thats the reason people with CGPA more than 8 tend to score good in GRE ad TOEFL, we will analyse this futher. \n \n > Note one more thing a student preparing to study MS abroad first has to study hard to get a good CGPA , then prepare for GRE to get better score and then finally prepare for TOEFL. This is the most common procedure students follow.\n \n > There is a simple logic behined this small but very important and useful observation. CGPA is the overall aggregate of GPA of every semester. To get a CGPA above 8 or 8 a student has to perform well in every semester consistent. Even if a student performs bad in any of the semesters it will directly affect the CGPA .
