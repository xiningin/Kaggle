Note that:\n- The filepath to the dataset is stored as `museum_filepath`.  Please **do not** change the provided value of the filepath.\n- The name of the column to use as row labels is `\"Date\"`.  (This can be seen in cell A1 when the file is opened in Excel.)\n\nTo help with this, you may find it useful to revisit some relevant code from the tutorial, which we have pasted below:\n\n```python\n# Path of the file to read\nspotify_filepath = \"..\/input\/spotify.csv\"\n\n# Read the file into a variable spotify_data\nspotify_data = pd.read_csv(spotify_filepath, index_col=\"Date\", parse_dates=True)\n```\n\nThe code you need to write now looks very similar!","088a42e3":"## Step 4: Assess seasonality\n\nWhen meeting with the employees at Avila Adobe, you hear that one major pain point is that the number of museum visitors varies greatly with the seasons, with low seasons (when the employees are perfectly staffed and happy) and also high seasons (when the employees are understaffed and stressed).  You realize that if you can predict these high and low seasons, you can plan ahead to hire some additional seasonal employees to help out with the extra work.\n\n#### Part A\nCreate a line chart that shows how the number of visitors to Avila Adobe has evolved over time.  (_If your code returns an error, the first thing that you should check is that you've spelled the name of the column correctly!  You must write the name of the column exactly as it appears in the dataset._)","bef5bd19":"In this exercise, you will use your new knowledge to propose a solution to a real-world scenario. To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **line charts** to understand patterns in the data.\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou have recently been hired to manage the museums in the City of Los Angeles. Your first project focuses on the four museums pictured in the images below.\n\n![ex1_museums](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pFYL8J1.png)\n\nYou will leverage data from the Los Angeles [Data Portal](https:\/\/data.lacity.org\/) that tracks monthly visitors to each museum.  \n\n![ex1_xlsx](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mGWYlym.png)\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.","1b1182ac":"## Step 2: Review the data\n\nUse a Python command to print the last 5 rows of the data.","ee44144a":"The last row (for `2018-11-01`) tracks the number of visitors to each museum in November 2018, the next-to-last row (for `2018-10-01`) tracks the number of visitors to each museum in October 2018, _and so on_.\n\nUse the last 5 rows of the data to answer the questions below.","45cc5062":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

The other museums think these types of events aren't that important, and budgets should be split purely based on recent visitors on an average day.  \n\nTo show the museum board how the event compared to regular traffic at each museum, create a line chart that shows how the number of visitors to each museum evolved over time.  Your figure should have four lines (one for each museum).\n\n> **(Optional) Note**: If you have some prior experience with plotting figures in Python, you might be familiar with the `plt.show()` command.  If you decide to use this command, please place it **after** the line of code that checks your answer (in this case, place it after `step_3.check()` below) -- otherwise, the checking code will return an error!"}}
