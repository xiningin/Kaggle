Say you got a DICOM CT Image. When you read the value of (0020,0037) good chances it will be 1\\0\\0\\0\\1\\0. The X vector is (1,0,0) meaning it is exactly directed with the image pixel matrix row direction and the Y vector is (0,1,0) meaning it is exactly directed with the image pixel matrix column direction.\n\nThe following pictures explains what this means:\n\n![Image+Orientation+Patient](https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-9VxCJQKbXrA\/UbER-byXv6I\/AAAAAAAAOT8\/8_vqt_g-ZzQ\/s1600\/Image+Orientation+Patient.png)\n\nWhat we have here is the pixel data matrix in black. On the top left is pixel (0,0) and at the bottom right, pixel (512, 512) (please forgive me that the pixels are not square. It's OK in DICOM). So That's the image. Now we have the patient coordinate system in Red. So the coordinate system of the image is exactly in the same direction of the coordinate system of the patient. The image plane is parallel to the patient Axial Plane. So now we can put the letters. R at the begging of X axis, L at the end of the X Axis, A at the beginning of Y Axis and P at the end of Y Axis.\n\n[6].
