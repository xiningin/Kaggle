This can be explained by: [the lack of mental-health services within primary care, the burden of cost barriers, and the lack of alternative workforce models that specialize specifically in mental health\/mental therapy.](https:\/\/www.commonwealthfund.org\/publications\/issue-briefs\/2020\/may\/mental-health-conditions-substance-use-comparing-us-other-countries)","c32c18c2":"The first thing I notice is that the column, HDI for year, has many NaN values.","8814003f":"**What countries have the highest number of reported suicides?**","3cd93708":"***Japan***","c03df88c":"***United States***","f5a8094d":"I have created a new column that categorized each country to their geographic region.\n","1cf847bd":"*Lithuania*\n\nThe countries with the most recorded suicide rates are: Russia, the United States, and Japan. However, an important factor to consider when analyzing the suicide rates of countries is to understand how many suicides have been recorded out of total population. Surpisingly enough, the United States and Japan did not have any years where their suicide rate was included in the Top 10 countries when accounting total population.\n\nFor now I want to analyze the country that ranks #1 in this category, and that happens to be Lithuania.","eb5bb452":"# Can we develop a clustering model with this data set?\n\nI wanted to see if our data has any significant clusters. I will first evaluate this by inputting country data into a scatterplot.","15e5b971":"**Are there any significant correlations between the number of suicides with the economic status of countries?**","30f77b5d":"**What countries have the lowest number of reported suicides?**","1879d817":"# **An analysis on the suicide rates from 1985 to 2015**#\n\nI have chosen this data because I have a passion for mental health. I want to provide some insight to you and I as to why commiting suicide is more common in countries compared to their geographic\/regional counterpart. \n\nI am no anthropologist, sociologist, psychologist, or economist. However, I have a sense of duty of telling a story with data. All statements and analysis are based on my opinion. \n\nUnpacking suicide data needs to be done carefully. Reasons for commiting suicide are not black and white - it's a combination of the following reasons:\n* Lack of food security\n* Lack of affordable housing \n* Lack of suicide prevention courses in youth\n* Lack of affordable healthcare\n* The stigma of mental illness\n* Lack of community acitivity\n* The lack of mental health care\n* Financial insecurity \n* Lack of policies that protect marginalized groups\n\nThis dataset unfortunately does not have all of the above information in order to paint an accurate picture; however, I will continue to build upon this notebook with more datasets that will complement this dataset. \n\nThank you for reading!","da11ebd2":"***Russia***","10997939":"Unforunately, the data only providies suicide rates for **4 out of the 54** countries within Africa (with Cabo Verde only having 4 entries). I hope at a later date, I will be able to find an updated resource that may provide more of the reported suicide rates within Africa. \n\nAll of the data analysis I will do on the continents will not include Africa as a whole. However, it would be interesting to look at the three countries that have a decent amount of recorded data: Mauritius, Seyechelles, and South Africa.","9084e304":"We only have information of the HDI for the year for only 8364 out of 27,820 data points. I will remove the whole column.","c0b4f813":"**Disclaimer**: I made sure to be conscious of what it means to have a reported suicide. I recognize that there could be many developing countries who do not record all of their suicide rates\/do not have the resources to do so. This might prevent us from realizing that there could be countries who need recognition when conducting similar analytics.\n\nIn addition, it is not my say to define a silverlining in these situations. Every single reported suicide has a story - untold or not. I do not attempt to make light of these numbers. This kernel is used for research purposes only. I will gladly participate in a discussion that discusses mental health in a deeper manner. ","4f0c35f9":"There is somewhat a positive correlation. However, we must continue to analyze this correlation more closely.","f69af778":"# Conclusion\n\nAs guessed, the kmeans model did not show any obvious clusters within the scatterplot. I will contitnue to build upon this dataset, but for now I will leave it as it is. Thank you for reading and please let me know if there are any problems within my kernel. \n\nI hope we can continue to utilize data for good causes such as this one. I am hoping you as a reader learned something from this kernel because I definitely did. I will continue to build kernels that tell a story. Let me know if there is anything you would like to see from me!"}}
