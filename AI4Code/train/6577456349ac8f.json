It is almost always preferable to have at least a little bit of\nregularization, so generally you should avoid plain Linear Regression. Ridge is a good\ndefault, but if you suspect that only a few features are useful, you should prefer Lasso\nor Elastic Net because they tend to reduce the useless features\u2019 weights down to zero,\nas we have discussed. In general, Elastic Net is preferred over Lasso because Lasso \nmay behave erratically when the number of features is greater than the number of\ntraining instances or when several features are strongly correlated."}}
