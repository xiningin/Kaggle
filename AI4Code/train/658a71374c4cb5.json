The Boxplot contains 3 lines corresponding to 25th percentile, 50th percentile and 75th percentile. 25th percentile means 25% of the points have value less than the particular value. We can use it for an approximate calculation of error.","f4409136":"## Summary\n<br> From the above plots, we can tell that there is a fair degree of overlap between the patients.\n<br> But by observing the plots, we can tell that axil_nodes feature has more importance than the other two features in classifying the data.\n<br>  If the axil_nodes are greater than 50 then the point will fall under the survival status=2","fafd861c":"##  The shape of data:\nData has 4 features as we already saw\n<br> There are 305 datapoints or vectors present.","c8281c59":"## Observations:\nIn the plot of age, we can see that 100% of the points from the survival feature have the value of age less than approx. 75\nSimilarly we can safely deduct that if the axil_nodes are greater than 50 then the point will fall under the survival status=2","a3f764d7":"# Pair Plots\nPair plots doesn't work if the dimensionality of the data is high even though they are good for low dimensionality data. The total number of plots we get are nc2 which is a really high number if we have a 100 dimensions. Going through those many plots and observing the structure of the data will take up a lot of time. This is drawback in using pair plots.","7ea17f14":"## PDF(Probability Density Function), CDF(Cumulative density function)\nPDF tells us what the probability of a new point falling in a particular range of values is. \nCDF tell us what percentage of points are less than a particular value of feature. \nuseful scenario: \nIn companies which make deliveries we can tell what percenatge of customers are getting deliveries in 5 days or 2 days. By this we can analyze how to increase efficiency. \nIntegration of pdf is cdf and differentiation of cdf is pdf.","cf061c4e":"## Observation\nFrom the above graphs we can tell that there is a fair degree of overlap between the patients. So even by taking a combination of any of the two features we cannot linearly separate the two category of patients. \n<br> But by observing the plots, we can axil_nodes feature have more importance than the other two features in classifying the data","067c472f":"## UniVariate Analysis\nYou can use pdf, cdf, boxplot and violin plots to do analysis on a single feature to find out which feature is essential for classification. \nAnalysis done on a single feature is called Univariate Analysis where as on two features is called Bivariate Analysis. \nIf you are doing analysis on more than two variables, it is called Multivariate analysis.","8fcc60da":"# About Dataset:\n## Attributes:\n1.

So we can partly separate the data using axil_nodes feature."}}
