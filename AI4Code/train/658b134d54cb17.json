Find which book genre that was most likely bought by the users.","cd281814":"First we will display the top books based on reviews.","dcad89b4":"We can see that the dataset contains 550 rows and 7 columns. Furthermore, we can display the types of data for each column in the dataset.","66f75c55":"Then, we will use pandas to view the first five rows of the dataset.","d7a83423":"From the table above we can see that the oldest book was The Last Olympian, Breaking Dawn, Eat This, Not That!, Good to Great, and Sookie Stackhouse. On the other hand, the newest book in the dataset was You Are a Badasss, School Zone, The Wonderful Things You Will Be, P is for Potty!, and Girl, Was Your Face.","7f4a14c3":"First, we will use heatmap to check whether the dataset has missing values or not.","4d41f3b4":"In the subsequent step, we will display the unique value of each categorical data using the code below.","00568210":"1. The cheapest book are Frozen (Little Golden Book), The Constitution of the United States, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck, Book 8.\n2. The most expensieve book was  Diagnostic and Statistic Manual which was wrotten by American Psychiatric Association.\n3. The book that has higher reviews was Where the Crawdads Sing, which was wroten by Delia ownes.\n4. The book that has higher user was The Magnolia Story and Dog Man series, which was wrotten by Chip Gaines and Dav Pilkey respectively.\n5. The book genre that was most likely bought by the users was Nonfiction books.","2f8a0575":"# Business Understanding","a7b3ef04":"Moreover, we can also display the descriptive statistics too.","4ae35be4":"We can see that the book which has the lowest user rating was The Casual Vacany which was wrotten by J.K.

All the five chart experienced a fluctuation.\n2. Although Fiction book price was higher than Nonfiction book price in the beginning of the period, however, Non Fiction book price was lessen than Fiction Book Price in the next period.\n3. Although Fiction book has smaller reviews than Nonfiction book in 2018, however, it has higher reviews than Nonfiction books throughout the entire period.\n4. Although Fiction book has smaller user rating than Nonfiction book in 2012, however, it has higher user rating than Nonfiction books throughout the entire period.","59c6b9e1":"First we will import the library and the dataset.","ec2239be":"Lastly we will use a heatmap of correlation plot to check the relationship of the numerical variabe in the dataset.","34977124":"From the table above we can see that the book which has the higherst reviews was Where the Crawdads Sing, which was wroten by Delia ownes.
