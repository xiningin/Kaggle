Started  \nFirst, let's import the relevant libraries and the raw UFC data.","7b8becf6":"# Conclusion\nWell I hope you enjoyed this exploration with me. I was surprised to see that fighter efficiency depended so much on fighters' styles and that the importance of adjusted efficiency seems to be greater for heavier fighters than for smaller ones.  With this simple metric it is easy to compare fighters from different eras, genders, weightclasses, and styles. Even though efficiency clearly isn't everything, it is a fun talking point when chatting with your friends about who is a better fighter.  :-P","28c8ab16":"# How have fighting styles changed over the history of the UFC?  \nWe see that there have been pretty significant changes in how fighters approach the fightgame since the UFC began.  In the early days of the UFC, the ground game made up a big part of fighters' styles. In the early 1990s, nearly 40% of attacks were ground attacks. But as the game has evolved, fighters have increasingly become reliant on distance striking. Takedowns, have never dominated at any point, but this is to be expected, as you need way fewer takedowns to accomplish your ultimate goal of finishing a fight. Just one could be enough. The proportion of fighters incorporating clinch strikes has remained fairly constant since the 1990s.  \n\nJust from this graph we can see that comparing efficiency across time has some problems, since fighting styles have changed pretty significantly over the past few decades.","0808e1c5":"### Turning the wide dataframe of fights into a long dataframe of fighters\nWe see that the dataframe is in a wide format grouped by each fight, with the Red and Blue corner fighters having their fight stats in columns denoted by 'R_' and 'B_', respectively.  I am going to take the information for red and blue fighters separately, and create a new long dataframe with the stats for every UFC fight for each fighter. In that process, I will also have to work with the raw data to identify the fighter's weightclass, gender, if they won the given fight, and eliminate the precalculated percentage columns, because I want to calculate those more precisely myself. In order to combine all of the fighters into one long dataframe, I will also need to trim the 'R_' and 'B_' prefixes from the columns.","a5ef1c75":"# How does fighting style affect a fighter's total efficiency?  \nNow, let's plot a fighter's total efficiency against the proportion of total attacks for each attack type to get an idea of how total efficiency may be affected by a fighter's fighting style.  \n\nTakedowns don't seem to be related all too much to total efficiency, but like I mentioned earlier, takedowns only make up a small portion of the game in terms of a fighter's total attacks.  For the three striking categories, there is a pretty clear relationship between efficiency and how much a fighter commits to one of those categories. For distance strikes, fighters who attempt a greater proportion of their attacks from range tend to also be less efficient. There is a fairly strong negative correlation ($\\rho$ = -0.53) between the proporiton of distance strikes and total efficiency. That isn't too surprising, because these attacks will also have a greater volume to compensate for the loss of efficiency and they may also be a bit 'safer', since it will be harder for a fighter to get badly hurt or submitted from distance vs. in the clinch or on the ground.  \n\nFighters who attempt more attacks on the ground or in the clinch are far more efficient, but they are also more vulnerable to takedowns or submissions, and we see a moderately strong ***positive*** relationship between efficiency and the proportion of attacks in the clinch ($\\rho$ = 0.47) or on the ground ($\\rho$ = 0.39).  \n\nSo it is pretty clear that if we want to compare fighters, we need to adjust how we calculate efficiency by accounting for fighting style.","d416e86c":"# Calculating Adjusted Efficiency  \nTo account for the differences in fighting styles, I am going to basically 'reweight' the contribution of each fighter's attempts from each attack type to the same standard.  In this case, I am going to reweight the number of attempts by the median proportion of those attempts for all fighters who ever fought at least three fights on UFC roster.  So, in this case, the median proportion of attacks from Distance were 0.780193. If a fighter was less prone to distance striking, and only attempted 50% of his attacks from distance, his new adjusted efficiency would be reweighted with 0.780193 instead of 0.50, etc. After reweighting each attack success rate, these are then summed up to give us the fighters' adjusted efficiency.","f1fb8da0":"### Unadjusted Efficiency  \nFirst, I will calculate all fighters' unadjusted efficiency as:  \n***Fighter Efficiency = ((Takedowns + Distance Strikes + Clinch Strikes + Ground Strikes) \/ (Takedown Attempts + Distance Attempts + Clinch Attempts + Ground Attempts)) x 100 ***  \n\nNaturally, this is a weighted average. So, fighters' total efficiency will be affected by the proportion of their attacks of a certain type. So, fighters who attempt more takedowns will have their total efficiency more influenced by takedown attempts compared to a fighter who attempts few takedowns, for example.  \n\nThen, I will identify the proportion of each attack type of the total attacks for each fighter, and will also identify the year a fighter entered into the UFC.  \n\nAfter that, I no longer need all of these rows, and will only keep one row per fighter.\n","19a0f010":"### Retaining Fighters with at least three fights  \nNow, with the new long dataframe, I am going to split the attack columns into attempts and successes. When fighters had no attempts of a given type, their values are filled with zeros. Then, I will reduce the width of the dataframe by only keeping features that are relevant to the calculations and comparisons.","ca79636e":"# How important is efficiency in different weightclasses?\nHere, I wanted to see how the champions compare to their respective weightclasses in terms of adjusted efficiency.  Basically, I wanted to see if champions are more efficient versus the rest of their division and if this is related to the weight they fight at. The challenge here, is that women have fewer weight classes, with the top weight class being Featherweight. So even though featherweight is one of the smaller weight classes for men, it is the heaviest for women.  So I reconstructed a new relative weight class measure that takes gender into account, so that I can get an idea when comparing ALL fighters, how the gap between champions and the rest of the weight class varies according to weight.  \n\nThe results were pretty interesting. It seems that the heavier the weight class, the larger the efficiency gap is between the champions and the rest.  For the smaller divisions (flyweight, bantamweight, and featherweight) there is basically no difference in the adjuste efficiency of the champions and median fighter. But when we get up to Light Heavyweight, we see that Jon Jones is almost 30% more efficient than the median of the division. This might be because of the inherent differences in conditioning between the weight classes.  Typically, the heavier fighters are more powerful, but have less stamina than lighter fighters. In that case, there is a premium to being highly efficient.  For the lighter weight classes, higher stamina allows even good fighters the opportunity to be less efficient but to have a higher output. And we can expect that the opponents of the champions in the smaller weight classes may also be more mobile (and therefore harder to land on), which could play a role in these numbers too. ","ed1350bb":"# Introduction\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a measure of fighter efficiency that can be compared over time and between fighters. Fighter efficiency can be thought of as the percentage of a fighter's attacks that are successful, and these will include attacks of all types (i.e. standing up, on the ground, in the clinch, and takedowns). The problem is, if we only calculate fighter efficiency as the sum of attacks of all types divided by the sum of attempts of all types, we won't be able to easily compare these across fighters. That is because different fighters have different fighting styles. Some of them rely more on takedowns and ground and pound, which tend tend to have relatively higher success rates, while others rely more on standup attacks, which have lower success rates, but higher volume. So, the goal here is to put forward a measure that can be used to standardize for this fact.","b7f6ca0a":"# How do the current champions stack up against the rest?  \nOn the whole, the champions have adjusted efficiencies above the median efficiency for the UFC, but they are by no means the most highly efficient fighters in terms of attack accuracy. They do seem to combine attack styles in a way, though, that can make them more successful overall. Most of the current champions do not rely too heavily on distance striking (most were at or below the median for proportion of distance attacks). And most of them place a greater emphasis on ground attacks than the median fighter, which probably allows them to finish more fights. When it comes to clinch attacks and takedowns, though, the current champions tend to be fairly typical in terms of how much emphasis they place on those attacks.","809a1a94":"# Comparing Unadjusted and Adjusted Attack Efficiency  \nWe see that the unadjusted efficiency rates are fairly close to the adjusted ones, but there is a pretty significant amount of variation. The median difference in unadjusted versus adjusted efficiency was only 0.7 percentage points, but there is a decent spread here. At the extremes, we see that one fighters' unadjusted efficiency was overestimated by about 10 percentage points and another's was underestimated by nearly 20 percentage points!","b7805e58":"# Time to Calculate Fighter Efficiency  "}}
