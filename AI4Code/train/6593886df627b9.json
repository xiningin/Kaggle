By slicing up the data and making use of visualizations, we were able to answer these questions.\n\nFrom our analysis we found:\n- The overall rate of adverse events more than **halved** from *2005-2015*.\n- **Perioperative Hemorrhage \/ Hematoma** and **Accidental Puncture \/ Laceration** are the events occuring most commonly from our data.\n- **Lake County** has the highest count of events per 100K population from our data.","8f3f5402":"By making use of the animation, we can quickly visualize how the adverse event rate per county has changed over our time period. The animation bar can also be used as a slider to focus on each year by itself. Again, this can be an overwhelming chart when all counties are selected, but if we isolate certain counties of interest it becomes useful.","42e45b5e":"Immediately we can see the counties that have the highest total obs rate over the 10 year span that we were given in the data. **Lake County** especially is an outlier from the rest of the state. Let's look at this by year in a line plot and see if we can spot it and others as an outlier.","be123de6":"This plot is easier to look at and quickly take in the data compared to our Plotly map. We can easily see where the event rate is higher in the country over the 10-year span and where there is a lower incident rate. However, it does lack the ability of being able to look at particular years and focusing on certain counties.\n\nI did also take the time to animate this map by creating a gif outside of the notebook. You can see how the rate of adverse events have dropped in the state from the link below.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/N0e9ApS","460bf65e":"This may seem too chaotic at a glance - but with  Plotly we can isolate our highest counties in the previous graph *or* compare specific counties we're interested in to the **Statewide** numbers, then we can begin to see trends in the data.","ea562a0b":"# Adverse Hospital Events in California:\nThis dataset comes from California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). It contains data collected on 7 adverse events that can occur during hospitalization:\nretained surgical item or unretrieved device fragment, iatrogenic pneumothorax, central venous catheter-related blood stream infection, postoperative wound dehiscence, accidental puncture or laceration, transfusion reaction, and perioperative hemorrhage or hematoma.\n\nWe will be slicing this data in 3 ways to be able to analyze it.\n\n**1. High-Level Statewide View**\n\n**2. Analysis by Counties**\n\n**3.

This shows the count per 100,000 population, and will help us to better see counties where more adverse events are occuring per population. Otherwise high-population counties like *Los Angeles* would appear as higher on our totals although their rate might be lower.","74b94155":"# Mapping County Event Rates:\nNow that we've done some detailed analyses of our data, let's put what we've found on a map to further visualize the distribution of these events within the state.","d387f3e2":"# County Analysis:\nNow that we have a good knowledge of our data as a whole, we will dig in to the numbers further and uncover what counties are driving the events for the state.","585c9a01":"# Statewide Analysis:\n\nFirst, we'll begin with some high-level statewide analysis to get a grasp on the total rate of these events in California.","c991a823":"From later analysis it was discovered Alpine and Sierra (the two lowest populated counties in California) have missing data in certain years.
