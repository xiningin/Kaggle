number of samples and\n        n_features is the number of features.\n\n    y : array-like, shape (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_features), optional\n        Target relative to X for classification or regression;\n        None for unsupervised learning.\n\n    axes : array of 3 axes, optional (default=None)\n        Axes to use for plotting the curves.\n\n    ylim : tuple, shape (ymin, ymax), optional\n        Defines minimum and maximum yvalues plotted.\n\n    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional\n        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.\n        Possible inputs for cv are:\n\n          - None, to use the default 5-fold cross-validation,\n          - integer, to specify the number of folds.\n          - :term:`CV splitter`,\n          - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.\n\n        For integer\/None inputs, if ``y`` is binary or multiclass,\n        :class:`StratifiedKFold` used. If the estimator is not a classifier\n        or if ``y`` is neither binary nor multiclass, :class:`KFold` is used.\n\n        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various\n        cross-validators that can be used here.\n\n    train_sizes : array-like, shape (n_ticks,), dtype float or int\n        Relative or absolute numbers of training examples that will be used to\n        generate the learning curve. If the dtype is float, it is regarded as a\n        fraction of the maximum size of the training set (that is determined\n        by the selected validation method), i.e. it has to be within (0, 1].\n        Otherwise it is interpreted as absolute sizes of the training sets.\n        Note that for classification the number of samples usually have to\n        be big enough to contain at least one

The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each so-called boosting iteration consist of applying N weights to each of the training samples. Initially, those weights are all set to 1\/N, so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted data. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence.
