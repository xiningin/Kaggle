All news are not real, right? So how will you detect the fake news? The answer is Python. By practicing this advanced python project of detecting fake news, you will easily make a difference between real and fake news. Before moving ahead in this advanced Python project, get aware of the terms related to it like fake news, **tfidfvectorizer, PassiveAggressive Classifier.**\n\n![](https:\/\/rsf.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/rsf_full\/public\/fake-news-dz.png?itok=sa-knSuC&timestamp=1587642210)","b15fed01":"## 4) Split the dataset into training and testing sets.","6ce8d0fa":"## 3) get the labels from the DataFrame.","39c7f8aa":"# Steps 1 for detecting fake news with Python\n\n\n## 1) Make necessary imports:","289fcc4e":"## 5) initialize a TfidfVectorizer","7bb8b5a4":"#### Next, we\u2019ll initialize a PassiveAggressiveClassifier.

Stop words are the most common words in a language that are to be filtered out before processing the natural language data. And a TfidfVectorizer turns a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features. Now, fit and transform the vectorizer on the train set, and transform the vectorizer on the test set.","bbda7c56":"### The Dataset\nThe dataset we\u2019ll use for this python project- we\u2019ll call it news.csv. This dataset has a shape of 7796\u00d74. The first column identifies the news, the second and third are the title and text, and the fourth column has labels denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE.

We took a political dataset, implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model.

This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and\/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.\n\n### B) What is a TfidfVectorizer?\n\n#### TF:\n(Term Frequency): The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency. A higher value means a term appears more often than others, and so, the document is a good match when the term is part of the search terms.\n\n#### IDF \n(Inverse Document Frequency): Words that occur many times a document, but also occur many times in many others, may be irrelevant. IDF is a measure of how significant a term is in the entire corpus.\n\nThe TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.\n\n### C) What is a PassiveAggressiveClassifier?\nPassive Aggressive algorithms are online learning algorithms. Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification outcome, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting. Unlike most other algorithms, it does not converge. Its purpose is to make updates that correct the loss, causing very little change in the norm of the weight vector."}}
