Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity of its syntax (with some going as far as to call it \"executable pseudocode\").\nNote how we indicated which code belongs to the if. \"But I don't want ANY spam!\" is only supposed to be printed if spam_amount is positive.\nBut the later code (like print(viking_song)) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?\n\nThe colon (:) at the end of the if line indicates that a new \"code block\" is coming up. Subsequent lines which are indented (beginning with an extra 4 spaces) are part of that code block. You may be familiar with other languages which use {curly braces} to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace often is surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks.\n\nThe later lines dealing with viking_song are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the if's code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we start defining functions and using loops.\n\nThis code snippet is also our first sighting of a string in Python:","ef489d32":"Or maybe the help() function can tell us something about it.","e5bc6340":"# Conditionals\nWhile useful enough in their own right, booleans really start to shine when combined with conditional statements, using the keywords if, elif, and else.\n\nConditional statements, often referred to as if-then statements, allow the programmer to execute certain pieces of code depending on some Boolean condition.
