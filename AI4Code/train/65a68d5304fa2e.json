Quiet an Achievement!","a7b20810":"### We could find that there are text of many possible languages. With this dataset atleast, there are features\/tags with which we can distinquish this. Say for Example: - Lang_abv and Language helps us understand this here, but this won't be the case every time. <br>\n### We might be having the text data coming in without any Language Tags and probably there is a need to bucket and segregate it as well. For this, there is a need to detect the language at the first place which can  be done with the help of spacy and spacy-langdetect which is a fully customizable language detection pipeline for spaCy","d8370c25":"So our simple function was able to detect the detect whether each text is on English Language or not. Same logic can be applied if you wanted to check for any other language and based out of the boolean output you can segregate the text data."}}
