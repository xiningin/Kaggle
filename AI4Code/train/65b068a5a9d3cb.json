Your submissions usually have two columns: an ID column and a prediction column. The ID field comes from the test data (keeping whatever name the ID field had in that data, which for the data is the string 'Id'). The prediction column will use the name of the target field.\n\nWe will create a DataFrame with this data, and then use the dataframe's to_csv method to write our submission file. Explicitly include the argument index=False to prevent pandas from adding another column in our csv file.","fbfddfc3":"Example below of how the output would look once published","a257c49d":"\n### Make Submission\nHit the blue Publish button at the top of your notebook screen.
