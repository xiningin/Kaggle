This is a cool indicator that can be useful, but it doesn't tell the exact truth : is Messi better than Ronaldo in front of the goal? This kind of indicator isn't enough to say so.\n\nIn fact, this ratio lacks a decisive element : the difficulty of the shots taken. We can pretend that Messi has good teammates that do all the job for him and allow him to only score taps-in, while Ronaldo has to take harder shots, and thus has a lower ratio of goals\/shot.\n\nThat's why we need another way of evaluating the performances of a striker : the **Expected Goals** (xG) are the perfect indicator for that.\n\nThe objective of the xG is to give a value to each shot, between 0 and 1. With a value of 0, the shot has almost no chance to go into the net, while with a value of 1 the shot is unmissable.
