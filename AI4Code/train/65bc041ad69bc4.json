Duration of shows is very different for TV shows vs Movies. The US has the longest duration since it has the most TV shows.\n1. India has the smallest duration since it watches mostly movies on Netflix.\n1. US watches more movies and dramas while UK watches more British TV shows (no surprise!) while Korea watches Romantic and Comedies TV shows. \n\nThere is so much more to add but I am sure you get the picture.\n","f60aa1ac":"# Now let us see what charts we can get from AutoViz","a1a9fefe":"Hope you enjoyed this notebook.
