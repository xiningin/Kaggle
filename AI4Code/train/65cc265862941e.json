As with most things though, the earlier you catch potential poop problems, the better it will be for you and your dog. So going to the bathroom \u201ctogether\u201d with your dog \u2013 i.e., not just letting them out in the yard to do their business on their own \u2013 is an important opportunity for you to keep an eye on your dog\u2019s \u201cinner workings\u201d and pick up on what they might be trying to tell you. https:\/\/www.preventivevet.com\/dogs\/what-dogs-poo-can-tell-you-about-their-health","c8896c62":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata @mpwolke"}}
