(Attain best Reach to Conversion ratios\/Click to Conversion ratios)**\n\n *Since highest conversion rate was attained in campaign_c, we can consider the factors contributed in this campaign:*\n\n* The number of ad counts should be more for better reach.\n\n* The age group of 30-34 should be the main aim.\n\n* People with interest types after 100 should be given more attention\n\n* More the number of times the add is shown i.e. \"impression\", more approved_conversion rate is achieved.\n\n**2)Finding the perfect target demographics with the appropriate clickthrough rates**\n\n* Women tend to buy the product more often after clicking the ad than men.\n* Also the age group 30 to 34 buy the product more often after clicking the ad\n\n**3)Understanding the ideal turnaround\/decision making time per age group to convert and retarget future social campaigns**\n\n* Age group 30-34 tend to take less decision making time followed by 35 to 39 and 40-44. \n* Age group 45-49 take the most time to decide.\n\n**4)Comparing the individual campaign performance so the best creative\/campaign can be run again with adjusted audiences.**\n\n* clearly campaign 1178 wins the battle due to highest approved_conversion rate.\n* Also campaig 916 does pretty well , considering the number of ads it involves. With less no of ads, it has managed to peform better than campaign 936 with large no of ads.","fc274ed0":"   # **Sales conversion optimizaton by analysing Facebook Ad-campaingn**"}}
