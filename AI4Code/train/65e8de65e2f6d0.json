The main role of ACE2 is the degradation of Ang II resulting in the formation of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) which opposes the actions of Ang II. Increased Ang II levels are thought to upregulate ACE2 activity, and in ACE2 deficient mice Ang II levels are approximately double that of wild-type mice, whilst Ang 1-7 levels are almost undetectable. Thus, ACE2 plays a crucial role in the RAS because it opposes the actions of Ang II. Consequently, it has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease where its expression is decreased. Not surprisingly, current therapeutic strategies for ACE2 involve augmenting its expression using ACE2 adenoviruses, recombinant ACE2 or compounds in these diseases thereby affording some organ protection. ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein [8] that is expressed and active in most tissues. The highest expression of ACE2 is observed in the kidney, the endothelium, the lungs, and in the heart [2, 8] . The extracellular domain of ACE2 enzyme contains a single catalytic metallopeptidase unit that shares 42% sequence identity and 61% sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of ACE [2].\n\n**Ranked Labels**\n1. ACE protein, human\n  * CUI: C1452534\n  * score: 2.068973\n2. angiotensin converting enzyme 2\n  * CUI: C0960880\n  * score: 1.985163\n3. Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A\n  * CUI: C0022709\n  * score: 1.798690\n4. Angiotensin converting enzyme measurement\n  * CUI: C0201888\n  * score: 1.746387\n---\n\n## How?\nFirst, I apply the [UMLS](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unified_Medical_Language_System) linking alpha feature available in SpaCy\/scispacy to the abstracts in the dataset. Then, I compute the tf-idf scores for each term in each document. Lastly, I provide a ranked list of UMLS labels for each document, saved in a CSV.\n\n## Approaches Used\nThe scispacy UMLS linking alpha feature as described [here](https:\/\/github.com\/allenai\/scispacy#umlsentitylinker-alpha-feature). The tf-idf approach is modeled after the scikit-learn TfidfTransformer class [here](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/feature_extraction.html#tfidf-term-weighting)\n\n## Outcome\nFor each document with an abstract, a set of ranked labels from the UMLS controlled vocabulary is provided. From these, experts can review which labels are correct, incorrect, or missing. Participants can also filter using the labels to create subsets of the data that may correspond to particular questions.\n\n## Data Created\n\nThree files are created:\n * `tfidf_named_{date}.csv` contains, for each document:\n   * A list of applied concepts from the UMLS\n   * The term frequency (raw count)\n   * The idf value of the concept within the dataset of abstracts\n   * The tf-idf score for that concept for that document\n * `concepts_{date}.csv` contains, for each concept used in the project:\n   * The identifier (CUI)\n   * The definition (if available)\n   * Raw counts\n   * idf values\n   * Average score throughout the dataset of abstracts\n * `covid_text_{date}.csv` contains, for each document:\n   * Document ID\n   * Title\n   * Abstract\n   * Full text\n\n## Next steps\n* **Engage subject matter experts to ...**\n  * **Review labels and verify their application**\n  * **Edit and improve the labels for the dataset**\n  * **Choose important labels that correspond to questions in the competition**\n* Engage machine learning expertise to take labeled data and begin model creation\n* Work on threshold\/floor for tf-idf scores to automatically avoid misleading labels\n* Use linked data sources for related taxonomies to establish hierarchical relationships between concepts\n* Generate new scores as new documents arrive\n* Generate scores based off of full text\n\n*Please let me know what you think, and don't be afraid to reach out.
