the task questions by utilising a pretrained BERT Question Answer model - [bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad).\n\nThis work is a collaborative effort between [Nick Sorros](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/nsorros), [Antonio Campello](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/campello) and [Liz Gallagher](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/lizgal).\n\n\n## Methodology\n\nFor each question in the task list we find the 5 more relevant 2020 papers to the question text using TFIDF vectors. Next we split up the text from these papers and apply the pretrained model to predict the answer to the question in each of the text chunks. We output the highest scoring answer found. Thus for each question we output the top answer found for each of the 5 most relevant papers.\n\n### Data Filters\n\n1. We only use papers which are from 2020.\n2. We only use English language papers. Languages were predicted by applying the [langdetect](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/langdetect\/) language detection library to the abstract text in the metadata.\n3. We deduplicate any papers which had the same pmcid.\n\n### Evaluation Data\n\nWe have tagged 150 answers (5 from each question) as to whether we though they were the best answer or not the best answer from this paper, or whether the paper was not relevant to this question.\n\nUsing this data we can calculate 2 metrics of how well the model performs on the answers - the relevance and the good answer ratio:\n\nrelevance = `(best_answer + not_best_answer) \/ (best_answer + not_best_answer + not_relevant)`\n\nand\n\nGood answer ratio = `best_answer \/ (best_answer + not_best_answer)`\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Results version 1\n\nData: The data wasn't filtered.\n\nModel: Predictions were made by separating chunks of text by fullstops.\n\n| Task | Number of questions | Relevance | Good answer ratio | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability? | 5 | 65.22% | 40.00 |\n| What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors? | 8 | 85.00% | 52.94 |\n| What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution? | 5 | 52.63% | 10.00 |\n| What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics? | 2 | 70.00% | 57.14 |\n| What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions? | 2 | 85.71% | 66.67 |\n| What has been published about medical care? | 4 | 66.67% | 30.00 |\n| What do we know about diagnostics and surveillance? | 1 | 75.00% | 100.00 |\n| Other interesting questions | 3 | 18.18% | 0.00 |\n\n\n","e499c8a4":"%%bash\npip install -q transformers**","c4bdf2e2":"## Create the QuestionCovid class\n```\nArguments:\n    TOKENIZER: A pretrained BertTokenizer\n    MODEL: A pretrained BertForQuestionAnswering model\n    index2paperID: A dictionary of indexes to the paper id as found from get_data_texts\n    index2paperPath: A dictionary of indexes to the paper pathway as found from get_data_texts\n    data_text: A dictionary of paper ids and the collated body text from them\n    question: A single question to ask the papers\n    \nAttributes:\n    fit: Vectorize the body text from data_text using TFIDF\n    predict: Load the text of the top 5 closest TFIDF vectors of the papers to the question.\n        Split the texts for each of these papers up into chunks of 3 sentences, and predict the\n        answers to the question for each chunk of text using the pretrained BERT QA model.\n        Output the answer with the highest score for each of the 5 closest papers.\n        For each of the 5 closest papers using TFIDF, 'predict' yields:\n        1. the paper id,\n        2. the best answer,\n        3. the BERT QA score,\n        4. the text chunk the answer came from,\n        5. and the cosine similarity between the question and the paper TFIDF vectors. \n```\n\n","721e7182":"## Predict and save the answers to all the task questions\nThis takes up to an hour and will save the answers in '\/kaggle\/working\/answers.jsonl'.","f212bcf0":"## Load the BERT model and fit the QuestionCovid model with the publication texts","5b2774a5":"## Predict the answer to one question using the most relevant paper","340dd80e":"## Add each question from the Kaggle competition tasks list\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/tasks","d1a57ed1":"## Load all the 2020 publication texts\n\n- For any JSON file found in the data location collate all the body text found\n- Create a dictionary of the paper ID and its body text\n- Only include publications in the data which are from 2020 (this has to be done by linking to the metadata.csv file)\n- Create key dictionaries of the index to the paper ID (index2paperID), and the index to publication file pathway (index2paperPath)"}}
