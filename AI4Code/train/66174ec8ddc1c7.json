In this data set, we removed the identifiable information about the school districts. We also used an open source tool [ARX](https:\/\/arx.deidentifier.org\/) [(Prasser et al. 2020)](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1002\/spe.2812) to transform several data fields and reduce the risks of re-identification. For data generalization purposes some data points are released with a range where the actual value falls under. Additionally, there are many missing data marked as 'NaN' indicating that the data was suppressed to maximize anonymization of the dataset. \n\n| Name | Description |\n| :--- | :----------- |\n| district_id | The unique identifier of the school district |\n| state | The state where the district resides in |\n| locale | NCES locale classification that categorizes U.S. territory into four types of areas: City, Suburban, Town, and Rural.
