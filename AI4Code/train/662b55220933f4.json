The resizing is performed by squishing: we avoid cropping since it might miss the tumor location, adding noise to the data.\n\n## 2.

Introduction <a id=0><\/a>\n\nIn modern medicine, neuroimaging provides an essential tool for physicians to diagnose intracranial injuries or diseases, such as tumors. Computer vision\/ML models can be trained to assist medics and radiologists in analyzing patients' scans and their use is becoming more and more widespread. Using fastai we show how to train a convolutional neural network which can identify the presence of a tumor in a brain scan with an accuracy of over 99%.\n\n## 1.

We look at the sizes' distribution in order to choose the correct resize shape.","51892bf0":"We train a residual neural network using the `resnet34` architecture, with cross entropy as loss function. We use *transfer learning*: for the first two epochs we train only the NN head, then we unfreeze the encoder's layers and train all weigths for 8 more epochs. This is done with the `fine_tune` method of fastai's `Learner` class.","44567ef0":"# Brain Tumor Detector with ResNet (using Fastai)\n\n\n\n\n0. [Introduction](#0)\n\n1.
