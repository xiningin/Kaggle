NIV very significantly improves survival, quality of life and cognitive performances.\"\n\n\"The initial NIV settings are simple, but progression of the disease, ventilator dependence and upper airway involvement sometimes make long\u2010term adjustment of NIV more difficult, with a major impact on survival. Unique data concerning the long\u2010term adjustment of NIV in ALS show that correction of leaks, management of obstructive apnoea and adaptation to the patient's degree of ventilator dependence improve the prognosis.\"\n\n\"Non\u2010ventilatory factors also impact the efficacy of NIV and various solutions have been described and must be applied, including cough assist techniques, control of excess salivation and renutrition. NIV in ALS has been considerably improved as a result of application of all of these measures, avoiding the need for tracheostomy in the very great majority of cases. More advanced use of NIV also requires pulmonologists to master the associated end\u2010of\u2010life palliative care, as well as the modalities of discontinuing ventilation when it becomes unreasonable.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/resp.13525","fffa31f4":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">PALLIATIVE CARE AND DISCONTINUATION OF NIV<\/span>**\n\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Dyspnoea and end of life<\/font>\n\n\n\"End of life is accompanied by a number of symptoms: dyspnoea, weakness, physical fatigue, decreased activity, psychological fatigue and lack of motivation.82 According to one study, patients may experience distress and pain during the last month of life and often receive suboptimal treatment.\"\n\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Discontinuation of NIV<\/font>\n\n\"Although ventilatory support can meaningfully extend life, the patient sometimes requests cessation of NIV when allowed by local legislation. However, discontinuation of NIV will inevitably be accompanied by severe symptoms, or even true acute respiratory distress. This type of situation must be anticipated, which necessitates rigorous and carefully appropriate drug treatment.\"\n\n\"It is important to ensure the continuous presence of a doctor or a nurse in the patient's room after stopping ventilatory support, to allow a rapid response when the doses need to be increased to reassure the family about the significance of any respiratory pauses or agonal gasps, which, despite their spectacular nature, must not be interpreted as signs of suffering. If death does not occur rapidly, a doctor or nurse should frequently visit the patient's room, or may need to be continuously present in some cases.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/resp.13525","ecdc71a6":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Survival Times and Mechanical Ventilation<\/font>\n\nIllustration of the different expected survival times depending of the quality of mechanical ventilation.
