So, I will be performing some basic signal visualiztion and EDA.","dbaaab26":"### Lets take a look at the seismograms.\nA seismogram is a graphical display of the seismic measurement by a seismograph or geophones. It capture the motion of the ground whenever a seismic wave travels through it. Usually, it is a measure of acceleration. The actual measurement consists of time in one axis and amplitude in the other axis. The ***large spikes*** in the seismogram display in the below image tells certain activity at a given point of time. Larger the amplitude, stronger the event is. The weaker or low amplitude measurements may contain a lot of noises such as ground rolls, winds, or even electric interference depending upon what kind of sensor it is used.","776ceaf6":"### Looks like one of the sensor from this station might have missing values. ","49fdc8df":"### From the wiggle display, it seems that the the not all the sensor have same amplitude characteristics. I would expect if all of these sensors to have similar amplitude range. It is possible that these sensors might be far apart and therefore different characteristics. Lets look at them side by side.","8d470382":"The 'train' metadeta comprises 4431 stations, each stations containing 10 sensors for collecting seismic events.

As you can see some sensors dont have the spikes at the same time. If a sensor is farther from the source\/epicenter of an Earthquake, the longer it takes the seismic waves to travel and reach the sensor.
