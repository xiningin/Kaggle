What we do not know is how to bring people back to life \nBy Nana Kofi Quakyi Jul 26,2020\n\n\nIn its early days, Ghana\u2019s COVID-19 response was heralded as a success story. It was a viral sensation.\n\nBut the ovation is fading and the West African nation\u2019s case count is surging.\n\nGhana isn\u2019t the only African country that initially appeared to have COVID-19 under control. Others, like South Africa, were also praised for taking early, decisive action. But the recent surge in coronavirus cases in Ghana, and the inability of the country\u2019s health system to cope with it, were seeded by the outlook, oversights and omissions in the easing of its lockdown.\n\nThe partial lockdown of Accra and Kumasi, Ghana\u2019s principal cities, bought the government time to prepare for the onslaught of the virus. The nation needed to be ready for testing and contact tracing, providing personal protective equipment for health workers and dealing with patients in need of acute care for COVID-19. And it had to make provisions to sustain all these as the epidemic evolved.\n\nBut the extra time would only be afforded if the lockdown actually slowed the spread of the virus. So in deciding when to ease the restrictions, knowing the degree of this impact was of the essence, as was progress on those public health and health system reinforcements. Ghana\u2019s timing was bad. https:\/\/theconversation.com\/ghanas-much-praised-covid-19-strategy-has-gone-awry-here-is-why-143217","f0db21e0":"#Unfinished business\n\nThe government announced an end to the lockdown on 19 April. Yet data published by the Ghana Health Service did not offer conclusive evidence that the objectives of the restrictions had been met.\n\nIt was unclear whether the spread of COVID-19 had actually slowed \u2013 and by how much.\n\nSome references were made to the health system and public health improvements in announcing the end of the lockdown. But details were opaque. Within 10 days of President Akufo-Addo\u2019s national address, the Ghana Medical Association was attributing rising health worker infections to poor distribution of protective supplies.\n\nExisting facilities for intensive care were still being expanded when the restrictions on movement were lifted, and authorities were still scouting locations for new isolation centres.\n\nGhana\u2019s limited testing capacity also needed to be expanded, as the entire public health response depended on early case detection. Plans for new and expanded laboratories were still being drawn up when the lockdown was ended.\n\nThe authorities touted pooled testing as an answer. Multiple samples were grouped together and tested. The samples in each pool were individually retested only if a pool returned a positive result for COVID-19. If the pool was negative then it was assumed that all the samples in it were negative.\n\nPool testing is useful where there is low viral prevalence, and much less so in a large outbreak. If capacity for individual testing wasn\u2019t significantly increased before pooled testing reached its limits, Ghana\u2019s ability to detect and manage cases would be severely compromised. https:\/\/theconversation.com\/ghanas-much-praised-covid-19-strategy-has-gone-awry-here-is-why-143217","968a1d08":"#The original code has a $ (dollar sign\/cifr\u00e3o)before {}","b427e6bd":"The 22.6% positivity rate for 6 July suggested that Ghana\u2019s testing regime is not casting a wide enough net to give a true picture of community spread. That statistic was as high as 30.1% on 3 July, and the average for the week ending on 6 July was 23.8%.\n\nThe medical community\u2019s fears have also materialised. The rate of infections among healthcare workers is staggering. A total of 779 had been infected in the line of duty as of 1 July, and that number has been revised to upwards of 2,000 over the course of the month. Insufficient and inadequate PPE, slow testing, and limited institutional capacity are driving this disturbing trend.\n\nThe present state of Ghana\u2019s epidemic is at least partly attributable to the premature lifting of the shelter-in-place order. But its future hinges on whether the nation\u2019s strategy will remain unresponsive to the evolving realities of community spread, the limitations and urgent needs of its fragile public health system, and the daunting risks health workers continue to face. So far the evidence is not promising.\n\nAuthorities in Ghana continue to ease restrictions. Schools have been reopened for final year students, despite public concern. Scores of students and staff have been infected. The health minister rejected calls to reconsider this decision on the grounds that it would be cowardly to reverse course. He only recently recovered from the virus himself.\n\nA mass voter registration exercise is also under way nationwide, despite an open appeal against it by over 200 physicians who cited the obvious risk of further spread of COVID-19.https:\/\/theconversation.com\/ghanas-much-praised-covid-19-strategy-has-gone-awry-here-is-why-143217","e72b4918":"#Alternative hypothesis\n\nEarly in the epidemic, authorities adopted a testing target as the benchmark for ending the restrictions on movement. The objective was to locate some 34,000 travellers who arrived in Ghana between early March and the closure of the border on 22 March; to identify and trace people they had come into contact with; and to test these travellers and their associates for COVID-19.\n\nThe \u201cenhanced contact tracing\u201d exercise, as the president explained on 5 April, would inform future action. By 19 April, 1.27% of some 51,721 people \u2013 just over half of those targeted \u2013 were found to be positive for COVID-19.\n\nThis result was used as the primary evidence that Ghana\u2019s disease burden was small, and that the epidemic had been substantively contained.\n\nBut that testing wasn\u2019t representative. It ignored community spread, which had been documented as early as 20 March. It seemingly underestimated the risk of a large outbreak from undetected cases; how quickly that might happen; and the impact on the still limited laboratories, the still inadequate public health infrastructure, and the still underprepared healthcare system.\n\nThe reduction of the volunteer contact tracer workforce after the lockdown exemplified the authorities\u2019 rhetoric that the worst of COVID-19 was over.\n\nEighteen weeks into the outbreak, Ghana\u2019s COVID-19 response is buckling under the weight of reality.https:\/\/theconversation.com\/ghanas-much-praised-covid-19-strategy-has-gone-awry-here-is-why-143217","e821fbdd":"#People wait to receive food and water in Accra, Ghana, during a partial lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID19), april 04, 2020. \n![](https:\/\/im-media.voltron.voanews.com\/Drupal\/01live-166\/styles\/sourced_410px_wide\/s3\/2020-04\/reuters_ghana_food_distribution_03Apr20.JPG?itok=r79sxPby)https:\/\/www.voanews.com\/africa\/ghanas-decision-lift-partial-covid-19-lockdown-criticized-some#:~:text=People%20wait%20to%20receive%20food%20and%20water%20in%20Accra,%20Ghana,","3aaf7d86":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata   @mpwolke  ","47d92425":"#Codes from Taikutsu   https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ravels1991\/tjsp-e-seus-sal-rios-astron-micos"}}
