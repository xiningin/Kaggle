Can we predict the medal tally of a country? Is there some correlation between the age, height or weight of athletes in a sport? Lets try to answer these using machine learning techniques!","e5af8302":"Even after merging, we find that the below NOC codes in the Olympics data had no counterpart in the NOC master data.","3a68e080":"Hmm, This looks interesting. So NOC code 'FRA' is associated with 160 teams? That sounds prepostorous! Let's use a master of NOC to country mapping to correct this.","49c251b5":"### Merge Population Data\nApart from GDP, population is also of import when looking at a countries performance. There are two trains of thought for this - <br>\n1. Higher populations mean a bigger talent pool to choose from,\n2. Its not GDP alone but GDP per capita that decides how much resources a country has.","70693ef8":"### Who has the most medals across all editions of the olympics?\nMedal tally is the sum of all medals won.\n\nLet's create a column that captures whether or not a medal was won! It would be 1 if Medal column says Gold, Silver or Bronze and 0 otherwise.","d2e45f19":"Wow! We get 86% accurate predictions with k-nearest neighbors while predicting athletics.","f794a8db":"Have you ever had a sports clash turn into a data analytics project? Well, this is what happened to me and a close group of friends during one casual conversation about sports!!\n\nI decided to do some number crunching on 120 years of olympics to see which are the best performing countries at the olympics and what makes them great!\n\nI use the [olympics dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/heesoo37\/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) from kaggle, and decided to merge it with the country wise [gdp](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/resulcaliskan\/countries-gdps) and [population data](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/centurion1986\/countries-population).\n\nWith the weapons ready, its time to see who's BOSS!","62a73506":"#### Hope you guys enjoyed it! Any comments are welcome! :)","9500863d":"Excluding rows with Russia (1980) and USA (1984) because their biggest contender didn't participate in the olympics that time, we see that in **general team do better whilst playing at home!**","3e6b5063":"### Merge GDP data\nTo effectively study factors that affect the medal tally of a country, we need to import the Country-Year wise GDP data.

GDP data is shown below- ","d85f69df":"## Size of Olympic contingent that these countries send to the Olympics!","451b7f6c":"The above accuracies show that given a height and weight I can predict the sport as being or not being weightlifting with 96% accuracy! This was because the weightlifters were so clearly visibile as separate on the weight\/height scatterplot.\n\nNext, let's try predicting Athletics!","b8ce4b5a":"The result summary above shows an R^2 value of 0.75 which is good. This means that these variables account for 75% of all variation in the medal tally.","09627d5c":"It is interesting to see that for each of these countries, a point of peak in the contingent size translates directly to a peak in the medal tally! These have been marked as large triangles on the plots.","59b5ddf4":"The NOC data has the NOC code and the corresponding Country Name. The first five rows of the data are shown below -","daa3ec5e":"Phew! So somehow it has so happened that each of our top countries has atleast one instance of hosting in the considered time period! Fortuitous! :) \n\nOne problem though, is that Russia hosted in a year when USA did _NOT_ participate. Since Russia and USA were the top contenders for medals in the period, it should be that Russia won a lot more than they would have in case USA participated. We would ideally need to control for this!\n\nThe approach for home advantage calculation would be to list host country against each year, playing nation and their total medal tally. Then we would compare performance one edition before and one edition after the olympics was held at that playing country's home.","4c7a0359":"**USA, Russia, Germany** and **China** are the best countries of all time when it comes to medal tallies from 1964 to 2016. What do the yearwise medal tallies look like?","48129925":"#### Where was the olympics held in each of the years under consideration?","071f621d":"We now need to merge the original dataset with the NOC master using the **NOC code as the primary key**. This has to be a left join since we want all participating countries to remain in the data even if their NOC-Country is not found in the master. We can easily correct those manually.","23f25530":"Before we actually merge, lets check if NOCs in the olympics data match with those in the Country Code.","824afdd7":"Now, its time to calculate medal tally agnostic of the team size - one gold means one gold for an event. To do this we divide the number of medals by the count of winning team members. How do we get the team members?

This means that for team events, just a sum of the 'Medal_Won' column would give us an incorrect picture of the medal tally. \n\nWe need to correct for this. First, lets analyse which events are team events. So, what events are team events?\n#### If a team wins more than one gold medal for an event in an edition of the olympics, then that event is a team event.","5cc45ba5":"There are a lot of missing values in the resulting data - this is to be attributed to the countries not found in the GDP and population masters and also the fact that Population and GDP are only for 1961 onwards while Olympics data is from 1896. Therefore, let's consider only data from 1961 onwards.","8f854335":"## Can we predict the medal tally of a country?\n\nThe exploration phase showed that the following factors affect a country's medal tally - \n1. GDP\n2. Contingent Size\n3. Population\n4. Home field advantage","86395720":"#### 2) NOC - National Olympic Committee. \nThese are responsible for organizing their people's participation in the Olympics.\nAre all NOCs linked to a unique team? We can find this out by taking a unique subset of just the NOC and team columns and taking a value count.","819289f1":"Aha! only 6! So maybe what we can do is, add a country code for each Team in the olympics dataset first and then merge using the Country Code. The data now has GDP data attached!","3d56f55f":"#### Lets plot a breakup of medal tally by the medal type - Gold, Silver, Bronze","0b373e15":"Plotting for a few sports we see that, we can distinguish players who play athletics and weightlifting easily due to their unusual height or weight, but the rest of the sports look tricky to distinguish just on the basis of height and weight.","66ed88e2":"We see from the data that some cities have been captured incorrectly- <br>\n1. Moskva should be 'Moscow'\n2. Athina should be 'Athens'\n\nLet's first correct these cities before we proceed with any analysis","f3d12688":"**Interesting Insight 1**: The blank value at 1980 for USA and China is not a data error! In 1980, the United States led a boycott of the Summer Olympic Games in Moscow to protest the late 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In total, 65 nations refused to participate in the games, whereas 80 countries sent athletes to compete, India being one of those.\n\n**Interesting Insight 2**:The missing point at 1984 for Russia is no error either! The boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles followed four years after the U.S.-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The boycott involved 14 Eastern Bloc countries and allies, led by the Soviet Union, which initiated the boycott on May 8, 1984.\n\n**Interesting Insight 3** - China did not win in the olympics till 1984 and it has shown excellent performance since then.","f9d9a421":"The plot shows a 0.622 correlation between GDP and medals won!

Nice!","9f761ccb":"### Does the size of the contingent relate with the number of medals?\nTo get to this, I plot the number of medals won by a team across the years with the contingent size sent to the Olympics in those years.","93bd6d5a":"## This was EXCITING! \n\n#### We learnt that -\n1. USA, Russia, Germany and China are medal tally leaders in the olympics if we count beginning in 1964. They have all sent varying number of athletes into events over time and have fared better with higher contingent sizes. \n2. Women, who were not a very large part of the Olympics contingents earlier, now enjoy equal representation in the olympics teams. \n3. 1980 and 1984 were weird years, with USA not participating in 1980 due to Russia invading Afghanistan and then Russia retaliating in 1984 by not participating and starting the friendship games.\n4. We found interesting insights by looking at the most successful sporting events for each of the top countries - \n5. While USA loves swimming, China likes diving, Russia has a penchant for wrestling and mostly all of them like athletics.\n6. GDP impacts the number of medals won by a nation positively!\n7. The most accomplished athletes list shows 50% Americans, mostly swimmers!\n8. We can predict the medal tally of a country with an error (RMSE) of just ~7 medals using linear regression on - GDP, Population, GDP_per_capita and contingent size.\n9. It is also possible to predict some sports that an athlete plays using just his height and weight. We used a very simple K-Nearest neighbors model. This can obviously be improved upon!","1aefc065":"The correlation matrix above confirms my conclusions from the plots! A large positive correlation (0.703) exists between contingent size and medal tally.\n\n**Interestingly, as we will see in the analysis below, the edition with peak contingents of all these nations is also the edition when the olympics was held in their home country**"}}
