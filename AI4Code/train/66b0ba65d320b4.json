proxy for underlying utility value, as opposed to market price.\n\n- **area_total_calc** is the most cross-correlated item. The larger the overall property, the more room there is for everything else, including tax.\n\n- **tax_building** is far more cross-correlated with utility value than **tax_land** which is maybe more correlated with market price\n\n- **id_parcel** is a random field, which would suggest a correlation strength of below **0.13** can assumed to be indistinguishable from noise. This is matched the strongest anti-correlation field **region_county** with a correlation strength of -0.12\n\n- **num_bath (0.259448)** vs **num_bathroom (0.250364)** suggests a difference between metrics and measurements. A bathroom by definition contains a bath (representing utility value), whereas an estate agent trying to optimise for market price would quote the **num_bathroom** statistic, which even though it is slightly less cross-correlated with utility value.  Properties with more bathrooms than baths may be prone to an error in valuation.\n\n- **num_room (0.177573)**  vs **num_bathroom (0.250364)** may be another indicator of sales marketing, we suspect that in an house optimised for utility value, that bathrooms would scale proportionally with total rooms and the rest of the cross-correlation matrix. If there might higher ratio of rooms without bathrooms, it suggests the house is optimized for market price.\n\n- A possible avenue to explore, is that error in estimate vs sales price may be correlated to the difference in correlation between the most cross-correlated attributes (> +0.24) vs the lesser cross-correlated attributes (0.15-0.20).\n\n- Several attributes produced a NaN result for the mean correlation matrix, suggesting they lack sufficient non-null data to be used for measuring correlations, thus could be safely removed from the properties dataset: **framing, deck, num_pool, pooltypeid10, pooltypeid2, pooltypeid7, story, tax_year**     \n\n- **logerror (0.037710)** is almost a perfectly uncorrelated with all the other attributes provided, which may explain why Zillow have attached a million dollar prize for being to correctly guess it","871b18a5":"- 181108 (99.74%) where sold only once, making up the vast majority of the data\n- 254 (0.25%) where sold twice, \n- 2 (0.003%) where sold 3 times.\n\nThe next question is to determine if any properties where never sold in the transactions dataset ","051d47e6":"As we can see, properties_with_transactions makes up only 2.7% of the original data, and this is the only data useful to us","96fdf965":"Remap the column names to be more human readable","e01b10a7":"# Exploratory Data Analysis - Zillow Dataset\n\nThis is an exploratory data analysis of the Zillow dataset, taking inspiration from \n\n- [https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/philippsp\/exploratory-analysis-zillow](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/philippsp\/exploratory-analysis-zillow)\n- [https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/headsortails\/pytanic](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/headsortails\/pytanic)","d3f7f2c1":"# Duplicate Properties\n\nProperties that have been sold more than once will have multiple transaction entries.","409b43a9":"The may be the time to try and train a neural network on the top 25 fields most correlated with logerror","7f4a76e2":"# Load Input Data","5316a626":"# Correlation Matrix\n\nLets do an initial top level correlation matrix analysis.\n\nBy calculating the mean of each column, we find the attributes with the most cross-correlation. \n","df209289":"Lets explore the correlation between the seemingly random attributes","4000716e":"The top cross-correlated entries are: \n\n- 0.338765 - area_total_calc \n- 0.270347 - tax_building\n- 0.266564 - num_bath\n- 0.245959 - num_fireplace\n- 0.220768 - num_garage\n- 0.204202 - num_bedroom                 \n\nThe larger and higher quality the house is, the more of everything else tends to be, including tax. \n\nBaths, fireplaces and even garages are better proxies for size and quality than bedrooms. This is the metric vs measurement effect, with number of bedrooms usually being the most visible statistic in an estate agents, thus the one with the greatest psychological effect of market price.
