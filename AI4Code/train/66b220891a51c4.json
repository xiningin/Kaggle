Next, I was interested in how much raw information the corona virus contained. To figure that out, I took the genome and encoded it from a string to bytes (encoded via UTF-8 formatting), and it turns out the corona virus contains exactly 29KB of data, uncompressed, which is about the same amount of data as a non formatted written essay. Below you can see the full genome, and the associated file size.","08bc2fd6":"Next, I analyzed the amino acid sequence. To do so, I once again translated the string of letters into bytes, and evaluated how much information it contained. About 9.9 kilobytes. Finally, I counted the amount of amino acids and plotted them on a nice bar graph for visualization. ","c7e510c6":"Next, I performmed both transcription and translation on the genome. To start, I transcribed the genome by replacing the Thymine nucleotides with Uracil, since RNA cannot contain Thymine. Next, I imported a dataset contianing a list of codons and their associated nucleotide sequences. I matched the codon, and then inserted the amino acid single letter identifier into an array. Below you can see the translated genome, and the amino acid sequence.","0c16b5dd":"# Transcription and Translation","071ed36f":"# Hacking COVID-19 ","939b866c":"# Amino Acids Analysis"}}
