For others it is a dream.\n\nThe myriad global problems are discussed in the world everyday, that I always wonder what are the real issues to talk about. The other day, I was sharing thoughts with a friend. Our conversation started from importance of education and it turned towards impact of inequality in personality development. This is a continuous disturbing thought in my mind. Thus, I decided to discuss it as a major part of my explanatory data analysis and find meaningful insight. This kernel is an attempt to give a motivational thought to those who continuously struggle due to different forms of discrimination. These include age, gender, economy, education and other inequalities. \n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nIn this kernel, I will discuss some important general questions which are hurdles for many, and which usually people ask when they start in any field.\nSince, the data is related to computer science in general, and data science and machine learning in particular, thus, thus I will also mention useful resources to get started in the field of AI.\n\nThe survey received 19,717 responses from 171 countries. 19,717 is a very small sample size to discuss large population and make analysis. Thus, for the justification of my analysis, I will be using other references in addition to Kaggle survey results.","f91c773c":"If you start exploring opportunities in the age between 18-30, it is more likely that you'll earn good salary by 30-40 years.

In 18 countries, husbands can legally prevent their wives from working [[4]](https:\/\/www.un.org\/sustainabledevelopment\/gender-equality\/); in 39 countries, daughters and sons do not have equal inheritance rights; and 49 countries lack laws protecting women from domestic violence [[4]](https:\/\/www.un.org\/sustainabledevelopment\/gender-equality\/). The suffering from cultural norms ultimately creates frustration and loss of hope.\n\n**So, gender inequality is a reality of this age, but only where there are gender biased laws. **\n\nThe data from American Psychology Association reveals that women outnumber men in psychology by 75% [[8]](https:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/2017\/07-08\/women-psychology).
