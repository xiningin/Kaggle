What we can clearly see is the biggest factor going into the estimation\nis the score that they would get in G2. What does look interesting is the fact that\nstudytime is negatively related to the grade that they get, however this is a very\nsmall factor.

This will be a regression based ML project using sklearn.","fc723adf":"Important to note here that the data is generally very well structured. There are no missing values and it is very complete. However sklearn can only accept numerical inputs. In this case I will only use some of the numerical columns we have. I will leave the pre-processing of labeled data for a more in-depth project."}}
