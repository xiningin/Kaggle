These blood clots are formed when plaque build up within blood vessels become dislodged. Plaque is essentially a build up of cholestrol and fat on blood vessel walls.\n\nFactors that promote plaque build up is high cholestrol, unhealthy diets, and lack of exercise. These factors can be quantified by attributes such as blood pressure, cholestrol levels, heart rate and so forth - which give an indication on the health of the patients heart and circulatory system.","a7816fac":"The problem statement requires a classification model.
