I decided to drop Bedroom2. \nThis is for two main reasons:\n- the overview is quite vague about the origin of this variable - 'Scraped # of Bedrooms (from different source)' \n- from a quick view of the database, it seems to be very similar to Number of Rooms. Let's check it with a simple scatterplot: as you can see below the relationship is almost perfectly linear, which tells me that they are almost a perfect match. I do not think that the variable provides additional information that Rooms. ","29c70e1f":"The revious visualization was a simple 1D outlier measure: each point was either an outlier either for price or distance. But what about those points that are 2D outliers, that is on the edge of the distribution for both variables? In order to detect those points we need high-dimensional methods. Mahalanobis distance is one such measure, which will help to realize our next graph. ","e06e5a9f":"# 4. Machine learning","ec7543d7":"## 5. P.S. Visualize Random Forest Hyperparameters\nI thought to dedicate a last visualization to one of the major hyperparameter that I tweaked in my training: max_depth.

","f3470578":"<a id='missing_data'><\/a>","ff47d322":"This plot is quite confusing, because most values are in the low end of the Price range and they turn out as blue. Perhaps it would be better to first delete the most extreme outliers (let's say 5 std from the mean) and then plot the figure? I also tried normalising the price variable (with log transformation and standard scaler) but this resulted in a completely green map, that is a map dominated by middle values. Please let me know your suggestions in the comment section, if you have any.","f6999862":"<a id='outliers'><\/a>","0535537f":"## 4.3.

This time I used a trick to stop some useless warning that I was not able to fix in any other way.","22b922a5":"The grid search approach is often too costly, as many combinations are tested. In these cases it is easier to use a randomized search, that evaluates a only an user defined number of random combinations for each hyperparameter at every iteration. This way we could also test more hyperparameters. \nSee this [tutorial](https:\/\/github.com\/ageron\/handson-ml\/blob\/master\/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb) and this [resource](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/hyperparameter-tuning-the-random-forest-in-python-using-scikit-learn-28d2aa77dd74), with its [notebook](https:\/\/github.com\/WillKoehrsen\/Machine-Learning-Projects\/blob\/master\/random_forest_explained\/Improving%20Random%20Forest%20Part%202.ipynb).","265a6b6e":"## 4.2.

It's just that in this notebook I used the information provided by the former to refine the latter. Moreover, I tested more combinations with the randomized search. In any case, this time I will consider the model obtained by the randomized search as the best one. First I will plot the feature importance for this model. This will give me precious insight to the most important factor in predicting our dependent variable Price. Then I will apply the model to the test set. "}}
