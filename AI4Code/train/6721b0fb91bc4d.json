most frequent items bought?","c4d256e4":"Music, dvd, and cds category recieved he highest review average. This makes sense because those are not items you can really give a bad rating for. Next is kids clothes. They may have a really low amount of orders but it seems that they get good reviews. A lot of book types are also included in having the best review average. This may suggest that selling movies, books, and music may be a really great way to get great reviews. \n\nInsurance Services get the worse ratings. This may be something that may not be worth having at this store. It may a good idea to either improve the insurance services or get rid of them all together. \n\nThe next item with the worst reviews are diapers with a score of about 3.25 along with portable kitchens and food preparer type products. \n\nPc gaming products come next, which is also itneresting because they are also bought the least. It would defintely be a good idea to have this looked into further an consider discontinuing pc gaming products. \n\n\n\n","4ac3c1df":"# Exploration\n\n## Where do most customers come from?","e7d34d49":"Most customers are from the states and cities of Sao Paul, followed by Rio de Janeiro. This is not too suprising because the highest populations of people in Brazil are also from these states and cities.","f3565805":"# Conclusion\n\n## Findings\n- Most customers are from the states and cities of Sao Paul and rio de janeiro.\n- Bed and bath products are the top products ordered followed by beauty products, and sports leisure products.\n- Insurance services have the lowest amount of products ordered, followed by kids clothes, and pc gaming products. \n- credit card payments are more than 3 times more likely than any other payment type to be used.\n- The most common number of payment installments is 1.\n- movies, and music have the best reviews.\n- Insurance Services get the worse reviews.\n\n## Limitations and Next Steps\n\nOne big limitation is a lack of knoweldge of brazil or its culture when doing this analysis. For example, with location, there could be more insights to discover that only a local Brazilian analyst would notice with states and cities. Further, products that have less orders may have underlying reason for not being bought. Maybe computers are more expensive in Brazil than other places so everyone buys gaming computers elsewhere.\n\nThis data set has tons of variables and there almost countless insights to be found here. The goal of this analysis was only to get a better understanding of our customers specifically however, this is only the tip of the iceberg and there is much more to find.\n\nThe next steps would be to do text analysis on customer reviews in order to find out why customers give good or bad ratings for these items. It would be interesting to see what customers have to say about insurance services and if there are any common words being used using text segmentation.\n\n\n","d6e2b5f3":"# Introduction\n\n## Purpose\nThe goal of this analysis is get some insights in order to get a better understanding of our customers, what they buy, and how they rate our products.\n\n## The Data\nThe data used here is hosted publically by Olist, the largest deparment store in Brazil. It contains 9 tables including customer, seller,order,products, geolocation, and payments data. \n\n## Questions to Answer\n\n- Where do our customers come from?\n- What items do people buy the most of?\n- How do our customers pay?\n- What products do our customers like?","3362199b":"# Data Importation","52c6face":"On the left, we see that credit cards take up most of the orders. In fact, they are more than 3 times more higher than any other payment type in the data set.\n\nOn the right, we see that the most common number of payment installments is 1. After that the amount of orders decreases as the number of payment installments increaces however, 8 and 10 payment installments rise a bit more.","ebf5307e":"Bed and bath products are the top products ordered followed by beauty products, and sports leisure products.\n\nInsurance services have the lowest amount of products ordered, followed by kids clothes, and pc gaming products. \n\n","4891ad06":"The highest amount of orders have 5 start reviews and as the ratings decrease so do the order counts, except for 1.
