It contains articles, and rankings of national happiness based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various life factors.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/balancedachievement.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/2017-World-Happiness-Report.jpeg?resize=1170%2C717&ssl=1\" width=400 height=400\/>\n\n**Now the next question is \"How the happiness calculates from 156 different countries?\"**\n\n* The rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. \n\n* The report correlates the results with various life factors.\n\n","c5eaa665":"### **Top 10 Countries with high Healthy life expectancy**","1274564d":"### **Top 10 Countries with high Social Support**","c77a602b":"### **Top 10 Countries with high GDP (Economy)**","5bee52fe":"**Below heatmap shows correlation between features.**\n\nHappiness score is highly correlated with \n> ***GDP per capita > Social support==Healthy life expectancy>Freedom to make life choices>Perceptions of corruption***\n\nHappiness score is not much correlated with Generosity.","a1b79c3b":"**How is the Happiness Score is distributed?**\n\nAs you can see below happiness score has values above 2.85 and below 7.76.\nSo there is no single country which has happiness score above 8.","b865b95a":"### **Top 10 Countries with high Perceptions of corruption**","1f489641":"## **How one feature is related to another feature?**","250fa189":"**4.
