As suggested by the Professor of the course, I also started to read the book 'Introduction to Statistical Learning' in parallel. This combination gave me a good insight into AI, ML and helped me quickly move towards practical coding using Python. Rather than looking for more videos and sessions, I thought to start with implementing something, so that, along the road I can step by step explore the areas as encountered. There are numerous possible paths in AI\/ML. But I chose to first pick up a data set and then see what I can do with it.\n\n## Picked up a dataset\nKaggle is a very good place to find numerous datasets. I browsed some data sets and picked the Black Friday dataset.\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mehdidag\/black-friday","7258edb1":"Even below plots don't provide any hint of whether some products are particularly being purchased by either females or married males.","a4bb3483":"Let us check back rest of the columns again to see what next we could explore.","3154be44":"Looking at below count plot, looks like very less number of females attended the black friday sale. \nBut it could also mean less number of females paid for the products and may be their spouse paid for them. ","8705ee67":"There are 12 columns with different formats of data in each column.","caa9b708":"As we see above, there are no bars for the married in the 0-17 range which makes sense. And then if we look at the 46 and above groups, females are very less. But on the other hand, married males paying in range 46-55 are also comparatively more than married females. So it could also imply that though ladies do shop a lot, their spouses are possibly paying for it and hence data reflects that men shopped more.\nIf we had more categorical data defining what kind of products were purchased by men, we could dig in this statement further. However, since in this dataset we don't know if there is a category that implies feminine products\/clothes we cannot further explore this case.","dcbc5016":"May be we could check further - how many of these males were actually married?\nFor this lets create a column that represents gender+married status and then use it as hue.","ca54dae6":"Further, I could also check among the age groups, which gender was a majority by adding a hue.\nAnd as seen below, more males spent in the sale than females.","b7f0d18c":"Couple of observations from above charts:\n1. Irrespective of occupation the proportion of products being purchased is generic. i.e. category 1, 5 are most bought by customers of any occupation and similary, 13-18 categories are bought in less numbers compared to other products.\n2. If we look at category 1, it is most bought by customers with 8, 17, 5 occupations. This can be used when recommending a product on a platform where occupation of user is known. Similar observation can be done for other categories. Specially when we don't actually know what those categories represent, such relation can help understand user purchasing patterns based on an known attribute (e.g. occupation).","74561e0c":"Now, on plotting a count plot for age, seems like the majority of the population in the ages group 26-35 attended the sale.","496d6ae4":"So looks like Product_Category_2 and Product_Category_3 have some null values. \nWe could check their unique values and then assign a default value accordingly for NaNs","03c836a3":"I would try to plot a few columns. But, before that, I need to clean the null values.","56b93c11":"After having a look at the data columns, I began to first think what could be the use cases of using such dataset in AI\/ML.\n\t\n## I listed down the use cases I could think of..\n\t- Analyzing data for research \n\t\t\u25cb Who is more likely to spend more in a black Friday sale?\n\t\t\t\u00a7 Men or Women.\n\t\t\t\u00a7 Married or Un Married\n\t\t\t\u00a7 Old Residents or new residents \n\t\t\u25cb Which type of products are more likely to be sold in a sale like black Friday?\n        \u25cb Which type of products are common among men and which among women?\n\t- Prediction\/classification-\n\t\t\u25cb Predict Age of a customer based on the rest of available data.\n\t\t\u25cb Predict gender of a customer based on rest of data.\n\t\t\u25cb Predict amount of purchase based on rest of data.\n     - Recommendation -\n         \u25cb Suggest products based on age.\n         \u25cb Suggest products based on location customers belong to.\n         \u25cb Suggest products based on gender.\n\n***However, without exploratory data analysis and data visualization, we cannot tell if the given data will help with these use cases. Only if the relevant columns have a correlation, those will be helpful to predict\/conclude the cases.***"}}
