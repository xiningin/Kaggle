Also, we have no idea what is the parameter set for this generator so if you are planning to work on your ML skills, do take the result as a grain of salt.\n\n## Objective\n- To identify correlation betweeen each variable and the test scores","9034aa42":"- We can see that there are only a few students whose parents have a Masters or Bachelor degree. Hence, I don't think we can confidently say that students with highly educated parents will score better. ","d529160b":"- Students having standard lunch tend to perform better than those with free\/reduced lunch. \n- Better lunch means having more energy to cope with the immense study load, yielding better results. ","1db0e4a5":"- Well, this does not really tell us much since we do not know what each group represents","96697b1c":"- We can see that females tend to do better in reading and writing while males are better. I read an article from the Journal of Economic Perspectives and they stated that males have \"superior\" spatial skills that gave them the advantage. Back in history, males are heavily involved in hunting, an activity that required greater spatial orientation than females' tasks and that could explain why there are more males in STEM field. \n- So why do females tend to be better in reading and writing? There are few reasons. Research evidence has shown that girls use both brain hemispheres when presented with reading and writing tasks, whereas boys are more likely to using a single hemisphere of the brain. Another reason could be the gender differences in behavioral problems, such as physical aggression and disobeying rules, as well as attention disorders, which have been associated with general reading and writing impairments.","df399c97":"## Importing packages ","95746212":"- It seems to us that students with parents that held a Masters tend to do well for all 3 sections. This is followed by students with parents holding a Bachelor degree.\n- If the parents have better education, the students will have a better advantage due to better guidance. In the real world it may not always be the case since some parents do not spend time with their children. Also, better educated parents tend to have higher income and can afford to send their children to tuition. ","e216662b":"## Finding correlation between variables and test scores \nGiven that all variables here is a categorical data, we will need to use 1-way ANOVA test to calculate correlation.\n- We will be using 95% confidence interval (95% chance that the confidence interval you calculated contains the true population mean).\n * The null hypothesis is that they are independent.\n * The alternative hypothesis is that they are correlated in some way.","8d8b3f0e":"- We obtained a P-value < 0.05, this means we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that race and the test scores are correlated.","4dc88ae1":"## Create a function to generate an overview of the data ","9c614139":"- We obtained a P-value < 0.05, this means we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that quality\/type of lunch and the student's test scores are correlated.","ea50e88b":"- Needless to say, completing a test preparation course allows student to be better prepared for the actual test.","7b2c6bb4":"## Does the education level of the parents really affect the student's score?","94d5484c":"- As expected from a generator, we do not see any NaN values.\n- Also, the summary of the test score shows that the scores do not vary that much among the 3 types of test.","8dfe08c1":"## Summary\n- Our Chi-square test shows that all variables are correlated to test scores. This is much expected from values created from generators.\n- We observe that females are better performed in writing and reading while males are better in math. Part of the reason could be due to evolutionary traits that provide males with \"superior\" spatial traits. In females, studies have shown that they use both brain hemispheres when presented with reading and writing tasks, whereas boys are more likely to using a single hemisphere of the brain.\n- Students that have highly educated parents tend to perform better but due to the small sample size, it's hard to confirm that hypothesis. \n- Students that have standard lunches performed better as they have higher energy levels that can support their immense study loads.\n- Students who took test preparation courses did significantly better since they are better trained with resources that can help them in an actual setting.
