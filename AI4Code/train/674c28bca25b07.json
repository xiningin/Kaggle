The first hidden layer is again fully connected to another \u2018hidden\u2019 layer. The term hidden indicates that we are not directly interact with these layers and these are kind of obscured to the user. The second hidden layer is on its turn fully connected two the final output layer, which consists of two nodes. So in this example we feed the model four inputs and we will receive two outputs.\n\nLet\u2019s now focus on a single neuron from our previous example. This neuron still is connected to all inputs, also called features. Using these features, the neuron calculates a single response (or output).

This neuron executes two operations. The first operation is a multiplication of the features with a weight vector \ud835\udc4a and adding the bias term \ud835\udc4f. The second operation is a so called activation function, indicated here by \ud835\udf0e. The output of the neuron is a probability between zero and one. The single neuron acts like a small logistic regression model and therefore, an ANN can be seen as a bunch of interconnected logistic regression models stacked together. While this idea is pretty neat, the underlying truth is a bit more subtle. There are many different architectures for ANNs and they can use various building blocks that act quite different than in this example.\n\nThe linear operation in our single neuron is nothing more than a linear regression. Therefore, to understand logistic regression, the first step is to have an idea how linear regression works. The next section will show a step by step example as a recap.","f517343c":"## b) An implementation in Tensorflow\nBefore we can start we first need some data to do a logistic regression.

It can be downloaded from here:\\\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/azeembootwala\/titanic","19050473":"# 2.1 One step back: linear regression\n## a) What is a linear regression again?\nLinear regression in its simplest form (also called simple linear regression), models a single dependent variable \ud835\udc66 using a single independent variable \ud835\udc65. This may sound daunting, but was this means is that we want to solve the following equation:\n```\n\ud835\udc66 = a\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc4f\n```\n\nIn the context of machine learning, \ud835\udc65 represents our input data, \ud835\udc66 represents our output data, and by solving we mean to find the best weights (or parameters), represented by \ud835\udc64 and \ud835\udc4f in the linear regression equation. A computer can help us find the best values for \ud835\udc64 and \ud835\udc4f, to have the closest match for \ud835\udc66 using the input variable \ud835\udc65.\n\nFor the next examples, let us define the following values for x and y:\n```\n\ud835\udc65 = [\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3,4,5]\n\ud835\udc66 = [\u22123,\u22121,1,3,5,7,9,11]\n```\n\nThe values for \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 have a linear relation so we can use linear regression to find (or fit) the best weights and solve the problem. Maybe, by staring long enough at these values, we can discover the relation, however it is much easier to use a computer to find the answer.\n\nIf you have stared long enough or just want to know the answer, the relation between \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 is the following:\n```\n\ud835\udc66 = 2\ud835\udc65 + 1\n```\n\nIn the next section we will use Tensorflow to create our single neuron model and try to \u2018solve\u2019 the equation.","ee9e78d3":"The model in Tensorflow is very similar to our linear regression model.

These are the weights $W$, which is just a single value, because we only have a single input. Also we need to define the bias term $b$.","d52e294a":"Lets observe some random examples:","adc866a6":"# 3) From Linear Regression to Binary Logistic Regression\n## a) What is the difference?\nThe differences between linear regressions and a logistic regressions are not major. There are two differences from the previous code we created. First, our linear regression model only had a single feature, which we inputted with $x$, meaning that we only had a single weight. In logistic regression, you generally input more than one feature, and each will have its own weight. This will change the previous simple multiplication to a matrix multiplication (dot product). Secondly, we will add a so called *activation function* to map this value between 0 or 1. Let's remind ourselves again of our simple model:\n![Logistic unit](https:\/\/github.com\/dennisbakhuis\/Tutorials\/raw\/master\/Logistic_Regression\/assets\/logisticunit.png)\n\nBy convention (from what I have understood) in Tensorflow, the input vector has columns for features, and rows for examples. If we would have 2 datapoints the input matrix would look like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nX = \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nf^1_1 & f^2_1 & f^3_1 & f^4_1 \\\\\nf^1_2 & f^2_2 & f^3_2 & f^4_2 \n\\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe superscript shows the feature number, the subscript indicates the example.\n\nEach of these inputs are associated with their own weights. The node itself has two explict operations. The first is the dot product between the weights vector and the input vector. The second is the sigmoid funtion. The weight vector $W$ in this example has four weights:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nX = \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nW^1 \\\\\nW^2 \\\\\nW^3 \\\\\nW^4\n\\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn the node we first compute the linear part:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nZ = W X + b\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor our example this will look like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nZ = \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nW^1 \\\\\nW^2 \\\\\nW^3 \\\\\nW^4\n\\end{matrix} \\right) \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nf^1_1 & f^2_1 & f^3_1 & f^4_1 \\\\\nf^1_2 & f^2_2 & f^3_2 & f^4_2 \n\\end{matrix} \\right) + b = \\left(\n\\begin{matrix}\nW^1 f^1_1 + W^2 f^2_1 + W^3 f^3_1 + W^4 f^4_1 + b\\\\\nW^1 f^1_1 + W^2 f^2_1 + W^3 f^3_1 + W^4 f^4_1 + b\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right) = \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nz_1 \\\\\nz_2 \n\\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nNotice that the result is only a single value for each example.\n\nFor all values of $x$, which can be from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ (all real numbers), the sigmoid function maps $x$ between 0 and 1. Only values for $x$ close to zero matter, as these are in the 'linear regime'. Very large, or very small are only clipped to 1 and 0 respectively. The mathematical definition of the sigmoid is:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nA = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis is all there is to the logistic unit. The sigmoid function gives the node its non-linear character. Many of these units together can do almost magical things. First we will make our first logistic regression model in Tensorflow.","a13903e3":"Now we can calculate the accuracy:","0dc2a914":"We can plot the loss function of our function:","2356c4fd":"## b) An implementation in Tensorflow\n\nBefore we start with Tensorflow, we should first organize our input data (\ud835\udc65) and output data (\ud835\udc66). For this we are going to use Numpy:","2284179f":"## c) What is actually happening?\nWell, the steps required are still the same:\n1. forward pass\n2. calculate loss\n3. backward pass\n4. update weights\n5. repeat\n\nAl steps have minor changes. The forward pass will be a more general dot product and we need to add the activation function. This final activation functions gives a value between 0 and 1, we need to round this to an actual value of 0 or 1. The loss function is binary cross entropy, which is of course different from the mean square error. The backward pass will calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to $W$ and $b$. As our loss function changed, we will have different differentials. The update weights function is unchanged, the final loop is also very similar.\n\nIn Numpy, and in math in general as far as I know, the dot product needs the shapes of the vectors (and matrices) to be compatible:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nX Y = X_{i,j} Y_{j, k}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis means that the number of columns of $X$ must be equal to the number of rows in $Y$. To make ourselves a bit easier, we will Transpose our input vector $X$ and flip the vector. This will result that the rows will be features and the columns will be examples.","91fad6b7":"As we can see, our weights are pretty much off and we need to update them. To do that we need to first calculate the gradients $\\delta$Loss\/$\\delta W$ and $\\delta$Loss\/$\\delta b$. Maybe your differential skills are a bit rusty. The trick is to apply the product rule. We can ignore the sums as these are linear:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta W} Loss =  \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}  \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta W} (y - \\hat{y})^2 \\\\\nU = (y - \\hat{y}) = (y - (Wx + b)) \\\\\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta W} Loss = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}  \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta U} U^2 \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta W} -(W x + b) \\\\\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta W} Loss = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}  -2x(y - \\hat{y})\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor $\\delta$Loss\/$\\delta b$ we only need to repeat the last step, with respect to $b$:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta b} Loss = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}  \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta U} U^2 \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta b} -(W x + b) \\\\\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta b} Loss = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}  -2(y - \\hat{y})\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe will implement this in the 'backward pass' function.

In the next section we will use our new knowledge for binary logistic regression.","03d0b543":"To configure the model, we again do a compile. For this example I changed the loss into 'binary_cross_entropy'. This is another loss function which works better for binary logistic regression problems. If you are interested in the inner workings I recommend wikipedia. \\\nI also added the metric 'accuracy' to calculate the accuracy for each epoch. This should improve as we train the model.","fd4115aa":"And the accuracy:","f18ce6b0":"Next is the backwards pass. For this, We would need to differentiate the Loss function with $W$ and $b$.

Link between neural networks and logistic regression\n2. One step back: linear regression\n3. From linear to (binary) logistic regression\n4. Round up","d6fb0f50":"# 1. Link between neural network and logistic regression\nWhen we hear or read about deep learning we generally mean the sub-field of machine learning using artificial neural networks (ANN). These computing systems are quite successful in solving complex problems in various fields, examples are, image recognition, language modelling, and speech recognition. While the name ANN implies that they are related to the inner workings of our brain, the truth is that they mainly share some terminology. An ANN generally consists of multiple interconnected layers, which on itself are build using neurons (also called nodes). An example is shown in figure 1.\n\n![Neural Network](https:\/\/github.com\/dennisbakhuis\/Tutorials\/raw\/master\/Neural_Network\/assets\/NeuralNetwork.png)\n*Figure 1: Example of a typical neural network, borrowed from my follow up article on neural networks.*","3633cfe0":"The Dense function is used to create layers of many fully connected neurons (logistic units). The parameter units is used to set the amount of neurons. We only use a single unit and therefore, we will set it to one. As this is the first \u2018layer\u2019 of our model, we need to tell Tensorflow what shape it can expect as an input. This is only necessary for the first layer.\n\nNow that we have defined the model, we need to use the Compile() method to configure the model for training. The method requires at least two parameters, a loss function and an optimizer. The loss function is a measure for how well the model predicts the actual value. For this example we will use the mean squared error (average of the squared difference between the predicted and the actual value of \ud835\udc66). The \u2018learning algorithm\u2019 will try to minimize the loss my adjusting (optimizing) the parameters (weights and bias) for each step. The optimizer defines a method to perform this Optimizing step and a common method is Gradient Descent, or in our case Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This method will become more clear in the next section where we will implement it in plain Numpy.","133bec19":"I called the parameters $W$ and $b$ to match their corresponding official neural network terms: weights and bias. We are however, still calculating the exact same thing as the linear regression problem:\n\\begin{equation}\ny = W x + b\n\\end{equation}\n\nNext we will define a function that makes a prediction using our current model parameters. In deep learning terms, this is called forward pass. The variable of the predicted value is generally name $\\hat y$.","096c8cc8":"Now lets redefine our forward function to do the dot product and the activation function. The forward pass is defined in two steps:\n1. $Z = W X + b$\n2. $\\sigma(Z)$\n\nNote that $W X$ is a dot product.","f8282361":"Variable $Y$ is the label if they survived and we had 792 examples.
