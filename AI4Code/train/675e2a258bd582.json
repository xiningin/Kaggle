That mean reduction in R0 from 6 to 2 gives us additional two weeks to prepare to tackle the peak infection. It can also be observed that the extent of infection also decreases with reduction in R0. When R0=6, total population gets infected whereas when R0=2, 20% of the population remains uninfected when the epidemic is over. \n\nDespite COVID-19 being a relatively less fatal infection, it wreaked havoc all over the world as it quickly spread and caught many countries unprepared, overwhelming their health infrastructure. Health infrastructure is said to be overwhelmed when the number of infectious population is above the total beds available at the hospitals. Yes, the health infrastructure could be ramped up rapidly by converting other infrastructure to makeshift hospitals and calling retired health professionals back into duty etc. as followed by many countries but it won\u2019t be able to keep up with if the cases increase exponentially. The faster the infection curve rises, the quicker the local health care system gets overloaded beyond its capacity to treat people.
