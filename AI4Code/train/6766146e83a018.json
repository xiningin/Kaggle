This \"data science for good\" project offers the opportunity to put our skills towards a task more beneficial to society than getting people to click on ads!\n\n## Problem and Data Explanation\n\nThe data for this competition is provided in two files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The training set has 9557 rows and 143 columns while the testing set has 23856 rows and 142 columns. Each row represents __one individual__ and each column is a __feature, either unique to the individual, or for the household of the individual__. The training set has one additional column, `Target`, which represents the poverty level on a 1-4 scale and is the label for the competition. A value of 1 is the most extreme poverty. \n\nThis is a __supervised multi-class classification machine learning problem__:\n\n* __Supervised__: provided with the labels for the training data\n* __Multi-class classification__: Labels are discrete values with 4 classes\n\n### Objective\n\nThe objective is to predict poverty on a __household level__. We are given data on the individual level with each individual having unique features but also information about their household. In the dataset for the task, we'll have to perform some _aggregations of the individual data_ for each household. Moreover, we have to make a prediction for every individual in the test set, but _\"ONLY the heads of household are used in scoring\"_ which means we want to predict poverty on a household basis. \n\n__Important note: while all members of a household should have the same label in the training data, there are errors where individuals in the same household have different labels. In these cases, we are told to use the label for the head of each household, which can be identified by the rows where `parentesco1 == 1.0`.__ [competition main discussion](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction\/discussion\/61403)\n\nThe `Target` values represent poverty levels as follows:\n\n    1 = extreme poverty \n    2 = moderate poverty \n    3 = vulnerable households \n    4 = non vulnerable households\n\nThe explanations for all 143 columns can be found in the [competition documentation](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction\/data), but a few to note are below:\n\n* __Id__: a unique identifier for each individual, this should not be a feature that we use! \n* __idhogar__: a unique identifier for each household. This variable is not a feature, but will be used to group individuals by household as all individuals in a household will have the same identifier.\n* __parentesco1__: indicates if this person is the head of the household.\n* __Target__: the label, which should be equal for all members in a household\n\n### Metric\n\nPredictions will be assessed by the __Macro F1 Score.__ \n\n```\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nf1_score(y_true, y_predicted, average = 'macro`)\n```\n\n## Roadmap\n\na.
