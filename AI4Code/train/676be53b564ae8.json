More precisely, if one plots the percentage of variance explained by the clusters against the number of clusters, the first clusters will add much information (explain a lot of variance), but at some point the marginal gain will drop, giving an angle in the graph. The number of clusters is chosen at this point, hence the \"elbow criterion\". This \"elbow\" cannot always be unambiguously identified. Percentage of variance explained is the ratio of the between-group variance to the total variance, also known as an F-test. A slight variation of this method plots the curvature of the within group variance.\n# Basically, number of clusters = the x-axis value of the point that is the corner of the \"elbow\"(the plot looks often looks like an elbow)","567ef986":"# Now, we find the most produced food items in the last half-century","884d3460":"Perfect!

Finding solutions for feeding the growing world population has become a hot topic for food and agriculture organizations, entrepreneurs and philanthropists. These solutions range from changing the way we grow our food to changing the way we eat. To make things harder, the world's climate is changing and it is both affecting and affected by the way we grow our food \u2013 agriculture. This dataset provides an insight on our worldwide food production - focusing on a comparison between food produced for human consumption and feed produced for animals.\n\nContent\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations provides free access to food and agriculture data for over 245 countries and territories, from the year 1961 to the most recent update (depends on the dataset). One dataset from the FAO's database is the Food Balance Sheets. It presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period, the last time an update was loaded to the FAO database was in 2013. The food balance sheet shows for each food item the sources of supply and its utilization. This chunk of the dataset is focused on two utilizations of each food item available:\n\nFood - refers to the total amount of the food item available as human food during the reference period.\nFeed - refers to the quantity of the food item available for feeding to the livestock and poultry during the reference period.\nDataset's attributes:\n\nArea code - Country name abbreviation\nArea - County name\nItem - Food item\nElement - Food or Feed\nLatitude - geographic coordinate that specifies the north\u2013south position of a point on the Earth's surface\nLongitude - geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface\nProduction per year - Amount of food item produced in 1000 tonnes\n\nThis is a simple exploratory notebook that heavily expolits pandas and seaborn","8ec18243":"Let's see what the data looks like...","1389dc20":"# Some more feature engineering\n\nThis time, we will use the new features to get some good conclusions.\n\n# 1.
