For example, when you change the random_state to random_state=1, the results are as follows:\n\nLogistic Regression: 86.6%\n\nRandom Forest: 86.6%\n\nGradient Boost: 83.3%\n\nSVM: 90%\n\nAdaBoost: 85%\n\nAs you can see, when we change the random_state parameter, we get very different results which lead to worse performing models.\n\nAnother example, that really takes a toll on the accuracies is when I change the random_state paramater to random_state=42, which is what many practioners use as the random_state. The results are as follows:\n\nLogistic Regression: 81.6%\n\nRandom Forest: 76.6%\n\nGradient Boost: 78.3%\n\nSVM: 71.6%\n\nAdaBoost: 71.6%\n\nThese results are not very appealing and this was only due to changing the random_state paramter. We don't get anywhere near the results that we did when random_state was equal to 1 or 2 and this was something I wanted to share and a cool discovery I had. I didn't realize that changing such a simple paramter could really be the difference between the highest accuracy of 93.3% and 81.6%. Hope you learnt something."}}
