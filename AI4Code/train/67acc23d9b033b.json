Although numerous imaging techniques have been put in place for the diagnostic and treatment of breast cancer, the advancement in genetic programming and machine learning over the past decades have improved the accuracy of breast cancer detection tremendously, more so than imaging techniques. To facilitate interpretation and analysis, enormous amount of mammography films have been processed by the system to help improve the visibility of peripheral areas and intensity distribution, and several methods have been reported to assist in this process. Feature extraction is one of the most important step in breast cancer detection due to its ability to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors. After extraction, image properties such as smoothness, coarseness, depth, and regularity are extracted by segmentation.\n\nThis dataset is ideal for the testing of machine learning model but since I have just started out (this is my second Kaggle), I will be merely performing an exploration data analysis. \n\n## Objective\n- Find out the correlation between cancer radius, texture,parimeter, compactness, etc and whether the cancer is malignant or benign. \n- Upon finding out their correlation, find the relationship between these variables and whether the cancer is malignant or benign.\n","6aa1b5b5":"# Correlation\n- Here, we will want to find out the correlations among each variable.\n    * To do so we will need to plot a correlation matrix\n    * This method is normally used for feature selection. Features with high correlation are more linearly dependent and hence have almost the same effect on the dependent variable. When two features have high correlation, one is dropped. \n        * This step is essential in reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model. It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in some cases, to improve the performance of the model.\n\n\n","19903039":"Great to see no null values here!
