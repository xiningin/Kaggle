Since its inception in 1992, GroupLens's research projects have explored a variety of fields including:\n\n* recommender systems\n* online communities\n* mobile and ubiquitious technologies\n* digital libraries\n* local geographic information systems\n\nGroupLens Research operates a movie recommender based on collaborative filtering, MovieLens, which is the source of these data. We encourage you to visit <http:\/\/movielens.org> to try it out! If you have exciting ideas for experimental work to conduct on MovieLens, send us an email at <grouplens-info@cs.umn.edu> - we are always interested in working with external collaborators.\n\n\nContent and Use of Files\n========================\n\nFormatting and Encoding\n-----------------------\n\nThe dataset files are written as [comma-separated values](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Comma-separated_values) files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (`,`) are escaped using double-quotes (`\"`). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Mis\u00e9rables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.\n\n\nUser Ids\n--------\n\nMovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).\n\n\nMovie Ids\n---------\n\nOnly movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id `1` corresponds to the URL <https:\/\/movielens.org\/movies\/1>). Movie ids are consistent between `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `links.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).\n\n\nRatings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAll ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n\n    userId,movieId,rating,timestamp\n\nThe lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n\nRatings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).\n\nTimestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n\n\nTags Data File Structure (tags.csv)\n-----------------------------------\n\nAll tags are contained in the file `tags.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n\n    userId,movieId,tag,timestamp\n\nThe lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n\nTags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.\n\nTimestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n\n\nMovies Data File Structure (movies.csv)\n---------------------------------------\n\nMovie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n\n    movieId,title,genres\n\nMovie titles are entered manually or imported from <https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/>, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.\n\nGenres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:\n\n* Action\n* Adventure\n* Animation\n* Children's\n* Comedy\n* Crime\n* Documentary\n* Drama\n* Fantasy\n* Film-Noir\n* Horror\n* Musical\n* Mystery\n* Romance\n* Sci-Fi\n* Thriller\n* War\n* Western\n* (no genres listed)\n\n\nLinks Data File Structure (links.csv)\n---------------------------------------\n\nIdentifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file `links.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n\n    movieId,imdbId,tmdbId\n\nmovieId is an identifier for movies used by <https:\/\/movielens.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https:\/\/movielens.org\/movies\/1>.\n\nimdbId is an identifier for movies used by <http:\/\/www.imdb.com>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0114709\/>.\n\ntmdbId is an identifier for movies used by <https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/movie\/862>.\n\nUse of the resources listed above is subject to the terms of each provider.\n\n\nCross-Validation\n----------------\n\nPrior versions of the MovieLens dataset included either pre-computed cross-folds or scripts to perform this computation. We no longer bundle either of these features with the dataset, since most modern toolkits provide this as a built-in feature. If you wish to learn about standard approaches to cross-fold computation in the context of recommender systems evaluation, see [LensKit](http:\/\/lenskit.org) for tools, documentation, and open-source code examples.","c4dd236a":"3) Cosine similarity","2ba2d57f":"## 1.1. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc124\uba85\nThis dataset (ml-latest-small) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service.
