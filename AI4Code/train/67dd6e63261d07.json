The top item in each list has been custom-made to help you with the exercises on that page.\n\nThe first step in most data analytics projects is reading the data file. In this section, you'll create `Series` and `DataFrame` objects, both by hand and by reading data files.\n\n# Relevant Resources\n* ** [Creating, Reading and Writing Reference](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/creating-reading-and-writing-reference)**\n* [General Pandas Cheat Sheet](https:\/\/assets.datacamp.com\/blog_assets\/PandasPythonForDataScience.pdf)\n\n# Set Up\n\nRun the code cell below to load libraries you will need (including code to check your answers).","db7732e8":"## 3.\n\nCreate a variable `ingredients` with a `pd.Series` that looks like:\n\n```\nFlour     4 cups\nMilk       1 cup\nEggs     2 large\nSpam       1 can\nName: Dinner, dtype: object\n```"}}
