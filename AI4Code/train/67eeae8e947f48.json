This library depends on the stock markers from [Yahoo Finance](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/).\n\n**Note: To install the yfinance library, you will have to enable Internet in the Kaggle notebook settings**","dda0625b":"# How to change plot data using Dropdowns!\n\n### #Plotly #Python #Drowdowns #Stocks #Tutorial\n\n**Problem:** For a given dataset with many attributes, I was plotting the same style of plot but with different data for the y-axis. I was trying to find a way to save space in the notebook and somehow have the ability to swap the data in the same plot quickly without having to re-running the cell.\n\n**Solution:** I found that in [Plotly](https:\/\/plot.ly\/python\/), you can configure a [dropdown of buttons](https:\/\/plot.ly\/python\/dropdowns\/) that can force the plot to update its style or data. The dropdown menu code is straightforward and the user interface is simple enough to include in professional notebooks.\n\nI have been using [Plotly](https:\/\/plot.ly\/python\/) for some time now. The previous versions of their library weren't as user friendly, but the 4.x version of the library is really good and easy to use. However, there are still a lot of things about their documentation that lack clarity and demonstration on how the features work. Hence this notebook is designed as a tutorial or a referrence cheat sheet for whenever in the future I want to add a plot with a dropdown menu in my notebooks."}}
