He grew up to be most influencial Philosopher ever and was given nicknames like **The Master** and **The Philosopher**, Oh forgot to mention he was also the tutor of **Alexander The Great**. There are 4 great questions which Aristortle has answered:\n\n*  What makes people Happy ?\n\nHmm, So According to Aristortle a person his happy if he\/she posses the following virtues: Courage, Temperance, Liberality, Magnificence, Pride, Patience, Truthfulness, Witiness, Friendliness, Modesty.\n\n* What is Art For?\n\nAristortle has written a manuel for writting great plays named **The Poetics**. He has introduced the ideas of **PeriPeteia** or sudden change in fornute and **Anagnoresis** or a sudden moment of dramatic revelation. By these literary devices Aristorle wants to bring home the notion that tragedy can befall on anyone, and in such moments we must be kind and compasenate toward others.\n\n* What are Friends for ?\nAccording to Aristortle there are 3 kinds of friendships:\n\n * The one where each individual is seeking fun or him\/herself.\n * The one where everyone wants a strategic advantage from one another.\n * The one which is True Friendship.\n\n\n* How can ideas cut through a Busy World ?\n\nLike most of us, Aristortle also wondered why the Best idea not always wins the argument? He studied his surroundings and came up with the art of **Rhetoric** where he emphasied on the ideas of making a discussion funny (because people has short attention spans), being empathetic toward other person and  being persuasive.\n\n(reference: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=csIW4W_DYX4)","c0e03f5e":"# Russell\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/a6\/Bertrand_Russell_transparent_bg.png\/225px-Bertrand_Russell_transparent_bg.png)\n\nThe aspects of Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy cover the changing viewpoints of philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970), from his early writings in 1896 until his death in February 1970.","532e0e47":"# Keynes\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/04\/Keynes_1933.jpg)\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes CB FBA (5 June 1883 \u2013 21 April 1946), was an English economist, whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. Originally trained in mathematics, he built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles, and was one of the most influential economists of the 20th century.His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, and its various offshoots.\n\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He argued that aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. He detailed these ideas in his magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in 1936. By the late 1930s, leading Western economies had begun adopting Keynes's policy recommendations. Almost all capitalist governments had done so by the end of the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946. As a leader of the British delegation, Keynes participated in the design of the international economic institutions established after the end of World War II but was overruled by the American delegation on several aspects.\n\nKeynes's influence started to wane in the 1970s, partly as a result of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists,[6] who disputed the ability of government to favourably regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy.However, the advent of the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 sparked a resurgence in Keynesian thought. Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 by President Barack Obama of the United States, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.\n\nWhen Time magazine included Keynes among its Most Important People of the Century in 1999, it stated that \"his radical idea that governments should spend money they don't have may have saved capitalism.\"[9] The Economist has described Keynes as \"Britain's most famous 20th-century economist.\" In addition to being an economist, Keynes was also a civil servant, a director of the Bank of England, and a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals.\n","4bd01ce4":"# Malebranche\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/1\/17\/Nicolas_Malebranche.jpg\/330px-Nicolas_Malebranche.jpg)\n\nNicolas Malebranche, Oratory of Jesus (August 1638 \u2013 13 October 1715), was a French Oratorian[1] priest and rationalist philosopher. In his works, he sought to synthesize the thought of St. Augustine and Descartes, in order to demonstrate the active role of God in every aspect of the world. Malebranche is best known for his doctrines of vision in God, occasionalism and ontologism.","1b7f2ae4":"# Kripke\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d4\/Kripke.JPG\/330px-Kripke.JPG)\n\nSaul Aaron Kripke (born November 13, 1940) is an American philosopher and logician in the analytic tradition. He is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and emeritus professor at Princeton University. Since the 1960s, Kripke has been a central figure in a number of fields related to mathematical logic, modal logic, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, metaphysics, epistemology, and recursion theory. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts.\n\nKripke has made influential and original contributions to logic, especially modal logic. His principal contribution is a semantics for modal logic involving possible worlds, now called Kripke semantics. He received the 2001 Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy.\n\nKripke is also partly responsible for the revival of metaphysics after the decline of logical positivism, claiming necessity is a metaphysical notion distinct from the epistemic notion of a priori, and that there are necessary truths that are known a posteriori, such as that water is H2O. A 1970 Princeton lecture series, published in book form in 1980 as Naming and Necessity, is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century. It introduces the concept of names as rigid designators, true in every possible world, as contrasted with descriptions. It also contains Kripke's causal theory of reference, disputing the descriptivist theory found in Gottlob Frege's concept of sense and Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions.\n\nKripke also gave an original reading of Ludwig Wittgenstein, known as \"Kripkenstein\", in his Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. The book contains his rule-following argument, a paradox for skepticism about meaning.","2002eaf7":"George Berkeley (12 March 1685 \u2013 14 January 1753) \u2013 known as Bishop Berkeley (Bishop of Cloyne of the Anglican Church of Ireland) \u2013 was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called \"immaterialism\" (later referred to as \"subjective idealism\" by others). This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are ideas perceived by the minds and, as a result, cannot exist without being perceived. Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction, an important premise in his argument for immaterialism.","c3d9daf2":"# A Function Is All you Need!","d8e387f4":"# Smith\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/43\/Adam_Smith_The_Muir_portrait.jpg\/330px-Adam_Smith_The_Muir_portrait.jpg)\n\nAdam Smith FRSA (16 June 1723 \u2013 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist, philosopher as well as a moral philosopher, a pioneer of political economy, and a key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment,also known as ''The Father of Economics'' or ''The Father of Capitalism''.Smith wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Adam Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage.\n\nSmith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.\n\nSmith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as Horace Walpole.","109fb46a":"# Husserl\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/8d\/Edmund_Husserl_1910s.jpg\/330px-Edmund_Husserl_1910s.jpg)\n\nEdmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl ( April 1859 \u2013 27 April 1938) was a German philosopher who established the school of phenomenology. In his early work, he elaborated critiques of historicism and of psychologism in logic based on analyses of intentionality. In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called phenomenological reduction. Arguing that transcendental consciousness sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl redefined phenomenology as a transcendental-idealist philosophy. Husserl's thought profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy, and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond.\n\nHusserl studied mathematics, taught by Karl Weierstrass and Leo K\u00f6nigsberger, and philosophy taught by Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. He taught philosophy as a Privatdozent at Halle from 1887, then as professor, first at G\u00f6ttingen from 1901, then at Freiburg from 1916 until he retired in 1928, after which he remained highly productive. In 1933, due to racial laws, having been born to a Jewish family, he was expelled from the library of the University of Freiburg, and months later resigned from the Deutsche Akademie. Following an illness, he died in Freiburg in 1938.","53d02f81":"# Descartes\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/73\/Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg\/330px-Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg)\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (31 March 1596 \u2013 11 February 1650) was a French-born philosopher, mathematician, and scientist who spent a large portion of his working life in the Dutch Republic, initially serving the Dutch States Army of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange and the Stadtholder of the United Provinces. One of the most notable intellectual figures of the Dutch Golden Age,Descartes is also widely regarded as one of the founders of modern philosophy.\n\nMany elements of Descartes's philosophy have precedents in late Aristotelianism, the revived Stoicism of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like Augustine. In his natural philosophy, he differed from the schools on two major points: first, he rejected the splitting of corporeal substance into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to final ends, divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena. In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God's act of creation. Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the Passions of the Soul, an early modern treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic \"as if no one had written on these matters before.\" His best known philosophical statement is \"cogito, ergo sum\" (\"I think, therefore I am\"; French: Je pense, donc je suis), found in Discourse on the Method (1637; in French and Latin) and Principles of Philosophy (1644, in Latin).\n\nDescartes has often been called the father of modern philosophy, and is largely seen as responsible for the increased attention given to epistemology in the 17th century.He laid the foundation for 17th-century continental rationalism, later advocated by Spinoza and Leibniz, and was later opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. In the 17th-century Dutch Republic, the rise of early modern rationalism \u2013 as a highly systematic school of philosophy in its own right for the first time in history \u2013 exerted an immense and profound influence on modern Western thought in general, with the birth of two influential rationalistic philosophical systems of Descartes (who spent most of his adult life and wrote all his major work in the United Provinces of the Netherlands) and Spinoza \u2013 namely Cartesianism and Spinozism. It was the 17th-century arch-rationalists like Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz who have given the \"Age of Reason\" its name and place in history. Leibniz, Spinoza, and Descartes were all well-versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, and Descartes and Leibniz contributed greatly to science as well.","0ef27d1c":"# Quine\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/62\/Wvq-passport-1975-400dpi-crop.jpg\/330px-Wvq-passport-1975-400dpi-crop.jpg)\n\nWillard Van Orman Quine (June 25, 1908 \u2013 December 25, 2000) was an American philosopher and logician in the analytic tradition, recognized as \"one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century.\"From 1930 until his death 70 years later, Quine was continually affiliated with Harvard University in one way or another, first as a student, then as a professor. He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978.\n\nQuine was a teacher of logic and set theory. Quine was famous for his position that first order logic is the only kind worthy of the name, and developed his own system of mathematics and set theory, known as New Foundations. In philosophy of mathematics, he and his Harvard colleague Hilary Putnam developed the \"Quine\u2013Putnam indispensability thesis,\" an argument for the reality of mathematical entities.However, he was the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not conceptual analysis, but continuous with science; the abstract branch of the empirical sciences. This led to his famous quip that \"philosophy of science is philosophy enough.\" He led a \"systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself\"[13] and developed an influential naturalized epistemology that tried to provide \"an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input.\" He also advocated ontological relativity in science, known as the Duhem\u2013Quine thesis.\n\nHis major writings include the papers \"On What There Is\", which elucidated Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions and contains Quine's famous dictum of ontological commitment, \"To be is to be the value of a variable\", and \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" (1951) which attacked the traditional analytic-synthetic distinction and reductionism, undermining the then-popular logical positivism, advocating instead a form of semantic holism. They also include the books The Web of Belief, which advocates a kind of coherentism, and Word and Object (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine's famous indeterminacy of translation thesis, advocating a behaviorist theory of meaning.\n\nA 2009 poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries.He won the first Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy in 1993 for \"his systematical and penetrating discussions of how learning of language and communication are based on socially available evidence and of the consequences of this for theories on knowledge and linguistic meaning.\" In 1996 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for his \"outstanding contributions to the progress of philosophy in the 20th century by proposing numerous theories based on keen insights in logic, epistemology, philosophy of science and philosophy of language.\"","152dbc2c":"# Hume\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/ea\/Painting_of_David_Hume.jpg\/330px-Painting_of_David_Hume.jpg)\n\nDavid Hume ((26 April 1711 OS) \u2013 25 August 1776) was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, historian, economist, librarian and essayist, who is best known today for his highly influential system of philosophical empiricism, skepticism, and naturalism.Beginning with A Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340), Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Hume argued against the existence of innate ideas, positing that all human knowledge derives solely from experience. This places him with Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and George Berkeley as a British Empiricist.\n\nHume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; instead, they result from custom and mental habit. We never actually perceive that one event causes another but only experience the \"constant conjunction\" of events. This problem of induction means that to draw any causal inferences from past experience, it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past, a presupposition which cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.\n\nAn opponent of philosophical rationalists, Hume held that passions rather than reason govern human behaviour, famously proclaiming that \"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.\"Hume was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle. He maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the is\u2013ought problem, or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a normative conclusion of what ought to be done.\n\nHume also denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only a bundle of sensations, and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions. Hume's compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom. His views on philosophy of religion, including his rejection of miracles and the argument from design for God's existence, were especially controversial for their time.\n\nHume influenced utilitarianism, logical positivism, the philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive science, theology, and many other fields and thinkers. Immanuel Kant credited Hume as the inspiration who had awakened him from his \"dogmatic slumbers.\"","b0b32487":"# Ricardo\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/dc\/Portrait_of_David_Ricardo_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg\/330px-Portrait_of_David_Ricardo_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg)\n\nDavid Ricardo (18 April 1772 \u2013 11 September 1823) was a British political economist, one of the most influential of the classical economists along with Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith and James Mill.

As a representative of the seventeenth-century tradition of rationalism, Leibniz developed, as his most prominent accomplishment, the ideas of differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton's contemporaneous developments.Mathematical works have consistently favored Leibniz's notation as the conventional expression of calculus. It was only in the 20th century that Leibniz's law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found mathematical implementation (by means of non-standard analysis). He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal's calculator, he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685 and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, which is the foundation of nearly all digital (electronic, solid-state, discrete logic) computers, including the Von Neumann machine, which is the standard design paradigm, or \"computer architecture\", followed from the second half of the 20th century, and into the 21st.\n\nIn philosophy, Leibniz is most noted for his optimism, i.e. his conclusion that our universe is, in a restricted sense, the best possible one that God could have created, an idea that was often lampooned by others such as Voltaire. Leibniz, along with Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three great 17th-century advocates of rationalism. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy also assimilates elements of the scholastic tradition, notably that conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence.\n\nLeibniz made major contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in philosophy, probability theory, biology, medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics, and computer science. He wrote works on philosophy, politics, law, ethics, theology, history, and philology. Leibniz also contributed to the field of library science. While serving as overseer of the Wolfenb\u00fcttel library in Germany, he devised a cataloging system that would serve as a guide for many of Europe's largest libraries.Leibniz's contributions to this vast array of subjects were scattered in various learned journals, in tens of thousands of letters, and in unpublished manuscripts. He wrote in several languages, primarily in Latin, French and German but also in English, Italian and Dutch. There is no complete gathering of the writings of Leibniz translated into English.","2751fa0e":"# Hegel\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/ce\/Hegel_by_Schlesinger.jpg\/330px-Hegel_by_Schlesinger.jpg)\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (27 August 1770 \u2013 14 November 1831) was a German philosopher, and the most important figure in German idealism. He is considered one of the fundamental figures of modern Western philosophy, with his influence extending to the entire range of contemporary philosophical issues, from aesthetics to ontology to politics, both in the analytic and continental tradition.\n\nHegel's principal achievement was his development of a distinctive articulation of idealism, sometimes termed absolute idealism, in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and subject and object are overcome. His philosophy of spirit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, art, religion and philosophy. His master\u2013slave dialectic has been influential, especially in 20th-century France. Of special importance is his concept of spirit (Geist, sometimes also translated as \"mind\") as the historical manifestation of the logical concept \u2013 and the \"sublation\" (Aufhebung, integration without elimination or reduction) \u2013 of seemingly contradictory or opposing factors: examples include the apparent opposition between necessity and freedom and between immanence and transcendence. (Hegel has been seen in the twentieth century as the originator of the thesis, antithesis, synthesis triad, but as an explicit phrase it originated with Johann Gottlieb Fichte.)\n\nHegel has influenced many thinkers and writers whose own positions vary widely. For example, \"the roots of post-structuralism and its unifying basis lies, in large part, in a general opposition not to the philosophical tradition tout court but specifically to the Hegelian tradition\" dominating philosophy in the twentieth century prior to post-structuralism. Paul Tillich wrote that the historical dialectical thought of Hegel \"has influenced world history more profoundly than any other structural analysis.\" Karl Barth described Hegel as a \"Protestant Aquinas\" while Maurice Merleau-Ponty wrote that \"all the great philosophical ideas of the past century\u2014the philosophies of Marx and Nietzsche, phenomenology, German existentialism, and psychoanalysis\u2014had their beginnings in Hegel.\"\n\nHegel's work has been considered the \"completion of philosophy\" by multiple of the most influential thinkers in existentialism, post-structuralism, and twentieth-century theology. Derrida wrote of Hegel in his work Of Grammatology that \"he undoubtedly summed up the entire philosophy of the logos. He determined ontology as absolute logic; he assembled all the delimitations of philosophy as presence,\" later remarking that Hegel is thus \"the last philosopher of the book and the first philosopher of writing,\" indicating the relation of Hegel to post-structural thought by stating \"if there were a definition of Diff\u00e9rance, it would be precisely the limit, the interruption, the destruction of the Hegelian dialectical synthesis wherever it operates.\"In his work Systematic Theology, theologian Paul Tillich referred to Hegel's work as \"perfect essentialism,\" later writing \"essentialism was in Hegel's system fulfilled.\" Martin Heidegger observed in his 1969 work Identity and Difference and in his personal Black Notebooks that Hegel's system in an important respect \"consummates western philosophy\"by completing the idea of the logos, the self-grounding ground, in thinking through the identification of Being and beings, which is \"the theme of logic\", writing \"It is... incontestable that Hegel, faithful to tradition, sees the matter of thinking in beings as such and as a whole, in the movement of Being from its emptiness to its developed fullness.\" Heidegger in various places further stated Hegel's thinking to be \"the most powerful thinking of modern times.\"","0668b61a":"# Heidegger\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/64\/Heidegger_2_%281960%29.jpg\/330px-Heidegger_2_%281960%29.jpg)\n\nMartin Heidegger (26 September 1889 \u2013 26 May 1976) was a German philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. He is best known for contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism.\n\nIn Being and Time (1927), Heidegger addresses the question of the meaning of \"being\", which \"is concerned with what it is that makes beings intelligible as beings\".Heidegger approaches this question through an analysis of Dasein, his term for the specific type of being that humans possess.The reason for this approach is that we already have a pre-ontological understanding of being that shapes how we experience the world. This conception of the human is in contrast with that of Rationalist thinkers like Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who had understood human existence most basically as thinking, as in Cogito ergo sum (\"I think therefore I am\").\n\nHeidegger's later work includes criticism of the view, common in the Western tradition, that all of nature is a \"standing reserve\" on call, as if it were a part of industrial inventory.","5181e4e4":"# Merleau-Ponty\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/98\/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty.jpg\/330px-Maurice_Merleau-Ponty.jpg)\n\nMaurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty (14 March 1908 \u2013 3 May 1961) was a French phenomenological philosopher, strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. The constitution of meaning in human experience was his main interest and he wrote on perception, art, politics, religion, psychology, psychoanalysis, language, nature, and history. He was the lead editor of Les Temps modernes, the leftist magazine he established with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in 1945.\n\nAt the core of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role perception plays in understanding the world as well as engaging with the world. Like the other major phenomenologists, Merleau-Ponty expressed his philosophical insights in writings on art, literature, linguistics, and politics. He was the only major phenomenologist of the first half of the twentieth century to engage extensively with the sciences and especially with Gestalt psychology. It is through this engagement that his writings became influential in the project of naturalizing phenomenology, in which phenomenologists use the results of psychology and cognitive science.\n\nMerleau-Ponty emphasized the body as the primary site of knowing the world, a corrective to the long philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of knowledge, and maintained that the body and that which it perceived could not be disentangled from each other. The articulation of the primacy of embodiment led him away from phenomenology towards what he was to call \u201cindirect ontology\u201d or the ontology of \u201cthe flesh of the world\u201d (la chair du monde), seen in his final and incomplete work, The Visible and Invisible, and his last published essay, \u201cEye and Mind\u201d.\n\nIn his earlier work, Merleau-Ponty supported Soviet communism while remaining critical of Soviet policies and Marxism in general, adopting a skeptical stance which he termed Western Marxism. His endorsement of the Soviet show trials and prison camps was published as Humanism and Terror in 1947, though he would later denounce Soviet terror as being counter to the purportedly humanist aims of the revolution.","f13d9e22":"# Spinoza\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/ea\/Spinoza.jpg\/330px-Spinoza.jpg)\n\nBaruch (de) Spinoza (born Baruch Espinosa; later as an author and a correspondent Benedictus de Spinoza, anglicized to Benedict de Spinoza; 24 November 1632 \u2013 21 February 1677) was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Sephardi origin. One of the early thinkers of the Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.Inspired by the groundbreaking ideas of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Spinoza became a leading philosophical figure of the Dutch Golden Age. Spinoza's given name, which means \"Blessed\", varies among different languages. In the Netherlands he used the Portuguese name Bento.In his Latin and Dutch works, he used Latin: Benedictus de Spinoza.\n\nSpinoza was raised in the Portuguese-Jewish community in Amsterdam. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine. Jewish religious authorities issued a herem. against him, causing him to be effectively expelled and shunned by Jewish society at age 23, including by his own family. His books were later added to the Catholic Church's Index of Forbidden Books. He was frequently called an \"atheist\" by contemporaries, although nowhere in his work does Spinoza argue against the existence of God.\n\nSpinoza lived an outwardly simple life as an optical lens grinder, collaborating on microscope and telescope lens designs with Constantijn and Christiaan Huygens. He turned down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. He died at the age of 44 in 1677 from a lung illness, perhaps tuberculosis or silicosis exacerbated by the inhalation of fine glass dust while grinding lenses. He is buried in the Christian churchyard of Nieuwe Kerk in The Hague.\n\nSpinoza's magnum opus, the Ethics, was published posthumously in the year of his death. The work opposed Descartes' philosophy of mind\u2013body dualism and earned Spinoza recognition as one of Western philosophy's most important thinkers. In it, \"Spinoza wrote the last indisputable Latin masterpiece, and one in which the refined conceptions of medieval philosophy are finally turned against themselves and destroyed entirely\". Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel said, \"The fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all.\" His philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted Gilles Deleuze to name him \"the 'prince' of philosophers.\"","d49635ec":"# Lewis\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/ad\/David-K.-Lewis.jpg)\n\nDavid Kellogg Lewis (September 28, 1941 \u2013 October 14, 2001) was an American philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. Lewis taught briefly at UCLA and then at Princeton University from 1970 until his death. He is closely associated with Australia, whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than 30 years.\n\nLewis made significant contributions in philosophy of mind, philosophy of probability, epistemology, philosophical logic, aesthetics, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of time and philosophy of science. In most of these fields he is considered among the most important figures of recent decades. But Lewis is most famous for his work in metaphysics, philosophy of language and semantics, in which his books On the Plurality of Worlds (1986) and Counterfactuals (1973) are considered classics. His works on the logic and semantics of counterfactual conditionals are broadly used by philosophers and linguists along with a competing account from Robert Stalnaker; together the Stalnaker-Lewis theory of counterfactuals has become perhaps the most pervasive and influential account of its type in the philosophical and linguistic literature. His metaphysics incorporated seminal contributions to quantified modal logic, the development of counterpart theory, counterfactual causation, and the position called \"Humean supervenience\". Most comprehensively in On the Plurality of Worlds, Lewis defended modal realism: the view that possible worlds exist as concrete entities in logical space, and that our world is one among many equally real possible ones.","f941664e":"# Aristortle\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg\/330px-Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg)","9311397e":"Now we are writting a class for text Summarization (copying this class from one of my Previous Notebooks)\nIf interested you can check it here:\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/vanvalkenberg\/text-summarization-using-spacy\n\nThe basic idea behind this algorithm is to find the sentence that has the maximum number of the most commonly used words in the text corpus after removing the stopwords (like the, is, that, etc).

Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels. His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in communication studies, anthropology, psychology, sociology, criminology, cultural studies, literary theory, feminism, Marxism and critical theory.\n\nBorn in Poitiers, France, into an upper-middle-class family, Foucault was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV, at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, and at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, The History of Madness (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, he produced The Birth of the Clinic (1963) and The Order of Things (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism, from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing called \"archaeology.\"\n\nFrom 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the University of Tunis before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris VIII. Foucault subsequently published The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the Coll\u00e8ge de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published Discipline and Punish (1975) and The History of Sexuality (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society.\n\nFoucault died in Paris from complications of HIV\/AIDS; he became the first public figure in France to die from complications of the disease.

His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American Revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nLocke's theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Locke was the first to define the self through a continuity of consciousness. He postulated that, at birth, the mind was a blank slate, or tabula rasa. Contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without innate ideas, and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience derived from sense perception, a concept now known as empiricism. Demonstrating the ideology of science in his observations, whereby something must be capable of being tested repeatedly and that nothing is exempt from being disproved, Locke stated that \"whatever I write, as soon as I discover it not to be true, my hand shall be the forwardest to throw it into the fire\". Such is one example of Locke's belief in empiricism.\n","7f4f3cc7":"# Plato\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/88\/Plato_Silanion_Musei_Capitolini_MC1377.jpg\/330px-Plato_Silanion_Musei_Capitolini_MC1377.jpg)\n\nPlato (428\/427 or 424\/423 \u2013 348\/347 BC) was an Athenian philosopher during the Classical period in Ancient Greece, founder of the Platonist school of thought and the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.\n\nHe is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy, along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle.Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality. The so-called Neoplatonism of philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry greatly influenced Christianity through Church Fathers such as Augustine. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: \"the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\"\n\nPlato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato is also considered the founder of Western political philosophy. His most famous contribution is the theory of Forms known by pure reason, in which Plato presents a solution to the problem of universals known as Platonism (also ambiguously called either Platonic realism or Platonic idealism). He is also the namesake of Platonic love and the Platonic solids.\n\nHis own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been along with Socrates, the pre-Socratics Pythagoras, Heraclitus and Parmenides, although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from Plato himself. Unlike the work of nearly all of his contemporaries, Plato's entire body of work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.

Kant's comprehensive and systematic works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him one of the most influential figures in modern Western philosophy.\n\nIn his doctrine of transcendental idealism, Kant argued that space and time are mere \"forms of intuition\" which structure all experience, and therefore that while \"things-in-themselves\" exist and contribute to experience, they are nonetheless distinct from the objects of experience. From this it follows that the objects of experience are mere \"appearances\", and that the nature of things as they are in themselves is consequently unknowable to us. In an attempt to counter the skepticism he found in the writings of philosopher David Hume, he wrote the Critique of Pure Reason (1781\/1787), one of his most well-known works. In it, he developed his theory of experience to answer the question of whether synthetic a priori knowledge is possible, which would in turn make it possible to determine the limits of metaphysical inquiry. Kant drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposal that the objects of the senses must conform to our spatial and temporal forms of intuition, and that we can consequently have a priori cognition of the objects of the senses.\n\nKant believed that reason is also the source of morality, and that aesthetics arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment. Kant's views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially the fields of epistemology, ethics, political theory, and post-modern aesthetics.He attempted to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and to move beyond what he believed to be the failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics. He wanted to put an end to what he saw as an era of futile and speculative theories of human experience, while resisting the skepticism of thinkers such as Hume. He regarded himself as showing the way past the impasse between rationalists and empiricists, and is widely held to have synthesized both traditions in his thought.\n\nKant was an exponent of the idea that perpetual peace could be secured through universal democracy and international cooperation, and that perhaps this could be the culminating stage of world history.The nature of Kant's religious views continues to be the subject of scholarly dispute, with viewpoints ranging from the impression that he shifted from an early defense of an ontological argument for the existence of God to a principled agnosticism, to more critical treatments epitomized by Schopenhauer, who criticized the imperative form of Kantian ethics as \"theological morals\" and the \"Mosaic Decalogue in disguise\", and Nietzsche, who claimed that Kant had \"theologian blood\"and was merely a sophisticated apologist for traditional Christian faith. Beyond his religious views, Kant has also been criticized for the racism presented in some of his lesser-known papers, such as \"On the Use of Teleological Principles in Philosophy\" and \"On the Different Races of Man\". Although he was a proponent of scientific racism for much of his career, Kant's views on race changed significantly in the last decade of his life, and he ultimately rejected racial hierarchies and European colonialism in Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch (1795).\n\nKant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history during his lifetime. These include the Universal Natural History (1755), the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), the Critique of Judgment (1790), Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason (1793), and the Metaphysics of Morals (1797).","efb27c87":"# Popper\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/43\/Karl_Popper.jpg\/330px-Karl_Popper.jpg)\n\nSir Karl Raimund Popper CH FBA FRS (28 July 1902 \u2013 17 September 1994) was an Austrian-British[10] philosopher, academic and social commentator.\n\nOne of the 20th century's most influential philosophers of science, Popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method in favour of empirical falsification. According to Popper, a theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can (and should) be scrutinised with decisive experiments. Popper was opposed to the classical justificationist account of knowledge, which he replaced with critical rationalism, namely \"the first non-justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy\".\n\nIn political discourse, he is known for his vigorous defence of liberal democracy and the principles of social criticism that he believed made a flourishing open society possible.

Fichte also wrote works of political philosophy; he has a reputation as one of the fathers of German nationalism.","a9d0a65b":"# Marx\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d4\/Karl_Marx_001.jpg\/330px-Karl_Marx_001.jpg)\n\nKarl Heinrich Marx FRSA (5 May 1818 \u2013 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher, economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist and socialist revolutionary. Born in Trier, Germany, Marx studied law and philosophy at university. He married Jenny von Westphalen in 1843. Due to his political publications, Marx became stateless and lived in exile with his wife and children in London for decades, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and publish his writings, researching in the reading room of the British Museum. His best-known titles are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto and the three-volume Das Kapital (1867\u20131883). Marx's political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent intellectual, economic and political history. His name has been used as an adjective, a noun and a school of social theory.\n\nMarx's critical theories about society, economics and politics, collectively understood as Marxism, hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages.Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socio-economic systems and that those would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers.Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.\n\nMarx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history and his work has been both lauded and criticised. His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to capital and subsequent economic thought. Many intellectuals, labour unions, artists and political parties worldwide have been influenced by Marx's work, with many modifying or adapting his ideas. Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.","19c11377":"# Deleuze\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/d\/de\/Gilles_Deleuze.jpg)\n\nGilles Deleuze (18 January 1925 \u2013 4 November 1995) was a French philosopher who, from the early 1950s until his death in 1995, wrote on philosophy, literature, film, and fine art. His most popular works were the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Anti-Oedipus (1972) and A Thousand Plateaus (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst F\u00e9lix Guattari. His metaphysical treatise Difference and Repetition (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus. An important part of Deleuze's oeuvre is devoted to the reading of other philosophers: the Stoics, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, and Bergson, with particular influence derived from Spinoza.A. W. Moore, citing Bernard Williams's criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the \"greatest philosophers\". Although he once characterized himself as a \"pure metaphysician\",[16] his work has influenced a variety of disciplines across the humanities, including philosophy, art, and literary theory, as well as movements such as post-structuralism and postmodernism.","0e8bf2b2":"# Derrida\n\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/9c\/Derrida_Dibujo.jpg\/330px-Derrida_Dibujo.jpg)\n\nJacques Derrida (July 15, 1930 \u2013 October 9, 2004) was a French philosopher best known for developing a form of semiotic analysis known as deconstruction, which he analyzed in numerous texts, and developed in the context of phenomenology.He is one of the major figures associated with post-structuralism and postmodern philosophy.\n\nDuring his career Derrida published more than 40 books, together with hundreds of essays and public presentations. He had a significant influence on the humanities and social sciences, including philosophy, literature, law, anthropology,historiography, applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis and political theory.\n\nHis work retains major academic influence throughout the US continental Europe, South America and all other countries where continental philosophy has been predominant, particularly in debates around ontology, epistemology (especially concerning social sciences), ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and the philosophy of language. In most of the Anglosphere, where analytic philosophy is dominant, Derrida's influence is most presently felt in literary studies due to his longstanding interest in language and his association with prominent literary critics from his time at Yale. He also influenced architecture (in the form of deconstructivism), music,art, and art criticism.\n\nParticularly in his later writings, Derrida addressed ethical and political themes in his work. Some critics consider Speech and Phenomena (1967) to be his most important work. Others cite: Of Grammatology (1967), Writing and Difference (1967), and Margins of Philosophy (1972). These writings influenced various activists and political movements. He became a well-known and influential public figure, while his approach to philosophy and the notorious abstruseness of his work made him controversial."}}
