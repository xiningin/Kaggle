That can be found in *g_research_data* file.\n- I am formatting the timestamp to match my future use.\n- I created a transformer for properly setting the attributes. At this point, I am using *DFAttributesTypeTransformer* from the file *g_research_transformations*.\n\n> NOTE: In the file *g_research_transformations*, I am using the same interface for all the transformation classes. That is why you can see some parent class and then children classes.","53ccb3c3":"In following cell I am going to create a grouped *high* column.

I created a transformer class that can do the grouping based on time window and create attributes relevant to cryptocurrency trading.  \n\nThe transformer *GroupDFBlocksByTimeTransformer* from the file *g_research_transformations* is used as follows:\n- First parameter is a data frame with date time attribute in datetime index format and another column to be transformer. \n- Second parameter is the name of the date time attribute.\n- Third parameter is the window lenght as in [here](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/docs\/reference\/api\/pandas.Series.dt.floor.html). Examples:\n    - \"15min\", \"75min\", ... for minutes,\n    - \"1H\", ... for hours,\n    - \"1D\", ... for days.\n- Fourth parameter is the name of grouping function. Currently available are: \"mean\", \"max\", \"min\", \"first\", \"last\".\n\nLet us have a look at examples useful for our usecase.","a1a9b242":"> **TO USE THE WHOLE DATA SET JUST DELETE THE FOLLOWING CELL**","35fe32a0":"## General Python Libraries","af172975":"## Recreating the Data Frame\n\nLet us use the former to recreate all the OHLC attributes (Open, High, Low, Close) for window length 10 minutes.","1e2b1072":"## Reading the Data\n\nFirst of all, I read the data from the file.\n\n> **NOTE:** In this notebook, I am using just a sample of the data, of course can be replaced by the whole data set.

This approach allows you to change the name of attribute on one place without affecting the code.\n- Grouping by time. This is very important feature. The basic goal is to get the trading data set with all its attributes, but on different scale."}}
