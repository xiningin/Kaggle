Let's see what the family situation was like: ","0318a3a4":"Interesting. Looks like the majority of people who boarded in Queenstown were not assigned any specific cabins. Or at least there aren't any records about them. After a simple Google search, I found the route for Titanic and it looks like the ship started its journy from South Hampton (where it loaded the majority of the passengers), made a stop in Cherbourg and then made a last stop in Queenstown. So the people who boarded from Queenstown were probably poor people who were just happy to be on the ship and travel to US, regardless of the cabin types they were getting. ","3766aba4":"*Alright, can't help but wonder how many people were on board with family members? the data set has two columns that determine if a passenger had a parent\/child, or a sibling on board.

That being said, looks like there are more dependant (with family) women on borad compared to men and even children. I think maybe 16 is a little bit too old to count as a child considering how many teenagers used to travle on their own at the time for work (Ok, I am obviously under the influence of the movie but still...) .

Look at this. let's see what we have here: \n* so if you were a man, unfortunately it looks like you have a low survival chance on Titanic and it doesn't matter if you are with family members or not. Although if you are a rich man who is in first class on Titanic, you are twice as more likely to survive. \n* If you were a woman on Titanic your chances for survival would be pretty damn good! if you are a rich woman (regardless of whether you are traveling with family or not) you will certianly survive. Your chances of survival in 2nd class are still close to 100% ( pretty great!) but if you were in 3rd class, your chances of survival would plummet by 50%. Bad news for poor women!\n* If you were a child (or a young adult in our case) on Titanic, your chances of survival would really depend on whether you are with family members or not! even if you were a 3rd class passenger, your chances of survival would be twice as much if you were accompanied by a family member.
