In most cases, pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs from deep veins in the legs or, rarely, from veins in other parts of the body (deep vein thrombosis).\n\nBecause the clots block blood flow to the lungs, pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. However, prompt treatment greatly reduces the risk of death.

This symptom typically appears suddenly and always gets worse with exertion.\nChest pain. You may feel like you're having a heart attack. The pain is often sharp and felt when you breathe in deeply, often stopping you from being able to take a deep breath. It can also be felt when you cough, bend or stoop.\nCough. The cough may produce bloody or blood-streaked sputum.\nOther signs and symptoms that can occur with pulmonary embolism include:\n\nRapid or irregular heartbeat\nLightheadedness or dizziness\nExcessive sweating\nFever\nLeg pain or swelling, or both, usually in the calf caused by a deep vein thrombosis\nClammy or discolored skin (cyanosis)","257dff3b":"The DICOM files contains a lot of infomation in addition to the raw pixel values.
