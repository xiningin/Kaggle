It is an expansion of bivariate data analysis, which considers only two variables in its models. As multivariate models consider more variables, they can examine more complex phenomena and find data patterns that more accurately represent the real world.","27e9a306":"## Insights\n\n<font color='blue'>SkinThickness shows positive weak linear association with other variable in given dataset <font color = 'red'> ,(Except with Age) <\/font>.<\/font> That means On increasing SkinThickness in patients, Other variables will also increase.<font color = 'blue'>SkinThickness with Age show a weak negative correlation, that means on increasing SkinThickness , Age must decrease.<\/font>","177ea5c0":"## Insights\n\n<font color='blue'>DPF shows positive weak linear association with other variable in given dataset.<\/font> That means On increasing DPF in patients, Other variables will also increase.","f30e0b4a":"### Summary ==>\n\nWe can clearly see that data points are not seperable linearly according to Outcome. <font color = 'blue'>Distribution of variables are normal<\/font>, In some variables they are skewed to right due to Outliers.

I can see in Pregnancies column, minimum is 0 (May be this is sign for no pregnancy) which is considerable, But maximum month of pregnancy is 17 which does not make any sense.
