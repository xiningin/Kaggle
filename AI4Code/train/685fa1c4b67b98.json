A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are learned.\n\nThe same kind of machine learning model can require different constraints, weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns. These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem. Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined loss function on given independent data. The objective function takes a tuple of hyperparameters and returns the associated loss.Cross-validation is often used to estimate this generalization performance.","22710a2a":"# **Deep Learning Algorithms**","96dab10a":"Normal Probability Plot","5b886cb4":"# Hyperparameter Optimization","c698fb2e":"**Correlation data**","18da6fa2":"When two sets of data are strongly linked together we say they have a High Correlation.

It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive).\n\nThe F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall). The F1 score is also known as the S\u00f8rensen\u2013Dice coefficient or Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).\n\n\n"}}
