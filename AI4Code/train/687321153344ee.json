It is designed to be compatible with many existing CPU tools, such as Pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc. It enables **massive** acceleration of many data-science and machine learning tasks, oftentimes by a factor fo 100X, or even more. \n\nRapids is still undergoing developemnt, and as of right now it's not availabel in the Kaggle Docker environment. If you are interested in installing and riunning Rapids locally on your own machine, then you should [refer to the followong instructions](https:\/\/rapids.ai\/start.html).\n\nIn order to install Rapids locally we'll be follow the setup that was inmplemented by Chris Deotte in [the following kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/rapids-data-augmentation-mnist-0-985)."}}
