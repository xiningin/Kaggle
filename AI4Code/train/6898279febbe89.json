A number of students have been observed and their hours of study along with their grades are recorded. This will be our training data. Our goal is to design a model that can predict the marks if number of hours studied is provided. Using the training data, a regression line is obtained which will give minimum error. This linear equation is then used to apply for a new data. That is, if we give the number of hours studied by a student as an input, our model should be able to predict their mark with minimum error.\n\n","391943d8":"Hi Everyone,\nI am a beginner, so I hope this helps us together understand how to conduct Data Analysis in python!\nWe will start off by importing the necessary libraries!","80cc8e57":"Looking at the head of our data, we can see that there are several columns including the ranking, institution name, country, and various parameters in the basis of which one could predict the university ranking!","6c69b938":"Wow! Such a relief that there are no null values in any of the columns. It would save our time from doing feature engineering on the data! Oh wait, seems like we had a confusion. On checking the 10th row, we see that there are 200 missing entries.\n\nExcept the institution name and country column, all the other columns have only numerical entries."}}
