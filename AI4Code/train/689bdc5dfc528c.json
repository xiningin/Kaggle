most common (blue outline, Gleason pattern 3) and second most common (red outline, Gleason pattern 4) cancer growth patterns present in the biopsy dictate the Gleason score (3+4 for this biopsy),

Biopsies not containing cancer are represented by an ISUP grade of 0 in this challenge.\n\nLet's also look at the class distribution.","4b99aa91":"So the basic preprocessing I've done is:-\n* Normalizing the images.\n* Reshape the images to be of shape 224,224,3\n* Basic image augmentation like rotation, flipping etc.","124aff17":"Hey guys, this kernel is a very simple baseline for the competition and I train the images using Keras VGG16. \n\nI'll keep making changes to the kernel as I'm trying to improve the model. If you like the kernel, **Don't forget to upvote**.","dade6762":"## About the competition\n\nWith more than 1 million new diagnoses reported every year, prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among males worldwide that results in more than 350,000 deaths annually. The key to decreasing mortality is developing more precise diagnostics. Diagnosis of PCa is based on the grading of prostate tissue biopsies. These tissue samples are examined by a pathologist and scored according to the Gleason grading system. In this challenge, we have to develop models for detecting PCa on images of prostate tissue samples.\n\nThe training set consists of around 11,000 whole-slide(WSI) images of digitized H&E-stained biopsies(a standard way of staining the originally transparent tissue to produce some contrast) originating from Radboud University Medical Center and Karolinska Institute(the data_provider field in train\/test corresponds to this).\n\nThe data is provided in 4 parts:-\n* train.csv:- That contains the image_id,name of either of the two data provider, gleason and ISUP grade.\n* test.csv:- containing just image_ids and data_provider.\n* train_images:- A folder containing biopsy images in a large multilevel .tiff file.(some of these images will be used for testing).\n* tarin_label_masks:-A folder containing segmentation masks showing which parts of the image led to the ISUP grade. Not all training images have label masks, and there may be false positives or false negatives in the label masks for a variety of reasons. These masks are provided to assist with the development of strategies for selecting the most useful subsamples of the images. The mask values also depend on the data provider.","f7789da0":"These images are pretty big in size for training I'll be using the resized 512x512 dataset uploaded by @xhlulu.","9bd81fec":"We are asked to predict ISUP grade(scale 0-5) for each prostate biopsy image, which is in turn derived from the gleason score(three categories 3,4,5).Before diving deeper into the competition let's try to understand these first.\n\n## Gleason Score:-\nSince prostate tumors are often made up of cancerous cells that have different grades, two grades are assigned for each patient.  A primary grade is given to describe the cells that make up the largest area of the tumor and a secondary grade is given to describe the cells of the next largest area.  For instance, if the Gleason Score is written as 3+4=7, it means most of the tumor is grade 3 and the next largest section of the tumor is grade 4, together they make up the total Gleason Score.  If the cancer is almost entirely made up of cells with the same score, the grade for that area is counted twice to calculated the total Gleason Score. \n\nThe samples are made up of glandular tissue and connective tissue. The glands are hollow structures, which can be seen as white \u201choles\u201d or branched cavities in the WSI. The appearance of the glands forms the basis of the Gleason grading system.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.prostateconditions.org\/images\/about\/murtagh7e_c114_f04-2.png)\n\n\nThis is how Gleason score is decided from(3-5), 5 being the most severe. To understand more [read this](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment\/overview\/additional-resources).\n\n\n## ISUP grade\nAccording to current guidelines by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP), the Gleason scores are summarized into an ISUP grade on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following rule:\n\n* Gleason score 6 = ISUP grade 1\n* Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) = ISUP grade 2\n* Gleason score 7 (4 + 3) = ISUP grade 3\n* Gleason score 8 = ISUP grade 4\n* Gleason score 9-10 = ISUP grade 5.\n\nAn example as provided on the official page of the competition can make us understand better.","48493c33":"\nLet's take a look at one of the biopsy.","ba729412":"The classes are imbalanced, more severe cases are underrepresented.\n\nLet's start preparing the images for training.","53bf625d":"Let's take a look at the architecture."}}
