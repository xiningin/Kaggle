However, punctuations like periods and exclamation marks can create multiple ids for the same word. For example, \"bye\" and \"bye!\" would generate two different word ids.\n\nImplement the function `token_lookup` to return a dict that will be used to tokenize symbols like \"!\" into \"||Exclamation_Mark||\".  Create a dictionary for the following symbols where the symbol is the key and value is the token:\n- Period ( **.** )\n- Comma ( **,** )\n- Quotation Mark ( **\"** )\n- Semicolon ( **;** )\n- Exclamation mark ( **!** )\n- Question mark ( **?** )\n- Left Parentheses ( **(** )\n- Right Parentheses ( **)** )\n- Dash ( **-** )\n- Return ( **\\n** )\n\nThis dictionary will be used to tokenize the symbols and add the delimiter (space) around it.  This separates each symbols as its own word, making it easier for the neural network to predict the next word. Make sure you don't use a value that could be confused as a word; for example, instead of using the value \"dash\", try using something like \"||dash||\".","42ee5bbc":"### Hyperparameters\n\nSet and train the neural network with the following parameters:\n- Set `sequence_length` to the length of a sequence.\n- Set `batch_size` to the batch size.\n- Set `num_epochs` to the number of epochs to train for.\n- Set `learning_rate` to the learning rate for an Adam optimizer.\n- Set `vocab_size` to the number of unique tokens in our vocabulary.\n- Set `output_size` to the desired size of the output.\n- Set `embedding_dim` to the embedding dimension; smaller than the vocab_size.\n- Set `hidden_dim` to the hidden dimension of your RNN.\n- Set `n_layers` to the number of layers\/cells in your RNN.\n- Set `show_every_n_batches` to the number of batches at which the neural network should print progress.\n\nIf the network isn't getting the desired results, tweak these parameters and\/or the layers in the `RNN` class.","c163d091":"---\n# Checkpoint\n\nAfter running the above training cell, your model will be saved by name, `trained_rnn`, and if you save your notebook progress, **you can pause here and come back to this code at another time**.

In addition, I decreased batch_size to 128 to add some noise and improve the generalization.\n\nBy doing these changes, this was the result:\n\n    Epoch:    5\/10    Loss: 3.4381761382818223\n    \n                    ...\n                    \n    Epoch:   10\/10    Loss: 3.182987419128418    \n    \nI decided not to change the rest of the hyperparameters, since an acceptable loss (3.18) was reached. However, some considerations can be made if some changes are considered for these hyperparameters:\n\n- sequence_length: the lower the sequence length, the faster the training but the lesser the consideration for long blocks of text. Depending on the nature of the text (in this case a script), a larger sequence_length would be better for the generation of new similar text.\n- batch_size: a good starting point would be to choose a value between 32 and 256.\n- learning_rate: 0.001 is a good starting learning rate. In order to decrease training time, this value could be increased carefully (0.01 would be a good increased value).\n- embedding_dim: a value between 200 and 400 would be a good starting value. The greater the number, the more information is extracted from the embedding, but the higher the number of operations and memory needed.\n- hidden_dim: Usually larger is better performance wise. Common values are 128, 256, 512, etc.\n- n_layers: a good number of layers would be 2 or 3. A larger number could also be used but the error wouldn't have decreased much while increasing the training time significantly.\n\n","429a2a0b":"### Define forward and backpropagation\n\nUse the RNN class you implemented to apply forward and back propagation. This function will be called, iteratively, in the training loop as follows:\n```\nloss = forward_back_prop(decoder, decoder_optimizer, criterion, inp, target)\n```\n\nAnd it should return the average loss over a batch and the hidden state returned by a call to `RNN(inp, hidden)`. Recall that you can get this loss by computing it, as usual, and calling `loss.item()`.\n\n**If a GPU is available, you should move your data to that GPU device, here.**","37cdd35c":"### Generate a New Script\nIt's time to generate the text. Set `gen_length` to the length of TV script you want to generate and set `prime_word` to one of the following to start the prediction:\n- \"jerry\"\n- \"elaine\"\n- \"george\"\n- \"kramer\"\n\nYou can set the prime word to _any word_ in our dictionary, but it's best to start with a name for generating a TV script.
