In this report I will attempt to explore the dataset. Based on 6 different factors that could explain the happiness level of a country.

Healthy life expectancy\n2. Log of GDP per capita\n3. Generosity\n4. Corruption\n5. Freedom\n6. Social support\n\nI am seeking to understand what makes people happy in stable and predictable environment. Therefore, I will explore the dataset from 2019 excluding the current COVID-19 pandemic. Understandably, due to uncertainty, instability and disappointment happiness has declined in 2020. Hopefully once a recovery is underway it will allow economic activities to resume and resolve the damage done by the COVID-19 outbreak. Once recovery from COVID-19 is completed the key findings and insight become relevant again.","3692f5a1":"**Fig. 6c Line Log of GDP per capita chart of all countries**","111900d7":"**Some calculations:**","8984d5e5":"Let's focus our data on the 6 happiness-related factors and the countries score from the ladder.

Also, the level of public transport present in a country is, in my opinion, important. Having Traveled Europe, good and well-maintained infrastructure usually meant a people were happier (as an observational paradigm). Thus, this data could improve the happiness indicator and prediction model and perhaps help explain and proof different correlation and causations.","9467639c":"I am going to choose an arbitrary threshold of 25. The threshold seem most appropriate due to the fact that the top happiest countries have an average of 20 with each of the above indicators.

Whilst the Log of GDP per capita', 'Healthy life expectancy and 'Social support' have a clear(-er) pattern visibly.","b67dbf02":"The charts and data seem to favor the null hypothisis (H0): Social support seems not to contributes to a country overall happiness. Because, according to our benchmark we see a clear nagative correlation between a country ladder score and the level of social support it provides. For example in the top 10 happiest countries only 1 country (Austria) provide an above average social support. This can be explained by different scenarios. For example, people are happier in countries where the majority have a better opportunity to earn a *good income. Good in a sense that the income covers the necessities and more.","3f6411ba":"The plan is to explore and visualize the data to understand and get intuition to discover new findings that will be useful later.","cd9d6942":"**Fig. 6b Line Healthy life expectancy chart of all countries**","3083693a":"Lets check for any significant outliers:","16c79c79":"Fig. 7 Barchart of top 20 countries"}}
