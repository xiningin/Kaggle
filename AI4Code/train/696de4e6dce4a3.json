As my analysis only cover analysis of each variable with the popularity it's impossible to tell.\n\nFor the image analysis, i found some pets with very low popularity very cute and vice versa.\n\nSo, i suspect that the models will have a very high error as the popularity score seems to me a bit random.\n\nFuthermore, training data seeems to have a high tendance around 25 of popularity. It would be interesting to have a model who return always 25 to see what happens.","9bc1d2f3":"As the correlation matrix show, it seems that the variables seems to not play a big part in order to determine if the pets are popular or not.","1cd36d7a":"## conclusion","5762f0ab":"The popularity of the pets do not follow exactly the normal law. In fact we can see 3 extremums.\n\nThere is firstly a first peak around 1, meaning that there are photos who are considered not popular at all. \n\nThen there is a second extremum who assemble who reunite a lot of datas around 25 meaning that the majority of the photos are considered not very popular.\n\nFinally we can see a third peak at 100 meaning that there are a lot of pets considered very popular.","4714197e":"Some of the pets who have a terrible popularity are quite beautiful and i find other pets whith a high popularity not that cute.\n\nSo from a human perspective it's hard to determine by just looking at the picture if the pet is going to be popular or not.","09bda397":"# Analysis of pets data"}}
