In 2015, The Post documented more than two times more fatal shootings by police than had been recorded by the FBI.

This can be translated that men are more violent and law offenders. In race comparison we notice that more white people are killed, something that could mean that Police shooting is irrelevant with racist believes or that white people are more violent. Finally looking the age histogram we notice that from 18 age until the peak of 37 we have a expodential increasement of number of victims by police and from the peak until 90 we have a expodential decreaseemnt of number of victims.
