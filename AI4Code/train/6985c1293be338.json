This is based on the observation that the number of rides is fairly consistent day over day as is the average ride duration.\n\nConversely, casual user rentals are lower Monday through Thursday and trend upwards starting on Friday and peaking on the weekend.\n\nThis seems to indicate using the bikes for leisure activities such as touring the city, sightseeing, etc. Additional data that supports this is the longer average ride duration. \n\n#### My three recommendations for the new marketing strategy are as follows:\n\n1. Offer a weekend-only membership at a different price point than the full annual membership to entice casual users towards a full annual membership. They can only unlock bikes on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.\n2. Create a \"See our City\" campaign targeted to casual users that includes 52 suggested routes that will cover all of the major sights in Chicago---one for each weekend. Casual riders could rent as they go, but they could see their city in one year (and save money!) for the price of an annual membership.\n3.

Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\nUntil now, Cyclistic\u2019s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: `single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships`. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. \n\nCyclistic\u2019s finance analysts have `concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders`. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, `Moreno believes that ` `maximizing` the number of annual members will be key to `future growth`. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, `Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members`. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. \n\n<b> Moreno has set a clear goal: <\/b>\n\n- Design marketing strategies aimed at `converting casual riders into annual members`. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand `how annual members and casual riders differ`, `why casual riders would buy a membership`, and `how digital media could affect their marketing tactics`.
