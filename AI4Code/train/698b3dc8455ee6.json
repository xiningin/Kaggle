The MNIST dataset is a monochronic picture with a 28x28 size. We set the batch size to -1 in the shape argument so that it takes the shape of the features [\"x\"].\n* Here -1 for input x specifies that this dimension should be dynamically computed based on the number of input values in x, holding the size of all other dimensions constant. This allows us to treat batch_size(parameter with value -1) as a hyperparameter that we can tune.","0786b5b9":"### Build Model","9c7a4601":"### Preprocessing","481a5ec9":"Feel free to upvote if you this notebook helped you!","eba60558":"### View Prediction","eb152605":"## What is Classification?\n* Classification is a task that uses machine learning algorithms which learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. Example: classifying an email as 'spam' or 'not spam'.\n* There are many classification algorithms in ML.\n\n## What is an MLP Classifier?\n* Fullform - Multi-layer Perceptron\n* Library - Scikit-Learn\n* Easy to learn & implement\n* Relies on an underlying Neural Network to perform classification","f91c42e8":"### Submission"}}
