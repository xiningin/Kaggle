Human Development Index\n\n\"The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.\" (Human Development Reports)\n\n\"The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.\"(Human Development Reports)\n\nIt can be made a whole kernel only for HDI data.

Conclusions\n\nFirst of all I'd like to say that I'm not an expert in politics or economy, it's a subject that is interesting for me and I once I'm a beginner, I made this kernel to practice my code and tried to draw some conclusions. Said that:\n\nThrough this EDA we could see that along the years, countries tend to make polices for economic freedom aiming trades, property rights and sound money. Goverment size does not affect how economically free a country is, as I personally thought it'd be. So it's not about the size of a goverment, it's about the regulations made that allows economic freedom.\n\nWe also could observe that there is a positive correlation between countries with a high human development with countries economically free. The example of Chile that I took is one of those cases. Since the mid 70's Chile transformed it's economy by adopting these policies. Unfortunately the HDI started being mesured  in 1990 so we can't see how was Chile's index before these economics changes.\n\nOf course that's not the only reason that makes the HDI of country high, but it's interesting to see the relation of these features.","53ef086a":"It'll look like this:","e2d5f09b":"# Top 15 Most Economically Free Countries in 2016","736ebcf2":"These datasets don't have the same countries and years.

Merging Data Frames","bda6a3df":"<a id=\"about\"><\/a>\n# 2. About the Dataset\n\nThe Economic Freedom of the World Report made by Fraser Institute is the world\u2019s premier measurement of economic freedom, ranking countries based on five areas: size of government, legal structure and security of property rights, access to sound money, freedom to trade internationally, and regulation of credit, labour and business.\n\nThe institute divides and subdivides the characteristics for assessing the economic freedom of a country. The main ones are:\n\n<b>Area 1: Size of Government<\/b> \u2014 As government spending,\ntaxation, and the size of government-controlled enterprises\nincrease, government decision-making is substituted for\nindividual choice and economic freedom is reduced.\n\n<b>Area 2: Legal System and Property Rights<\/b> \u2014Protection of\npersons and their rightfully acquired property is a central\nelement of both economic freedom and civil society.\nIndeed, it is the most important function of government.\n\n<b>Area 3: Sound Money<\/b> \u2014 Inflation erodes the value of rightfully\nearned wages and savings. Sound money is thus essential\nto protect property rights. When inflation is not only high\nbut also volatile, it becomes difficult for individuals to plan\nfor the future and thus use economic freedom effectively.\n\n<b>Area 4: Freedom to Trade Internationally<\/b> \u2014 Freedom to\nexchange\u2014in its broadest sense, buying, selling, making\ncontracts, and so on\u2014is essential to economic freedom,\nwhich is reduced when freedom to exchange does not\ninclude businesses and individuals in other nations.\n\n<b>Area 5: Regulation<\/b> \u2014 Governments not only use a number\nof tools to limit the right to exchange internationally, they\nmay also develop onerous regulations that limit the right to\nexchange, gain credit, hire or work for whom you wish, or\nfreely operate your business.","88b5b6e1":"As we did with the Economic Freedom dataset, first let's check the data","25f7ee2f":"## Which Are The Least And Top Economically Free Countries?\n\nThe dataset has the index for each country since 1970 to 2016. We can check which ones are on the bottom an on the top of the last year measured.","7e971054":"It's possible to see in this plot that most of these countries always had a high index in economic freedom. Some have had great oscillations through the years probably generated by governments or historical events. \n\nExcept for Chile, it is the only south american country among the top 15 countries in 2016. And the most interesting fact is that Chile was a 4th quartile country by the middle of the 70's.","8541fffb":"## Were they always like that?","beb3892e":"## Loading Data","8f978298":"## Filling Missing Data\n\nAs we did with the first dataset, the NaN values will be replaced with countries median","e49e5eb5":"Among the BRICS, all countries have an index between 6.0 and 7.0 except for Brazil that stays below 6.0.\n\nThere is no oscillation for Russia until 1990 probaly because it was one of those Null values filled by the median.","aa38b3cc":"## Dropping Features With More Than 1242 Null Values\n\nHere I'm going to let only the variables that has more than 1\/3 of non-null values.

Only in Venezula, the last country in 2016 rank, we can see a huge difference comparing to the others. \nVenezula has been facing one of it\u00b4s biggest crisis in these last few years.\n\nAnother observable fact is that most of them are african and asian countries, except for Argentina and Venezuela that are located in South America.

At college we were introduced to R, we learned how to make some plots and statistics tests (that was the main purpose). I even ran two kernels in R to practice EDA and Machine Learning. \n\nBut realized that most of data scientists work with Python, and it was much more used than R. So I've decided to learn and check the advantages of the language. \n\nSo I'm running my first kernel in Python to take some insights and to practice Python a little.\n\nOnce I'm a begginner in data science, I really appreciate if you can tell me whether the analysis is pursuing for a correct logical, the topics I can improve or what else I could do using this dataset.","e94d6495":"<a id=\"briccs\"><\/a>\n# 5. BRICS & Chile\n\nOnce we talking about country development, I decided to get BRICS' countries and compare them to Chile, which is the region where we saw a huge growth in its index.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar, BRICS is an acronym for the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Together they represent about 25% of the world's land mass and more than 40% of its population.","4a4a034a":"<a id=\"hdi_econ\"><\/a>\n# 8.
