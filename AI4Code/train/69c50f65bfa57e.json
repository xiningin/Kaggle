Traders are using those charts to to make trading decisions based on occurring patterns.\n\nThere are two main patterns that are used in candlestick charts. One is bullish and another one is bearish. \nBullish patters indicate that price of the stock is likely to rise, while Bearish patter indicate fall in the stock price. However one must remember that candlestick charts and its patterns are representing only tendencies in price movement.\n\nHere's image I made that explains Candlestick's\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/BztW98W\/Bearish-Redish.png\" alt=\"Bearish-Redish\" border=\"0\" \/>\n\n\n","28c113a1":"## Introduction\nIn this kernel I will deliver EDA and Forecast for Stock Prices from Spanish Stocks Historical Data. <br>\nDataset which will be primary focus of the work is about the company named <b>Repsol S.A<\/b>\n\nRepsol is Spanish energy company that hires over 24,000 of employees world-wide. It operates in many areas of the oil and gas industry among which are exploration, production, refining and distribution of petrochemicals.","8c18c412":"## Importing Libraries","a095f573":"## Forecast\n\nForecasting will be done using Facebook's library called Prophet which was designed for time series forecasting and on top of that it is using Sklearn API so it should be quite easy to understand.\n\nProphet takes data as a dataframe and it use two main labels. One is \"ds\" as datastamp and another is \"y\" as value that we want to forecast.\nAfter we fit dataframe to model we make a forecast. As a result we are given dataframe with predicted values. Among those values are the boundaries of the uncertainty interval (lower and upper).\n","6e7c4a37":"As can be seen in Volume chart, either Volume of Repsol stock reached 0 or we have no information about volume of that stock.
