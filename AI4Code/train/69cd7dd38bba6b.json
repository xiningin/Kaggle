(customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.\n\nAn insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.\n\nFor example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000\/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000\/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.\n\nJust like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called \u2018sum assured\u2019) to the customer.","cda35634":"**Hense doing the same processing on test data will give us the same accuracy**","0b92f670":"> **Separating the Categorical data**","833bf800":"<font color=\"green\"><b>XGboost classifier AUC is : 85.63 <\/b><\/font>","5220fc25":"<font size=\"+1\" color='blue'><b> I hope you enjoyed this kernel , Please don't forget to appreciate me with an Upvote.<\/b><\/font>","3890a7b8":"> **Count of Gender with respect to the Previously injured**\n\n> **Response for MALE and Female are same**","54023abf":"**Hence data has been preprocessed we can perform some operations**","cc4b5030":"> **Reading dataset**","84a23d11":"> <font size=\"+1\" color=\"brown\"><b>Exploratory data analysis<\/b><\/font>\n\n> <font size=\"+1\" color=\"brown\"><b>Modeling and evaluation<\/b><\/font>","037a4fd2":"> **COUNT FOR VEHICLE DAMAGE vs RESPONSE**","d2d6ff3d":"![image](http:\/\/www.motortrainingschool.co.in\/images\/course-09.jpg)","1281ed4c":"<font size=\"+3\" color='#0000FF'><b> Problem Statement<\/b><\/font>","97cc4450":"<font size=\"+3\" color=\"#513B1C\"><b>Bussiness Goal<\/b><\/font>","876caf07":"<font color=\"green\"><b>Random Forest Classifier score is : 87.30<\/b><\/font>"}}
