There is no data about New York\n2. Some data in year 2020 is missing\n3. Around 1000 cities have reported only 1 accidents\n4. Los Angeles has the most number of deaths followed by Miami and Charlotte\n5. State of California has almost thrice the number of deaths than its successor Florida\n6. A high percentage of accidents happen between 3pm to 5pm maybe because the people who work in the day return during that time\n7. Most number of accidents have happened in the weekdays and there are less number of accidents in weekends which I found very odd\n8. A lot of missing data for years 2018 and 2019\n9. Although the number of accidents were pretty consistent thorughtout the rest of the years\n10. A large number of accidents have been classified with severity of 2, this also depends on the rules which are being used or modified to classify these accidents\n11. Less number of accidents have happened in foggy and cloudy conditions.","5bd87829":"# A Country-Wide Traffic Accident Dataset(2016 - 2020)\n### The dataset contains around 1.5 million records. It has records from  49 states out of 52 of U.S.A. The dataset was found on Kaggle ('https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sobhanmoosavi\/us-accidents'). The dataset has been collected real-time, using multiple traffic APIs. Currently, it contains accident data collected from February 2016 to Dec 2020 for the Contiguous United States.","a243f7ab":"### About the Project\n#### I personally love the part of data analytics where search the data find anomalies and make various types of visualizations.

The primary goal of EDA is to maximize the analyst's insight into the underlying structure of dataset, while providing allof the specific items that an analyst would want to extract from a dataset.\n\n### Main aim of performing EDA are:\n- Looking at data to understand what is on a browsing level\n- Performing investigations to understand data better\n- Looking for anomalies and patterns hidden in the data\n\n### Why is EDA so important:\n- Helps us understand data before coming to conclusions\n- Helps spot erroneous data trends and events\n- Backs up data with proof\n\n### Types of EDA:\n- Univariate Analysis :- Analysis of a single variable (Change in Age,Height)\n- Bivariate Analysis :- Analysis of two variables (Sport preferences for M\/F, GRE based score on age)\n- Multivariate Analysis :- Analysis based on more than two variables (Diabetes prediction based on age,insulin,BMI etc.)","88035fe4":"---","e9872ccb":"---","40cf4970":"### Anaslysing City column"}}
