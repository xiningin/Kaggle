At each step, we toggle one feature on or off at random, and if our estimator performs better using this set of features we continue onwards from there.\n\nIf the estimator performs worse, we _probably_ go back to the previous step and try again, but with a small probability \u2014 depending on just how much worse \u2014 we choose this new set of features anyway.  This helps us avoid getting stuck in a local minimum.\n\nTo make sure we still settle with a good set of features, we decrease the probability of accepting a worse state a little each step.\n\nNow, this is going to be a bit slow if we use our regular estimators for this competion, so just as in many other feature-selection techniques, it's probably better to use some very fast estimator that still can give us an idea of how important various features are.\n\nFor more details see the [repo](https:\/\/github.com\/chrka\/rwfs).","87719b6d":"And wee see that `defenders_in_the_box`, `distance`, and `quarter_4` retain their status of being the most important when we pick the features with more than 0.9 feature importance.\n\nDifferent runs can of course produce different results, but truly important features should still show up if we take enough steps and tune our parameters appropriately.

That gives us an idea of just how essential it is.\n\n`rwfs.feature_importances_` gives us this by computing the fraction of accepted stats the features are part of.
