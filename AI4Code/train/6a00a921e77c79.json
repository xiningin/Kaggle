This function will be called, iteratively, in the training loop as follows:\n```\nloss = forward_back_prop(decoder, decoder_optimizer, criterion, inp, target)\n```\n\nAnd it should return the average loss over a batch and the hidden state returned by a call to `RNN(inp, hidden)`. Recall that you can get this loss by computing it, as usual, and calling `loss.item()`.\n\n**If a GPU is available, you should move your data to that GPU device, here.**","71c1006e":"### Test your dataloader \n\nYou'll have to modify this code to test a batching function, but it should look fairly similar.\n\nBelow, we're generating some test text data and defining a dataloader using the function you defined, above. Then, we are getting some sample batch of inputs `sample_x` and targets `sample_y` from our dataloader.\n\nYour code should return something like the following (likely in a different order, if you shuffled your data):\n\n```\ntorch.Size([10, 5])\ntensor([[ 28,  29,  30,  31,  32],\n        [ 21,  22,  23,  24,  25],\n        [ 17,  18,  19,  20,  21],\n        [ 34,  35,  36,  37,  38],\n        [ 11,  12,  13,  14,  15],\n        [ 23,  24,  25,  26,  27],\n        [  6,   7,   8,   9,  10],\n        [ 38,  39,  40,  41,  42],\n        [ 25,  26,  27,  28,  29],\n        [  7,   8,   9,  10,  11]])\n\ntorch.Size([10])\ntensor([ 33,  26,  22,  39,  16,  28,  11,  43,  30,  12])\n```\n\n### Sizes\nYour sample_x should be of size `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or (10, 5) in this case and sample_y should just have one dimension: batch_size (10). \n\n### Values\n\nYou should also notice that the targets, sample_y, are the *next* value in the ordered test_text data. So, for an input sequence `[ 28,  29,  30,  31,  32]` that ends with the value `32`, the corresponding output should be `33`.","44fd6343":"**Answer:** (Write answer, here)","bfd64deb":"---\n## Build the Neural Network\nImplement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/master\/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM\/GRU hidden state\n - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n \nThe initialize function should create the layers of the neural network and save them to the class. The forward propagation function will use these layers to run forward propagation and generate an output and a hidden state.\n\n**The output of this model should be the *last* batch of word scores** after a complete sequence has been processed. That is, for each input sequence of words, we only want to output the word scores for a single, most likely, next word.\n\n### Hints\n\n1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`\n2. You can get the last batch of word scores by shaping the output of the final, fully-connected layer like so:\n\n```\n# reshape into (batch_size, seq_length, output_size)\noutput = output.view(batch_size, -1, self.output_size)\n# get last batch\nout = output[:, -1]\n```","737b8cc1":"### Tokenize Punctuation\nWe'll be splitting the script into a word array using spaces as delimiters.  However, punctuations like periods and exclamation marks can create multiple ids for the same word. For example, \"bye\" and \"bye!\" would generate two different word ids.\n\nImplement the function `token_lookup` to return a dict that will be used to tokenize symbols like \"!\" into \"||Exclamation_Mark||\".  Create a dictionary for the following symbols where the symbol is the key and value is the token:\n- Period ( **.** )\n- Comma ( **,** )\n- Quotation Mark ( **\"** )\n- Semicolon ( **;** )\n- Exclamation mark ( **!** )\n- Question mark ( **?** )\n- Left Parentheses ( **(** )\n- Right Parentheses ( **)** )\n- Dash ( **-** )\n- Return ( **\\n** )\n\nThis dictionary will be used to tokenize the symbols and add the delimiter (space) around it.  This separates each symbols as its own word, making it easier for the neural network to predict the next word. Make sure you don't use a value that could be confused as a word; for example, instead of using the value \"dash\", try using something like \"||dash||\".","f8238507":"## Explore the Data\nPlay around with `view_line_range` to view different parts of the data. This will give you a sense of the data you'll be working with. You can see, for example, that it is all lowercase text, and each new line of dialogue is separated by a newline character `\\n`.","8b31ce63":"---\n## Implement Pre-processing Functions\nThe first thing to do to any dataset is pre-processing.  Implement the following pre-processing functions below:\n- Lookup Table\n- Tokenize Punctuation\n\n### Lookup Table\nTo create a word embedding, you first need to transform the words to ids.  In this function, create two dictionaries:\n- Dictionary to go from the words to an id, we'll call `vocab_to_int`\n- Dictionary to go from the id to word, we'll call `int_to_vocab`\n\nReturn these dictionaries in the following **tuple** `(vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab)`","ae3ecc93":"### Question: How did you decide on your model hyperparameters? \nFor example, did you try different sequence_lengths and find that one size made the model converge faster?

Set `gen_length` to the length of TV script you want to generate and set `prime_word` to one of the following to start the prediction:\n- \"jerry\"\n- \"elaine\"\n- \"george\"\n- \"kramer\"\n\nYou can set the prime word to _any word_ in our dictionary, but it's best to start with a name for generating a TV script. (You can also start with any other names you find in the original text file!)","8b3f947d":"---\n# Checkpoint\n\nAfter running the above training cell, your model will be saved by name, `trained_rnn`, and if you save your notebook progress, **you can pause here and come back to this code at another time**. You can resume your progress by running the next cell, which will load in our word:id dictionaries _and_ load in your saved model by name!","c96880d6":"# The TV Script is Not Perfect\nIt's ok if the TV script doesn't make perfect sense. It should look like alternating lines of dialogue, here is one such example of a few generated lines.\n\n### Example generated script\n\n>jerry: what about me?\n>\n>jerry: i don't have to wait.\n>\n>kramer:(to the sales table)\n>\n>elaine:(to jerry) hey, look at this, i'm a good doctor.\n>\n>newman:(to elaine) you think i have no idea of this...\n>\n>elaine: oh, you better take the phone, and he was a little nervous.\n>\n>kramer:(to the phone) hey, hey, jerry, i don't want to be a little bit.(to kramer and jerry) you can't.\n>\n>jerry: oh, yeah. i don't even know, i know.\n>\n>jerry:(to the phone) oh, i know.\n>\n>kramer:(laughing) you know...(to jerry) you don't know.\n\nYou can see that there are multiple characters that say (somewhat) complete sentences, but it doesn't have to be perfect! It takes quite a while to get good results, and often, you'll have to use a smaller vocabulary (and discard uncommon words), or get more data.  The Seinfeld dataset is about 3.4 MB, which is big enough for our purposes; for script generation you'll want more than 1 MB of text, generally. \n\n# Submitting This Project\nWhen submitting this project, make sure to run all the cells before saving the notebook.

You'll be using the `generate` function to do this. It takes a word id to start with, `prime_id`, and generates a set length of text, `predict_len`. Also note that it uses topk sampling to introduce some randomness in choosing the most likely next word, given an output set of word scores!"}}
