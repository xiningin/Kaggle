Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like .csv, .tsv, or .xlsx. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with Matplotlib and Seaborn, Pandas provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.\n\nThe main data structures in Pandas are implemented with Series and DataFrame classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of Series instances. DataFrames are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (examples, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features of these instances."}}
