Both of these models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series (forecasting). ARIMA models are applied in some cases where data show evidence of non-stationarity, where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the \"integrated\" part of the model) can be applied one or more times to eliminate the non-stationarity.\nARIMA model is of the form: ARIMA(p,d,q): p is AR parameter, d is differential parameter, q is MA parameter\n### ARIMA(1,0,0)\n**y<sub>t<\/sub> = a<sub>1<\/sub>y<sub>t-1<\/sub> + \u03f5<sub>t<\/sub>**\n### ARIMA(1,0,1)\n**y<sub>t<\/sub> = a<sub>1<\/sub>y<sub>t-1<\/sub> + \u03f5<sub>t<\/sub> + b<sub>1<\/sub>\u03f5<sub>t-1<\/sub>**\n### ARIMA(1,1,1)\n**\u0394y<sub>t<\/sub> = a<sub>1<\/sub>\u0394y<sub>t-1<\/sub> + \u03f5<sub>t<\/sub> + b<sub>1<\/sub>\u03f5<sub>t-1<\/sub>** where **\u0394y<sub>t<\/sub> = y<sub>t<\/sub> - y<sub>t-1<\/sub>**","f8534d17":"## <a id='1.5'>1.5 Using date_range<\/a>","dd9f88ec":"\u03d5 is around 0.9 which is what we chose as AR parameter in our first simulated model.","c195f19a":"## <a id='4.1'>4.1 AR models<\/a>\n An autoregressive (AR) model is a representation of a type of random process; as such, it is used to describe certain time-varying processes in nature, economics, etc. The autoregressive model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term (an imperfectly predictable term); thus the model is in the form of a stochastic difference equation.\n #### AR(1) model\n R<sub>t<\/sub> = \u03bc + \u03d5R<sub>t-1<\/sub> + \u03b5<sub>t<\/sub>\n ##### As RHS has only one lagged value(R<sub>t-1<\/sub>)this is called AR model of order 1 where \u03bc is mean and \u03b5 is noise at time t\n If \u03d5 = 1, it is random walk.

Open-high-low-close Charts (or OHLC Charts) are used as a trading tool to visualise and analyse the price changes over time for securities, currencies, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. OHLC Charts are useful for interpreting the day-to-day sentiment of the market and forecasting any future price changes through the patterns produced.\n\nThe y-axis on an OHLC Chart is used for the price scale, while the x-axis is the timescale. On each single time period, an OHLC Charts plots a symbol that represents two ranges: the highest and lowest prices traded, and also the opening and closing price on that single time period (for example in a day). On the range symbol, the high and low price ranges are represented by the length of the main vertical line. The open and close prices are represented by the vertical positioning of tick-marks that appear on the left (representing the open price) and on right (representing the close price) sides of the high-low vertical line.\n\nColour can be assigned to each OHLC Chart symbol, to distinguish whether the market is \"bullish\" (the closing price is higher then it opened) or \"bearish\" (the closing price is lower then it opened).\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/datavizcatalogue.com\/methods\/images\/anatomy\/SVG\/OHLC_chart.svg\">\n\nSource: [Datavizcatalogue](https:\/\/datavizcatalogue.com\/methods\/OHLC_chart.html)","7a0d868e":"There are always better models.","7befe9c9":"### Generating a random walk","2512dd65":"### How to import data?\nFirst, we import all the datasets needed for this kernel.

Each symbol represents the compressed trading activity for a single time period (a minute, hour, day, month, etc). Each Candlestick symbol is plotted along a time scale on the x-axis, to show the trading activity over time.\n\nThe main rectangle in the symbol is known as the real body, which is used to display the range between the open and close price of that time period. While the lines extending from the bottom and top of the real body is known as the lower and upper shadows (or wick). Each shadow represents the highest or lowest price traded during the time period represented. When the market is Bullish (the closing price is higher than it opened), then the body is coloured typically white or green. But when the market is Bearish (the closing price is lower than it opened), then the body is usually coloured either black or red.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/datavizcatalogue.com\/methods\/images\/anatomy\/SVG\/candlestick_chart.svg\">\n\nCandlestick Charts are great for detecting and predicting market trends over time and are useful for interpreting the day-to-day sentiment of the market, through each candlestick symbol's colouring and shape. For example, the longer the body is, the more intense the selling or buying pressure is. While, a very short body, would indicate that there is very little price movement in that time period and represents consolidation.\n\nCandlestick Charts help reveal the market psychology (the fear and greed experienced by sellers and buyers) through the various indicators, such as shape and colour, but also by the many identifiable patterns that can be found in Candlestick Charts. In total, there are 42 recognised patterns that are divided into simple and complex patterns. These patterns found in Candlestick Charts are useful for displaying price relationships and can be used for predicting the possible future movement of the market. You can find a list and description of each pattern here.\n\nPlease bear in mind, that Candlestick Charts don't express the events taking place between the open and close price - only the relationship between the two prices. So you can't tell how volatile trading was within that single time period.\n\nSource: [Datavizcatalogue](https:\/\/datavizcatalogue.com\/methods\/candlestick_chart.html)","3f357749":"Now, for ARMA models.\n\n## <a id='4.3'>4.3 ARMA models<\/a>\nAutoregressive\u2013moving-average (ARMA) models provide a parsimonious description of a (weakly) stationary stochastic process in terms of two polynomials, one for the autoregression and the second for the moving average.
