Firstly, it would be good to know, how much percentage of each room_type makes up the total listings.

","e978627d":"Following are my conclusions and findings after analyzing the data:\n1. room_type: Majority of the listings belonged to the Entire room\/apt & Private room category. Shared Rooms were hardly listed. This observation is understandable as not many people would like to share their room with anyone. Furthermore, room_type percentage with respect to the neighbourhood_group was plotted, to give insights into the distribution\n2. neighbourhood_group: Maximum listings came from Brooklyn & Manhattan. Queens followed third with very small contributions from Bronx and Staten Island \n3. host_id: Hosts with the maximum listings were identified. The maximum number of listings by a single host was found to be 327\n4. price: Upon plotting the map, price was found to be higher in Northwest Brookyln and in southern Manhattan\n5. The correlation matrix and the histogram unfortunately revealed lack of correlation between the price and the other features. Had the correlation been slightly stronger an attempt would have been made to carry out some Machine learning on the data and validating it by setting aside a small portion of the data as test data","1f7f2f92":"I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the Stackoverflow community, as they have been my go to resource for all my data science related queries.
