In case of low exchange rate of national currency in country X, it's cheaper for other countries to import goods from country X. Consequently, if the exchange rate of national currency is high, country X is an importer and it's more affordable to buy goods from the foreign countries instead of producting them. \nIf exchange rate fluctuates widely, it could create uncertainty and instability on financial markets, for trading processes and etc, and lead to critical situations for the whole country.","3cccc7ac":"And after that make a barchart with those countries who faced systemic crisis and show how often did they have banking crisis.
