The cause of suicide is mostly family problems and somewhat due to diseases. Most of the cases are from married and divorce or widow peoples. Women who are housewives, people engaged in farming\/agricultural activities, children in primary, middle school, or no education suicided the most. The number of suicides increased in 2004 and from 2008 onwards took a massive increment. Males and the age group between 15-45 were involved in most suicides. Analysis of statewise and union territories is hard to interpret as the data is almost the same for all states and union territories for five parameters. The inefficiency of not knowing the exact reason for suicide or any of the five parameters for the cause of suicide is a drawback.*\n                                              ","082566d4":"##                                                         Conclusion","5760f71f":"**Plot for important parameters taken into account for suicide taking gender as a criterion**","33fa1a11":"**Plot for Year taking Gender as a criterion**","802623ca":"**Heatmap of Indian States and Union Teritories taking sub types under the parameters as a criterion**","31ac32d1":"**Heatmap of Indian States and Union Teritories taking Age Group as a criterion**","f1b34a4e":"**Getting overall info from the data**","7748d811":"**Plot for important parameters taken into account for suicide year after year**","56ec8710":"**Plot for important parameters taken into account for suicide taking age group as a criterion**","f3655420":"**Importing Libraries**","e5f65b8a":"**Plot for sub types under the parameters for the reason of suicide taking Age Group as a criterion**","c98ae7cb":"**Getting statistical info from the columns of data**","373462bc":"**Reading the data**","d275c691":"**Heatmap of Indian States and Union Teritories taking important parameters as a criterion**","1c635b53":"**Plot for Gender taking Age Group as a criterion**","eb90f52e":"**Plot for sub types under the parameters for the reason of suicide taking Gender as a criterion**","1a4eae5f":"**Plot for important parameters taken into account for suicide taking sub types under the parameters as a criterion**","b54a68ef":"**Visualizing the columns of data**"}}
