Model fitting and selection\nFor the model fitting, I will try out the following\n* Logistic regression in the primal space and with different kernels\n* SVM in the primal and with different Kernels\n* Ensemble models","334c6081":"The Df has 1000 rows with 14 attributes. We review this further to identify what attributes will be necessary and what data manipulation needs to be carried out before Exploratory analysis and prediction modelling","cf0dbd30":"We note the following:\n* There is no significant difference in the credit score distribution between retained and churned customers. \n* The older customers are churning at more than the younger ones alluding to a difference in service preference in the age categories. The bank may need to review their target market or review the strategy for retention between the different age groups\n* With regard to the tenure, the clients on either extreme end (spent little time with the bank or a lot of time with the bank) are more likely to churn compared to those that are of average tenure.\n*  Worryingly, the bank is losing customers with significant bank balances which is likely to hit their available capital for lending.\n* Neither the product nor the salary has a significant effect on the likelihood to churn.","2df8aac8":"### From the above results, my main aim is to predict the customers that will possibly churn so they can be put in some sort of scheme to prevent churn hence the recall measures on the 1's is of more importance to me than the overall accuracy score of the model.\n\n### Given that in the data we only had 20% of churn, a recall greater than this baseline will already be an improvement but we want to get as high as possible while trying to maintain a high precision so that the bank can train its resources effectively towards clients highlighted by the model without wasting too much resources on the false positives.\n\n### From the review of the fitted models above, the best model that gives a decent balance of the recall and precision is the random forest where according to the fit on the training set, with a precision score on 1's of 0.88, out of all customers that the model thinks will churn, 88% do actually churn and with the recall score of 0.53 on the 1's, the model is able to highlight 53% of all those who churned.","70821f04":"### Test model prediction accuracy on test data","fd5ebe51":"We note the following:\n* Majority of the data is from persons from France. However, the proportion of churned customers is with inversely related to the population of customers alluding to the bank possibly having a problem (maybe not enough customer service resources allocated) in the areas where it has fewer clients.\n* The proportion of female customers churning is also greater than that of male customers\n* Interestingly, majority of the customers that churned are those with credit cards. Given that majority of the customers have credit cards could prove this to be just a coincidence. \n* Unsurprisingly the inactive members have a greater churn. Worryingly is that the overall proportion of inactive mebers is quite high suggesting that the bank may need a program implemented to turn this group to active customers as this will definately have a positive impact on the customer churn.\n","b5433a55":"The precision of the model on previousy unseen test data is slightly higher with regard to predicting 1's i.e. those customers that churn. However, in as much as the model has a high accuracy, it still misses about half of those who end up churning. This could be imprved by providing retraining the model with more data over time while in the meantime working with the model to save the 41% that would have churned :-)","b053bfea":"So about 20% of the customers have churned. So the baseline model could be to predict that 20% of the customers will churn.\nGiven 20% is a small number,  we need to ensure that the chosen model does predict with great accuracy this 20% as it is of interest to the bank to identify and keep this bunch as opposed to accurately predicting the customers that are retained.","0af32d06":"From the above, we will not require the first 2 attributes as the are specific to a customer. It is borderline with the surname as this would result to profiling so we exclude this as well.","39b87848":"<img src=\"https:\/\/s16353.pcdn.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Churn.png\" style=\"float: left;\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\" \/>\n# PREVENTING BANK CUSTOMER CHURN!\n# \" Exploratory Data Analysis  & Prediction!\"\n\n# 2018\n\n[** by_Keldine Malit** ]"}}
