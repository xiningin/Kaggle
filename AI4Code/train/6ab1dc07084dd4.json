Therefore more than 3 times are the chances of survival when the nodes=0.\n\n3) When the number of nodes >= 3(or 4 approx.) the person is more likely to die. So we take 3(or 4 approx.) as a thershold we can classify between the two based on their probability value. When less than 3 the person is more likely to survive, so purely based on probability of fatality based on nodes the datapoints can be classified.","ef0af574":"About the features:\n\nage : It represents the age of the patient(person)\n\nyear : It basically represents the year of operation  from 1900\n\nnodes: Number of positive axillary nodes detected.\n\nstatus: Indicates whether patient(person) survived or not\n\nSurvived_5 = the patient survived 5 years or longer \n\nDied_5 = the patient died within 5 year\n\n# Objective\n\n To classify whether the patients who has undergone surgery(operation) survived or died based on the number\n of nodes found in their body as well as their age"}}
