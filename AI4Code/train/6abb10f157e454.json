Remember that with this algorithm, \n> The agent chooses moves to get a score that is as high as possible, and it assumes the opponent will counteract this by choosing moves to force the score to be as low as possible.\n\nConsider the toy example below of a game tree that the agent will use to select its next move.  \n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QlfWGM9.png\" width=80%><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nWhich move will the agent select?

In this case, \"alpha\" and \"beta\" to refer to two values that are maintained while the algorithm is running, that help to identify early stopping conditions.  \n\nWithout alpha-beta pruning, minimax evaluates each leaf node.  With alpha-beta pruning, minimax only evaluates nodes that could provide information that affects the agent's choice of action.  Put another way, it identifies nodes that could not possibly affect the final result and avoids evaluating them."}}
