If linear regression thinks that one of the feature is important, it gives high coefficient to this feature. However, this can cause overfitting that is like memorizing in KNN. In order to avoid overfitting, we use regularization that penalize large coefficients.\n\n* Ridge regression: First regularization technique. Also it is called L2 regularization. \n    * Ridge regression lost fuction = OLS + alpha * sum(parameter^2)\n    * alpha is parameter we need to choose to fit and predict. Picking alpha is similar to picking K in KNN. As you understand alpha is hyperparameter that we need to choose for best accuracy and model complexity. This process is called hyperparameter tuning.\n    * What if alpha is zero? lost function = OLS so that is linear rigression :)\n    * If alpha is small that can cause overfitting\n    * If alpha is big that can cause underfitting. But do not ask what is small and big. These can be change from problem to problem.\n* Lasso regression: Second regularization technique. Also it is called L1 regularization. \n    * Lasso regression lost fuction = OLS + alpha * sum(absolute_value(parameter))\n    * It can be used to select important features od the data.

As you can see in plot, when K is 1 it memozize train sets and cannot give good accuracy on test set (overfit). Also if K is 18, model is lead to underfit. Again accuracy is not enough.

Just I am kidding sorry for this :) (We actually did it at KNN part)\n* We only need is one line code that is GridSearchCV\n    * grid: K is from 1 to 50(exclude)\n    * GridSearchCV takes knn and grid and makes grid search. It means combination of all hyperparameters. Here it is k.\n","424b5399":"<a id=\"3\"><\/a> <br>\n### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)\n* In order to make something in data, as you know you need to explore data. Detailed exploratory data analysis is in my Data Science Tutorial for Beginners\n* I always start with *head()* to see features that are *pelvic_incidence,\tpelvic_tilt numeric,\tlumbar_lordosis_angle,\tsacral_slope,\tpelvic_radius* and \t*degree_spondylolisthesis* and target variable that is *class*\n* head(): default value of it shows first 5 rows(samples). If you want to see for example 100 rows just write head(100)\n","43a7e5d4":"As you can see *pelvic_incidence* and *pelvic_tilt numeric* are important features but others are not important\n\n<br> Now lets discuss accuracy. Is it enough for measurement of model selection. For example, there is a data that includes 95% normal and 5% abnormal samples and our model uses accuracy for measurement metric. Then our model predict 100% normal for all samples and accuracy is 95% but it classify all abnormal samples wrong. Therefore we need to use confusion matrix as a model measurement matris in imbalance data.\n<br> While using confusion matrix lets use Random forest classifier to diversify classification methods.\n* tp = true positive(20), fp = false positive(7), fn = false negative(8), tn = true negative(58) \n* tp = Prediction is positive(normal) and actual is positive(normal). \n* fp = Prediction is positive(normal) and actual is negative(abnormal).\n* fn = Prediction is negative(abnormal) and actual is positive(normal).\n* tn = Prediction is negative(abnormal) and actual is negative(abnormal)\n* precision = tp \/ (tp+fp)\n* recall = tp \/ (tp+fn)\n* f1 = 2 * precision * recall \/ ( precision + recall)\n\n","b0ecdcd4":"* Well, we fit the data and predict it with KNN. \n* So, do we predict correct or what is our accuracy or the accuracy is best metric to evaluate our result? Lets give answer of this questions\n<br> Measuring model performance:\n* Accuracy which is fraction of correct predictions is commonly used metric. We will use it know but there is another problem\n\n<br>As you see I train data with x (features) and again predict the x(features). Yes you are reading right but yes you are right again it is absurd :)\n\n<br>Therefore we need to split our data train and test sets.\n* train: use train set by fitting\n* test: make prediction on test set.\n* With train and test sets, fitted data and tested data are completely different\n* train_test_split(x,y,test_size = 0.3,random_state = 1)\n    * x: features\n    * y: target variables (normal,abnormal)\n    * test_size: percentage of test size. Example test_size = 0.3, test size = 30% and train size = 70%\n    * random_state: sets a seed. If this seed is same number, train_test_split() produce exact same split at each time\n* fit(x_train,y_train): fit on train sets\n* score(x_test,y_test)): predict and give accuracy on test sets","d520b77a":"<a id=\"9\"><\/a> <br>\n### PRE-PROCESSING DATA\n* In real life data can include objects or categorical data in order to use them in sklearn we need to encode them into numerical data\n* In data, class is *abnormal* and *normal*. Lets convert them into numeric value (actually I did it in logistic regression part with different method)\n* 2 different feature is created with the name *class_Abnormal* and *class_Normal*\n* However we need to drop one of the column because they are duplicated","3c87cd66":"### Up to this point what you learn:\n* Supervised learning\n* Exploratory data analysis\n* KNN\n    * How to split data\n    * How to fit, predict data\n    * How to measure medel performance (accuracy)\n    * How to choose hyperparameter (K)\n    \n**<br> What happens if I chance the title KNN and make it some other classification technique like Random Forest?**\n* The answer is **nothing**. What you need to is just watch a video about what is random forest in youtube and implement what you learn in KNN. Because the idea and even most of the codes (only KNeighborsClassifier need to be RandomForestClassifier ) are same. You need to split, fit, predict your data and measue performance and choose hyperparameter of random forest(like max_depth). ","1f4605dd":"Okay, as you understand in scatter matrix there are relations between each feature but how many *normal(green)* and *abnormal(red)* classes are there. \n* Searborn library has *countplot()* that counts number of classes\n* Also you can print it with *value_counts()* method\n\n<br> This data looks like balanced.

This is kind of like hyperparameter in KNN or regressions. \n* inertia: how spread out the clusters are distance from each sample\n* lower inertia means more clusters\n* What is the best number of clusters ?\n    *There are low inertia and not too many cluster trade off so we can choose elbow","62563e56":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a> <br>\n### CROSS VALIDATION\nAs you know in KNN method we use train test split with random_state that split exactly same at each time. However, if we do not use random_state, data is split differently at each time and according to split accuracy will be different. Therefore, we can conclude that model performance is dependent on train_test_split. For example you split, fit and predict data 5 times and accuracies are 0.89, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. Which accuracy do you use? Do you know what accuracy will be at 6th times split, train and predict. The answer is I do not know but if I use cross validation I can find acceptable accuracy.\n<br> Cross Validation (CV)\n* K folds = K fold CV.\n* Look at this image it defines better than me :)\n* When K is increase, computationally cost is increase\n* cross_val_score(reg,x,y,cv=5): use reg(linear regression) with x and y that we define at above and K is 5.
