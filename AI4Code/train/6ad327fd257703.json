In particular, when no suitable domain-specific resources are likely available at the starting. \nTo respond to the needs of medical experts to quickly and accurately receive answers to their scientific questions related to coronaviruses, we can develop QA systems based on articles related to COVID-19. Thus, the Kaggle opened this competition named the **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)** and proposed the **CORD-19** dataset that encompasses 120K articles about coronaviruses and other diseases. The competition offered more than ten tasks to cover some fundamental questions related to COVID 19 and provided the chance for the ML community to develop QA systems and employ them on the CORD-19 dataset.  In this notebook, we have been focused on finding answers for **What is the efficacy of novel therapeutics being tested currently?**. \n\" \n\n## Approaches\n\nTo do so, we implemented two frameworks (SBERT+BERT and LDA+ALBERT) that are based on advanced NLP and ML tools. This notebook is focusing on SBERT+BERT. In another notebook, we are using [LDA+ALBERT](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/parkyoona\/lda-albert-for-cord-19-data). \n\n### SBERT+BERT\nThe first framework based on [BERT](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1810.04805) model. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a well-known language representation model that is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from the unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. The pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just adding one additional output layer and can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference. \nIn this notebook, we are using Sentence-BERT ([SBERT](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1908.10084)) as well. SBER is an enhancement of the BERT and is useful in developing a semantic-based sentence embedding.\n\n### LDA+ALBERT\n\nThe second framework is based on [ALBERT](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1909.11942). \nALBERT has similar architecture as other BERT models, but it is based on a transformer encoder with Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELU) nonlinearities. ALBERT uses a different embedding method than BERT. In more detail, ALBERT uses two-step word embedding that first projects a word into a lower-dimensional embedding space and then extends it to the hidden space. Furthermore, ALBERT uses a cross-layer parameter sharing to improve parameter efficiency; it only uses feed-forward network (FFN) parameters across layers to share attention parameters. Another difference between ALBER and BERT is that ALBERT uses a sentence-order prediction (SOP) loss to avoid topic prediction and focus on modeling inter-sentence coherence.

The articles were first filtered using a keyword search which filters out articles that do not contain COVID-19 keywords in the titles. This reduced the number of scholarly articles from 120,464 to 31,450. Once filtered, the top n articles were extracted by embedding the query and the article titles using [Sentence-BERT](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1908.10084), measuring the cosine similarity between the query embedding and each article title embedding, and sorting the articles by the cosine similarity score. Only the top n articles with the highest cosine similarity scores were kept. In this experiment, we set n as 100.  We used a pre-trained Sentence-BERT model, ['bert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens'](https:\/\/github.com\/UKPLab\/sentence-transformers\/blob\/master\/docs\/pretrained-models\/sts-models.md). This model is a BERT-base model with mean-tokens trained on AllNLI and then on STS benchmark training set.\n\nOnce the top articles were extracted, the primary endpoint of each article was extracted using QA BERT. To do this, we set the question as the article title, the context as the article conclusion, and the answer as the primary endpoint of the article. We used a pre-trained QA BERT-large-uncased model with whole word masking fine-tuned on SQuAD, ['bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad'](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad#).
