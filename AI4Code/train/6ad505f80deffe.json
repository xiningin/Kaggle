It may be the case that caffeine allows one the possibility to improve their sleep through enabling one to be motivated enough to exercise (or anything in a similar vain).\n\nThanks for reading :)\n","ff316a8f":"### Exploration\nNow that our data is in a tidy format, we can now begin to explore and visualize the dataset.","962702d8":"### Correlation Matrix\nLet's start with a correlation matrix and display it as a heatmap to have a glance at the linear relationship between our variables and to see if there is anything that stands out to us.\n\nIt appears we have a decent linear relationship between Time in bed (hours) & Sleep quality (~0.711), this seems consistent with the general notion of sleeping more and feeling more refreshed.\n\nWe also notice there is a decent linear relationship between Worked out (whether our user worked out that particular day) & Drank Tea \/ Drank Coffee (~0.306 & ~0.377 respectively). It may be the case that this individual requires caffeine in order to jump start their morning to work out, or to make it through their work day and to have enough energy to hit the gym in the evening.","ea2dd536":"### Comparing Average Sleep Scores on Caffeine\nLet's take a closer look at the mean sleep scores (Sleep quality) to see if we can note anything of interest. We will group the days by the four different combinations of Drank Tea T\/F ~ Drank Coffee T\/F.\n\nInterestingly, this person gained sleep quality and slept slightly longer (20 minutes on average) on the days that they drank tea & coffee compared to no tea & coffee. This raises the question of whether the subjective sleep quality reported by the individual is an accurate representation of the true quality of their sleep indicated by their brain's sleep waves which will reduce in quality if an individual has caffeine in their system when they sleep as described in this the following study: (https:\/\/jcsm.aasm.org\/doi\/10.5664\/jcsm.3170). This individual also rarely worked out when they did not drink tea nor coffee, perhaps caffeine (tea or coffee) provides the motivation to begin a workout.\n","ac17e30b":"### Which days of the week was tea or coffee consumed?\nThe ratio of drank coffee (T) to not drank coffee (F) seems relatively consistent throughout Monday ~ Thursday, with Saturday having the largest disparity between coffee drank that day compared to not drank that day. Interestingly, Friday appears to have a low overall drank \/ not drank count. \n\nLooking at our weekly plot of whether this individual consumed tea, it appears that there is a preference for coffee on Sundays significantly more compared to tea, perahsp they are enjoying a lovely Sunday morning with a nice cuppa (of coffee).","a5d7bd85":"### Import Dataset","33c4338f":"### Cleaning the Data\nChecking the .head() of our dataframe shows that we need to do some cleaning up before we can begin exploring this dataset. Calling on the .dtypes of our dataframe also reveals that our variables are not in the correct format either.\n\nWe need to:\n* Change 'Start' and 'End' to the datetime format\n* Change 'Sleep quality' to a numeric value instead of a string with the % symbol\n* Change 'Time in bed' to amount of hours in bed represented as a float\n* Change 'Wake up' to 'Happy' for ':)' and 'Moderate' for ':|'\n* Fill in the missing values in 'Sleep Notes' with '' (a blank space) for us to use in the next step for creating binary variables\n* Separate the 'Sleep Notes' column into binary values for each variable within this column (i.e. 'Drank tea' : T \/ F)\n* Remove the 'Activity (steps)' column as there appears to be too many missing values (0's) on days when the individual noted they had worked out, or we are blatantly missing sleep notes\n","132336ae":"# Sleep iOS App Data - Exploratory Analysis \n\n## Inspiration for this project\nA few years ago I had read a wonderful (and somewhat worrisome) book titled 'Why We Sleep' by Matthew Walker, in which Walker whom is a neuroscientist and sleep researcher, carefully delves into the modern research regarding the importance of sleep. Walker outlines extensive research on how sleep affects our moods, dietary preferences, our body's ability to fight cancer, physical & mental aptitude, among a host of other ideas to which Walker proposes that our lack of sufficient and quality sleep may explain some of today's issues. This book, along with Michael Pollan's recent 'This is your Mind on Plants' book with the section about caffeine history and information, instilled a sense of curiosity to see if I could do a bit of my own digging in a sleep dataset to uncover something of interest (if anything).\n\n## The Dataset\n\nThis dataset was provided via: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/danagerous\/sleep-data which notes that it was collected over a four year period utilizing the Sleep Cycle app from Northcube on iOS.\n\n### Import Necessary Packages","be69d6c9":"### Which days of the week had a workout session?\n\nThis person worked out most often on Monday ~ Thursday, with about a third of the amount worked out during the week on Friday ~ Sunday. Let's compare this to when the individual drank caffeine (tea & coffee)\n","b421784d":"### Comparing Worked Out T\/F\n\nNext we can compare our variables on whether this individual has worked out or not that particular day, and to see what affect this has on sleep quality or our other variables..\n\nInteresingly, the sleep quality and time in bed appears to be just slightly higher on the nights the individual worked out. Drinking tea and coffee on average had nearly double the rates on the days this person worked out, compared to the days they did not work out. Relating back to the previous dataframe looking into caffeine, perhaps the stimulation provided the necessary \"boost\" for this person to work out. Let's see which days of the week this person worked out on and if there is a pattern."}}
