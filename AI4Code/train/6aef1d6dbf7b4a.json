Where to look for the inspiration\n<a id=\"wheretostart\"><\/a> \n\nYou can take many different approches for the competition. I can't really advice any of that.

Encoder-decoder: https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1508.01211\n2. RNNs with CTC loss: https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1412.5567<br>\nFor me, 1 and 2  are a sensible choice for this competition, especially if you do not have background in SR field. They try to be end-to-end solutions. Speech recognition is a really big topic and it would be hard to get to know important things in short time.\n\n3. Classic speech recognition is described here: http:\/\/www.ece.ucsb.edu\/Faculty\/Rabiner\/ece259\/Reprints\/tutorial%20on%20hmm%20and%20applications.pdf\n\nYou can find *Kaldi* [Tutorial for dummies](http:\/\/kaldi-asr.org\/doc\/kaldi_for_dummies.html), with a problem similar to this competition in some way.\n\n4. Very deep CNN - Don't know if it is used for SR. However, most papers concern Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition Systems (LVCSR). We got different task here - a very small vocabulary, and recordings with only one word in it, with a (mostly) given length.

That's why you can still understand another person talking to the telephone, where GSM signal is sampled to 8000 Hz.\n\nSummarizing, we could resample our dataset to 8k. We will discard some information that shouldn't be important, and we'll reduce size of the data.\n\nWe have to remember that it can be risky, because this is a competition, and sometimes very small difference in performance wins, so we don't want to lost anything.

We can lower the dimensionality of the dataset and interactively check for any anomaly.\nWe'll use PCA for dimensionality reduction:","d47bb04e":"Let's plot mean FFT for every word","65982deb":"There are also recordings with some weird silence (some compression?):\n","fabbfd86":"There's a very important fact. Recordings come from very different sources. As far as I can tell, some of them can come from mobile GSM channel.\n\nNevertheless,** it is extremely important to split the dataset in a way that one speaker doesn't occur in both train and test sets.**\nJust take a look and listen to this two examlpes:","5d249588":"## 2.5. Gaussian Mixtures modeling\n<a id=\"gmms\"><\/a> \n\nWe can see that mean FFT looks different for every word. We could model each FFT with a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Some of them however, look almost identical on FFT, like *stop* and *up*... But wait, they are still distinguishable when we look at spectrograms! High frequencies are earlier than low at the beginning of *stop* (probably *s*).\n\nThat's why temporal component is also necessary. There is a [Kaldi](http:\/\/kaldi-asr.org\/) library, that can model words (or smaller parts of words) with GMMs and model temporal dependencies with [Hidden Markov Models](https:\/\/github.com\/danijel3\/ASRDemos\/blob\/master\/notebooks\/HMM_FST.ipynb).\n\nWe could use simple GMMs for words to check what can we model and how hard it is to distinguish the words. We can use [Scikit-learn](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/) for that, however it is not straightforward and lasts very long here, so I abandon this idea for now.","63e4eb6b":"---\n\n**If you like my work please upvote.**\n\nLeave a feedback that will let me improve!
