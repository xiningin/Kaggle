There's a clear sweet spot around 11 AM UTC... right when post engagement starts dropping, if you remember our previous graph.

To have the highest chance of being noticed, you should post between 00:00 UTC and 12:00 UTC (that's the evening to the middle of the night for you Americans, and morning to middle of afternoon for our Eurasian viewers).
