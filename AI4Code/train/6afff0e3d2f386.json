Measure of total amount of bilirubin.\n* It is often part of a panel of tests that measure liver function. \n* A small amount of bilirubin in your blood is normal, but a high level may be a sign of liver disease.\n* Test results may vary depending on your age, gender, health history, the method used for the test, and other things.\n* Adults with jaundice generally have bilirubin levels greater than 2.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dL). \n\n**Direct Bilirubin\/Conjugated bilirubin**\n\n* Bilirubin is also part of bile, which your liver makes to help digest the food you eat.\n* Bilirubin that is bound to a certain protein (albumin) in the blood is called unconjugated, or indirect, bilirubin. \n* Conjugated, or direct, bilirubin travels from the liver into the small intestine. \n* A very small amount passes into your kidneys and is excreted in your urine. \n* This bilirubin also gives urine its distinctive yellow color.\n* High level indicates liver problems, such as hepatitis, or blockages, such as gallstones.\n\n**An alkaline phosphatase (ALP)**\n* Measure of the amount of ALP in your blood. \n* ALP mostly found in the liver, bones, kidneys, and digestive system. \n* When the liver is damaged, ALP may leak into the bloodstream. \n* High levels of ALP can indicate liver disease or bone disorders.\n\n**Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) **\n\n* Normal ranges are:\n* Males: 10 to 40 units\/L\n* Females: 9 to 32 units\/L\n\n**Alamine Aminotransferase**\n\n* A normal ALT test result can range from 7 to 55 units per liter (U\/L). \n* Levels are normally higher in men.\n\n**Total Protein**\n\n* The normal range for total protein is between 6 and 8.3 grams per deciliter (g\/dL). \n\n**Albumin**\n\n* A normal albumin range is 3.4 to 5.4 g\/dL. \n* grams per deciliter (g\/dL).\n* If you have a lower albumin level,It can mean that you have liver disease or an inflammatory disease.\n\n**Albumin and Globulin Ratio**\n* A normal range of albumin is 39 to 51 grams per liter (g\/L) of blood. \n* The normal range for globulins varies by specific type. A normal range for total globulins is 23 to 35 g\/L. \n* If your protein level is low, you may have a liver or kidney problem.\n","60ea0cab":"*  Check age distribution by sex","65752f2d":"There are 4 missing values in Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio ","e22d2c4e":"********************************To Be Continued****","dfb96687":"**Distribution of Age by Gender in Dataset 1**","b370dcb8":"**Distribution of features in the whole dataset**","51039870":"**Dataset Feature**\n\n* Value 1  -->  Group 1\n* Value 2  -->  Group 2","7e3ba6c1":"Number of people in Dataset 1 and 2","77b10ef6":"Lets drop those missing values","cdaf0c4a":"> Display Datasets by patient gender","cc360b73":"Okay!
