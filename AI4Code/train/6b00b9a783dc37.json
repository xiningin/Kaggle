Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\n**Energy:** Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.\n\n**Tempo:** The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece, and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n\n**Loudness:** The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.\n\n**Speechiness:** This detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.\n\n**Instrumentalness:** Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. \u201cOoh\u201d and \u201caah\u201d sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \u201cvocal\u201d.\n\n**Liveness:** Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n\n**Acousticness:** A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.\n\n**Key:** The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C\u266f\/D\u266d, 2 = D, and so on.\n\n**Mode:** Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n\n**Duration (song_duration_ms) :** The duration of the track in milliseconds.\n\n**Time Signature:** An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).\n","665e82f3":"lets first start off with a profiling tool","6f479c80":"1. max and min and mean song duration are","c25af330":"Now lets check the distibutions of individual features and see what we can understand about the feature","af5524b6":"the test data consists of 10000 rows and all features from training data","2120fcec":"we see that song_popularity, time_signature, audio_mode, id are not continous","a041f6c3":"ah! this seems i dont know confusing i never heard songs lenghtier than 5min, beats me we can learn more about this going forward\n\nthe min duration seems like 0.42min, maybe something like anime OST or ending song\n\nthe mean seems to be common songs are usually in and around 3min ","05d09568":"<h3 align=\"center\"> Exploratory Data Analysis<\/h3>","237325f9":"there are NANs present in the data\n\nid column is the primary column\n\nthere are continous as well as discrete columns in the data\n\nwe shall see what description of each columns shows us, im only putting down what i can take away, there might be multiple other things which we can derive from this","d61e6c70":"now lets take a look at the original values of the table, till now we analysed based on stats.\n","77206205":"there are 40000 rows and 15 columns in the data\ni.e 14 features and 1 target column\n"}}
