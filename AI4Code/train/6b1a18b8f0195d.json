It is a high level library where many popular machine learning algorithms are available as off the shelf functions. This makes it more easier to use than standard frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras. \n\nFor example if you want to use a Linear Regression model with scikit learn, all you have to do is to call LinearRegression( ). Then you can train the model by just calling the model.fit( ) function. \n\nAll of this might not make sense right now, but I will walk you through the whole process with an example in this notebook.","641023ff":"### But how can we increase the accuracy of the model? There are several methods, known as Hyperparameter Tuning, which can go deep into later on. For now, we can try using another technique than just simple Linear Regression.

So we can split the dataset into only its attributes, put it into our model to predict the values and then compare the original median house price with what our model predicted. This will be 64% accurate.","b4407df1":"### Now we can go on to train our model with x_train and y_train\n\n\n","d1fa08ca":"And that's 96% accuracy of the model's values with the actual values.
