This techniques label encodes categorical columns resulting in a 1 if the value is true, with all associated values in that row taking value 0. Take for example our 'Embarked' column. Using one hot encoding will create embarked_S, embarked_C, and embarked_Q columns for each row. The True value will take a 1.

There are a combination of techniques to fix these missing values including:\n* Fill with either the median or mean. Using the median may be preferable as it is more robust to outliers. If you high extreme values on each end, then the mean may be affected severally. (i.e. mean income of the district that Bill Gates lives in.)\n* Drop the column if the majority of data is missing.\n* Fill with 0 if appropriate. Many times a missing value may signify \"no item\".
