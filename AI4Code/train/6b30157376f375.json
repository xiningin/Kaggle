correclation between **Bilirubin_direct** and **Bilirubin_total**. **Bilirubin_direct** is missing for about 96 % of patients, having another feature that highly correlates to this one enables us to exclude **Bilirubin_direct** from classification model. \n+ There is a high correlation between **DBP** (diastolic BP), **MAP** (mean arterial pressure), and **SBP** (systolic BP). Mean arterial pressure is known ([source](https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s00134-009-1427-2)) to be primary indicator of patient state in near septic conditions, thus, both **DBP** and **SBP** may be disregarded as **MAP** is calculated from these two features. \n+ We can notice correlation between three features - **pH**, **HCO<sub>3<\/sub>**, and **PaCO<sub>2<\/sub>**. Despite being correlated the ratio between these three features may tell us whether the patient is undergoing *acidosis* or *alkalosis* and which one it is *metabolic* or *respiratory*. Thus, it's better to leave these features and maybe combine them into some categorical feature that will state what type of acidosis\/alkalosis has been developed. \n+ Lastly, hemoglobin (**Hgb**) and hematocrit (**Hct**) values happened to be highly correlated. This is to no surprise because whilst hemoglobin expresses concentration of hemoglobin in blood, hematocrit is a volume share of erytrocytes in blood. Research articles about sepsis diagnosis mostly concentrate on hemoglobin out of these two, while hematocrit is often used to asses anemia and other diseases. Let's stick with experts and leave just **Hgb**.","5a1ebef3":"### Observations\n**Vital signs:**\n+ **HR**, **Temp**, and **Resp** seem to differ between septic and non-septic patients\n+ The rest of the attributes don't differ and may be irrelevant in terms of sepsis prediction <br>\n\n**Laboratory values:**\n+ Despite having similar mean, feature **BaseExcess** appears to deviate higher from the mean for septic patients, it is possible that abnormal concentration of excess bicarbonate is inherent to septic patients\n+ **FiO2** is represented by somewhat discrete values with bimodal distribution. This and the fact that just about 20% of the patients have record of this value makes this features likely to be diregarded as non-representative\n+ **pH** of septic patients appears to be higher (more basic pH)\n+ **BUN** also appears to be higher in concentrations for sepsis-positive patients\n+ **Calcium** concentration, although similar for septic and non-septic patients, has outliers for septic patients at very low concentrations. We may want to investigate this further\n+ **Bilirubin_direct** looks to be higher for septic patients, but we have to keep in mind that more than 96% of the patients lack this attribute. Nontheless, it is possible though that bilirubin concentration was measured only if doctors suspected this attribute to be abnormal and we there are indeed some very high concentration for septic patients\n+ **Bilirubin_total** is higher for septic patients as well. Worth noting, that total bilirubin concentration is defined as the sum of **Bilirubin_direct** and indirect bilirubin. Therefore we may expect this feature to be strongly correlated with **Bilirubin_direct** \n+ **Hct** and **Hgb** values seem to be slightly lower in concentrations for septic patients\n+ Septic patients appear to have slightly higher **PTT** sometime\n+ **Fibrinogen** of septic patient appears to be bimodal and slightly higher in concentration than that of non-septic patients. About 95% of patients miss this feature thus we might expect that fibrinogen was measured for some specific reason\n+ Septic patients may have slightly lower concantrations of **Platelets**\n\n**Demographics:**\n+ No differnce in **Age** between septic and non-septic patients. It is unlikely that one or few years of diffence in age may lead to higher chance of developing sepsis. However, in many biochmical signs tend to change with age, therefore it may be benefitial to include age in our model but to divide it into some discrete, more representative values. A lot of age values are 100, which are for patients older than 90.\n+ **HospAdmTime** is quite similar for all patients\n+ Patients that stayed at ICU longer have had higher chances of eventually developing sepsis\n+ Patients that didn't have a record of ICU unit were likely assigned to other ICU than SICU and MICU (e.g. Cardiac ICU, Trauma ICU etc.) as all the patients have a record of time spent in ICU (**ICULOS** attributte).","c71b1b3e":"Now, let's perform a chi square test.

The distribution of this feature also looks very unusual, perhaps indicating that this sample is quite non-representative. \n+ **EtCO2** (end tidal carbon dioxide) lacks for more than 95 % of the patients. This feature does not change between septic and non-septic patients and although there might be a specific reasong to measure this parameter is appear to be non-related to sepsis occurence. \n+ **SaO2** is similar case to **EtCO2** - lots of missing values and no apparent difference between septic and non-septic patients, we will drop this feature. \n+ **HospAdmTime** (hours between hospital admit and ICU admit) does not differ between positive and negative patients. Overall, most of the patients are delivered to ICU as soon as they develop a critical condition and it's probably irrelevant how long they have been present in a hospital in stable condition.\n+ **TroponinI** is missing in most cases (>95%) and is reported to indicate heart and kidney failure, thus we may exclude thus feature\n\n","e8c7e6e5":"---","2c9fcb03":"Let's begin with the most obvious - **Age**.

What can be tried next to improve prediction is to check whether fine-tuning of neural network reduces its overfitting.","7a91fa76":"P-values represent probability of a null-hypothesis applicability to a given feature. In this case the null-hypothesis is that a feature and target label are dependant values. For feature selection we will use the most common p-value threshold - 95 %.
