Denominators for testing and a mechanism for rapidly sharing that information, including demographics, to the extent possible. Sampling methods to determine asymptomatic disease (e.g., use of serosurveys (such as convalescent samples) and early detection of disease (e.g., use of screening of neutralizing antibodies such as ELISAs).\n2. Efforts to increase capacity on existing diagnostic platforms and tap into existing surveillance platforms.\n3. Recruitment, support, and coordination of local expertise and capacity (public, private\u2014commercial, and non-profit, including academic), including legal, ethical, communications, and operational issues.\n4. National guidance and guidelines about best practices to states (e.g., how states might leverage universities and private laboratories for testing purposes, communications to public health officials and the public).\n5. Development of a point-of-care test (like a rapid influenza test) and rapid bed-side tests, recognizing the tradeoffs between speed, accessibility, and accuracy.\n6. Rapid design and execution of targeted surveillance experiments calling for all potential testers using PCR in a defined area to start testing and report to a specific entity. These experiments could aid in collecting longitudinal samples, which are critical to understanding the impact of ad hoc local interventions (which also need to be recorded).\n7.

Latency issues and when there is sufficient viral load to detect the pathogen, and understanding of what is needed in terms of biological and environmental sampling.\n10. Use of diagnostics such as host response markers (e.g., cytokines) to detect early disease or predict severe disease progression, which would be important to understanding best clinical practice and efficacy of therapeutic interventions.\n11. Policies and protocols for screening and testing.\n12. Policies to mitigate the effects on supplies associated with mass testing, including swabs and reagents.\n13.

Coupling genomics and diagnostic testing on a large scale.\n17. Enhance capabilities for rapid sequencing and bioinformatics to target regions of the genome that will allow specificity for a particular variant.\n18. Enhance capacity (people, technology, data) for sequencing with advanced analytics for unknown pathogens, and explore capabilities for distinguishing naturally-occurring pathogens from intentional.\n19. One Health surveillance of humans and potential sources of future spillover or ongoing exposure for this organism and future pathogens, including both evolutionary hosts (e.g., bats) and transmission hosts (e.g., heavily trafficked and farmed wildlife and domestic food and companion species), inclusive of environmental, demographic, and occupational risk factors.\n\nAt the end of this notebook, the question asked is answered by means of each of the aspects listed above. In each case, the original content of the article that most represents the processed aspect is shown.\n\nTo accomplish the goal, the selected approach was to perform text mining on input data, by applying the latest advances in natural language processing (NLP). This was realized by the following steps:\n\n    1. Obtain input data and pre-process it to facilitate analysis.\n    2. Extract the key terms from the task description.\n    3. Match key terms with text contents.\n    4. Group and quantify the findings.\n    5. Show the documents that answer the task questions.\n        \nThe advantage of using NLP to abord this problem is that it is based on language-specific models, saving time and resources for text analysis.\n\nThe key terms was extracted from the task description in the step 2, resulting in a set of rule-based patterns.\n\nThe matching of key terms (step 3) was applied through topic  classification with Spacy library. This work through large sets of the unstructured data to match the patterns obtained in step 2. It is a very fast and scalable process that preferably uses the GPU resource.\n\nThis approach presents the limitation of synonymy, where multiple words and phrases have the same or similar meaning. To counter this, great care was taken in selecting keywords to make up the vocabulary of terms (e.g. COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov, SARS Coronavirus 2, or 2019 Novel Coronavirus).\n\nIn other hand, since the [original input data](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge) it is stored in JSON single files, whose structure is likely too complex to directly perform the analysis, this notebook uses the pre-processed data from the dataset [CORD-19-CSV](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/huascarmendez1\/cord19csv), also of same authorship of this.\n\nThe preprocessing of the data further consisted of filtering the documents that specifically talk about the covid-19 disease and its other names, as well as that they dealt with related risk factors, among other general data review, counting and cleaning activities.\n\nFinally, as it is clear that the results presented here are not final, it is recommended to assume them as a starting point for a complete understanding of each of the aspects that it tries to address.","d7a29f83":"Group findings by key term and sort by key term and count.
