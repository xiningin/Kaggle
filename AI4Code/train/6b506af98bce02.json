The following bar chart shows the total size (in sq. km) of green zones within countries - as per the reported data.","821d8855":"The following visualization shows the kinds of services that will be most impacted by the various kinds of climate hazards. \n\nWild fires, heat waves, sea level rise, and extreme precipitation events, such as storms, feature prominently in the reported data. This is not at all surprising given that various parts of the world have already been seeing a very significant increase in events of these types in the last decade. These include but are not limited to the heat waves across Europe, the wildfires in Australia, California, and the Amazon, and gradual increase in the strength and frequency of storms in the United States.\n\nMoreover, water scarcity continues to affect a number of locations across the planet, and it's nice to see these kinds of climate related threats have started to register amongst the top priorities for cities.","2404c941":"Renewable energy installed in cities depends in large part on the geographical attributes and locations of the cities that enable certain technologies for energy capture\/generation. The next visualization shows the division of renewable energy capacity (in MW) in each region by its source.","aade74ca":"As has become well known in the last few years, as cities such as Beijing and New Delhi continue to be choked with toxic air primarily consisting of harmful PM 2.5 partculate matter, air pollution remains one of the leading issues affecting cities and the health of people living within them. It is estimated that over 4.2 million people lose their lives each year due to air pollution related health complications, such as chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer, stroke, etc.","42d2b935":"The amount of food served by cities shows their dedication towards eliminating hunger. Chennai outshines other cities in terms of total number of meals served.","ec508299":"Next, we attempt to score some of the mitigation actions the cities are undertaking. This is in order to provide some way to compare the various actions after weighing their costs alongside their benefits.\n\nThe proposed score is calculated by considering the amount of renewable energy a certain action causes to be produced, along with the energy savings and reduction in emissions that occur as a direct consequence of undertaking the action. This is then divided by the total cost of the project to account for the financial resources that need to be directed towards the implementation of the action. This results in the final score for the action.\n\nThe actions sorted by their scores are visualized below, and key areas to focus on turn out to be the transport and transit sectors, which also happen to be large contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. These high scores are expected mainly due to the increasing demand and availability of electric transportation technology. Another cause of this would be due the steep downward trend in the price of batteries, which are used to store energy for electric transportation.","46ffd452":"What are the methods for emission transfer applied by cities and the consequent total emissions (in metric tonnes) saved?","ada285a0":"Next we move to analysing emissions. The following visuzlization displays the average CO2 emissions by region and sector\/subsector. Not surprisingly, a number of cities in developing nations in Asia and the Middle east contribute more towards the global emissions especially in sectors related to unclean energy generation and transportation, both areas which have seen unprecedented growth linked to their developing nation status.","6485659b":"When coming up with goals, it is important to develop indicators used to monitor the progress towards those goals. In fact, that is the entire point of this CDP competition. Here we try to visualize the kind of metrics cities are using to track their goals by creating a word cloud for the descriptions they provide for their indicators.

The remaining targets see much smaller year on year changes.","6bbd588c":"Air pollution primarily consists of the harmful PM2.5 and PM10 matter which passes into the lungs and damages the blood vessels. \n\nAir pollution today is one of the major reasons for health issues for people living in densely populated cities, especially in developing nations whose control on air quality is generally below par. The next visualization presents breakups for concentrations of various constituents of air pollution at different time scales.","ca157ff5":"Minimizing city-wide food waste and promoting sustainable foods further shows a city's commitment towards meeting their carbon goals and making the most of their food resources, while alleviating hunger. \n\nThe next two visualizations show how cities say they are promoting sustainable foods, and the total annual food wastage in the city, respectively.","f7b81c67":"The next visualization analyses the contribution of GHG gases in certain sectors. CO2 and CO2 equivalent emissions contribute the most, mainly in transpotation and energy generation. We also see a significant amount of methane emissions being contributed in relation to livestock rearing. Other gases have relatively lower contributions.","7f31d5c6":"The ability to adapt to climate change is an important factor to ensure the thriving of cities. Here we look at the factors most affecting adaptation ability across the globe, and whether they contribute positively or negatively to it.\n\nCities seem to continue to think that throwing money at an issue solves the problem, and the primary challenge to adapting is budgetary constraints. Now this may very well depend on the exact situation on ground, but it does give us a look into the direction of thinking of policy makers and city administrators. Other factors that support adaptability are community and political engagement, access to education, stability, and access to key resources such as data and basic services.","fc47dd0c":"The following visualization shows the primary goals cities have set themselves with respect to their adaptation efforts. As seen earlier in this notebook, the key hazards cities seem to be focusing on are those related to extreme temperature and precipitation events such as heat waves and storm events respectively, those that relate to water scarcity and rising sea levels.","3cf3e9e2":"A similar visualization now compares GHG gases emitted through certain activies or the burning of specific fuels. Once again we see CO2 and CO2 equivalent emissions are most often found to contribute towards emissions from a variety of different fuels and activities, followed next by methane and nitrous oxide.","0d452681":"Next let's take a look at the actions being taken to mitigate climate risks. \n\nThe following heatmap shows the climate hazards against the actions being implemented\/planned by cities to mitigate them. Flood mapping, tree planting, and long term planning stand out as the primary mitigative actions - owing to the increasing concerns due to rising sea levels and overflooding, rising greenhouse effects, and the need for effective planning much in advance of actually facing the climate issues. \n\nIt is essential that we as a planet don't ignore these threats and come up with well thought out plans for the future of humanity in order to prevent the worst case scenario's of climate change.","1fc66796":"Next we try to get an idea of the impact of climate change and climate hazards on different sectors, and how these differ from country to country. \n\nWater and sanitation come out to be the most at risk, which is in line with the predictions that a majority of the nations of the world will be facing serious risk to water supply due to the fast diminishing sources of freshwater. The data also tells us that sanitation continues to be one of the most important requirements in developing nations for the minimizations of water borne diseases, many of which are responsible for the extreme loss of life, especially in the case of infants.","2305100c":"The next visualization gives us an idea of the kind of impact we are likely to see in the world if the goals of climate action and adaptation are not met. \n\nWith the population of the world set to grow up to 10 billion by the year 2050, we can see that there will be an immense shortage of and therefore a huge increase in demand for resources and public services. These two areas, along with a further increase in risk to already vulnerable populations make up the top social impacts across the entire set of climate hazards.","740740b2":"A good measure for judging the amount of emissions in a city is to calculate the per capita emissions or emission intensity. This gives us a fairer metric to compare different cities on their emissions. The next visualization shows the top cities with maximum emission intensities as per the reported data.","7ecf5d50":"The final visualization of this notebook presents the mitigation actions being undertaken to reduce risks to water security. \n\nThe important actions being considered that work with multiple risks are spreading awareness and increasing investment in improving water supply infrastructure. This makes sense considering the need for water conservation requires every individual to do his or her part and since a number of cities report inadequate water supply structure","1bfad209":"To begin, once we've built our `cities` dataframe (see Data Wrangling), we select a set of key questions from the 2020 Questionnaire which might aid in the identification of KPIs.

We see that there is a large co-relation between the sectors corresponding to city adaptation actions and city adaptation plans.","622f15cb":"The predominant form of passenger transport in cities continues to be private vehicles - by a huge margin. \n\nAs such, cities should explore ways to reduce dependence on private vehicles by building the required infrastructe for well connected public transport services. Moreover, green zones within city perimeters, or implementation of surge pricing withing city areas prone to overcrowding,  congestion, or poor air quality could influence a shift towards other forms of travel such as cycling.","41d0e4e5":"Children, the elderly, and the poor are most affected by climate related health issues owing to the fact that they comprise the most vulnerable populations in any given demographic in part of the world.","df8ccb6a":"What are the gases most contirbuting to each city's emissions?
