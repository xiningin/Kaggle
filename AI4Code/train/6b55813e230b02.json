Later, I found GTA-5 dataset is enough to do so and decided to public all the gathered data for Research purposes.\n\nInitial version of this data contained 1000 images snapped at 500ms interval of time which were later filtered by me to around 510 images.\n\nFormat of the file is the indication of it labels i.e., XXX_WASD where XXX represent the id of the image and WASD represent the keys to accelerate, move left, reverse accelerate, move right respectively present at current interval of 500ms previous to snapped image.\n\nOwner of this dataset can be considered as unknown; it is free to use for any purpose.\n\nFeel free to ask any question in discussion forms and more data to this dataset will be added shortly."}}
