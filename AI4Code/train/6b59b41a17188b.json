In the *Production* department, we can see that **salaries are also diminished**: these workers have a pay rate below 35, whereas some younger ones get as high as $60\/hour. This calls for a more detailed analysis of this specific division.\n\nAlthough the plot is focused on salary, it also reveals that both *Admin Offices* and *Software Engineering* barely have any workers over 40.","a479381f":"An in-depth analysis reveals that the wage disparity at Admin Offices, the largest throughout departments, **comes from the presence of two men working in a high-paid position (*shared services manager*), contrasted with three women employed as *administrative assistant*.**\n\nAmong those whose title is Accountant I, the female employee's pay rate is only marginally lower than that of a male colleague. We can also see that only women work as Sr. Accountants, **which shows that females aren't necessarily kept away from higher positions in this department**.","51e5f0aa":"### Final thoughts \n\nDental Magic is a generally diverse company, though it still has some faults.\n\nThe biggest issue is the lack of age diversity, which is not truly promoted by any recruitment source.

This could be the result of discriminatory practices. Let's investigate further to see if there are any reasonable causes for the wage gap:","abfb6a63":"### 3. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?\n\n**Race**\n\nWhile more than half of the workforce is made of white people, we've seen before that the jobs are more well distributed along underrepresented groups comparatively to official statistics in a national level. \n\n*Hispanics* get a slightly higher pay rate in average, whereas *American Indian or Alaska Natives* perform lower on that variable. Considering that these groups have only four members each, it is premature to conclude the divergence is caused by any discriminatory treatment.\n\n**Gender**\n\nThe workforce is predominantly female. Additionally, Dental Magic's CEO is a woman, and some more can be found in other high positions. These are positive, distinctive traits in a world that favors hiring male workers for most roles, especially leading ones.\n\nA potential highlight is how the company hires many women to work in *Production*, a department where labor is often manual.\n\nHowever, the company still faces some income inequality related to gender. The issue should be further investigated and dealt with.\n\n**Age**\n\nOnly 6.4% of the workers are 55 or older. This is certainly a diversity issue, specially looking at how 2018 data from the US BLS shows that 23.1% of the workforce in the country is in that age group (https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/emp\/graphics\/2019\/labor-force-share-by-age-group.htm).\n\n**The matter is specially precarious in the Software Engineering department and Admin Offices, that together count no more than a handful employees over *40*.**\n\n\n*Sales*, on the other hand, performs really well, having a good amount of well-paid elderly workers.","494c4d33":"## Importing what's important\nThese are standard libraries for EDA.

It should only be encouraged and expanded.\n\nRegarding race, more than half of the people hired via *Indeed* and *on-campus recruiting* are from underrepresented groups. Contrastingly, some sources need to undergo further scrutiny as to *why they only bring white employees*.\n\nWhen it comes to age diversity, the organization is far behind, and no recruitment source is distinctly efficient.","38998be9":"The numbers are balanced, and **most employees are female.** \n\nTaking a look at each department now:","1ca0b43c":"### Gender Equality","f584fe07":"The perfomance of *two or more races* employees is rather levelled with that of colleagues in the same position, yet their pay rates are the lower than any other. **As far as the dataset goes, this points to the existence of discrimination.**","b67b0395":"The graph clarifies that it is generally not the case that older workers are getting a lower salary than their position's average. **Matures' pay rates are limited because almost all of them work in lesser functions (Production Technician I and II).**","d7220eb2":"An in-depth look at each department shows that payment is generally egalitarian. **The exception is *IT\/IS*, wherein those of *two or more races* have a diminished pay rate.** Why is that?

However, it is important to note that only a handful of employees work there, in such a way that it doesn't affect the overall statistics so much.\n\nOn the other hand, *Production* plays a big part in broadening the wage gap because:\n1. the department has the lowest pay rate; \n2. this decreases female mean compensation by a lot, **since it contains the largest number of workers, most of them being women**;\n3. considering the employee amount, even though the inequality within Production itself isn't great, it ends up making a significant impact.\n\n**We can see a substantial wage gap at Admin Offices**; there, women's average income is much lower than men's.\n\nIt demands some examining:","cf8110c9":"Now we have the employees' ages stored in a column.

None of the data show a cause for that.\n\n2. **Women's income is lower overall.** The gap stems mainly from two sources:\n  - in *Production*, the least well-paid department, females outnumber males by some extent, which results in a greater impact in women's overall salary. Their average income is also slightly inferior in the department;\n  - in *Admin Offices*, the wage gap between genders is substantial, though it is hard to tell if the distribution of functions is discriminatory.\n\n3. **Most workers aged 50+ in *Production* work at lower-paid positions.**\n\n\n\n\n","2ff92e54":"### Racial Diversity","38f624ee":"**In *Software Engineering*, there is an outlier: a worker just over 50 years old, whose pay rate is much lower than that of younger colleagues**.
