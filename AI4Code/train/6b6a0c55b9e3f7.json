Unhide the output of the cell below to see.","89acc8b5":"# Functions and Getting Help\nIn this lesson, we'll be talking about functions: calling them, defining them, and looking them up using Python's built-in documentation.\n\nIn some languages, functions must be defined to always take a specific number of arguments, each having a particular type. Python functions are allowed much more flexibility. The `print` function is a good example of this:","63555376":"### Lambda functions\n\nIf you're writing a short throwaway function whose body fits into a single line (like `mod_5` above), Python's `lambda` syntax is conveniently compact.","d65c9d3b":"## \"What does this function do again?\"\n\nI showed the `abs` function in the previous tutorial, but what if you've forgotten what it does?\n\nThe `help()` function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn. If you can remember how to use `help()`, you hold the key to understanding just about any other function in Python.","8a596ff3":"...though what it shows isn't super useful.\n\nNotice that the code cells above have examples of functions (`type`, and `print`) taking *another function* as input. This opens up some interesting possibilities - we can *call* the function we receive as an argument.","15eade18":"When applied to a function, `help()` displays...\n\n- the header of that function `abs(x, \/)`. In this case, this tells us that `abs()` takes a single argument `x`. (The forward slash isn't important, but if you're curious, you can read about it [here](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/24735311\/python-what-does-the-slash-mean-in-the-output-of-helprange))\n- A brief English description of what the function does.","6ffe7fde":"# Your turn!\n\nHead over to [the Exercises notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/1275158) to get some hands-on practice working with functions and getting help.","b3837835":"Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:","c002c7db":"This creates a function called `least_difference`, which takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\nFunctions start with a header introduced by the `def` keyword. The indented block of code following the `:` is run when the function is called.\n\n`return` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.\n\nIs it clear what `least_difference()` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:","cf0a2985":"Python evaluates an expression like this from the inside out. First it calculates the value of `abs(-2)`, then it provides help on whatever the value of that expression is.\n\n<small>(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers! In Python, even something as simple-seeming as an integer is actually an object with a fair amount of internal complexity. After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the voluminous help output above will make more sense.)<\/small>\n\n`abs` is a very simple function with a short docstring. `help` shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like `print`:","31dbbaec":"<!-- Mention that non-default args must come before default? -->\n\n## Functions are objects too","2e9f0b88":"Unsurprisingly, Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description. However, when I write a function, I can provide a description in what's called the **docstring**.\n\n### Docstrings","4b0c0a66":"## Defining functions\n\nBuiltin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.","15d2b883":"The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. When we call `help()` on a function, it shows the docstring.","74371db8":"But if we don't specify a value, `sep` is treated as having a default value of `' '` (a single space).","64a229a5":"The syntax for creating them may be different, but `f` and `x` in the code above aren't so fundamentally different. They're each variables that refer to objects. `x` refers to an object of type `float`, and `f` refers to an object of type... well, let's ask Python:","11496ad8":"Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of \"null\" in other languages.)\n\nWithout a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.","b8c45d60":"With judicious use of lambdas, you can occasionally solve complex problems in a single line. ","e005cf4f":"You probably won't often define [higher order functions](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Higher-order_function) like this yourself, but there are some existing ones (built in to Python and in libraries like pandas or numpy) that you might find useful to call. For example, `max`.\n\nBy default, `max` returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional `key` argument, it returns the argument `x` that maximizes `key(x)` (aka the 'argmax').","43db0035":"> **Aside: example calls**\n> The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The `>>>` is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example of, see [this docstring for the numpy function `np.eye`](https:\/\/github.com\/numpy\/numpy\/blob\/v1.14.2\/numpy\/lib\/twodim_base.py#L140-L194).","3b626595":"## Default arguments\n\nWhen we called `help(print)`, we saw that the `print` function has several optional arguments.
