Most systems from recent seasons provide a complete ranking from #1 through #351, but sometimes there are ties and sometimes only a smaller set of rankings is provided, as with the AP's top 25. This year and last year they will typically go up to #353 because two new teams were added to Division I last year.","6e62239d":"Merge","2d55f389":"### Submission\n- Note that this pipeline is leaky during the first stage of the competition : the LB will be underestimated since the last 4 models were trained ","0373ee24":"Thanks for reading !","6783d285":"### Season Stats","7e0706e6":"### Processing\n\n- I keep only systems that are common to all the years.","32cef0de":"Compute features","43119268":"### Differences","b041527a":"### Preparing","cddcaf44":"### Ratings\n- `OrdinalRankW` is the average Massey Ranking of the winning team\n- `OrdinalRankL` is the average Massey Ranking of the  losing team","7a2e2526":"# NCAA Starter - The simpler the better \n\nIn this notebook I present a quite simple approach to the problem.\n\nIt is adapted from what I intended to submit last year. \nThe main idea is that the simpler the model, the more robust.

Thus, there are between 64-68 rows for each year, depending on whether there were any play-in games and how many there were. In recent years the structure has settled at 68 total teams, with four \"play-in\" games leading to the final field of 64 teams entering Round 1 on Thursday of the first week (by definition, that is DayNum=136 each season).

The data is formatted exactly like the MRegularSeasonCompactResults data. All games will show up as neutral site (so WLoc is always N). Note that this tournament game data also includes the play-in games (which always occurred on day 134\/135) for those years that had play-in games. Thus each season you will see between 63 and 67 games listed, depending on how many play-in games there were."}}
