The approach is very similar to the Word2Vec method, where each word is presented by a high dimension vector and trained based on the surrounding words over a huge corpus. The pre-trained word embedding used in many works is based on 400,000 vocabularies trained over Wikipedia 2014 and Gigaword 5 as the corpus and 50 dimensions for word presentation.

So word vectors can capture the connotation of words, like \u201cpeopleness,\u201d \u201canimalness,\u201d \u201cplaceness,\u201d \u201cthingness,\u201d and even \u201cconceptness.\u201d And they combine all that into a dense vector (no zeros) of floating point values. This dense vector enables queries and logical reasoning.\n\n(source: [Natural Language Processing in Action](https:\/\/www.manning.com\/books\/natural-language-processing-in-action))\n\n> Even though we have syntactic word representations, it does not mean that the model captures the semantics meaning of the words. On the other hand, bag-of-word models do not respect the semantics of the word. For example, words \u201cairplane\u201d, \u201caeroplane\u201d, \u201cplane\u201d, and \u201caircraft\u201d are often used in the same context. However, the vectors corresponding to these words are orthogonal in the bag-of-words model. This issue presents a serious problem to understanding sentences within the model. The other problem in the bag-of-word is that the order of words in the phrase is not respected. The n-gram does not solve this problem so a similarity needs to be found for each word in the sentence. Many researchers worked on word embedding to solve this problem. The Word2Vec propose a simple single-layer architecture based on the inner product between two word vectors.\n\n> Word embedding is a feature learning technique in which each word or phrase from the vocabulary is mapped to a N dimension vector of real numbers. Various word embedding methods have been proposed to translate unigrams into understandable input for machine learning algorithms. This work focuses on Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, three of the most common methods that have been successfully used for deep learning techniques.\n\n(source: [Text Classification Algorithms: A Survey](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1904.08067))\n\n<a id=\"Basic_Word_Embedding\"><\/a>\n### Basic Word Embedding Methods:\n\n<a id=\"Word2Vec\"><\/a>\n#### Word2Vec:\n\n[T.

The Word2Vec approach uses shallow neural networks with two hidden layers, continuous bag-of-words (CBOW), and the Skip-gram model to create a high dimension vector for each word. This unsupervised nature of Word2vec is what makes it so powerful.

For example, {\u201ca\u201d, \u201cabout\u201d, \u201cabove\u201d, \u201cacross\u201d, \u201cafter\u201d, \u201cafterward\u201d, \u201cagain\u201d, ...} can be considered as stop words. Traditionally, we could remove all of them in the text preprocessing stage. However, refer to the example from the [Natural Language Processing in Action](https:\/\/www.manning.com\/books\/natural-language-processing-in-action) book: \n> * Mark reported to the CEO\n> * Suzanne reported as the CEO to the board \n\n> In your NLP pipeline, you might create 4-grams such as reported to the CEO and reported as the CEO. If you remove the stop words from the 4-grams, both examples would be reduced to \"reported CEO\", and you would lack the information about the professional hierarchy. In the first example, Mark could have been an assistant to the CEO, whereas in the second example Suzanne was the CEO reporting to the board. Unfortunately, retaining the stop words within your pipeline creates another problem: it increases the length of the n-grams required to make use of these connections formed by the otherwise meaningless stop words. This issue forces us to retain at least 4-grams if you want to avoid the ambiguity of the human resources example.\n> Designing a filter for stop words depends on your particular application.\n\nIn short, removing stop words is a common method in NLP text preprocessing, whereas, it needs to be experimented carefully depending on different situations. \n\n[Back To Table of Contents](#top_section)","fd59e848":"<a id=\"Lemmatization\"><\/a>\n\n## Lemmatization:\nAccording to the [Speech and Language Processing](https:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/~jurafsky\/slp3\/ed3book.pdf) book:\n> Lemmatization is the task of determining that two words have the same root, despite their surface differences. The words am, are, and is have the shared lemma be; the words dinner and dinners both have the lemma dinner. Lemmatizing each of these forms to the same lemma will let us \ufb01nd all mentions of words in Russian like Moscow. The lemmatized form of a sentence like He is reading detective stories would thus be He be read detective story.\n\nand the book [Natural Language Processing in Action](https:\/\/www.manning.com\/books\/natural-language-processing-in-action):\n> Some lemmatizers use the word\u2019s part of speech (POS) tag in addition to its spelling to help improve accuracy. The POS tag for a word indicates its role in the grammar of a phrase or sentence. For example, the noun POS is for words that refer to \u201cpeople, places, or things\u201d within a phrase. An adjective POS is for a word that modifies or describes a noun. A verb refers to an action. The POS of a word in isolation cannot be determined. The context of a word must be known for its POS to be identified. So some advanced lemmatizers can\u2019t be run-on words in isolation.\n\nFor example, the \"good\", \"better\" or \"best\" is lemmatized into good and the verb \"gardening\" should be lemmatized to \"to garden\", while the \"garden\" and \"gardener\" are both different lemmas. In this notebook, we will also explore on both lemmatize on without POS-Tagging and POS-Tagging examples.\n\n[Back To Table of Contents](#top_section)","31370645":"| Model

It stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers. It has been pre-trained on Wikipedia and BooksCorpus and requires task-specific fine-tuning.\n\n> Lets understand BERT by breaking BERT abbreviation:\n> * **Bidirectional**: BERT takes whole text passage as input and reads passage in both direction to understand the meaning of each word.\n> * **Transformers**: BERT is based on a Deep Transformer network. Transformer network is a type of network that can process efficiently long texts by using attention. An attention is a mechanism to learn contextual relations between words (or sub-words) in a text.\n> * **Encoder Representation**: Originally Transformer includes two separate mechanisms \u2014 an encoder that reads the text input and a decoder that produces a prediction for the task, since BERT\u2019s goal is to generate a language model only the encoder mechanism is necessary hence 'encoder representation'\n\n> BERT is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder. There are two models introduced in the paper.\n> * BERT base \u2013 12 layers (transformer blocks), 12 attention heads, and 110 million parameters.\n> * BERT Large \u2013 24 layers, 16 attention heads and, 340 million parameters.\n\n\n> How BERT performs Bidirectional training?\n> \n> BERT uses following two prediction models simultaneously with the goal of minimizing the combined loss function of the two strategies:\n> \n> * **Masked Language Model**: Before feeding word sequences into BERT, 15% of the words in each sequence are replaced with a [MASK] token. The model then attempts to predict the original value of the masked words, based on the context provided by the other, non-masked, words in the sequence.\n> * **Next Sentence Prediction**: The model receives pairs of sentences as input and learns to predict if the second sentence in the pair is the subsequent sentence in the original document. During training, 50% of the inputs are a pair in which the second sentence is the subsequent sentence in the original document, while in the other 50% a random sentence from the corpus is chosen as the second sentence. The assumption is that the random sentence will be disconnected from the first sentence.\n\nResources and further reading on BERT's explanation could be found in the great Kaggle notebooks and Blogs here:\n* https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abhinand05\/bert-for-humans-tutorial-baseline-version-2\n* https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ratan123\/in-depth-guide-to-google-s-bert\n* https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kksienc\/comprehensive-nlp-tutorial-3-bert\n* https:\/\/yashuseth.blog\/2019\/06\/12\/bert-explained-faqs-understand-bert-working\/\n\nWe will create our sentence embeddings by BERT's pre-trained word vectors (Uncased) via Tensorflow (source: https:\/\/github.com\/google-research\/bert) and see the embedding output on the sample sentence from the our dataset.

Stemming uproots suffixes from words to merge words with similar meanings under their standard stem.\n\nThere are three major stemming algorithms in use nowadays:\n- **Porter** - PorterStemmer()): This stemming algorithm is an older one. It\u2019s from the 1980s and its main concern is removing the common endings to words so that they can be resolved to a common form. It\u2019s not too complex and development on it is frozen. Typically, it\u2019s a nice starting basic stemmer, but it\u2019s not really advised to use it for any production\/complex application. Instead, it has its place in research as a nice, basic stemming algorithm that can guarantee reproducibility. It also is a very gentle stemming algorithm when compared to others.\n\n- **Snowball** - LancasterStemmer(): This algorithm is also known as the Porter2 stemming algorithm. It is almost universally accepted as better than the Porter stemmer, even being acknowledged as such by the individual who created the Porter stemmer. That being said, it is also more aggressive than the Porter stemmer. A lot of the things added to the Snowball stemmer were because of issues noticed with the Porter stemmer. There is about a 5% difference in the way that Snowball stems versus Porter.\n\n- **Lancaster** - SnowballStemmer(): Just for fun, the Lancaster stemming algorithm is another algorithm that you can use. This one is the most aggressive stemming algorithm of the bunch. However, if you use the stemmer in NLTK, you can add your own custom rules to this algorithm very easily. It\u2019s a good choice for that. One complaint around this stemming algorithm though is that it sometimes is overly aggressive and can really transform words into strange stems. Just make sure it does what you want it to before you go with this option!\n\nsource: http:\/\/hunterheidenreich.com\/blog\/stemming-lemmatization-what\/\n\n<a id=\"PorterStemmer\"><\/a>\n### PorterStemmer\n[Back To Table of Contents](#top_section)"}}
