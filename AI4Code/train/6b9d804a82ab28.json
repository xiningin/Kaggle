Any suggestion to improvise would be warmly welcomed.\n### **1. Introduction:**\n[**Coronary artery disease (CAD)**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coronary_artery_disease), also known as coronary heart disease (CHD), or simply heart disease, usually involves a reduction in the blood flow due to blockage in the arteries of the heart. The heart disease are usually of the types stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. One of the most common symptom is shooting chest pain which may travel to the left shoulder or the arm. In many cases there are no symptoms of a heart disease but some usual symptoms mat include shortness of breath and emotional stress. Mostly the first sign of a heart disease in not clear until a heart attack.<br>\n    Thus, having a machine learning model to predict the occurance of a heart disease based on various parameters which could detect early heart disease may prove to be quintessential in averting the heart attack.<br>","77de009d":"#### *2.8 Max. heart rate achieved during thalium stress test vs Heart Disease*","5324ef25":"#### *2.2 Understanding the distribution of numerical variables*","85ded79b":"#### *2.3 Understanding the count of categorical variables*","536814a1":"#### *2.4 Age vs Heart Disease*","42566ab6":"##### **As can be seen from the graph, the propotion of males suffering from heart disease is more in males as compared to that in females.**","04d1ced2":"#### *2.5 Sex vs Heart Disease*","58bd0427":"#### *2.7 Resting Ecg vs Heart Disease*","8a9077cd":"#### *2.9 Cholestrol vs Heart Disease*","faf39a92":"#### *2.1.
