If one doesn't function well, the burdens get carried over to the second kidney. If the patient fails to take drastic measures to improve his\/her condition, both kidneys will fail, leading to acute renal failure. This can be fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Of course, this occurs at the advance stage of chronic kidney disease and symptoms will only show up at a severe stage. \n\n# Purpose of this project\n- We will like to find out the correlation between these health attributes and chronic kidney disease.\n    * This way we can allow early detections that facilitate medical interventions\n- Identify key precursors to chronic kidney disease that can be used for machine learning ","9f6c2cd6":"# Correlation between anemia and CKD\n- Anemia happens when there are insufficient red blood cells to carry out their duties. Our kidneys produce an important hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). This hormone tells your body to make red blood cells. For CKD patients, their kidneys cannot make enough EPO. Low EPO levels cause low red blood cell count, resulting in anemia.\n- Given that anemia here is a nominal data, we will need to use Chi-square test to calculate correlation. \n- We will be using 95% confidence interval (95% chance that the confidence interval you calculated contains the true population mean).\n    * The null hypothesis is that they are independent.\n    * The alternative hypothesis is that they are correlated in some way.","7217c560":"# Correlation between coronary artery disease and CKD\n- Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. \n- When you have heart disease, your heart may not be able to pump blood the right way causing pressure to build in the main vein connected to your kidneys. This may lead to a blockage and a reduced supply of oxygen rich blood to the kidneys, leading to kidney disease.\n- Given that coronary artery disease here is a nominal data, we will need to use Chi-square test to calculate correlation. \n- We will be using 95% confidence interval (95% chance that the confidence interval you calculated contains the true population mean).\n    * The null hypothesis is that they are independent.\n    * The alternative hypothesis is that they are correlated in some way.","8d540b15":"# Correlation between red blood cell and whether the patient has chronic kidney disease\n\nOur kidneys create an essential hormone called erythropoietin(EPO).
