Limiting the X-axis to 3.5 might have cut out some outliers with counts so small that they didn't show up as bars on our original chart. Let's check to see if any diamonds are larger than 3.5 carats:","9421d803":"Although the scatterplot above has many overlapping points, it still gives us some insight into the relationship between diamond carat weight and price: bigger diamonds are generally more expensive.","809d1fb4":"As we learned in lesson 14, the central box of the boxplot represents the middle 50% of the observations, the central bar is the median and the bars at the end of the dotted lines (whiskers) encapsulate the great majority of the observations. Circles that lie beyond the end of the whiskers are data points that may be outliers.\n\nIn this case, our data set has over 50,000 observations and we see many data points beyond the top whisker. We probably wouldn't want to classify all of those points as outliers, but the handful of diamonds at 4 carats and above are definitely far outside the norm.\n\nOne of the most useful features of a boxplot is the ability to make side-by-side boxplots. A side-by-side boxplot takes a numeric variable and splits it on based on some categorical variable, drawing a different boxplot for each level of the categorical variable. Let's make a side-by-side boxplot of diamond price split by diamond clarity:","e3bc88f9":"A grouped barplot is an alternative to a stacked barplot that gives each stacked section its own bar.

The pandas library includes basic plotting capabilities that let you create a variety of plots from DataFrames.

Let's create some fake time series data and plot it with a line plot:","ba2a0830":"The Python plotting ecosystem has many different libraries, which can make it confusing to know what to use and where to start. Pandas plotting functions let you visualize and explore data quickly. Pandas plotting functions don't offer all the features of dedicated plotting package like matplotlib for Python or ggplot2 for R, but they are often enough to get the job done. \n\nNow that we have developed some tools to explore data, the remainder of this guide will focus on statistics and predictive modeling in Python","40821677":"## Wrap Up","487355ef":"It turns out that 9 diamonds are bigger than 3.5 carats. Should cutting these diamonds out concern us? On one hand, these outliers have very little bearing on the shape of the distribution. On the other hand, limiting the X-axis to 3.5 implies that no data lies beyond that point. For our own exploratory purposes this is not an issue but if we were to show this plot to someone else, it could be misleading. Including a note that 9 diamonds lie beyond the chart range could be helpful.","52ef3b1f":"We see immediately that the carat weights are positively skewed: most diamonds are around 1 carat or below but there are extreme cases of larger diamonds.\n\nThe plot above has fairly wide bins and there doesn't appear to be any data beyond a carat size of 3.5. We can make try to get more out of hour histogram by adding some additional arguments to control the size of the bins and limits of the x-axis:","e398649b":"A histogram is a univariate plot (a plot that displays one variable) that groups a numeric variable into bins and displays the number of observations that fall within each bin.
