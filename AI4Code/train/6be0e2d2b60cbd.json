I'm still unsuccessful in implementing NLP methods to try and separate them. Let me know if you have ideas!\n\nFeel free to upvote and fork if you wish to learn about or add improvement to this work. I hope this have been fun and useful for all of you readers. Keep learning and happy data sciencing!","0e09d586":"# I'm a job seeker with X years of experience. How will I do?\n\nLet's see this dataset from the perspective of a job seeker\/possible applicant with certain length (say, X years) of work experience. The questions they're interested in might include:\n\n1. Am I going to have many opportunities in the open job market? Is my experience level wanted?\n2. How much salary should I expect? What does the job market says about my length of experience?\n\nHowever, the job postings provide a range of expected experience level. This means:\n\n- The job postings that expect 5-7 years of experience will accept people with either 5, 6, or 7 years of experience.\n- People that have 5 years of experience can apply to any job posting so long as that 5 years is within that job posting's desired experience level.","d419bf86":"# Introduction\n\nThis is a super-simplified exploration! Lightweight, educative (hopefully) and for fun. Enjoy.","2010b844":"Whoops, even if it accepts 0 to 5 years of experience, it's a **Head of Product** work post. So not exactly \"fresh graduate\" either.","89d1f917":"There isn't much to say about the plot: the more work experience you have - the higher you'll be paid. The distribution of salary moves up as the plot moves to the right. It is interesting to note that the salary distribution more-or-less settled after about 13 years of experience: there's not much of a difference on the boxenplots after that.\n\nOn the more junior side of the plot, jobs with zero years of experience mostly paysonly up to 10 lakhs. There are little jobs that pay more than that. One very interesting outlier stands out and pays the 25-50 lakh salary range, though.\n\n<br>\n\nNote: we assumed as stated above that the 25-50 lakhs salary range would pay midpoint i.e. 37.5 lakhs hence the plot.","f69d2cbe":"If you have 5 years of work experience, then congratulations! The job market is very competitive for you. You have many options available (in comparison of other experience levels).\n\nThe less experienced is less desirable because they are only eligible for starter\/junior positions; meanwhile the more experienced is less desirable because usually in that time frame people have already settled and are harder\/more expensive to hire. The 5 years of experience seems to be that sweet middle spot \"not fresh new, experienced\/well-versed enough, but not that expensive to hire\".\n\nIt may also mean that 5 years of experience is simply versatile and can apply in variety of areas: junior, senior, management, and (peeking ahead) even a Head of Product!","0c509cbf":"# Number of jobs available for my experience level","f505305b":"Challenges to work on this data:\n\n- Raw text on `job_description`, `job_desig`, and `key_skills`.\n- No clear categorization on `location`.\n- `experience` and `salary` is provided in ranges instead of precise values.\n- On top of that, `experience` is not restricted into clearly defined bins of ranges. Its values are seemingly arbitrary\/determined by the company that offers the job.","68842ad5":"# Paycheck expectation for my experience level"}}
