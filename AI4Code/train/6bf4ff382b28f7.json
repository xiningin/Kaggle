Families don't want to deal with the fact that this has exploded. We're doing what we can.\"\nWith hospitals running out of oxygen supplies, relatives of patients were told to make their own arrangements. https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2020\/07\/coffins-oxygen-bolivia-struggling-coronavirus-surge-200724081503555.html","06f8cf49":"#Polls deferred again\n\nWith the peak of the pandemic expected later this month, the electoral tribunal on Thursday postponed general elections, scheduled for September, until October 18.\n\nThe election was originally supposed to be held in May but had been rescheduled to September 6 after the country went into lockdown following the virus outbreak.\n\nThe latest postponement comes just two weeks after interim President Jeanine Anez, who has been leading the country following Evo Morales's controversial departure last year, tested positive for COVID-19.
