We can then add a constant to our predictions so that their means are shifted to better match the leaderboard means.\n\nThe proof for this mean scaling is the following:\n\nIf $y_i$ and $\\hat{y}_i$ are the true value and the predicted value for sample $i$.  We would like to add a constant $c$ to all predictions to reduce the $rmse$ score, i.e.:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{{\\left(y_i - (\\hat{y}_i + c)\\right)}^2} = 0$$\n\nIt is not hard to derive that:\n\n$$c = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)$$\n\nThe get the best results, each of the three test groups are mean scaled independently. Mean scaling is guaranteed to reduce RMSE. We then use clip(0,20) to further improve the score.  Notice clip(0,20) will change the means, therefore, we can repeatively apply the mean scaling routine until predictions converge.  This logic is implemented in **LeaderBoardProbing.mean_scale()**.\n\n*You should always apply this routine to your predictions, as it does not cost you any presubmission and the corrected prediction is always better than your original file!*","dab80b09":"You should obtain the following scores, notice, private scores are not needed, we only rely on the public scores.\n\n#Submission,Public,Private\n#submit_oct_mean_mpp.csv, Your public and private LB scores are: 1.189455 and 1.194442.\n#submit_oct_mean_pmp.csv, Your public and private LB scores are: 1.121041 and 1.125736.\n#submit_oct_mean_ppm.csv, Your public and private LB scores are: 2.002616 and 1.958823.\n\nNow use the previous score 1.118256 (**submit_oct_mean.csv**), together with the above three scores to create a final submission:\n","1b7202ed":"**Boost Your Score Through Leaderboard Probing**\n\nThe code in this notebook can polish your submission file, so that you get a guaranteed imporvement in your leadboard ranking.

Enjoy an improved ranking.\n\n**How Scaling Works Behind the Scene?**\n\nThere are 214,200 samples in the test set, including 5100 unique item_ids and 42 unique shop_ids.  The test set is made of the full product of 5100x42.\n\nLooking up the test (shop_id, item_id) pairs in the training data, we discovered there are three groups of test samples:\n\n**Group 2:** (shop_id, item_id) has historical sales data (i.e., in the training set). Sales of these samples could be predicted based on their historical time-series data. This group has 111404 samples (52%)\n\n**Group 1:** not in Group 2 but (item_id) has historical sales data in other shop_id.  Sales of these samples could be predicted mostly by sale data for the same item_id in other shops.  This group has 87550 samples (41%).\n\n**Group 0:** item_id has no historical data.  The only information available for prediction is through sales in the same item_category_id and shop_id.  This group has 15246 records (7%).\n\nLet us first probe the mean of each group.\n\nLet $j$ be the test group id, $j = 0, 1, 2$.\nThere are $n_0, n_1, n_2$ samples within each group, respectively.\nThere are $N$ total samples, where $N = n_0 + n_1 + n_2$.\nWe create 4 submission files, Probe000.csv sets all predictions to 0.  Probe100.csv sets all predictions to 0 except 1 for test group 0.  Similarly, Probe010.csv and Probe001.csv has the prediction 1 for test group 1 and test group 2, respectively.\n\nThe RMSE score for the 4 submission are $rmse_{000}, rmse_{101}, rmse_{010}, rmse_{001}$.\n\nThe true target for sample $i$ is $y_i$.\n\nWe have:\n\n$$N \\cdot rmse_{000}^{2} = \\sum_{j=0, i=1}^{n_0}{{y_{ji}}^2}+\\sum_{j=1, i=1}^{n_1}{{y_{ji}}^2}+\\sum_{j=2, i=1}^{n_2}{{y_{ji}}^2}$$\n\n$$N \\cdot rmse_{100}^{2} = \\sum_{j=0, i=1}^{n_0}{{(y_{ji} - 1)}^2}+\\sum_{j=1, i=1}^{n_1}{{y_{ji}}^2}+\\sum_{j=2, i=1}^{n_2}{{y_{ji}}^2}$$\n\n$$N \\cdot rmse_{010}^{2} = \\sum_{j=0, i=1}^{n_0}{{y_{ji}}^2}+\\sum_{j=1, i=1}^{n_1}{{(y_{ji}-1)}^2}+\\sum_{j=2, i=1}^{n_2}{{y_{ji}}^2}$$\n\n$$N \\cdot rmse_{001}^{2} = \\sum_{j=0, i=1}^{n_0}{{y_{ji}}^2}+\\sum_{j=1, i=1}^{n_1}{{y_{ji}}^2}+\\sum_{j=2, i=1}^{n_2}{{(y_{ji}-1)}^2}$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$N \\cdot (rmse_{100}^2 - rmse_{000}^2) = n_0 - 2 \\sum_{j=0, i=1}^{n_0}{y_{ji}}$$\n\n$$N \\cdot (rmse_{010}^2 - rmse_{000}^2) = n_1 - 2 \\sum_{j=1, i=1}^{n_1}{y_{ji}}$$\n\n$$N \\cdot (rmse_{001}^2 - rmse_{000}^2) = n_2 - 2 \\sum_{j=2, i=1}^{n_2}{y_{ji}}$$\n\n\ni.e., the means $\\mu_j$ for each test group and the overall mean $\\mu$ are:\n\n$$\\mu_{0} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - \\frac{N}{n_0} \\cdot (rmse_{100}^2 - rmse_{000}^2))$$\n\n$$\\mu_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - \\frac{N}{n_1} \\cdot (rmse_{010}^2 - rmse_{000}^2))$$\n\n$$\\mu_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - \\frac{N}{n_2} \\cdot (rmse_{001}^2 - rmse_{000}^2))$$\n\n$$\\mu = \\frac{1}{N}(n_0 \\mu_0 + n_1 \\mu_1 + n_2 \\mu_2)$$\n\nTherefore, we know the means for each test group:\n\n$\\mu_0=0.758939742420249$, $\\mu_1=0.0601995732152425$, $\\mu_2=0.3945593622881204$, and $\\mu=0.28393632703149974$.","19607678":"If you grade this file, you get 3\/10 Coursera score with:\n\nYour public and private LB scores are: 1.167778 and 1.172726.\n\nLet us first use mean scaling, this strategy does not require any probing, therefore, you should always apply this step to your submission.","e278e822":"The final score on **submit_oct_mean_labmdaV2_mean.csv** is:\n    \nYour public and private LB scores are: 1.038940 and 1.040874.\n\nSo we have improve the score from 1.167778 to 1.038940![](http:\/\/)","44f4ae08":"**Notes**\n\nI enjoy the theoretical aspects of machine learning and occassionally blog on related topics (http:\/\/randomsciencystuff.blogspot.com\/2017\/05\/notes-on-machine-learning.html).

For example, flip_signs() turns **mean.csv** into **mean_mpp.csv**, **mean_pmp.csv**, and **mean_ppm.csv**.  The suffix \"p\" stands for plus $+$ and \"m\" stands for $-$ in the formula below.\n\nWhat flip_signs() does is to flip the signs of our predictions, once for each test group, i.e., turn $\\hat{y}_i$ into $-\\hat{y}_i$, but only one group at a time.  We already have $rmse$, we just need to obtain $rmse_{-++}, rmse_{+-+}, rmse_{++-}$ through three manual submissions.\n\nSince\n\n$$N \\cdot rmse^2 = \\sum_{j=0,i=1}^{n_0} {(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} + \\sum_{j=1,i=1}^{n_1} {(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} +\\sum_{j=2,i=1}^{n_2} {(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}$$\n\n$$N \\cdot rmse_{-++}^2 = \\sum_{j=0,i=1}^{n_0} {(y_i + \\hat{y}_i)^2} + \\sum_{j=1,i=1}^{n_1} {(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} +\\sum_{j=2,i=1}^{n_2} {(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}$$\n\n$$N \\cdot rmse_{+-+}^2 = \\sum_{j=0,i=1}^{n_0} {(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} + \\sum_{j=1,i=1}^{n_1} {(y_i + \\hat{y}_i)^2} +\\sum_{j=2,i=1}^{n_2} {(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}$$\n\n$$N \\cdot rmse_{++-}^2 = \\sum_{j=0,i=1}^{n_0} {(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} + \\sum_{j=1,i=1}^{n_1} {(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} +\\sum_{j=2,i=1}^{n_2} {(y_i + \\hat{y}_i)^2}$$\n\nFrom the above 4 equations, we can calculate:\n\n$$\\sum_{j=0,i=1}^{n_0} { y_i \\hat{y}_i } = \\frac{N}{4} (rmse_{-++}^2 - rmse_{+++}^2)$$ \n\n$$\\sum_{j=1,i=1}^{n_0} { y_i \\hat{y}_i } = \\frac{N}{4} (rmse_{+-+}^2 - rmse_{+++}^2)$$ \n\n$$\\sum_{j=2,i=1}^{n_0} { y_i \\hat{y}_i } = \\frac{N}{4} (rmse_{++-}^2 - rmse_{+++}^2)$$ \n\nSimilar to version 1, we can now calculate multiplers for each test group independently:\n\n$$\\lambda_0 = \\frac{\\sum_{j=0,i=1}^{n_0} {(y_i \\hat{y}_i -\\mu_0^2)} }{\\sum_{j=0,i=1}^{n_0} {(\\hat{y}_i^2 - \\mu_0^2)}}$$\n\n$$\\lambda_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1,i=1}^{n_1} {(y_i \\hat{y}_i -\\mu_1^2)} }{\\sum_{j=1,i=1}^{n_1} {(\\hat{y}_i^2 - \\mu_1^2)}}$$\n\n$$\\lambda_2 = \\frac{\\sum_{j=2,i=1}^{n_2} {(y_i \\hat{y}_i -\\mu_2^2)} }{\\sum_{j=2,i=1}^{n_2} {(\\hat{y}_i^2 - \\mu_2^2)}}$$\n\nAfter multiplation, we do clip(0,20) followed by mean scaling. The logic is implemented in **LeaderBoardProbing.variance_scale_v2()**.\n\nTheoretically, we can repeat these processes to obtain further improvement.  In practice, the score hardly changes and there is no need to repeat this process.  Also, version 2 typically is only slightly better than version 1.  So you can simply use version 1 and be done with it, only use version 2 for your final submission.\n","e7c2b143":"**Variance Scaling Version 1**\n\nOur prediction has now been mean corrected, so that it matches the true value $\\mu$.  The submission of this **mean.csv** file gives us the public leaderboard $rmse$ score.  This score allows us to multiple the residues of our prediction by a constant $\\lambda$ to further reduce the score, i.e., we aim for a $\\lambda$ by:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda} \\sum_i^N {{\\left(y_i - \\lambda (\\hat{y}_i-\\mu) - \\mu \\right)}^2} = 0 $$,\n\nWe can derive:\n\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{\\sum_i {(y_i -\\mu)(\\hat{y}_i - \\mu)}}{\\sum_i {(\\hat{y}_i - \\mu)}^2} = \\frac{\\sum_i {(y_i \\hat{y}_i -\\mu^2)} }{\\sum_i {(\\hat{y}_i^2 - \\mu^2)}}$$\n\nThe only term unknown is $\\sum_i {y_i \\hat{y}_i}$.  From previous probings, we have $rmse$ score and $rmse_{000}$:\n\n$$ N \\cdot {rmse}_{000}^2 = \\sum_i y_i^2$$\n\n$$N \\cdot {rmse}^2 = \\sum_i {(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2} = \\sum_i y_i^2 + \\sum_i \\hat{y}_i^2 - 2 \\sum_i {y_i \\hat{y}_i}$$,\n\ntherefore, \n\n$$\\sum_i {y_i \\hat{y}_i} = \\frac{1}{2} N \\cdot (rmse_{000}^2 - rmse^2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i \\hat{y}_i^2$$.\n\nThus, by obtaining the $rmse$ score for our **mean.csv** submission, we can calculate $\\lambda$ and obtain a new **mean_lambda_mean.csv** file.  After we apply $\\lambda$ scaling, we can clip(0, 20), then call mean_scale() to polish the answer further.  This whole logic is implemented in **LeaderBoardProbing.variance_scale()**.","5a83c305":"Our first model is to simply use item_cnt_month data from 2015-Oct for the prediction, entries without training data are set to 0.
