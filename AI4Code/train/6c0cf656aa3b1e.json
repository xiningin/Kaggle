The high levels of reported mental illness in jail and prison populations is primarily due to false labeling of criminals as having a psychiatric illness.\n* According to research, at least 59% of the 185 public mass shootings that took place in the United States from 1900 through 2017 were carried out by people who had either been\n<b> diagnosed with a mental disorder or demonstrated signs of serious mental illness prior to the attack<\/b>\n  \n* If the cop came to know him\/her is having mental illness they can traserd , and give them correct correct labeling of criminality.
