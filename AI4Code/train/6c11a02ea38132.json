If we sample more than that, only the first 15 are shown.\n- If we sample a small number of images, we waste a lot of space.\n\nAll these problems stem from our shoddy approach to step 2 in the code. Instead of using the same grid dimensions every time, they should adapt to the number of images we're showing. For example, if `n = 3`,  we should make a 6\" x 2\" grid with 1 row and 3 columns. If `n = 15`, we should make a 16\" x 4\" grid with 2 rows and 8 columns. (We'll have one empty space in the grid, but that's okay, as long as we don't have whole rows or columns that are empty.)\n\nUpdate the code above to fix the values of `rows`, `cols`, `width`, and `height`, so that our grid adapts to the number of images shown and makes efficient use of space.

The code uses lots of syntax and data structures that we'll cover later, so if it looks like gibberish to you at this point, don't worry.
