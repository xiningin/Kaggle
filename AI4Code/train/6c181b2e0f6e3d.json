Pretty neat!","0552aef2":"Now, we can import aethos, along with pandas and numpy packages","d6e4c6cd":"We can use the **apply** method just like we would on a DataFrame, which just minor change in syntax. In this example, we have a function that will return 'Child' if Ages is less than 16. Otherwise it will return the sex of the individual. Using the apply method with the **get_person** method, we can specify that we want to create a new column 'Person' with the aggregation specified in get_person. Then we will drop column 'Sex'. Easy as that!","d18410bc":"If you would like to get all of this info in one clean report, the **data_report** method is an amazing feature.

Just pass the dataframe into the Aethos Data object. When doing this, we are able to specify the variable we are trying to predict in the **target_field** parameter (for the titanic dataset, it's 'Survived'). We are also able to split the dataset into two different sets, one for training and one for validation. This is done via the **split** parameter. The split percentage can also be changed by setting test_split_percentage to a float between 0 and 1 (by default it is 0.2)","9ce73cd4":"Calling missing_values again, we see that our DataFrame now contains no missing values!","a6d94af5":"Simply use the **missing_values** method to print a dataframe breakdown of missing values for each column.

I won't go into the word_report option at this point, but the interactive_table is helpful as it basically allows us more freedom to explore the dataframe.","0d8b1339":"One of the most time consuming things I have run into in data science, or at least in the early stages of developing a kernel, is the copy and pasting of code from previous projects into a new one. I've often desired a common ML workflow that would automate some of this tedious work so I don't need to create the same for-loop to one-hot encode columns with the sklearn library. Or so that I can get a fast statistics readout on each feature to speed up Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n![](http:\/\/)![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nThen I came across this [article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/aethos-a-data-science-library-to-automate-workflow-17cd76b073a4) written by Ashton Sidhu where he describes an Automated ML workflow that he has created, called **Aethos**. I decided to share it with the kaggle community in the hopes that it will improve some of your own processes. Link to the github repo [here](https:\/\/github.com\/Ashton-Sidhu\/aethos).\n\nI hope you find this kernel helpful and some **UPVOTES** would be very much appreciated.\n\n**Last Updated:** 1\/19\/2020","9eae95c0":"We are also capable of one hot encoding with a simple one-line. We will do this with the **Embarked** and **Person** features. Simply specify the columns to be encoded, and indicate whether you would like to keep the original columns prior to the ohe via **keep_col**.","8ff14665":"Aethos also provides more information than pandas with their describe function in order to get a good first statistical look at your data.","3cd2f455":"Now that we have created our dataframe with Aethos, we can treat it in very much the same way that we would treat a pandas dataframe.","e4fc0744":"## 2.
