It can be said that Singapore has the best range of ramens, however the Top Ten data are incomplete. Hence it is not really reliable to be used to determine the best ramen.\n* Overall, the most preferred style of packaging is Pack, followed by Cup and Bowl Style.\n* Among 386 ramens rated 5.0 stars, almost all of the ramens' packaging are Pack style. From these observations, we can say that Pack style is more preferred for ramen packaging.\n* Brazil has the highest average Stars, followed by Sarawak, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore. Note that Brazil has never been nominated to be in the Top Ten list. Considering that for this dataset, only 5 Variety of Brazil ramen products are reviewed, it's hard to say that Brazil produces the best ramen, although we found that it has the highest average Stars.\n* In my opinion, from this data exploration I concluded that Japan produces the best ramen for few factors such as:\n    1. It produces the highest variety of ramens,and still comes as second most frequent Country to be listed in Top Ten ramen ranking\n    2.  From the histogram, we can see that most ramens produced in Japan are reviewed as 5 stars with average of 3.98.","f1c0cda7":"# Ramen Rating Analysis","cde2e7ba":"### 2) What are the Top Ten Ramen?
