I've read  some great notebooks here. To name a few:\n\n1. [Comprehensive data exploration with Python][1] by **Pedro Marcelino**  : Great and very motivational data analysis\n\n2. [A study on Regression applied to the Ames dataset][2] by **Julien Cohen-Solal**  : Thorough features engeneering and deep dive into linear regression analysis  but really easy to follow for beginners.\n\n3. [Regularized Linear Models][3] by **Alexandru Papiu**  : Great Starter kernel on modelling and Cross-validation\n\nI can't recommend enough every beginner to go carefully through these kernels (and of course through many others great kernels) and get their first insights in data science and kaggle competitions.\n\nAfter that (and some basic pratices) you should be more confident to go through [this great script][7] by **Human Analog**  who did an impressive work on features engeneering. \n\nAs the dataset is particularly handy, I  decided few days ago to get back in this competition and apply things I learnt so far, especially stacking models. For that purpose, we build two stacking classes  ( the simplest approach and a less simple one). \n\nAs these classes are written for general purpose, you can easily adapt them and\/or extend them for your regression problems. \nThe overall approach is  hopefully concise and easy to follow.. \n\nThe features engeneering is rather parsimonious (at least compared to some others great scripts) . It is pretty much :\n\n- **Imputing missing values**  by proceeding sequentially through the data\n\n- **Transforming** some numerical variables that seem really categorical\n\n- **Label Encoding** some categorical variables that may contain information in their ordering set\n\n-  [**Box Cox Transformation**][4] of skewed features (instead of log-transformation) : This gave me a **slightly better result** both on leaderboard and cross-validation.\n\n- ** Getting dummy variables** for categorical features. \n\nThen we choose many base models (mostly sklearn based models + sklearn API of  DMLC's [XGBoost][5] and Microsoft's [LightGBM][6]), cross-validate them on the data before stacking\/ensembling them. The key here is to make the (linear) models robust to outliers.
