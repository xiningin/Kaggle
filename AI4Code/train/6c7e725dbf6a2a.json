Furthermore, the government expanded regulation gradually, and made sponsors cancel large-scaled events.\n\nOn March 11th, 2020, Canton Ticino declared a state of emergency for the first time in Switzerland, and almost all school, movie cinemas and nightclubs closed.  Since then, each canton started to declare a state of emergency one by one.  However, the government did not impose a curfew after all.\n\nOn March 25th,2020, the government established the system that finances maximum 500,000franc without interest to support the small and medium-sized enterprises.  In addition, the Swiss National Bank founded the new system called \"COVID-19 refinance facility\" to provide logistical support for other banks.\n"}}
