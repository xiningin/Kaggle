In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among America\u2019s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.","a186c4ec":"> ## **Engagement Data Description**","cd668b9e":"<img src = 'https:\/\/www.deccanherald.com\/sites\/dh\/files\/styles\/article_detail\/public\/article_images\/2017\/10\/25\/639382.jpg?itok=3gVHgLWL'>","5cc258de":"> # **Problem Statement**","d7315f55":"* time - date in \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n* lp_id - The unique identifier of the product\n* pct_access - Percentage of students in the district have at least one page-load event of a given product and on a given day\n* engagement_index - Total page-load events per one thousand students of a given product and on a given day","ed773ac6":"> ## **Products Data Description**","9f8014bd":"The COVID-19 has resulted in schools shut all across the world. Globally, over 1.2 billion children are out of the classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Research suggests that online learning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay.\nSome students without reliable internet access and\/or technology struggle to participate in digital learning; this gap is seen across countries and between income brackets within countries. In the US, there is a significant gap between those from privileged and disadvantaged backgrounds: whilst virtually all 15-year-olds from a privileged background said they had a computer to work on, nearly 25% of those from disadvantaged backgrounds did not. While some schools and governments have been providing digital equipment to students in need, such as in New South Wales, Australia, many are still concerned that the pandemic will widen the digital divide."}}
