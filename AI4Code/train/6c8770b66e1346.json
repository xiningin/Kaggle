Thanks for providing the interesting dataset. \n\nI found that there is a task regarding selling price. I barelly noticed that the dataset doesn't include the full dataset. I guess it is mainly because of the commercial usage issue provided by the data provider. \n\nAlthough there are small samples focusing on Samsung mobile phone, here below I tried to explain the market situation. One thing I concerned is that this is targeting Bangladesh market. Thus I may not fully understand the market specific issue. I hope your kinder understaing in regards with this. Thanks in advance.
