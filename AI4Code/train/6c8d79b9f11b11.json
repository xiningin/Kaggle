However, a heavy connection request to the API might result in an IP ban. The second and obivous choice might be either trying other vendors or taking the advantage of the paid services. In the case where you need to perform heavy translation work and also work in local, you may take the advantage of free MarianNMT on Transformers.","3708ebbc":"A list of language pairs\/models can be found on: https:\/\/huggingface.co\/Helsinki-NLP.","d68245dc":"![Neural-Machine-Translation.jpg](attachment:b26d9508-9487-4fd9-b7dc-a8244d3ff2da.jpg)"}}
