Hence we can omit it.\n\n->Wheelbase is strongly correlated with length as already said . So , we can drop it.    \n->We can also obeseve that the other features are not linearly dependent on price.We may have perform transformation.\n\n->Car length and car width are positively correlated , which is obvious, to maintain the aerodynamics of car.\n(Not considering Height as there are cars which are of good length and width but with low height(eg: Ferrari,Lamborghini)).\n\n-> Curb Weight shows positive correlation with both length and width.This is obvious that as length and width increases\nthe quantity of materials used will be increased resulting in increase in weight.\n\n->Engine size and Curb Weight shows a strong positive correlation . We can consider having engine size is the model building     as, weight is of a car depends on engine size(the  capacity of the engine) , type of materials used etc\n\n->Horse power and engine size are positively correlated.Which is as expected as the number of cylinders increase engines size also increase resulting in high horse power.Both individually are also equally correlated with price.\n\n->Mileage per gallon shows a string negative correlation with price.This is expected as higher the price, low the mileage","0ff991ee":"We can see that carwidth is the feature which has max impact on pricing in USA.","2dd44d83":"Observatios:\n->As the number of cyliinders increases , the fuel economy if cars decreases.\n->Rear wheel drive cars give less fuel economy.\n\nThus we can say that convertible and hardtop are the type of cars with more number of cylinders and are either 4wd or rwd.","78f687bd":"Observations:\n-> As the number of cylinders increase, engine becomes more powerful(which means it is likely to be a sports car).And for these \ntypes of cars, engine will be at rear.","af3e1a46":"The residuals are approx normally distributed","34ce3eeb":"As all the values are <5 : there is no multicollinearity withing the selected features.","88ab2ce4":"# Observations:\n-> We can see that horse power, curb weight,price,engne size are the features which are not normally distributed indicating that these have outliers.\n\n->All the features are in different units.Have to perform scaling\n","dbffb419":"Observation\n-> Toyota , Mercury are the most and the least preferred car brands by the people of America.\n->The Avg Pricing of Jaguar and Buick are high compared to others.\n->As already said, dividing it into bins as low , medium , high budget cars based on min price.\n   (As the segment of the car brand can be decided based on the entry level car price,here we are diriving it by the min price)","a28868df":"# Random Forest Regression"}}
