It is so inspiring of you to think about others in this hard time of your life.\n\nAccording to my analysis, Ahmedabad is in worst state of air pollution and needs more attention and budget to combat it. Since 2018, air pollution has increased to severe. It is slowly killing people of Ahmedabad as cases of lungs and heart diseases are on a rise. While pollution caused by firecrackers and climatic condition is a seasonal contributor, according to the Gujarat ENVIS Centre, major contributors to air pollution are industries and vehicles. Most air contaminants originate from combustion processes. Your money will be used in better wastewater treatment, solid-waste management, and hazardous-waste management. Also, big-scale air purifiers can be installed on various hotspots.\n\nYou can also use your influence to spread awareness among citizens and government of India. Government can play a crucial role in combating air pollution by makins strict rules and punishing violators.\n\nIf this project is successful, you can look forward to Delhi and Patna.","c052e78f":"To analyse further I will consider only AQI as in India, the proposed AQI will consider eight pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb) for which short-term (up to 24-hourly averaging period) National Ambient Air Quality Standards are prescribed. So, other pollutants are included in AQI.","aa3b0308":"Ahmedabad's air quality is worst.
