Google Street View Coverage Disparity","b33d554c":"Looking at the global level, one might put forward the hypothesis that those countries which have full street view coverage belong to the

Others might argue that there may be other factors in play here - like the ease of access for Google to map the streets because of terrorism, govt. policies, privacy laws, societal temperament etc.\nSome others might say it is just a matter of time.  \n\n\nWell, leaving aside the aspect of time, let us focus on the other two hypotheses.\nLet's try to answer what all these countires have in common that might help us understand the cause of this disparity.\nWe are going to evaluate these two groups of countries - covered and uncovered quantitatively on *Development Level* and also briefly qualitatively on some possible factors.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n","73fba502":"In any case, this is a wonderful feature provided by Google to see distant lands from the comfort of your home, and surely it is going to increase its reach in the future - for which we might have to be patient.\nAnd with that, this marks the end of this brief analysis.","4eaafc78":"The Dataset contains the following fields:\n* **Countries** - 189 Countries, excluding some like North Korea, Macao, Monaco, Taiwan and some other disputed states\n* **Human Development Index 2019** - A composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development\u2014a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living; measured on a scale of 0-1, with 1 representing very high development.\n* **Internet users, total (Percentage of population) 2018** - People with access to the worldwide network.\n* **Coefficient of Human Inequality 2019** - Calculated as the arithmetic mean of the values in inequality in life expectancy, inequality in education and inequality in income, measured on a scale of 1-100, with 100 representing most inequality.\n* **GDP per capita (2017 PPP Dollar)** - GDP in a particular period divided by the total population in the same period, measured in USD\n* **Human Freedom Score 2018** - The Human Freedom Index presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom on a scale of 1-10 with 10 representing highest freedom.\n\n","e603bf24":"We will be commparing a manually compiled list of the names of these street view covered countires with the countries database taken from the UNDP Data center (*http:\/\/hdr.undp.org\/en\/data*).
