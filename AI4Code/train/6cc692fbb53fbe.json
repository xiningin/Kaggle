variables with the lowest correlations between death rate. In other words, countries where these metrics are low have a high death rate. As we already know, public water sanitation is a key strategy to prevent new cases and this chart shows why.\n- Surprisingly, easy access to basic handwashing facilities isn't much correlated with cholera incidence.\n- It's worth noticing that there is a considerable positive correlation between the percentage of population practicing open defecation and death rates. That is, countries with high percentages of open defecation usually have higher cholera death rates.","0e74c3d8":"With this graph, we can say that:\n\n- There are 4 crisis (peaks) in the last 70 years, in the 50s, 70s, 90s, 10s. Interesting enough, these peaks have a difference of 20 years between each other, so we might expect a new cholera outbreak around 2030, kidding. \n- The last two peaks had about 400.000 more cases than the first two.\n- Since 1990, we observe that a new plateau has been defined, with every year having at least 100.000 cases.\n- Until 1960, the number of deaths followed closely the number of cases, that is, the death rate at that time was very high when compared to nowadays.

After that, Philipines and Indonesia also had a considerable number of cases.\n- In 1970, India, Philipines, Nigeria and Niger had a large participation in the peak.\n- In 1991, the first reported American outbreak had started in Peru and spread to the rest of the continent in the next few years. Brazil, Bolivia and Equador also had a lot of cases.\n- Since 1990, we can see that at least one African country per year had a considerable number of cases. That explains again the plateau and confirms that cholera seems to be an endemic disease in the African continent. Global health authorities should look at this issue in a more careful way because there is a vaccine being produced since the beggining of 19th centure and it is cheap.\n- In 2010, Haiti and Dominican Republic had a huge number of cases. It probably happened due to 2010 Haiti earthquake, which unfortunately left a large part of the population in poor conditions and without acess to clean water.\n\n### How many countries report Cholera cases every year? <a id ='eda-report-time'><\/a>","57e95864":"Above we can see that some metrics, like access to basic handwashing facilities, have a high percentage of missing values.","1ca6a89e":"### Inspecting supposedly numeric columns <a id ='prep-insp'><\/a>\n\nSince the columns cases, deaths and death rate should be numeric, I tried to look for non-numeric characters to figure out problems.","1591427d":"In the next cells I will fix the dataset in order to keep only numeric data in the cases, deaths and death rate columns.

In 2017, an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen and Somalia caused 1.227.391 cases, which is 929% higher than 2016 and doubled the previous record of cases. This shows that cholera is still a dangerous disease to a large part of the population who doesn't have access to water sanitation and clean food. **In this kernel I will make an historical analysis of the disease progression and inspect which development and public health indexes are more correlated with the cholera incidence. My goal is to shed a light on this thorny issue. If you like it, please consider giving it an upvote.** \n\nIn order to do so, I utilized data from the World Health Organization, which anually collect reports from its members and compiles them in their website. About three milion cases occur every year, but, as we will see, the number of reported ones is way lower than that. This happens because some of the most affected countries doesn't have enough money and capacity to make a good cholera surveillance. **Therefore, it is necessary to make a disclaimer: this analysis is limited and we are only seeing part of the problem.**\n\nBefore we start, let's understand what Cholera is. It can affects both children and adults and for most of them it won't cause any symptom. However, the bacteria will be present in their faeces for up to 10 days and will possibly infect other people if sanitation is not present. A minority of people will develop acute watery diarrhoea that, if not treated, can kill within hours. Besides that, most cases of cholera can be easily treated with oral rehydration solution. According to WHO, \"a multifaceted approach is key to control cholera, and to reduce deaths. A combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines are used\". Since 1990, three oral vaccines that cost at most $4 have been developed.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Importing data and libs](#importing-data)\n- [Data preparation](#data-prep)\n    * [First look at the data](#prep-first)\n    * [Inspecting supposedly numeric columns](#prep-insp)\n    * [Missing values](#prep-miss)\n- [Exploratory analysis](#eda)\n    * [How is the disease spreading globally over time?](#eda-global-time)\n    * [What are the regions most affected by Cholera?](#eda-region-time)\n    * [Visualizing the disease progression with an animated world map](#eda-country-time)\n    * [How many countries report Cholera cases every year?](#eda-report-time)\n    * [Which country is more affected?](#eda-bar-country)\n    * [Where is the death rate high?](#eda-bar-death-rate)\n    * [Is chorela incidence correlated with human development indexes?](#eda-corr)\n    * [What is the impact of water treatment in the spread of cholera?](#eda-water)\n\n## Importing data and libs <a id ='importing-data'><\/a>","c365af4c":"According to the graph, Bangladesh and Oman have death rates above 40%, followed closely by India with around 38%.\n\nNow, let's examine which countries have the highest rates in the last decade.","a5c7eb82":"### Missing values <a id ='prep-miss'><\/a>","97726079":"Scatterplots whose data follow a kind of linear relationship have higher correlations.
