Online learning (especially Coursera) is popular among the 35-44 year old respondents. Prediction of compensation, education, experience, and being a data scientist would require classification. Python, R, and SQL are commonly used, as expected. Though machine learning is popular, many in this category are relatively new to it. Based on areas such as experience in general and coding experience, the data suggests career\/role changers are well represented in this group of respondents. The US is well represented among this population. ML experience is relatively low, but this is expected as data science in general is a relatively new field. When reviewing the data on DBs, ML, big data tools\/products\/frameworks, there are a large variety of products being utilized. *\n\n*One final observation from the data. Some of the respondents selected 20 years and higher for experience in a number of questions (experience in roles, coding experience, etc.). In some cases this seems unrealistic, especially for the 30+ years cases. More realistic for respondents in their 40's, especially if their experience is 26 years or less. It's not impossible but more likely that some respondents selected the wrong answer, or perhaps they were exposed to data science\/analytics at a young age. *","9917fefa":"**Tools of the Trade...**","5166383f":"*Males clearly represent the majority of 35-44 year old respondents.
