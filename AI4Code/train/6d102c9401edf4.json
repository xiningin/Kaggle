Formerly, this disease was referred to as **2019 novel coronavirus** or **2019-nCoV**.\nThe COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold. \n\n**What are the symptoms of COVID-19?**\u202f \n\nSymptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. \n\n**How does COVID-19 spread?**\n\nThe virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.\n\n**Who is\u202fmost at risk?**\n\nWe are learning more about how\u202fCOVID-19\u202faffects people every day.\u202f\u202fOlder people, and people with chronic medical conditions,\u202fsuch as diabetes and heart disease,\u202fappear to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms.\u202f","08dcdea9":"# COVID-19 Cases in Indonesia (**cases.csv**)\n\nIndonesia as one of the most populous countries cannot escape the COVID-19 pandemic.
