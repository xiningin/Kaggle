Are employees that live further away more likely to have the Attrition status \"Yes\"\n","4a387914":"Based on the first 5 rows, we can see that each row is an employee at IBM. Each employee has many characteristics to define them including; age, how often they travel on business, how far work is from home, etc. \n\nA thing to note is the first column in the output (the one that has no header and starts counting from 0 and incrementing by one), otherwise known as the index column. If you do not specify an index column when reading in the csv file (Step 1), you can do so using the function DataFrame.set_index()\n\nAn important column is attrition. The purpose of this dataset is to see if there are any factors that contribute to a reduction in attrition. So lets practice setting the dataframe index to \"Attrition\".\n\nNote:\n> If you want to save the dataframe with the new column, you can't just call the function. You have to save the new version to a variable. For example:\n* < employees.set_index(\"Attrition\") > **WOULD NOT** result in the dataframe employees being overriden with the new dataframe\n* < employees = employees.set_index(\"Attrition\") > **WOULD** result in the dataframe employees having the new version of the dataframe with \"Attrition\" as the index column","9c26e5aa":"**Selection Method #1: Index Slicing**\n\niloc[ ] is a great way to slice a dataframe into more digestible slices\n> The easiest way to remember the use of iloc[ ] is to think of the i in iloc to stand for index\n\niloc slices based on the index of the dataframe.

Importing the Data\n\nThe first step in analyzing data is to upload the data into python. This can be done using the pandas read_csv function.\n\n\nNote: \n> 1. Ensure quotes (\" \") are put around the file name within the read_csv function (i.e. pd.read_csv(\"file_name.csv\"))\n        Within the quotes, you want to put the path to your file.

Graphing the Data\n\nSometimes, it is easier to understand data when you can see it. Pandas allows you to visualize the data by plotting it. Pandas also allows you to combine different functions.\n\nYou can groupby, get the mean, select specific columns, and plot data all in one line. We can see the means for the first four columns and plot a horizontal bar chart based the average based on attribtion (\"Yes\" or \"No\")\n\nAnother function that can be used is sort_values(). This allows for sorting based on a value, in this case Attrition.\n> The default direction for sort_values is ascending\n\nThe plot function allows you pick what type of plot you want to use. plot.scatter(), plot.bar(), plot.pie(), etc. \n\nPlay around with the different types of plots to see the results.\n    ","3b45a0ca":"**Groupby and mean**\n\n--- Groupby ---\n\nGroupby involves three steps:\n1.

Apply - Choose a function to apply to each group created in the split (mean, std, median, etc.)\n> In this case, we use mean() to find the average values for each column in the employees_select dataframe\n3. Combine - Combine the results into a dataframe \n\n\n> Note: If you don't want to include all columns in the Split-Apply-Combine process, you can select which columns to include.\n    \n    > Example:\n    > employees_select.groupby(\"Attrition\")[[\"Age\", \"DistanceFromHome\"]].mean()\n    \n    \n>> Output:\n    \n          \t    Age\t        DistanceFromHome\n    Attrition\t\t\n    No\t         37.561233\t8.915653\n    Yes\t        33.607595\t10.632911","70662602":"# 6. Conclusion\n\nEmployees that live closer to work at more likely to continue their jobs at IBM. The DistanceFromHome factor illustrates that if IBM can determine which factors truly matter to their employees, they can reduce their turnover rate resulting in employees that stay longer and have highly skilled and committed workforce.","4959204f":"# A Pandas Tutorial\n\nThis Tutorial will include:\n    1.
