FORECASTING THE 2017-2018 TALENTS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**\n\nUsing the decision tree fitted on players from 2009-2010 to 2016-2017, I forecast which strikers are expected to shine in 2017-2018. My goal is to find players which are expected to be in the top 10% of their league in 2017-2018 but who were in 2016-2017 rated below 715 (i.e. *relatively* under the radar) and under 30. \n\nI then match this list of players with the players' actual performance and compare my sample to a randomly selected sample of the same size.","6eddd78e":"**6. CONCLUSION**\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through my first random forest! I look forward to your thoughts, advice and suggestions.","8cab1205":"**1. INTRODUCTION**\n\nI've had for about a year now data on football performance of all players in the 5 'Big Leagues' (i.e. England, Spain, Italy, Germany & France) between 2009-2010 and 2016-2017 and I decided to try to fit a random forest on the data and see how much I can predict future success. \n\nI focus for now on strikers, which appear to be much more homogeneous in terms of performance. \n\nMy goal is to find a way to predict which players are 'relatively' under the radar and become rated in the top 10% of their league the following season.\n\nI will first present my data, then perform a random forest analysis to link period *t+1* rating with period *t* performance. I follow this by a concrete example of what my data predicts as the best 2018 strikers, and link this result to actual performance data. I finally wrap this up by forecasting the 2019 talents.\n\nPlease do comment and point me towards improvements !","956135fe":"**5. FORECASTING THE 2018-2019 TALENTS**\n\nUsing the same random forest, I use the 2017-2018 data to forecast the high potential players of the incoming season:","d2541a13":"**3.  RANDOM FOREST**\n\nI use the RandomForestRegressor from the sklearn package to fit my data. ","2ac0094c":"**2. DATA PRESENTATION**\n\nEach row of my dataset represents the performance of a player over a specific season. All measures (except for Rating & Rank) are *per 90 minutes*.\n\nRank is on a League and season basis, and stems from the Rating. Rating is on a scale from 0 to 1000.\n\nRatingf1 and Ratingf2 link the player's performance to his Rating respectively one and two seasons later (done in Excel).\n\nClassf1 (also done in Excel) categorizes the players from their Rating percentile: 1 is for top 10% players, 2 for top 25% players, 3 for top 50% players, 4 for top 75% players and 5 for the bottom 25%.","4b8f6682":"I filter to select the top 20% of the players with high potential (i.e. I exclude Messi & co who have been performing incredibly well over the past), and *voil\u00e0!*","66e0fbf1":"Although my group average is well below the top 10% target (730), it seems like I am still picking up on valid characteristics and that the players do on average, ceteris paribus, very well. \n\nI encourage you to look into the disapointing players, and you'll often find interesting stories (e.g. Carrasco moved to China after just a few months of the season).","2febff4e":"As you can see here, the dataset is quite rich. I now keep only the strikers who have played more than 1500 minutes over the season and for whom I can match performance with the following season's rating (i.e. where Ratingf1 exists). \nLet's look at the distribution of Ratingf1:"}}
