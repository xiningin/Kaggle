BASIC SPOT\n> The Basic Spot is a reference point for specific types of plays that is used to determine the Spot of Enforcement.\n> \n> ARTICLE 3. SPOTS OF ENFORCEMENT\n> The Spot of Enforcement is the spot at which a penalty is enforced. Six such spots are commonly used:\n> \n> The Previous Spot: The spot at which the ball was last put in play.\n> The Spot of the Foul: The spot at which a foul was committed or, by rule, is considered to have been committed.\n> The Spot of a Backward Pass or a Fumble: The spot at which the backward pass or fumble occurred during the down in which there was a foul.\n> The Dead Ball Spot: The spot at which the ball became dead.\n> The Succeeding Spot: The spot at which the ball will next be put in play (i.e., the spot of the ball after enforcement for a foul, or, if there has been no foul, the spot at which the ball became dead.)\n> The Spot of a Change of Possession: The spot at which possession is gained by or awarded to the opponent.\n> ARTICLE 4. VIOLATION\n> A violation is an infraction of a playing rule for which a penalty is not prescribed. A violation does not offset a foul.\n> \n> SECTION 15 - HANDLING THE BALL\n> Handing the ball is transferring player possession from one teammate to another without passing or kicking it.\n> \n> Except where permitted by rule, handing the ball forward to a teammate is illegal.\n> Loss of player possession by unsuccessful execution of attempted handing is a fumble charged to the player that last had possession. A muffed handoff (legal or illegal) is a fumble, and the ball remains alive.\n> A forward handoff occurs when the ball is handed (regardless of the direction of the movement of the ball) to a player who is in advance of a teammate from whose hands he takes or receives it.\n> SECTION 16 - HUDDLE\n> A Huddle is the action of two or more players in the field of play or in the end zone who, instead of assuming their normal position for the snap, free kick, or Fair Catch kick form a group for receiving instructions for the next play or for any other reason.\n> \n> SECTION 17 - IMPETUS\n> Impetus is the action of a player who carries the ball or provides the force (i.e., a pass, kick, snap, or fumble) that causes a ball in the field of play to touch or cross a goal line. If a Loose Ball touches or crosses a goal line, the impetus is attributed to the team whose player passed, kicked, snapped, or fumbled the ball, unless an opponent:\n> \n> muffs a ball that is at rest, or nearly at rest; or\n> bats a ball that has been kicked or fumbled; or\n> bats a backward pass after it has struck the ground; or\n> illegally kicks any ball (12-5-2).\n> Notes\n> \n> 1. The impetus is always attributed to the offense, unless the defense creates a new force that sends the ball behind its own goal line by muffing a ball which is at rest or nearly at rest, or by batting a loose ball on the ground or kicking any loose ball.\n> \n> 2. If a passive player is pushed or blocked into any kicked or fumbled ball or into a backward pass after it has struck the ground, causing the Loose Ball to touch a goal line or anything on or behind a goal line, the impetus is attributed to the pusher or blocker, provided that the pushed (blocked) player was not making an attempt to block an opponent.**","ee0bb633":"**Position analysis of play during 2017 Weekly season matches **","44c42dd5":"**Position analysis of play during 2016 Pre season matches **","cb7e65b1":"![](https:\/\/c.o0bg.com\/rf\/image_1200w\/Boston\/2011-2020\/2017\/12\/29\/BostonGlobe.com\/Sports\/Images\/df718101b1e04231b54ac3d654e9c5a0-df718101b1e04231b54ac3d654e9c5a0-0.jpg?uuid=uQuK7OzeEeerbgMQBVbbXg)","a7ef7d67":"**Mercedes Benz Stadium is the best stadium among the football stadium, it's architecture is flabbergasting.**","f84a7c3e":"![](https:\/\/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/0c\/0c\/d4\/11\/nfl.jpg)","c985278e":"# Regular Weekly Play Analysis from Week 7 - 12 ","64cde034":"# Most Stadium's Type of the NFL Stadiums used","83023025":"# Weather of the whole season ","20c34b0c":"# NFL Injury Statistics (including Concussion, MCL, ACL)","bdedd3b4":"**A concussion is a type of brain injury. It involves a short loss of normal brain function. It happens when a hit to the head or body causes your head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, creating chemical changes in your brain. Sometimes it can also stretch and damage your brain cells.**\n\n**Sometimes people call a concussion a \"mild\" brain injury. It is important to understand that while concussions may not be life-threatening, they can still be serious.**\n\n**Concussions are a common type of sports injury. Other causes of concussions include blows to the head, bumping your head when you fall, being violently shaken, and car accidents.**\n\n**Symptoms of a concussion may not start right away; they may start days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea, ringing in your ears, dizziness, or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury. Consult your health care professional if any of your symptoms get worse, or if you have more serious symptoms such as**\n\n**Convulsions or seizures\nDrowsiness or inability to wake up\nA headache that gets worse and does not go away\nWeakness, numbness, or decreased coordination\nRepeated vomiting or nausea\nConfusion\nSlurred speech\nLoss of consciousness\nTo diagnose a concussion, your health care provider will do a physical exam and will ask about your injury. You will most likely have a neurological exam, which checks your vision, balance, coordination, and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases, you may also have a scan of the brain, such as a CT scan or an MRI. A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain, as well as skull fractures.**\n\n**Most people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning, you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration, such as studying, working on the computer, or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse. Then when your health care provider says that it is ok, you can start to return to your normal activities slowly.**","0ae9f2c4":"# **Players and their Partner's Movement during the play which caused concussion**","11b78d84":"# Analysis -\n**1.

It is intended to remove unnecessary use of the helmet. The hits do not have to come to the head or neck but anywhere on the body. Players cannot use their helmets to butt, spear or ram an opponent.**\n\n**Plays subject to ejection include when a player has an unobstructed path to his opponent or contact was clearly avoidable, but the player chose to lower his head and use his helmet.**\n\n**Correction- There should be a speed parameter included to the rule, as in my analysis most of these players were travelling more than their avg miles\/hr. If the player is lowering his helmet and moving more than avg miles\/hr decided by NFL then he should be ejected from the game with 15 yards penalty and no ejection shall be committed if player lowers his helmet under stationary motion unless the player is taking down the moving player using his helmet.**\n\n2.**Protection of Punt Returners-\nIt is most often the Punt returners which face concussion during the tackle or by being blocked by imposing fair catch rule on them(5 yard award) or use canadian football rules which is The kicker and any players behind him at the time of the kick are considered onside; any other players on the kicking team are considered offside. A player who is onside may recover the kicked ball, while a player who is offside may not be the first to touch the kicked ball and is required to remain at least 5 yards from an opposing player attempting to catch the ball. Violations of these restrictions on an offside player are called no yards infractions, with various penalties associated with them. Better helmet for Punt Returners, punt left guard or punt right guard, or more protection for PR by giving him extra man in front of him in lineup formation rather than just PR only by himself.**\n\n3. **Blindsided block or Moving backwards block\/tackle-**\n\n**Almost 30% of these concussion happened due to blindsided block or while those PLG\/PLG were trying to catch the ball while moving backwards this cause some serious head blow to catchers if they got tackled while moving backwards.**\n\n**Another thing to mention that bad landing happened due to lack of vision to upcoming tackles, which caused them injury leading to concussion.**\n\n**Rule- A player who receives a \u201cblindside\u201d block when the path of the offensive blocker is toward or parallel to his own end line is a defensenless player.**\n\n**Correction- The blocking\/tackling player should be in the eye range(180 degrees) of the player getting tackled regardless of it's position or direction.**\n\n**Rule- A receiver attempting to catch a pass who has not had time to clearly become a runner.
