Statistics Canada (French: Statistique Canada), formed in 1971, is the Canadian government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. \n\nWe will be basically using three main indicators the GDP, CPI and the working hours and how they have been impacted by the covid-19 to analyze it's impact on the canadian economy. So before starting let's first try to understand what these indicators indicate:\n\nGDP by industry: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by industry is one of the three GDP series produced by the Canadian System of National Accounts (CSNA) of Statistics Canada. It is also known as the Output based GDP, because it sums the value added (output less intermediate consumption of goods and services) of all industries in Canada. A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal movements have been eliminated. More information about this can be obtained from -https:\/\/unstats.un.org\/unsd\/nationalaccount\/workshops\/2009\/ottawa\/AC188-Bk4.PDF\n\nCPI: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is not a cost-of-living index. We could compute a cost-of-living index for an individual if we had complete information about that person's taste and spending habits. To do this for a large number of people, let alone the total population of Canada, is impossible. For this reason, regularly published price indexes are based on the fixed-basket concept rather than the cost-of-living concept. More information about this can be obtained from - https:\/\/www.statcan.gc.ca\/eng\/subjects-start\/prices_and_price_indexes\/consumer_price_indexes\n\nWorkhours by industry: Actual hours worked is the sum of hours actually worked by all employed persons in the reference week. A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal movements have been eliminated. It should be noted that the seasonally adjusted series contain irregular as well as longer-term cyclical fluctuations. The seasonal adjustment program is a complicated computer program which differentiates between these seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements in a series over a number of years and, on the basis of past movements, estimates appropriate seasonal factors for current data. On an annual basis, the historic series of seasonally adjusted data are revised in light of the most recent information on changes in seasonality. More information about this can be obtained from - https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/t1\/tbl1\/en\/tv.action?pid=1410028901\n","1413ff84":"* Thus as we saw before and can also note from the above plots that the workhours for industries like 'Accomodation and food services' have significantly decreased over these months.\n* And products like 'Public administration' and 'Servicing producing sector' has experienced a steep decrease in workhours during the initial phase of this period but now they are slowly increasing over the time and this change can be contributed to the slow reopening of the economy.
