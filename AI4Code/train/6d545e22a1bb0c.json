Finally, we perform geometric verification using RANSAC and employ the number of inliers as the score for retrieved images.","77535b86":"# RANSAC for geometric verification\n\nRANSAC for geometric verification can be used to estimate geometric transformations. We want to make sure all matches are consistent with a global geometric transformation; however, there are many incorrect matches. Take the following graph for example, without the geometric verification there are many inconsistent matches while after applying RANSAC, we can estimate the geometric transformation and the set of consistent matches simultaneously.","2bc1ba04":"# The pre-trained DELF(Deep Local Feature) module:\nThis module is available on TensorFlow Hub can be used for image retrieval as a drop-in replacement for other keypoint detectors and descriptors.
