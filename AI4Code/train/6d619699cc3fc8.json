In this section, we look into the distribution of these two factors to examine which of them leads to the difference between male and female.","686787e8":"# Research questions and Objectives\n\nIn this context, the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II project was launched in 2014, providing comprehensive data with thermal comfort parameters collected through field studies around the world. The dataset provides considerable potential to support researchers and practitioners to further conduct their interested studies through selecting and analysing appropriate columns and rows. In this study, we aim to investigate how man and woman perceive thermal comfort differently throughout their lives. To address this research question, we select gender, age, metabolism and clothing as human factors with a label of thermal sensation, and building type as other factor. Taking these factors into consideration, this study aims to explore the relationship between gender and thermal sensation in different stages to emphasise objectives: \n\n- Comparing the difference within gender affected by thermal comfort\n- Analysing the imparct of other selected factors on male and female\n- Proposing generic recommendation with regard to gender in the operation of different building types.","3e88fbba":"Clothing index and metabolism are also analysed by heatmap here. Figure 2 verifies the different clothing performance of male and female in three building types. Basically, people in senior center tend to wear more clothes than others, while in classroom, people show the least clothing index among them. In this context, clothing need to consider as a potential factor on thermal sensation within gender.","c5f9aecf":"Based on the division of the thermal sensation, we generate three distribution maps to investigate the clothing difference between male and female within each thermal sensation level. The obvious gap shown in the figure indicates that the clothing index of women is constantly lower than men. Besides, women expresses tendency to adjust their clothing level from 0.3 to 0.6 depending on the thermal sensation, while men remain at a relatively high level of around 0.7 even when they feel heat.\n\nAccording to the relevant literature and newspapers, we infer that it is related to dress code that lead to gender difference of thermal sensation in the office. Some office guidelines place a premium on men with more capable and mature looking, that they forbid men to wear anything other than neat, ironed business suits and ties, even when women are celebrating the warm weather with sundresses, silk shirts, and linen shorts. Furthermore, it can also be speculated that the temperature setting in most offices is based primarily on men rather than women, and thus women feel much colder in that building environment.","6820ca26":"## Differences in Gender Thermal Sensation within Three Building Types\n\nTo dive into this interesting phenomenon, we plot three main bar charts to investigate the gender difference in thermal sensation within three building types. Based on the range of thermal sensation, we split it into three levels to indicate different perception of thermal comfort:\n\n- Cooler: (-3,0]\n- Comfortable: (0)\n- Warmer: [0,-3)\n\nWe then calculate the population percentage of female and male to compare the gender gap within these three sensation levels fairly and clearly.","da9ba0b5":"From above, Figure 1 illustrates the different performance of female and male in three building types with heterogeneous thermal sensation. In each type of building, female and male show slight discrepancy on thermal sensation. Particularly, the thermal sensation values in office buildings are found with lower satisfaction than the other two types. However, it is not clear to define which gender group is more sensitive to cold or heat, which requires specific investigation.\n","79ad87c4":"Generally, the clothing index in classroom is the lowest among the three building types with an index less than 0.5 for both male and female. Besides, women are more likely to wear less clothes than men. But the most significant discrepancy still exists in the office, comparing to the other two building types, where the median clothing index of male almost reaches to the upper quartile of female. In this context, we assume that clothing is a reason causing women to feel colder in office buildings. **Now we relate the clothing index to the thermal sensation in office building.**","65bd312d":"# Overview of Dataset\n\nAn overview is conducted to obtain the basic information of dataset. We sort out all five different building types in the dataset, and find that age distribution can be characteristic in some certain building types. As shown in the box plots below, most surveyed people in classrooms are aged at around 20 years old, while mid-aged people occupy the office buildings mainly, and senior centers almost cover the elders only.\n\nThrough the preliminary overview, we find out that the building types of classroom, office, and senior center could generally present three typical age groups as mentioned above. On this basis, we focus these three building types and zoom in the research scope to conduct the following analysis.","9fa87d72":"The third heatmap displays a comparison of metabolism. In general, it is hard to tell the difference between gender and building types with regard to metabolism, as the interval of metabolism label is not significant in the figure. A further exploration is required in the later section.\n\n**To summarise**, the general overview preliminarily indicates gender difference on thermal sensation, as well as the diverse situation in the building types. In addition, clothing index is also a possible factor due to the significant discrepancy between gender and building types. Nevertheless, metabolism does not reflect obvious difference. The detailed analysis of our research questions shows in the next stage.","cf76fcec":"Firstly, the above distribution map shows the density of metabolic rate within gender in the senior center, office and classroom respectively. The metabolic rate generally tends to decrease with age. Specifically, the rate of classroom concentrates on around 1.3 while senior center falls to less than 1.0. However, it is noticed that there is no significant gender difference in each building type, especially in office, where both the range and the peak of metabolic rate are highly coincident. It turns out that metabolism may not be the main factor influencing gender thermal sensation.","65a18385":"# Recommendation\n\nMany reports are discussing the issue of office AC temperature control and gender differences in thermal sensation. According to our data analysis and conclusions, dress code in offices should be the main factor\u200b for the gender differences of thermal sensation. Generally, males wear more clothes in the summer office buildings than females. Therefore, the following recommendations are made:\n\n**Dress Code:** \nThe office dress code for males should be more flexible during summer.\n\n**Air-Condition Temperature:**\nOn the basis of adjusting the office dress code of males, the temperature setting of AC can be adjusted appropriately to adapt to females' thermal sensation.\n\n**Zoned Temperature Control:**\nThe zoned temperature control system could be widely introduced into buildings. Males and females could adjust the regional temperature according to individual thermal sensations. So that people could be focused on attention and their individual needs. \n\nMeanwhile, we suggest that more investigations on the thermal comfort of gender differences under natural ventilation systems could be conducted.\n","a59f567a":"# **How do men and women perceive thermal comfort differently?**\n\n**Group 8**: Cao Kehan, Fan Juanjuan, Gao Xinyi, Lei Binyu, Liu Yanhan\n\n# Background\n\nIn the modern societies, an interesting phenomenon in buildings is that women have more complaints against indoor temperature. A relevant study shows that more than half of the laboratory and field studies have found that females express more dissatisfaction than males in the same thermal environments, which indicates that women typically prefer a warmer workspace than men in many regards (Karjalainen, 2021). The relationship between human difference and thermal comfort has been widely investigated in the literature and considered as a crucial part in the design and operation of built environment (Wang et al., 2018). According to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), it determines thermal comfort as \u201cthe condition of the mind in which satisfaction is expressed with the thermal environment\u201d (Timplalexis et al., 2019). It addresses that people are generally affected by thermal conditions and present different levels of sensation with a state of mind. One of the typical situations is that subjects may perceive different comfort in the same thermal environment influenced by individual differences, such as gender, sex, metabolism, local culture, etc.","0c3a27c7":"# Future Works\nAfter we finish analysing human factors for gender difference regarding thermal sensation in the office building, one irregular phenomenon also catch our attention that gender differences of thermal sensation in the office building is opposite to classroom. In general, girls more likely feel heat in the classroom. Through analysing the dataset, more than 70% of the cooling strategy in the classroom is **natural ventilation**. According to related literature, some researchers have pointed out that women have slightly higher average temperatures than men (Mackowiak, Wasserman, and Levine, 1992). Berglund (1998) shows that thermal sensation also depends on body temperature, which in turn relates to thermal balance and the effects of environmental factors as well as human factors. Therefore, the possibility for future works could also consider human body temperature, outdoor temperature, humidity and other relevant factors related to this phenomenon within gender, which has potential to conduct other interesting studies on the basis of our work.","02922438":"# Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we study gender difference on thermal sensation in the three building types, and verify that female tends to feel colder than male in the office. The performance is also different in classroom and senior center. Therefore, gender is not the only human factor impacting on thermal sensation.\n\nOn this basis, we then investigate the influence of other human factors including clothing index and metabolism in office building. However, the result does not indicate obvious gender discrepancy regarding metabolism which not considered as a relevant factor causing different thermal sensation in the office. On the other hand, women are found to wear fewer clothes than men in the office all the time. Thus, we assume that the dress code could be the primary factor leading to different thermal feeling within gender in the office buildings.\n\nAs for the situation in classroom, we find out that female is more sensitive to heat environment than male. In this context, we try to investigate the influence of both clothing and metabolism without obtaining reasonable inferences. Nevertheless, the common cooling strategy of natural ventilation is possible to associate with this phenomenon in classroom, which means other factors like temperature and humidity may also influence the thermal sensation difference.","d63e0b17":"The percentage of female feeling a chill in office building is larger than that of male. It also indicates that men are more likely to feel thermal comfort than female due to the percentage difference between 41% and 35% respectively. However, the gender difference is not found in the group with warmer feelings. Overall, it firstly infers that the proportion of female feeling cold is more than male in office.","c7f4a2f6":"## Why gender difference of thermal sensation in classroom is different with office building?\n\nAfter we finish analysing human factors related to gender difference of thermal sensation in the office building, one irregular phenomenon also catch our attention, that the gender differences of thermal sensation in the office building is opposite to classroom. Basically, girls more likely feel heat in the classroom. **Why does this phenomenon happened?** Following the analysis in the office buildings, we are trying to set human factor as a start point to figure out the relevant reason. So we analyse the influence of metabolism and clothing index on thermal sensation in the classroom. The results are as follows.\n\n**Clothing - Thermal Sensation in Classroom:** The plot illustrates that there is no obvious heterogeneity within gender regarding the clothing index in the classroom.\n\n**Metabolism - Thermal Sensation in Classroom:** Unexpectedly, the plot illustrates that there does not reflect different performance on metabolism between male and female regardless of these three building types.\n\nTherefore, in the aspect of human factors, it seems complicated to explain why females are more likely to feel heat than males in the classroom. Further research requires to conduct and align with this study.","20065d95":"# Analysis\nIn this section, we carry out detailed analysis to investigate the possible gender discrepancy of thermal sensation, as well as the phenomenon in these three different building types. Then, we also explore potential influencing factors that may have impacts on thermal perception, trying to receive other valuable results and conclusions.\n\n## General overview\n\nFirstly, we conduct a general overview of the selected dataset through heatmap. The result demonstrates that gender difference on the mean values of thermal sensation, as well as in different building types. Following this observation, we then consider clothing index and metabolism as other human factors to briefly reflect the gender difference.","c2d8cadf":"From the zone with cooler feeling in the chart above, it indicates slight gender difference that male is more sensitive to a chill in classroom, but the distinction of proportion values is not significant. Both 39% of female and male locate in the zone of thermal comfort. Whereas in the third group, females are more possibly to feel warmer than male.","592fb32d":"It is clear that most female and male tend to feel comfortable in the thermal environment despite a small group of people feeling cold. The proportion of people with warmer sensation is 31% for both male and female. No obvious gender discrepancy is indicated in the senior center.\n\n**To summarise**, based on the above investigation of three building types, we have verified that females are more sensitive to a chill environment than male in office buildings as illustrated in the background. However, females does not always feel cold in classrooms, and even feel the same as male in senior centers. In this case, we would like to continue exploring **why does the gender discrepancy exist in office and classroom?**","ef728c7d":"# Research method\n\nIn this study, based on problem statement of different perception of thermal comfort between men and women, we adopt exploratory analysis to verify temporary hypotheses and conduct a general comparison of thermal comfort in terms of gender. Exploratory analysis is an effective method to enable researchers understand the situation at an early stage and find out possible factors with impact on a particular issue through investigating relevant variables and analyse inner correlations among them. In consideration of data scale, we firstly select factors that highly associated with human including sex, clothing index, age and metabolism. To address different thermal comfort, we also consider building types as non-personal factors, where people spend almost 90% of their time indoor in the modern societies (Klepeis et al., 2001). Afterwards, we control summer as a baseline in order to exclude other impacts on the result. Furthermore, we use the function of plotting in Pandas to realise data visualisation and conduct comparison via different types of charts. \n\n**Analytical method**\n- Exploratory analysis\n- Plotting functions in Pandas\n\n**Data selection**\n- Human factors: Sex \/ Clothing \/ Age \/ Metabolism\n- Other factors: Building type\n- Index: Thermal sensation\n- Season: Summer\u200b\n\n**Data visualisation**\n- Heatmap: reflect an overview of thermal sensation between male and female based on colour saturations\n- Bar chart: examine difference within gender in details\n- Box plot: explore a comparison of man's and woman's perception of thermal comfort\n- Distribution plot: investigate the correlation within gender regarding thermal comfort"}}
