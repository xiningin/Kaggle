So all the values of each variable needs to be on the same scale so as to have equal distances.\n\nA varibale whose value ranges like 500g will be perceived more dominant by the algorithm than 5kg despite the fact 5kg is bigger than 500g.\n\nThus we standardize the data by substracting the mean and dividing it with its is standard deviation, thus each data sample will have unit variance.","ce7b49a1":"### Finding the optimum Clustering\n\n####  using KMeans via the Elbow Method and Silhouette scores\n\nKmeans is used to do the clusters and to find their centroids.\n\nBasically we run the KMeans() from sklearn with most of its parameters as default except the number of clusters which we fun via a for loop to find out the optimum cluster size and its Silhouette score.\n\n#### Kmeans:-\n\nThe KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares\n\nThis algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. Inertia makes the assumption that clusters are convex and isotropic, which is not always the case. It responds poorly to elongated clusters, or manifolds with irregular shapes, another reason for required standardization.\n\nhttps:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/clustering.html#k-means\n\nParameters: https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html\n\n\n#### Silhoutte Scores\n\nThe Silhouette Coefficient is calculated using the mean intra-cluster distance (a) and the mean nearest-cluster distance (b) for each sample. The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is (b - a) \/ max(a, b). \n\nThe best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar.\n\nParameters: Mostly at defaults with Labels set via KMeans.Labels_.\n\nhttps:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html","78ee5622":"Thus based on the above output we understand the data type of each category and we can assume that there is no null values bases on the fact that all 4 variables have equal non null counts","cd15d709":"We start by importing the dependencies.\n1.

The **Red** group lies in the bottom left of the plots have both least Income and Spending Capability. They are rational with their spending habits and thus will choose **Value** products which offer maximum benefit for least price. A **mass** marketing strategy will work in this type of consumer segment. **Offers, discounts** are quite attractive to this group. A all in one departmental stores like Walmarts, Big bazar (India) are preferred retailers.\n\n2. The **Blue** group are mostly **Impulse buyers** who dont believe in saving. A good array of display with relevant digital marketing techniques like location based advertisement to offers can be used to attact this group. Display plays a key role in selling to these customers. Can be seen flocking around Exclusive branded stores as well as departmental all in one retails.\n\n3. The **Skyblue** group behaves like an ideal group who likes to maintain a optimised life of earning and spendings. They are generally value buyers who like to buy products of low cost but gives the premium feel. Such customers will opt for EMI based shopping of high value CGs or like to upgrade an old item with a new. Can be seen flocking around Exclusive branded stores as well as departmental all in one retails.\n\n4. The **Green** group are groups who are savers and don't believe in unnecessary expenditure. They generally buy a movie tickets sans the pop corn. Prefer to buy a lot from all in one departmental retails.\n\n5. The **Indigo** group are high earners and high spenders thus a lucrative target for all types of goods. They are thrill, luxury seakers who don't bugde to spend the extra bug for good experience. Exclusive branded outlets are the most preferred choices here.\n\n\n\nNB: Group colour are based on the above Graph only."}}
