(Second Submission)\n\n\n#### **The Challenge**\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered \u201cunsinkable\u201d RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: **\u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d** using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).","54644bdc":"**From the above barplot, we have majority of the passangers(491) in the 3rd class**","13ac2a8d":"I will be dropping columns that i believe wouldn't be detaminants of if a passanger survived or not.  \nthe PassangerId, Ticket, Cabin and Name columns will be dropped while the missing values in the age, SibSp, Parch and Fare will be replaced with their respective column averages. The missing values in the \"Embarked\" column will be replaced with \"U\" which stands for unkown. This cleaning will be done on both datasets.","2cf13b65":"From the above mapping in \"Sex\" column, \"female\" has be converted to zero and \"male\" is 1.
