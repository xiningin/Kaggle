I simply solve the problem in six staightforward steps:\n\n1. Load the data\n2. Split in train and test sets\n3. Determine in input features are categorical or continuous\n4. Connect to a QLattice and reset it\n5. Use QLattice to find the simples possible model\n6. Evaluate the model (with AUC for classification and $R^2$ for regression)\n\n","bc325f0e":"# 2.
