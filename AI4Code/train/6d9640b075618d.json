Mosquitoes have a slender segmented body, one pair of wings, one pair of halteres, three pairs of long hair-like legs, and elongated mouthparts. \n\nHere we are going to analyse what are the factors that that causes increase and decrease in mosquitoes.","37c8f5f2":"**Importing Data**","965b4679":"**Statistics of the dataset**"}}
