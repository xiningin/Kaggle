There are several candidates for this; such as the euclidean, the Pearson and the [cosine similarity scores](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cosine_similarity). There is no right answer to which score is the best. Different scores work well in different scenarios and it is often a good idea to experiment with different metrics.\n\nWe will be using the cosine similarity to calculate a numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies.

load the data now.","da7c56ea":"# **The Age of Recommender Systems**","61804b51":"> *  **Content Based Filtering**- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.","98f07fcf":"They are used to predict the **rating** or **preference** that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. \nMoreover,  companies like Netflix and Spotify  depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and sucees.","5140c997":"We get a mean Root Mean Sqaure Error of 0.89 approx which is more than good enough for our case. Let us now train on our dataset and arrive at predictions.","b9b6ce37":"### **Single Value Decomposition**\nOne way to handle the scalability and sparsity issue created by CF is to leverage a **latent factor model** to capture the similarity between users and items. Essentially, we want to turn the recommendation problem into an optimization problem. We can view it as how good we are in predicting the rating for items given a user. One common metric is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). **The lower the RMSE, the better the performance**.\n\nNow talking about latent factor you might be wondering what is it ?It is a broad idea which describes a property or concept that a user or an item have. For instance, for music, latent factor can refer to the genre that the music belongs to. SVD decreases the dimension of the utility matrix by extracting its latent factors. Essentially, we map each user and each item into a latent space with dimension r. Therefore, it helps us better understand the relationship between users and items as they become directly comparable. The below figure illustrates this idea.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*GUw90kG2ltTd2k_iv3Vo0Q.png)","608094e3":"We can now reuse our **get_recommendations()** function by passing in the new **cosine_sim2** matrix as your second argument.","fddcda12":"The next step would be to convert the names and keyword instances into lowercase and strip all the spaces between them. This is done so that our vectorizer doesn't count the Johnny of \"Johnny Depp\" and \"Johnny Galecki\" as the same.","7309b5da":"Next, we'll write functions that will help us to extract the required information from each feature.","770483cb":"The first dataset contains the following features:-\n\n* movie_id - A unique identifier for each movie.\n* cast - The name of lead and supporting actors.\n* crew - The name of Director, Editor, Composer, Writer etc.\n\nThe second dataset has the following features:- \n\n* budget - The budget in which the movie was made.\n* genre - The genre of the movie, Action, Comedy ,Thriller etc.\n* homepage - A link to the homepage of the movie.\n* id - This is infact the movie_id as in the first dataset.\n* keywords - The keywords or tags related to the movie.\n* original_language - The language in which the movie was made.\n* original_title - The title of the movie before translation or adaptation.\n* overview - A brief description of the movie.\n* popularity - A numeric quantity specifying the movie popularity.\n* production_companies - The production house of the movie.\n* production_countries - The country in which it was produced.\n* release_date - The date on which it was released.\n* revenue - The worldwide revenue generated by the movie.\n* runtime - The running time of the movie in minutes.\n* status - \"Released\" or \"Rumored\".\n* tagline - Movie's tagline.\n* title - Title of the movie.\n* vote_average -  average ratings the movie recieved.\n* vote_count - the count of votes recieved.\n\nLet's join the two dataset on the 'id' column\n","e64929b4":"So, the mean rating for all the movies is approx 6 on a scale of 10.The next step is to determine an appropriate value for m, the minimum votes required to be listed in the chart. We will use 90th percentile as our cutoff. In other words, for a movie to feature in the charts, it must have more votes than at least 90% of the movies in the list.","6ba1aafe":"## **Credits, Genres and Keywords Based Recommender**\nIt goes without saying that the quality of our recommender would be increased with the usage of better metadata. That is exactly what we are going to do in this section. We are going to build a recommender based on the following metadata: the 3 top actors, the director, related genres and the movie plot keywords.\n\nFrom the cast, crew and keywords features, we need to extract the three most important actors, the director and the keywords associated with that movie. Right now, our data is present in the form of \"stringified\" lists , we need to convert it into a safe and usable structure","78a84b1a":"We see that our recommender has been successful in capturing more information due to more metadata and has given us (arguably) better recommendations. It is more likely that Marvels or DC comics fans will like the movies of the same production house. Therefore, to our features above we can add *production_company* . \nWe can also increase the weight of the director , by adding the feature multiple times in the soup.","4ed9b531":"For movie with ID 302, we get an estimated prediction of **2.618**. One startling feature of this recommender system is that it doesn't care what the movie is (or what it contains). It works purely on the basis of an assigned movie ID and tries to predict ratings based on how the other users have predicted the movie.","d09842b3":"Now enough said , let's see how to implement this.\nSince the dataset we used before did not have userId(which is necessary for collaborative filtering) let's load another dataset. We'll be using the [**Surprise** ](https:\/\/surprise.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/index.html) library to implement SVD.","dc6344e7":"Hurray! We have made our first(though very basic) recommender.\nUnder the **Trending Now** tab of these systems we find movies that are very popular and they can just be obtained by sorting the dataset by the popularity column.","356058cc":"# **Content Based Filtering**\nIn this recommender system the content of the movie (overview, cast, crew, keyword, tagline etc) is used to find its similarity with other movies. Then the movies that are most likely to be similar are recommended.\n\n![](https:\/\/image.ibb.co\/f6mDXU\/conten.png)","10dc244f":"Now something to keep in mind is that these demographic recommender provide a general chart of recommended movies to all the users. They are not sensitive to the interests and tastes of a particular user.\nThis is when we move on to a more refined system-  Content Basesd Filtering. ","665e08f1":"Note that in this dataset movies are rated on a scale of 5 unlike the earlier one.","b842defb":"# **Collaborative Filtering**\n\nOur content based engine suffers from some severe limitations. It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.\n\nAlso, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who she\/he is.\n\nTherefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers.\nIt is basically of two types:-\n\n*  **User based filtering**-  These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity.\nThis filtering technique can be illustrated with an example. In the following matrixes, each row represents a user, while the columns correspond to different movies except the last one which records the similarity between that user and the target user. Each cell represents the rating that the user gives to that movie. Assume user E is the target.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*9NBFo4AUQABKfoUOpE3F8Q.png)\n\nSince user A and F do not share any movie ratings in common with user E, their similarities with user E are not defined in Pearson Correlation. Therefore, we only need to consider user B, C, and D. Based on Pearson Correlation, we can compute the following similarity.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*jZIMJzKM1hKTFftHfcSxRw.png)\n\nFrom the above table we can see that user D is very different from user E as the Pearson Correlation between them is negative. He rated Me Before You higher than his rating average, while user E did the opposite. Now, we can start to fill in the blank for the movies that user E has not rated based on other users.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*9TC6BrfxYttJwiATFAIFBg.png)\n\nAlthough computing user-based CF is very simple, it suffers from several problems. One main issue is that users\u2019 preference can change over time. It indicates that precomputing the matrix based on their neighboring users may lead to bad performance. To tackle this problem, we can apply item-based CF.\n\n* **Item Based Collaborative Filtering** - Instead of measuring the similarity between users, the item-based CF recommends items based on their similarity with the items that the target user rated. Likewise, the similarity can be computed with Pearson Correlation or Cosine Similarity. The major difference is that, with item-based collaborative filtering, we fill in the blank vertically, as oppose to the horizontal manner that user-based CF does. The following table shows how to do so for the movie Me Before You.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*LqFnWb-cm92HoMYBL840Ew.png)\n\nIt successfully avoids the problem posed by dynamic user preference as item-based CF is more static. However, several problems remain for this method. First, the main issue is ***scalability***. The computation grows with both the customer and the product. The worst case complexity is O(mn) with m users and n items. In addition, ***sparsity*** is another concern. Take a look at the above table again. Although there is only one user that rated both Matrix and Titanic rated, the similarity between them is 1. In extreme cases, we can have millions of users and the similarity between two fairly different movies could be very high simply because they have similar rank for the only user who ranked them both.\n\n","f76c1042":"We are now in a good position to define our recommendation function. These are the following steps we'll follow :-\n* Get the index of the movie given its title.\n* Get the list of cosine similarity scores for that particular movie with all movies. Convert it into a list of tuples where the first element is its position and the second is the similarity score.\n* Sort the aforementioned list of tuples based on the similarity scores; that is, the second element.\n* Get the top 10 elements of this list. Ignore the first element as it refers to self (the movie most similar to a particular movie is the movie itself).\n* Return the titles corresponding to the indices of the top elements.","883a12ab":"While our system has done a decent job of finding movies with similar plot descriptions, the quality of recommendations is not that great. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" returns all Batman movies while it is more likely that the people who liked that movie are more inclined to enjoy other Christopher Nolan movies. This is something that cannot be captured by the present system.","a55ab3e2":"In this kernel we'll be building a baseline Movie Recommendation System using [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tmdb\/tmdb-movie-metadata). For novices like me this kernel will pretty much serve as a foundation in recommendation systems and will provide you with something to start with. "}}
