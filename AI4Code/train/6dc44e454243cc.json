Human-induced warming of the climate is expected to continue throughout the 21st century and beyond.\n\nThe range in temperature projections partly reflects different projections of future greenhouse gas emissions. Different projections contain different assumptions of future social and economic development (economic growth, population level, energy policies), which in turn affects projections of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The range also reflects uncertainty in the response of the climate system to past and future GHG emissions (measured by the climate sensitivity).\n\nIn this study, we will assess which countries issue a larger share of CO2 emissions - high or low-income countries.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is an international document adopted in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997 in addition to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This document is an international agreement to control global warming, engaging signatory states to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nUnder the Kyoto Protocol, 37 industrialized countries and the European Community (the European Union-15, made up of 15 states at the time of the Kyoto negotiations) commit themselves to binding targets for GHG emissions. The targets apply to the four greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and two groups of gases, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). \n\nThe six GHG are translated into CO2 equivalents in determining reductions in emissions. These reduction targets are in addition to the industrial gases, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are dealt with under the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.","213fc1e1":"Where MSb is the estimated variance between groups and MSw is the estimated variance within groups, xk\u00af is the mean within each group, nk is the sample size for each group, xi is the individual data point, and xG\u00af is the total mean.\nSSb  - Sum of Squares Between the groups\nSSw  - Sum of Squares Within the group","fa0bb8fa":"Now lets explore what is the distribution by income groups","d4f349ca":"As we see, the std for High income, Low income and Lower middle income groups are higher that groups mean.\n\nMean values\nHigh income            9.849469\nLow income             0.283718\nLower middle income    0.785655\nUpper middle income    3.017710\n\nStd values\nHigh income std : 10.27\nLow income std : 0.54\nLower middle income std : 1.09\nUpper middle income std : 2.96\n\nLet's calculate coefficient of variation (V) for each group","9fe32289":"<img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/f6\/Overview_map_of_states_committed_to_greenhouse_gas_limitations_in_the_first_Kyoto_Protocol_period_%28years_2008-2012%29_%28greyscale%29.png\/1280px-Overview_map_of_states_committed_to_greenhouse_gas_limitations_in_the_first_Kyoto_Protocol_period_%28years_2008-2012%29_%28greyscale%29.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 2000px;\"\/>","d7fdd310":"From our data exploration so far, we can see that the Average CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita), are quite different for each income group.

Also note that the standard deviation of each group are also very different, so we've violated one of our assumpions. However, we are going to use the 1-way ANOVA test anyway just to show the concepts.\n\nAfter that, we will perform Kruskal-Wallis H-test to test the null hypothesis. The Kruskal-Wallis H-test tests the null hypothesis that the population median of all of the groups are equal. It is a non-parametric version of ANOVA. The test works on 2 or more independent samples, which may have different sizes. <br><b>Rejecting the null hypothesis based on the results of the test, does not indicate which of the groups differs. Post-hoc comparisons between groups are required to determine which groups are different.<\/b><br>","ea0d244d":"In introduction above, we asked the following questions:\n\n<br>Is it a problem that low-income countries have not made commitments and have no CO2 emission quota? Is their negative impact on climate change comparable to the impact of human activities in high-income countries? \nIt would be a problem if it is demonstrated that low-income countries issue CO2 equivalent to those issued by high-income countries or high.\n<br>\n    Is it a problem that there are high-income coutries, who have not made commitments and have no CO2 emission quota? It would be a problem if it is demonstrated that high-income countries issue more CO2 equivalent to those issued by low-income countries.\n    \n<br><b>The rejection of the zero hypothesis means that there is signifficant difference in CO2 emissions between each income group.<\/b>\n    \n<br>Data exploration shows, that for the period from 1960 to 2014, the Low income group and Lower middle income group countries together, are responssible for only 8% of worlds CO2 emissions per capita, and High income group countries are responsible for 71% of CO2 emissions per capita.","36ed607a":"<br>Under the Protocol, only the Annex I Parties have committed themselves to national or joint reduction targets (formally called \"quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives\".Parties to the Kyoto Protocol not listed in Annex I of the Convention (the non-Annex I Parties) are mostly low-income developing countries, and may participate in the Kyoto Protocol through the Clean Development Mechanism\n\n<br>The emissions limitations of Annex I Parties varies between different Parties.
