Now, in Indian prison the caring of the prisoners are better and even improved as we compare with the ancient time. Many steps are being taken in India for prison reformation and one of the big steps is introducing education for prisoners. For this, the education system and its all facilities have been combined with the prison system so that the prisoners may get the education and engage themselves in a productive work for their livelihood and finally live their life respectfully when they come out from the prison. Through education the prisoners can also learn the socialism and learn how to behave with the people living in society.

The objective of the University was to offer highquality, innovative and need-based programmes at different levels, to all those who require them; and reach out to the disadvantaged segments by offering programmes in all parts of the country\nand overseas at affordable cost. IGNOU has been steadily expanding opportunities for life-long higher education and democratising education by making it inclusive. The University has adopted a flexible and innovative approach which encourages\nlearners to move from education to work and vice versa.
