EDA suggests the following parameters:\n  \n    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1024, n_features=255, n_informative=33+x,\n                n_redundant=0, n_repeated=0, n_classes=2, n_clusters_per_class=3,\n                weights=None, flip_y=0.05, class_sep=1.0, hypercube=True, shift=0.0, \n                scale=1.0, shuffle=True, random_state=None) # where 0<=x<=14\n                \nThe important parameters to note are `n_clusters_per_class=3` and `n_informative=33+x`. This means that the data resides in `33+x` dimensional space within 6 hyper-ellipsoids. Each hyper-ellipsoid is a multivariate Gaussian distribution therefore the best classifiers to use are QDA, Pseudo Labeling, and Gaussian Mixture. (See appendix for EDA showing 3 clusters per class).\n\n![image](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/six62019.jpg)\n\n# Better than Perfect Classifier!\nIf Kaggle generated the data with the above function call to `make_classification` then\n\nMany participants will submit a perfect classifier since the data is easy to separate using QDA and GM. Therefore to win this Kaggle competition, we must submit a better than perfect classifier! The code presented in this kernel has randomness added (and marked in the code below) which allows this classifier to score as much as LB 0.00050 better than a perfect classifier.\n\nIf the data is made with Sklearn's `make_classification`, perfect classification is classifying everything correctly except the 2.5% randomly flipped labels. No model can consistently predict the flipped labels correct. However, if you add randomness to your model sometimes it will do better than perfect (and get some flipped targets correct) and sometimes it will do worse. Below is a scatter plot of this kernel's performance. The dotted line is a perfect classifier and each dot is one attempt of this kernel to classify a synthetic dataset (that is similar to this comp's data). \n\nThe 200 dots represent 10 attempts made on each of 20 different randomly created synthetic datasets. The black dotted lines were determined by modifying `make_classification` to output the AUC of perfect classification. (See Appendix 3 for more info).\n\n\n![image](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/scatter61719.png)\n\nBesides indicating perfect classification on average, this scatter plot also shows that there is no correlation between this kernel's public LB and private LB performance. Therefore for our final submission, we will not choose our highest public LB submission. We will run this kernel 30 times and submit two versions chosen at random regardless of their public LB performance. Then we cross our fingers and hope that those two runs score better than perfect private test dataset classification :P\n","e776b756":"# Appendix 2 - Advanced Techniques\nSince the code above already classifies Sklearn's `make_classification` on average prefectly, there is no need to improve it. However, below are some ideas that could be used if improvement was possible and\/or neccessary.\n\n1. After building model 4's classifier, you could use it to classify the training data. Then all training data with `abs(oof - true)>0.9` are erroneous training data with their labels flippped. Next correct those training labels and run the entire kernel a second time.\n\n2. Since each cluster is centered at a hypercube corner, you can modify Sklearn's Quadratic Discriminant Analysis code by adding `meang[ np.argwhere(meang>=0) ] = 1.0` and `meang[ np.argwhere(meang<0) ] = -1.0`. This moves the centers of all clusters to hypercube corners.\n\n3. Computer accuracy cannot distinguish between predictions that are close to 1. Using an example with 6 digit accuracy, the numbers 1.000001 and 1.000002 are the same because both become 1.00000. To help improve AUC, you can add the following code to this kernel. `temp = np.log(pds[:,0]+pds[:,1]+pds[:,2])`; `temp[ np.isinf(temp) ] = -1e6`; `test_pred -= temp`. This improves AUC by differentiating between predictions close to 1. Note that this isn't a problem for predictions close to 0 because the numbers 0.0000001 and 0.0000002 are 1.0e-7 and 2.0e-7 and the computer can already differentiate them.\n\n4. After making predictions for `test.csv`, you can use them as pseudo labels and run the entire kernel a second time. Then use those labels and run the kernel a third time. Each iteration can give a slight boost.\n\n5. You can run this kernel multiple times and take an average. Or use k-folds. This removes this code's variance (randomness) and achieves close to prefection everytime but it also removes the possibility of scoring LB 0.00050 more or less than perfection.\n\n6. We can also remove this code's variance (randomness) by modifying Sklearn's code for Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Gaussian Mixture. Each of these models can only accept training labels that are either 0 or 1. By adding a few lines of code, we can allow these models to accept continuous probabilities and use them as weights. This would allow us to remove the randomization line `test_pred = test_pred > np.random.uniform(0,1,len(test_pred))`. Instead we can leave pseudo labels as probabilities between 0 and 1 and still call `QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis.fit(test_data,test_pred)`.\n\nUsing combinations of these additional advanced techniques, this kernel was able to score LB 0.97489 on this competition's public leaderboard. But validation showed that these techniques didn't make the basic perfect classifier any more perfect. Therefore for final submission, the basic classifier was used.","349ca205":"# Load Libraries and Data","191ba1ad":"# Submit to Kaggle\nAlright, let's cross our fingers and hope that our submission has a high private LB !!","6f985785":"# Identify Useful Features\nSklearn's `make_classification` leaks which features are useful by increasing their variance.","221b0fa0":"## Now let's plot the real data\nFirst we will use QDA to create pseudo labels for the public test data. Then we will plot a histogram of the variable means (data centers' coordinates) of target=0 and target=1 using all training and pseudo labeled public test data combined (768 rows per sub dataset). The plot below shows that Kaggle used `n_clusters_per_class=3`.","116fbaea":"# Appendix 1 - EDA revealing n_clusters_per_class = 3\nWe believe the data was made from Sklearn's `make_classification`. An important question is what parameter for `n_clusters_per_class` did Kaggle use? \n\nAccording to Sklearn's documentation [here][1]:\n\n> This initially creates clusters of points normally distributed (std=1) about vertices of an n-informative-dimensional hypercube with sides of length 2 * class_sep and assigns an equal number of clusters to each class.\n\nIn three dimensions that means, that the clusters will be centered at one of these 8 locations: (-1, -1, -1), (-1, -1, 1), (-1, 1, -1), (-1, 1, 1), (1, -1, -1), (1, -1, 1), (1, 1, -1), (1, 1, 1) where you replace all 1's by `class_sep`. If you create 1024 rows of data and have 2 clusters per class, then for `target=1`, you may have 256 points centered at (-1, 1, -1) and 256 points centered at (1, 1, -1). Then for `target=0`, you may have 256 points centered at (1, 1, 1) and 256 points centered at (-1, -1, 1).\n\nUsing EDA, we can determine the number of clusters per class of the real data. Sklearn's `make_classification` generates data (ellipses) at hypercube corners. Therefore if there is only `n_clusters_per_class=1` then the center of each ellipse (target=1 and target=0) of data will have all coordinates 1's and -1's, for example (1,1,-1,1,-1,1,...). So if we plot a histogram of all the variables' means (center coordinates), we will see a bump at 1 and -1. (By variable we mean within each sub dataset. That's 768 rows of train and public test. We don't mean all 262144 rows of original train columns).\n\nIf `n_clusters_per_class=2`, then within one sub dataset there will be 2 ellipses for target=1. For example, there may be one ellipse centered at (-1,1,...) and one at (1,1,...) and the first coordinates of 1 and -1 will average to 0 when we compute that variable's mean. Therefore, if `clusters=2`, we will see histogram bumps at -1, 0, and 1. If `n_clusters_per_class=3`, we will see 4 bumps. Etc, etc. We can confirm this with synthetic data. We will use `n_samples=768` because we only have training and public test data to compare with which only has 768 rows per `wheezy-magic` sub dataset.\n\nAfterward, we will plot a histogram of the real data's variable means (within sub datasets) and see which `n_clusters_per_class` it matches. Alternatively, we can build a model and assume that `n_clusters_per_class` equals 1, 2, 3, or 4. Then we check which `n_clusters_per_class` has the greatest CV. Both of these methods determine that `n_clusters_per_class=3`.\n\n[1]: https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html","a35f6d98":"# Appendix 3 - Final Submission Strategy\nBy applying our model to synthetic data, we can learn how it performs on a simulated public and private leaderboard. We observe that this kernel achieves perfection on average (if Kaggle used `make_classification` with the parameters we suspect). Sklearn's code for `make_classification` includes\n\n        # Randomly replace labels\n        if flip_y >= 0.0:\n            flip_mask = generator.rand(n_samples) < flip_y\n            y[flip_mask] = generator.randint(n_classes, size=flip_mask.sum())\n            \nBefore variable `y` gets rewritten, you can store it by adding `y_orig = y.copy()`. Next update the shuffle line to `X, y, y_orig = util_shuffle(X, y, y_orig, random_state=generator)`. Then change the last line of `make_classification` to `return X, y, y_orig`. By doing this, we can compute the AUC of a perfect classifier with `prefect = roc_auc_score(y, y_orig)`.\n \nNow we can make hundreds of synthetic datasets that are the similar to this competition's data and apply this kernel to see how well it does compared with a perfect classifier. For each synthetic dataset, we will run this kernel 10 times. This will show us patterns and help us decide how to choose our two final submissions. \n \nWe observe that sometimes this kenel does better than perfect and sometimes it does worse than perfect. It's interesting to note that there is no correlation between its performance on public LB versus private LB. In the example plots below, perfect classification is represented by the black dotted line.\n\nIf we take the average of this kernel's performance over many sythnetic datasets, it achieves perfect classification. Therefore there is no reason to improve this kernel. We can never expect to perform better than perfect classification on average. The only change we could consider is altering this kernel's standard deviation from perfection. We could either try to achieve perfection every kernel run, or (leave it as is and) randomly try to exceed perfection by a desired amount on some kernel runs.\n \n## Synthetic Dataset 1\n![image](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/ex161919.png)\n## Synthetic Dataset 2\n![image](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/ex261919.png)\n## Synthetic Dataset 3\n![image](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/ex361919.png)\n## Synthetic Dataset 4\n![image](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/ex461919.png)\n## Synthetic Dataset 5\n![image](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/ex561919.png)\n## Many Synthetic Datasets Together\n![image](http:\/\/playagricola.com\/Kaggle\/scatter61719.png)","485c341c":"## UPDATE: How Lucky Were We?\nHip hip hooray! `np.random.seed(42)` chose well.

We separately find the 3 ellipses of the target=1 data and 3 ellipses of the target=0 data using Sklearn GaussianMixture. Then we label each point with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 representing which ellipse it belongs to. Finally we train QDA on these 6 ellipses and use QDA to make our final predictions with `Pr(target=1) = Pr(in ellipse 3) + Pr(in ellipse 4) + Pr(in ellipse 5)`. (See appendix 2 for advanced techniques).\n\nFor validation, we didn't use typical k-folds CV. Instead we created synthetic data and optimized our technique on synthetic data. This has proven to be more reliable than CV. Also it allows our model to use all 1024 rows of sub datasets when building models. Our model has demonstrated that on average it can perfectly classify Sklearn's `make_classification` data. However many other participants can too. So randomness is added which allows us to do better than perfect sometimes. Then two random versions' output were submitted to Kaggle and hopefully those are the high scoring ones! :P\n\nWhen the code below is run locally, it generates synthetic data and calculates validation AUC. When the code is submitted to Kaggle, it uses real data and predicts `test.csv`.\n\n[1]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/pseudo-labeling-qda-0-969"}}
