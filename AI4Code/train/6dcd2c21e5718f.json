Unfortunately, we can't provide concrete tuning rules for every model. Lowering the learning rate can help one model converge efficiently but make another model converge much too slowly. You must experiment to find the best set of hyperparameters for your dataset. That said, here are a few rules of thumb:\n\n*  Training loss should steadily decrease, steeply at first, and then more slowly until the slope of the curve reaches or approaches zero.\n*  If the training loss does not converge, train for more epochs.\n*  If the training loss decreases too slowly, increase the learning rate. Note that setting the learning rate too high may also prevent training loss from converging.\n*  If the training loss varies wildly (that is, the training loss jumps around), decrease the learning rate.\n*  Lowering the learning rate while increasing the number of epochs or the batch size is often a good combination.\n*  Setting the batch size to a very small batch number can also cause instability. First, try large batch size values. Then, decrease the batch size until you see degradation.\n*  For real-world datasets consisting of a very large number of examples, the entire dataset might not fit into memory. In such cases, you'll need to reduce the batch size to enable a batch to fit into memory.\n\nRemember: the ideal combination of hyperparameters is data dependent, so you must always experiment and verify.","def1c66d":"# Training our model\n","61d5f540":"# Splitting the data","2da8dc03":"What is **verbose**?\n\nBy setting verbose 0, 1 or 2 you just say how do you want to 'see' the training progress for each epoch.\n\n`verbose=0` will show you nothing (silent)\n\n`verbose=1` will show you an animated progress bar like this:\n\n![progres_bar](https:\/\/dphi-courses.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/Deep+Learning+Bootcamp\/progress+bar.png)\n\n`verbose=2` will just mention the number of epoch like this:\n\n![verbose = 2](https:\/\/dphi-courses.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/Deep+Learning+Bootcamp\/epoch.png)","d4546686":"#### **Implementing hyperparameter tuning with Keras**\nNow we will go through the process of automating hyperparameter tuning using **Random Search** and **Keras**.

Define the model\nDefining the model requires that you first select the type of model that you need and then choose the architecture or network topology.\n\nFrom an API perspective, this involves defining the layers of the model, configuring each layer with a number of nodes and activation function, and connecting the layers together into a cohesive model.\n\nModels can be defined either with the Sequential API or the Functional API. Here we will define the model with Sequential API. Now **what is Sequential API?**\n\n**Sequential API**\nThe sequential API is the simplest API to get started with Deep Learning. \n\nIt is referred to as \u201csequential\u201d because it involves defining a Sequential class and adding layers to the model one by one in a linear manner, from input to output.\n\nThe example below defines a Sequential model that has one input layer, one hidden layer with 10 node,another hidden layer with 8 node and then an output layer with one node to predict a numerical value.\n\n","e2b189d5":"We can observe an error in the hyperparameter tuning procedure using native Sklearn, because the defined model is a Sequential model implemented by Keras, not a scikit-learn estimator. In order to correct this error, we will integrate Sklearn and Keras properly, by (a) creating a `create_model` function that allows to create the model in an automated way, and (b) defining a `KerasRegressor` model which is an implementation of the scikit-learn regressor API for Keras.","6528fe0f":"#### Hyperparameter Tunning\nThe hyperparameters here in this notebook are:\n1. Learning Rate\n2. Epochs\n3. Batch Size\n\nWe can try and change the values of these parameters and see the performance  of the model (evaluate the model) on X_test data","58fb34a1":"As you can see above, how the loss (cost) i.e. MSE has changed by just changing the learning rate.","3543a37c":"# Separating Input Features and Output Features\nBefore building any machine learning model, we always separate the input variables and output variables. Input variables are those quantities whose values are changed naturally in an experiment, whereas output variable is the one whose values are dependent on the input variables. So, input variables are also known as independent variables as its values are not dependent on any other quantity, and output variable\/s are also known as dependent variables as its values are dependent on other variable i.e. input variables. Like here in this data, we are trying to predict the price of a houce, so this is our target column i.e. 'MEDV'\n\nBy convention input variables are represented with 'X' and output variables are represented with 'y'."}}
