It is either small in scale or demonstrates no clear patterns.","62be7026":"Each waterbody is being analyzed separately. Modelling is based on the available data for this particular waterbody and does not necessarily include the same features for all objects of the same type since their behaviour differs considerably.\n\nProposed algorithm automatically selects input features for each target value based on correlation between the parameters, creates several machine learning models at runtime, cross-validates their accuracy in terms of determination coefficient (R2 score), selects the best model and makes a prediction for the specified future period - day, week or month - depending on the model frequency.\n\nPrediction could be made for the next period, second period, third period and so on - one at a time. Specific future period for prediction and data frequency (daily, weekly or monthly) are defined by arguments passed to the modelling function.\n\nIn theory, this approach does not have any limitations, however testing shows that accuracy is higher when predicting short-term future and shorter periods (daily or weekly values).","ef63e0fb":"### Types of models\n1. Depending on data frequency models are divided into 3 groups (frequency is defined by 'freq' argument of modelling() function):\n   - Daily models:\nTake the values of target variables and other parameters for the previous day as an input to predict target value for the next day or other day in the future selected by user.\n   - Weekly models:\nTake the average values of target variables and other parameters for the previous week as an input to predict the average target value for the next week or other future week selected by user.\n   - Monthly models:\nTake the average values of target variables and other parameters for the previous month to predict the average target value for the next month of other month in the future.\n2. Depending on the period (step) in the future which is predicted models would produce a forecast for the next period (day, week or month), second period, third period, etc. This behaviour is defined by 'steps_ahead' argument of the modelling() function. There is no restriction on input values for this argument. However, prediction accuracy for distant future periods is lower and it is not advisable to rely on this algorithm for long-term predictions.\n3. Depending on the algorithm final prediction is made with one of the following models:\n   - Basic sklearn models: one of RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor or KNeighborsRegressor (model with the highest cross-val score is selected given that the best R2 is higher than or equal to 0.6).\n   - Mean value of two linear model predictions and the actual value of the target variable for the previous period. This method is used to make a prediction if basic sklearn models listed above showed R2 lower than 0.6 on cross validation. Low R2 usually reflects the fact that target value varies chaotically or could not be wholly explained and derived from the given input features. In this case the simplest option is used for prediction - to look at the actual value of the target variable for the latest available period (day, week or month - depending on the model frequency) and make a correction for observable trend. LinearRegression predictions are made based on the last 5 and 10 available values of the target variable, and these two predictions are added to the actual value for the latest period and divided by 3.\n4. Depending on input features: input features for each model are selected at runtime based on correlation with the target value. Threashold for the selection is positive correlation above 0.2 or negative correlation below -0.2. The list of input features that are being used in the model is printed below each prediction. Prognostication algorithm is constructed in such a way that in the future the composition of inputs could change if new relevant data is added to dataset or correlation between the parameters changes.\n5. Depending on waterbody type: the competition rules required to create 4 models specific to waterbody type so that any of the models could be applied to predict target values of any object of this particular type. EDA did not show consistent patterns for target variables in waterbodies of the same type. Moreover, identical target variables in the same waterbody could demonstrate quite different patterns and prediction scores for the same models vary greatly. To achieve the highest possible level of accuracy and to take into consideration peculiarities of various waterbodies a decision was made to create one flexible algorithm which tests several models at runtime, selects appropriate input features and makes a prediction on monthly, weekly or daily basis depending on the user's choice.","0b543151":"#### Notes\nDaily models showed even higher R2 score and lower MAE based on the same input features with daily frequency.","f063255c":"Target variable in this dataset has about 55% of missing values.

The reasoning behind this is that prolonged periods of intense rainfall or draught would affect water level and flow rate more significantly than daily fluctuations and changes.\n- Reduction of input data to features most correlated with the target value for the predicted period (day, week or month). Only features with positive correlation above 0.2 or negative correlation below -0.2 are being used for training and prediction.","713f235d":"### Block 4: EDA functions\nFunctions defined in this section are used for analysis of data as it is, before feature engineering and modelling.","d5da100c":"In this dataset the most scarce data is volume (has about 80% of missing values).

Original data contained erroneous values, which distorted trends and distribution of values. In most cases 0 values were highly uncharacteristic for the measured parameter. In cases where 0 values are a minor part of the measurements, they differ dramatically from the neighboring datapoints (look like obvious point outliers). In cases where 0 values are in abundance, they form a separate bin distant from the bulk of typical measurements for the same parameter. Some of 0 values in rainfall columns could also be a placeholder for missing values, but there is no realistic way to filter them out and differentiate from legitimate 0 values.\n- Conversion of daily data to monthly or weekly averages for monthly and weekly models. This step reduces the number of datapoints and samples but smoothes fluctuations in data.\n- Interpolation or imputation of missing values is not being used. Original data as it is demonstrates irregular patterns and low correlation between parameters.

In all columns except rainfall 0 values were replaced with np.NaN.\n\nIn rainfall columns it is not obvious, which 0 values (if any) are a placeholder for NaN. Zero level of rainfall could actually be a realistic measurement. That's why simple replacement of all zero values by NaN couldn't be used. It doesn't discriminate between actual 0 values and errors. Filtering based on comparison between neighboring values is also not an option in this case, since dry weather could follow rainy periods and vise versa.\n\nAs a result, some level of noize in rainfall measurements could be present, which will affect accuracy of the models.","bc640203":"### Conclusions and recommendations\n\nWaterbodies differ in terms of correlation between features given in the datasets and range of features available for each object. It is the main obstacle to creating a generalized model with given input features for each waterbody type.\n\nTo overcome this problem flexible approach is used, which selects input features at runtime based on available data and correlation between parameters. In some cases, this algorithm could lead to unexpected results. If data in the original file is not evenly distributed (especially if some parameters are correlated with the target value but are not present in the latest periods of observation), prediction will be made based on the last period when all correlated features were present. Date of the input is printed along with the prediction and a list of input features. It is recommended to check if the input date is equal or close to the last date in the original file.\n\nAnalysis of data and interpretation of modelling results showed that in the **rivers** category target value demonstrates correlation with most other parameters (rainfall, temperature, season) and no visible long-term trend. This group was represented by a single object in this study, which make generalizations questionable.\n\nIn the **lakes** category target variables - lake level and flow rate - show moderate correlation to one another and no long-term trend. Both targets demonstrate low day-to-day correlation with rainfall and temperature. Simple shift of the target lake level one step backwards results in higher correlation (yesterday's rainfall affects today's lake level). Weekly rolling averages for rainfall and temperature and seasonal features (day and month of year) are also useful for predicting lake level. However flow rate could not be predicted based on these features with acceptable accuracy.\n\n**Aquifers** category showed low correlation of target values with rainfall, medium correlation with temperature and some degree of correlation with volume. In most cases target values are also affected by long-term trends. However these trends do not follow any obvious and easily explainable rules.\n\n**Water springs** are the most difficult group for prediction. Target values correlate mostly with one another and demonstrate practically no correlation with other parameters. Trends could not be generalized or explained with the data available for analysis. Some of the objects demonstrate highly suspicious behavious on the charts (abrupt shifts and gaps), which could be a result of error in the original data.\n\nProposed algorithm allows to get daily, weekly or monthly forecast for arbitrary chosen period in the future (next day, week or month, second next period, 5th next period and so on). However, it is not recommended to model distant future periods in this way, because accuracy of the predictions will deteriorate. As a rule, predictions accuracy for shorter periods (daily and weekly data) is higher than for longer periods (monthly data).\n\nAccuracy of the predictions could be improved by more thorough data cleaning and removing of noize and errors. However, domain knowledge is required for this step.","08cc8b79":"Target values demonstrate multi-year increase \/ decrease trends with no obvious cycles. Both variables follow the same trends over the whole period of observation.","72138b01":"#### Notes\nTarget variable that showed low R2 score for all four tested models was predicted using simple approach based on the latest actual value and linear trend. See explanation in Block 7.\n\nOther two target variables could be reliably predicted with one of the four tested models, which shows the best result (highest R2 score).\n\nIn this case, as well as in modelling other waterbodies, input features include parameters that show positive correlation with the next period target value highier than or equal to 0.2 or negative correlation below -0.2. Targets required different sets of input features: linear trend and average model for the first target is based solely on previous values of the target variable, the second target was predicted using a wide range of features including rainfall, depth, volume, temperature, hydrometry and seasonal columns, the last target was predicted based on input that included several depth and volume columns, hydrometry and year.","4faf2ac6":"#### 2.1.

All three target variables demonstrate low correlation with rainfall.","e51a2551":"#### Notes\nTaking into account large share of missing values and abnormal patterns of target variables seen on the graphs, unsurprisingly, modelling waterbody behaviour on a monthly basis leads to low R2 score and in some cases also to high mean absolute error (MAE) on cross-validation.

MAE for flow rate stayed rather high compared to scale of this variable. It means that only lake level could be accurately forecasted with the proposed models.\n\nThe same considerations as for monthly models are valid here. Accuracy of flow rate prediction could be increased only by adding other relevant data to model inputs. At present the model uses previous values of both targets, rainfall and temperature. Presumably, surface winds could affect the flow rate and cause occasional spikes that are seen on the graph and lead to large forecast errors. However, to make prediction for the future flow rate future values of wind will be required, and predicting this parameter will be nontrivial task in itself.","7ab44cec":"#### Notes\nBest models showed high R2 score (over 0.9) on cross-validation.

Target values for three out of four analysed variables shift upwards and downwards on a regular basis during the whole period of observation. These fluctuations look unnatural and most likely result from some kind of measurement errors.\n\nFlow rate at Bugnano, on the contrary, looks almost like a straight line, which differs dramatically from other target variables. Consulting with domain experts is desirable to establish which patterns should be treated as natural and which should be excluded as errors and noise.\n\nOne of the possible solutions to remove these abrupt shifts is to apply some kind of sliding window mean smoothing to the original data. However such step is questionable since the nature of these shifts is not clear. At present, 0 values in Arbure and Ermicciolo columns in this dataset were filtered out as obvious errors and replaced with NaNs. Other inconsistencies were left uncorrected.","92b84b76":"### 2.

Some of the target variables demonstrate visible seasonal patterns while others behave more chaotically and, obviously, are affected by external factors.\n\nIn this situation predictive models such as ARIMA would not provide accurate predictions, though such models are often used to get out of sample time series forecast for several periods ahead. For the same reason Prophet or XGBoost regression models\nwould not be useful in this case. Predictions made solely on seasonal features would show large errors\nbecause they ignore the influence of external factors.\n\nThough these models could take into account external regressors, if future values of those external regressors are unknown, they would be also useless.","29052312":"Target variable has some degree of correlation with all features available in the dataset.

Flexible data frequencies and forecast horizons\nThe algorithm allows for monthly, weekly and daily data frequencies. Depending on the arguments passed to the modelling() function the forecast could be made for a single day, the average monthly value or the average weekly value. Data frequency is defined with 'freq' argument.\n\nThe last argument of the function controls how many steps ahead the forecast is looking for. For example, calling modelling() with arguments freq='monthly' and steps_ahead=1 will produce the average value for the next month. Calling this function with arguments freq='monthly' and steps_ahead=3 will produce the average value for the third month counting from the last available data.\n\nIn theory, this approach should allow for medium-term and long-term forecasts. However, testing shows that the accuracy notably decreases, when the algorithm is applied to make a prediction for a distant future periods.\n\nAccuracy also depends on the data frequency chosen for prediction. The most accurate predictions could be made on a daily basis (even when making a forecast several steps ahead). The least reliable models are those based on monthly data. Weekly data provides better accuracy scores compared to monthly data but worse results compared to daily data.","117effa9":"Target variable has about 55% of missing values.
