concluded that,\n1.

Also other factors might be  availability of treatments, protective equipments etc in places of less confirmed cases but comparatively more death rate of health workers.\n\nPre health conditions of these individuals might be another factor too.******","09f726da":"Printing the list showing dept vs country death worldwide","60c3aecd":"The data analyses in which country maximum  death is recorded. The Pandemic countries dominates the chart however in lesser Pandemic countries and non Pandemic countries too, death has been recorded.","24ec1935":"So as the data suggests, the most number of deaths are recorded in the group of General Physicians and Nurses. Although one can assume that most vulerable groups are Emergency medicine or Critical Care and Respiraory problems but it seems that as the family physicians or general practioners are consulted primarily when people faced distress physically so they have contracted it most knowingly or unknowing followed by nurses responsible for primary well being of patients as well. The availability of the protective equipments can also be a factor alongside most contact.","711747a1":"I have further analysed this to understand the country wise trend\/variation. It seems that the most vulnerable group in Italy is General Physicians while in US the Nurses have fallen most. In UK ,the Nurses and Healthcare workers like hospital staffs , administrative staffs have highest death rate while in Iran it is of General Physicans and Nurses.\n\nA number of factors can be analysed based on this report.\n1.The age group of these groups\n2.The availability of protective equipments to these groups while treating\/coming in contact to patients.\n3.Patient to Healthcare workers ratio","27a65b31":"The total number of countries where death of physicians due to COVID 19 and total number of departments affected due to COVID 19 is given above which clearly shows that Healthcare Workers are affected worldwide and irrespective of departments in which they work","21d6c63f":"This clearly indicates that as the number of confirmed cases for a country increases, the death of Healthcare personnels increase.

A excel sheet which contains these relationships is also uploaded here. The Healthcare Worker category for example encompasses hospital staffs, hospital porters, receptionists etc.\n\n\n4.Death rate in countries like Italy ,UK,USA and Iran is more and hence for these countries individual graphs depicting the number of death per category for each of these countries are plotted and analysed.\n\n5.Finally death with respect to countries is plotted and analysed.\n\n"}}
