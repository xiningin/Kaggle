This makes segmentation of dense and touching cells more reliable. For details and additional tricks they use see the paper \"Cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation\".\n\nTo train it I used the script provided in the cellpose repo ie: `python -m cellpose --train ...` after I converted the dataset to the input format it expects.\n\nIn inference I just submit the masks as they were returned from the model - no postprocessing"}}
