We will go cluster by cluster and see how can we improve customer spending scores:\n### **Cluster 0 (Low Spending Score, Upper-middle Income, All Ages, 68% Males)**\nThis cluster has a great potential because income level is higher than the average income. Most customers in this segment are males which is not common for the dataset. We suggest to take a look at product line that males potentially could buy for themselves, their partners and children. High-end products can be included for this segment.\n\n### **Cluster 1 (Middle Spending Score, Middle Income, Old Age, 57% Females)**\nThis cluster is one of the middle segments with respect to income\/spending. The cluster consists of males and females with little dominance of latter (by 7%). The segment is already intrested in purchases from the mall and probably have a list of regular products they tend to buy. Analysing those products could help to perform cross-selling of related products as well as offering occasionally high-end upsells. \n\n### **Cluster 2 (High Spending Score, Upper-middle income, Middle Age, 52% Females)**\n\nThis is one of the most profitable segments. This segment contains almost the same distribution of males and females. High-end general purpose products are good stuff to promote in the segment.\n\n### **Cluster 3 (High Spending Score, Low Income, Young Ages, 59% Females)**\n\nCustomers from this segment have already showed a good spending activity, but they most likely limited in terms of budget. They may be good candidates for promotion\/coupon campaigns. In worse case, they would not increase their spendings.\n\n### **Cluster 4 (Low Spending Score, Low Income, All Ages, 59% Females)**\n\nThis segment includes customers with low spending score and low income across all ages. There are slightly more women. Customers from this cluster would be happy to save money. Including them to any kind of promotion lists or providing accumulation accounts may help to increase purchase activities.\n\n### **Cluster 5 (Middle Spending Score, Middle Income, Young Age, 66% Females)**\n\nThis is a counterpart of Cluster 1 with a larger percentage of females and younger ages. This segment has a good potetial, so deals that include tranding stuff for young female audiance may help to increase spendings of the segment.\n\n### **Cluster 6 (Low Spending Score, High Income, Middle Ages, 70% Females)**\n\nThis segment is similar to Cluster 0, but with mostly female audience. Hence, suggestion is the same but with main focus on female's needs.\n\n### **Cluster 7 (High Spending Score, High Income, Middle Ages, 60% Females)**\n\nThis is one of the most profitable segments. Offering high-end female-focus products may help to keep them spend.","67703d2b":"Insights:\n- From the Spending Group - Age plot we can see that the lowest variation is in **high spending group**. Its members are in **20-40 age group**. Low and medium spending groups seem to roughly covers the whole age range.\n- From the Spending Group - Annual Income plot we can see that customers from **the center of the annual income distribution** (\\$40k-\\$60k) belongs to **medium spending group** ","71143a66":"### Gender","5c61aa16":"Evidently, 2d space is not enough to distantly show all 8 clusters.

This implies that clusters should have circle-like shape. \n\nFrom the first glance this doesn't seem to be a case, so we can expect some amount of missclustered customers near cluster boundries.\n\nTo use K-means model, we need to know how many clusters are in the dataset. Although visually it's clear that there is five clusters, we won't content with just this and will use **the elbow method** and **silhouette diagram** as additional clues.","4b77e65a":"**Age-SpendingScore-Income plot** does a good job in distincting our clusters.\n\nJust by looking at this 3d plot, we can see the following insights about clusters:\n- **Cluster 0** - Low Spending Score, Upper-middle Income, Middle Age\n- **Cluster 1** - Middle Spending Score, Middle Income, Old Age\n- **Cluster 2** - High Spending Score, Upper-middle income, Middle Age\n- **Cluster 3** - High Spending Score, Low Income, Young Age\n- **Cluster 4** - Low Spending Score, Low Income, All Age\n- **Cluster 5** - Middle Spending Score, Middle Income, Young Age\n- **Cluster 6** - Low Spending Score, High Income, Middle Age\n- **Cluster 7** - High Spending Score, High Income, Middle Age\n\n**Gender-SpendingScore-Income plot** also was tried but it doesn't bring much information which means that gender is not significant factor for given dataset.","700e5010":"# Summary\n\nWe performed EDA and clustering on a small mall customer dataset. \n\nWe picked to find 8 clusters and performed their analysis. It was also possible to pick 5 or 6 clusters, but we chose to be more specific that that.\n\nFor each cluster we found an average customer represented in given dataset features. Based on customer portrait, we suggested general marketing advice on how the mall may target each customer cluster. To sum up this, we found potential in the current customer dataset which may be exploit by marketing team and cluster-specific targeting of customer needs.","b73fc353":"In SpendingScore-Income space, 8 clusters look like this:","21d66254":"Insights:\n- **Age**, **Income** and **Spending Score** features are **multimodal distributions** each having two or three heels\n- **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** plot seems to be formed with a **five dense regions**: 4 regions are on the sides and one is in the center","ecb714aa":"Insights:\n- Spending scores have a few modes: \n    - between 0 and 20 (men domintate)\n    - between 25 and 40 (women domintate)\n    - between 45 and 60 (women domintate)\n    - between 65 and 70 (men dominates)\n    - between 70 and 100 (women dominates) ","6cdf3d12":"# EDA","a50a6944":"We are going to try a few clustering models in the next sections but for now we need to preprocess our data set in order to proceed.","d54e2bbf":"Silhouette diagrams incorporate more information than the elbow plot. Each \"blade\" on the diagram represents a separate cluster. Height of blades represents **number of samples inside of the cluster** and width represents **strength of inter-cluster connections**. \n\nOur goal will be to find clusters of near the same size (heights are nearly the same) which are strongly connected (width is close to the right side of the plot).\n\nNow taking a look at the plots we made for 5, 6, 8 clusters we can see that they are nearly the same in terms of inter-cluster connectivity and size. On the 8 cluster diagram there is **one more strongly connected cluster 7** which is absent on the other plots. Let's take it as a sign of slightly better cluster quality. In a worse case we would get a little bit granual clusters which we would be able to merge according to marketing needs.\n\nDuring experiments, I tried to go beyond 8 clusters, but higher cluster diagrams doesn't seem to optimal. Some clusters showed negative silhouette score which is sign of sample misclustering. Also, given dataset contains only 4 features which limits possible clustering. For instance, when number of clusters more than 10, silhouette diagram starts to show empty clusters.","164bf278":"## References\n- https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/joshuaswords\/data-visualization-clustering-mall-data\n- https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kushal1996\/customer-segmentation-k-means-analysis\n- https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/fazilbtopal\/popular-unsupervised-clustering-algorithms","de0e18e2":"Insights:\n- There is a linear dependency between **Spending Score** and **Age**.
