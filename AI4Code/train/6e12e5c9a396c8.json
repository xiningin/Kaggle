Like other pneumonias, pulmonary infection with COVID-19 results in inflammation and fluid in the lungs. COVID-19 looks very similar to other viral and bacterial pneumonias on chest radiographs, which makes it difficult to diagnose. This computer vision model for detection and localization of COVID-19 would help doctors provide a quick and confident diagnosis. As a result, patients could get the right treatment before the most severe effects of the virus take hold.\n\nCurrently, COVID-19 can be diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction to detect genetic material from the virus or chest radiograph. However, it can take a few hours and sometimes days before the molecular test results are back. By contrast, chest radiographs can be obtained in minutes. While guidelines exist to help radiologists differentiate COVID-19 from other types of infection, their assessments vary. In addition, non-radiologists could be supported with better localization of the disease, such as with a visual bounding box.\n\nIn this competition, the task is to identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, categorization of the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19.","e9d3e3a7":"[<font size=\"5\">Interpretating the Problem <\/font>](#2)\n\nThe problem is about classification and detection and we are told to find in a test set, a *bounding box*, which is a rectangular box for identifying or even, detecting where a certain object is, and also it's said to find a class.\nWith the labels 'Negative for Pneumonia' 'Typical Appearance' 'Indeterminate Appearance' 'Atypical Appearance', we have to make a prediction string, for example:\n> atypical 1 0 0 1 1\n","b53b4439":"<font size =\"5\"> Data Files <\/font>\n\n\n1. train_study_level.csv - the train study-level metadata, with one row for each study, including correct labels.\n    \n2. train_image_level.csv - the train image-level metadata, with one row for each image, including both correct labels and any bounding boxes in a dictionary format. Some images in both test and train have multiple bounding boxes.\n    \n3. sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file containing all image- and study-level IDs.\n\n4. train folder - comprises 6334 chest scans in DICOM format, stored in paths with the form study\/series\/image\n    \n5. test folder - The hidden test dataset is of roughly the same scale as the training dataset.
