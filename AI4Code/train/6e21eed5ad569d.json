Even other strong teams above (FaZe, Liquid, Evil Geniuses) are over 10% below that of Astralis. I imagine this percentage is boosted heavily by their Nuke streak, as well as generally being unbeatible (on any map) in 2018. \n\n* **Ence** - Ence being second feeds into the general narrative that Ence was a good team because of tactics and guile, using aspects such as map pick\/ban to gain wins over better teams. It impresses me they were able to have the second highest win percentage on their own pick, while still being so far below the other elite teams in terms of skill. It is also a further indictment of their choice to kick Aleksib. I don't think they could ever have reached this percentage without them. \n\n* **Space Soldiers** - It is interesting that they are so high on the list. I imagine this is a function of farming low top 20 teams online, but I would have to look more into the data to determine the exact cause. \n\n* **General** - It appears to me that while your map pick can generate an increased chance to win a game, you still have to be a quality team in order to execute. Your map pick is by no means a free win, even if you are a tactical team. For example, BIG is second to last, and they are known to follow a strong gameplan. Additionally, neither North nor Optic, which were at times led by MSL with a fairly rigid system, have strong winrates (Optic is even last).  \n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe data used for this project is not perfect as it includes online matches and does not account for player changes within a team. However, I thought this was a fun exercise in data science and a bit illuminating as to the impact of pick\/ban. Please let me know if you see any issues with the data.","fc0ea56b":"**Filtering the Data**\n\nThis dataset is quite broad as it includes all HLTV matches from the end of 2015 to March 2020. For a more applicable snapshot, I filtered the data to include only the following:\n\n* **Only include the first two games within a best of 3 Series.**\n\nMatches are most often played as best of 1's, or best of 3's. For this analysis, I will only focus on best of 3's, as most analysts generally look at pick\/ban in terms of a best of 3 series. Additionally, there is generally no \"pick\" in a best of 1 as the common methodology is for both teams to ban 3 maps until there is a surviving map to play.\n\n* **Only include games between two teams within the top 20 (at the time the game was played).**\n\nThe scene is generally focused around the top twenty, and the pick\/ban phase is considered quite important at this level. Imposing this filter also removes wins that top teams gain by farming weaker teams not near their skill level. \n\n* **Remove teams which did not pick more than 20 games**\n\nThis filter gives some strength to the analysis such that teams with only a few map picks do not generate outlier win\/loss percentages.  \n\n* **Only Include games after 12\/31\/2016**\n\nI added this filter as I wanted to create a time-span of data of about 2 years. I felt this time span was large enough to gain a good snapshot, but still small enough that it hopefully curbs part of the issue generating from player changes within a team (see disclaimer at the bottom).","1bb9184f":"**Impact of Map Pick on Game Win**\n\nIn CS:GO, there is generally a map selection process between the two teams playing a match to determine what map(s) will be played. This usually involves a process of both picking maps to play, and banning away maps such that the other team cannot then pick them. \n\nA core belief is that a team should have a higher chance than the opponent to win their map pick. \n\nI wanted to quantify how often teams win their own pick. \n\n\nI started with a data set from kaggle.com with CS:GO professional matches scraped from HLTV.org spanning 11\/2015 - 3\/2020. This data was read into pandas, a data analysis library for Python.\n\nThe data can be found here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mateusdmachado\/csgo-professional-matches","76cd6ad2":"**Python Code**\n\nThe below python code cleans up the data and generates a final table that with three columns:\n\n* Team Name\n* Win Percentage on Picked Maps\n* Number of Games Played"}}
