Since early January, the World Health Organization has been calling for separation of at least one meter (a little more than 3 feet). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, has been recommending nearly twice that distance \u2014 6 feet or more.\n\nQuestions about distancing don't end at 6 feet. In the past few months, environmental scientists, physicists, engineers, epidemiologists, and others have become increasingly vocal with concerns that the virus might be transmitted through smaller droplets that can reach as far as 26 feet on violent exhalations like coughs and sneezes. The droplets can slow down, dry out, and hang in the air for hours. (No matter what distance they support, pretty much everyone weighing in on distance recommends that people wear face masks when out in public and close to others who might be potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2.).\n\nScientists describe the risk as a continuum from high to low; few believe the risk is high at 26 feet. But the conundrum facing health agencies and lawmakers in the absence of a consensus on just how far away is far enough is both difficult and consequential. Pediatrician and historian Howard Markel of the University of Michigan, one of the people who started the discussion of physical distancing 15 years ago, said different messages from policymakers can make it tough for the public. He said lack of precision is bound to make people worried about why there's no one single answer.\nhttps:\/\/www.medscape.com\/viewarticle\/936356?src=wnl_tp10n_200910_mscpedit&uac=102514CX&impID=2556879&faf=1","935672e3":"#Thanks Waldemar Brandt: Photo on Unsplash\n\n#Thanks to DipamVasani https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dipam7\/data-augmentation-in-fastai","c6dcef0f":"#Simulations Show How to Reduce the Spread of COVID-19, by Thierry Marchal, Published on April 7, 2020\n\n#Computer models offer engineers tools to simulate healthcare scenarios.\n\nThat complement standard in vitro and in vivo testing.

Medical practitioners, policymakers and organizations (like the CDC and WHO) can use this information to optimize the social distancing guidelines that protect us.\n \n\n![](https:\/\/www.ansys.com\/-\/media\/ansys\/corporate\/blog\/covid-19\/simulations-reduce-covid-19-spread\/simulations-reduce-covid-19-running.jpg?h=357&w=600&la=en&hash=C607E125A4A79E76674F5D8EA34F063FF2EDD94E)By running directly behind someone, you put yourself at serious risk of contamination.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ansys.com\/blog\/simulations-reduce-covid-19-spread","89a7fe33":"#WHY WE SHOULD ALL WEAR MASKS, by Sui Huang, March 26, 2020  \n\n#AEROSOL - Droplets below a diameter of 10 um (micrometer).\n\nThe upper size limit for the definition of \u2018aerosol\u2019 (particles so light as to be able to float in the air). For brevity, let us call this category \u201caerosols\u201d. These small aerosols are carried by ventilation or by winds and thus can travel across rooms. What makes N95 facial masks different from the surgical masks is that the former are designed (as per regulatory requirement) to stop aerosols: they have to filter out 95% of droplets smaller than 0.3 um.\n\n#SPRAY DROPLETS - Droplets larger than 10um (micrometer), reaching 100um (0.1mm) or more.\n\nCall these large particles \u201cspray droplets\u201d. (For a more detailed discussion. Of course, droplets can be even larger, up to a size visible to the naked eye in the spray generated by coughing or sneezing (0.1 mm diameter to above). Calculations suggest that if exhaled, the >0.1 mm droplets may evaporate or fall to a surface within 2m, depending on size, air humidity and temperature.\n\n#Coughing or sneezing\n\nCoughing or sneezing can shoot them like projectiles out of the mouth with a \u201cmuzzle velocity\u201d of 50 meters\/second (for sneezing) or 10 m\/s (for coughing), and droplets can reach distances as far as 6m away. If so, then the much mentioned \u201csafe distance\u201d of 6 feet in social encounters may not suffice \u2014 except you wear a (simple) mask \u2013more on that later.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/875\/1*m_a-cX7BpzAOg5YpyDa_ZA.png) Droplet larger than aerosols, when exhaled (at velocity of <1m\/s), evaporate or fall to the ground less than 1.5 m away. When expelled at high velocity through coughing or sneezing, especially larger droplets (> 0.1 mm), can be carried by the jet more than 2m or 6m, respectively, away.\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/@Cancerwarrior\/covid-19-why-we-should-all-wear-masks-there-is-new-scientific-rationale-280e08ceee71","11d308bc":"#Photo by Waldemar Brandt on Unsplash\n\n#Codes from DipamVasani https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dipam7\/data-augmentation-in-fastai","e9b90aad":"#Simulation research shows COVID-19 can spread farther by those exercising outdoors - By Jennifer Holton, Published April 9\/2020\n\n![](https:\/\/images.foxtv.com\/static.fox10phoenix.com\/www.fox10phoenix.com\/content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/932\/524\/exercise-social-distancing-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1)https:\/\/www.fox10phoenix.com\/news\/simulation-research-shows-covid-19-can-spread-farther-by-those-exercising-outdoors","f50d5da5":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcToeQS_zg9R53gjhJRXypTsVh0t2pCB1rCdMg&usqp=CAU)cebm.net","17bbe0b6":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke"}}
