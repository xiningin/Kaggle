However, there **is** a consistent gap in the experiemtns that have been run so far, and there is plenty of evidence that the training and validation datasets are statistically different.\n\nIn this notebook we'll try to assess the degree of difference using adversarial validation approach. For our features we'll just use the pixel-level data from the 32x32 resized images. This data has thus far been surprisingly informative about the images in this dataset."}}
