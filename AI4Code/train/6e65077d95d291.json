It is a simple and fast way to perform exploratory data analysis of a Pandas Dataframe. The pandasdf.describe() and df.info() functions are normally used as a first step in the EDA process. However, it only gives a very basic overview of the data and doesn\u2019t help much in the case of large data sets. The Pandas Profiling function, on the other hand, extends the pandas DataFrame withdf.profile_report() for quick data analysis.
