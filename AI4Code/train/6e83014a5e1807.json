For example, we can specify a value for `sep` to put some special string in between our printed arguments:","dfa9ccd3":"## Functions Applied to Functions\n\nHere's something that's powerful, though it can feel very abstract at first.  You can supply functions as arguments to other functions.  Some example may make this clearer:","f750560c":"# Your Turn\n\nFunctions open up a whole new world in Python programming. **[Try using them yourself](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/1275158)**.","840721a8":"> **Aside:**\n> The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The `>>>` is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example, see [this docstring for the numpy function `np.eye`](https:\/\/github.com\/numpy\/numpy\/blob\/v1.14.2\/numpy\/lib\/twodim_base.py#L140-L194).","60cdd89c":"Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:","3fa316d8":"Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of \"null\" in other languages.)\n\nWithout a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.","a7fbe119":"# Getting Help\n\nYou saw the `abs` function in the previous tutorial, but what if you've forgotten what it does?\n\nThe `help()` function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn. If you can remember how to use `help()`, you hold the key to understanding most other functions.\n\nHere is an example:","393c4b7b":"## Defining functions\n\nBuiltin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.","b045c58e":"Good programmers use docstrings unless they expect to throw away the code soon after it's used (which is rare).  So, you should start writing docstrings, too!","b2fa338a":"But if we don't specify a value, `sep` is treated as having a default value of `' '` (a single space).","3ac1080c":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

In this case, this tells us that `round()` takes an argument we can describe as `number`. Additionally, we can optionally give a separate argument which could be described as `ndigits`.\n2.

But there are higher-order functions built into Python that you might find useful to call. \n\nHere's an interesting example using the `max` function.\n\nBy default, `max` returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional `key` argument, it returns the argument `x` that maximizes `key(x)` (aka the 'argmax').","a39b7680":"If you were looking for it, you might learn that print can take an argument called `sep`, and that this describes what we put between all the other arguments when we print them.","5d10b388":"## Functions that don't return\n\nWhat would happen if we didn't include the `return` keyword in our function?","6accce02":"This creates a function called `least_difference`, which takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\nFunctions start with a header introduced by the `def` keyword. The indented block of code following the `:` is run when the function is called.\n\n`return` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.\n\nIs it clear what `least_difference()` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:","7bfbefa0":"The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function.
