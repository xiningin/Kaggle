I always wanted to learn it and I got really excited when I saw a Kaggle competition on it , although I was not able to fully concentrate on it due to other competitions up untill now. While I was learning all the different concepts in Object Detection , I came across Facebook's **Detection tranformer DETR** , launched in April 2020 . It's still quite new but the resuts are astonishing and the model itself is very fast . In this notebook, I explore this new architecture,its working and fine tune it for Wheat Detection competition Dataset.\n\nNote that for now this is just a baseline to demonstrate the architecture and its working ,it does not aim at getting very good results on lb,this will be a work in progress,and I will soon update with full training and a separate ","0fc066dd":"# Using DETR without Fine-Tuning\n\n* Before learning how to fine tune DETR if you want to use and play with DETR directly on some sample images , please refer the video [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LfUsGv-ESbc)\n* [Here](https:\/\/scontent.flko3-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t39.8562-6\/101177000_245125840263462_1160672288488554496_n.pdf?_nc_cat=104&_nc_sid=ae5e01&_nc_ohc=KwU3i7_izOgAX9bxMVv&_nc_ht=scontent.flko3-1.fna&oh=64dad6ce7a7b4807bb3941690beaee69&oe=5F1E8347) is the link to the paper\n* [Here](https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/detr) is link to their github repo for code and model zoo\n* They recently added a wrapper to use DETR from Detectron2 API","b53662f7":"# Training Function\n\nTraining of DETR is unique and different from FasteRRcnn  and EfficientDET , as we train the criterion as well , the training function can be viewed here : https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/detr\/blob\/master\/engine.py","3430fb9e":"# Update Log\n\n### V2\n* As I was made aware that I was printing the target boxes instead of predicted boxes , I have corrected it , I am really sorry , It was an honest mistake\n* Thanks to PRVI and his valuable suggestions , I have incorporated the following changes :\n  * Normalizing bounding boxes\n  * Using label 0 for main class\n\nThe code for the changes has been taken from [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/prokaj\/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers-detr#Creating-Dataset)","10e5dde2":"# Comp Metric","712c928f":"# Wheat Detection Competition With DETR\n\nSo I wanted to try DETR and what could be greater oppurtunity than a kaggle competition to test a model's potential. I just joined two days ago and from what I have analyzed these are by far the best practices for this competition :-\n* Use Stratified Kfold because of different sources of Images\n* Use Cut-mix for better model generalization\n* Use WBF ensemble for unifying predictions of Kfold model\n\nBesides these I found gem of an EDA kernel , It gives very valuable insigts , you can have a look [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/aleksandradeis\/globalwheatdetection-eda) by aleksandra .Here are the conclusions derived from that kernel\n* Images are taken at different zoom levels. Crop and resize data augmentations to be used for model training.\n* Images are taken at various lighting conditions. Special filters should be used to address that.\n* Bounding boxes are messy!\n\n**There are some Giant bounding boxes and some micro bounding boxes removal of which have reported bad lb, so I assume the noise is present in the test setas well, hence keeping them would be more benificial**\n\nKeeping all this in find we start with coding DETR , **Note that this code can be used and easily modified to other object detection tasks**","691676b5":"# Configuration\n\nBasic configuration for this model","629d25dd":"# DETR (Detection Transformer)\n\nAttention is all you need,paper for Transformers,changed the state of NLP and has achieved great hieghts.

Facebook's researchers argue that for object detection one part of the image should be in contact with the other part of the image for greater result especially with ocluded objects and partially visible objects, and what's better than to use transformer for it.\n\n**The main motive behind DETR is effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode prior knowledge about the task and makes the process complex and computationally expensive**\n\nThe main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, <font color='green'>are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture.<\/font>\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screenshot-from-2020-05-27-17-48-38.png)\n\n<font color='red'>Interesting Right??
