There are couple high-level tricks which can be summarized from playing the game as well:\n1. **Try to check sticky_actions before you do slide, pass, and shot, epecially the direction part.** It is simulating your direction button holding action when you use controller to paly the game.\n2. The ball ground level height is around 0.10 - 0.15 and player can pick a high pass at height around 0.5-1.0, while goalkeeper can catch the ball at around 0.5-2.0. Gravity is around 0.098, and drag plays a role during ball flying.\n3. The sprint speed is around 0.015 per step\n4. When PalyerRole is involved, there will be errors somehow, which is blocking to locate enemy goalkeeper accurately. My assumption here is that the latest PR merged in the helper is not available in the scoring environment. Will try to use it later.\n4. The space between boal controller and ball is around 0.012 during sprint which is close to the sprint speed. We may assume this is equal to one-step running length."}}
