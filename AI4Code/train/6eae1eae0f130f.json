It is my opinion based on the data provided, Waiters average the most tips on saturday and sunday around dinner time. Men on average, tipped 25 cents more than females. Also, there was only a 1 cent discrepancy in tip average between smokers and non smokers. This removes smoking from being a determing factor to tip amount.\n\n\nSecondly, The data shows that there is a increase in tip when a larger family dines together. This signifies that if you work with larger groups you can expect larger tips. However, there was a slight discrepency when analyzing families of 4 for people and families of five people. It would be expected that the larger family tips more but this is the only exception to the rule. In this scenario the family of size 4 tipped more on average than the family of size 5. The quantity of the data seems to have posed an issue here, seeing as it's so disproportionate. There was not enough data on the larger family size's to make concrete conclusions.\n\nLastly, Typically larger families tend to spend more money on their total bill. Also, you can see an increase in tip when there is a larger total bill price. This shows us that as waiters, if you want to earn more money from tips you may want to try and get the customer to spend more.\n\nI hope you enjoy this basic notebook focoused on data anlyzation and visualiztion.
