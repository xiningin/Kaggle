Perhaps the most important columns are the forecast date time (\u2018ds\u2018), the forecasted value (\u2018yhat\u2018), and the lower and upper bounds on the predicted value (\u2018yhat_lower\u2018 and \u2018yhat_upper\u2018) that provide uncertainty of the forecast.\n\nFor example, we can print the first few predictions as follows:"}}
