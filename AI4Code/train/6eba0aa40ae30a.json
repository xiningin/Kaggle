The lyrics to \"Wade in the Water\" were first co-published in 1901 in New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers by Frederick J. Work and his brother, John Wesley Work Jr., an educator at the historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, Fisk University.\n\nWork Jr. (1871 \u2013 1925)\u2014who is also known as John Work II\u2014spent thirty years collecting, promoting, and reviving the songcraft of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers, which included being a member and director of the Fisk Jubilee Quartet. The Sunset Four Jubilee Singers made the first commercial recording of \"Wade in the Water\" in 1925\u2014released by Paramount Records. W. E. B. Du Bois, who called this genre of songs, the Sorrow Songs, reviewed the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers' performance of \"Wade in the Water\" in a 1925.\n\nINTERPRETATION OF THE LYRICS\n\nFisk University was founded by the American Missionary Association. Many of the songs in the original Fisk Jubilee Singers songbooks dealt with themes from both the Old and New Testament. According to a 2002 article written by Dave Watermulder, J. Amber Hudlin, and Ellie Kaufman at George Washington University, the song reflect the Israelites' escape out of Egypt as found in Exodus.\n\nAccording to a 2007 anthology by California State University in Fresno, the singer \"warns of the coming signs of the end\" but says the \"victory of Heaven over Hell\" is assured, and \"looks forward to future freedom.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wade_in_the_Water","0dfb85b2":"<a id=\"1.1\"><\/a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">Who's that young girl dressed in blue?\nWade in the water.\nMust be the children that's coming through.\nGod's gonna trouble the water.<\/h3>","e0f8f9ec":"<a id=\"1.1\"><\/a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">You don't believe I've been redeemed.\nWade in the water.\nJust so the whole lake goes looking for me.\nGod's gonna trouble the water.<\/h3>","445ec48f":"<a id=\"1.1\"><\/a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">If you get there before I do.\nGod's gonna trouble the water.\nTell all of my friends I'm coming too.\nGod's gonna trouble the water.<\/h3>","530ced81":"<a id=\"1.1\"><\/a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">Wade in the water.\nWade in the water\nChildren.
