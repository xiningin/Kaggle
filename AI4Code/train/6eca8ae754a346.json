predicting employee performance, and the two are positively correlated, albeit slightly. The company might be interested in improving employee performance through increasing satisfaction using researched strategies, perhaps to increase the satisfaction of those who scored a 3.0 or less on the Employee Satisfaction survey. \n\nThis was a straightforward project, however I am definitely going to come back to it and explore further.","8da463a5":"# **HR Data Set - EDA & Performance prediction model**\n\nThis is my first project attempting to analyze a data set without any real guidelines. Feedback would be greatly appreciated! \n\nFor my project, I've decided to try to create a employee performance prediction model.","8b52d4bc":"### Interpreting the coefficients:\n\n- Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in **EmpSatisfaction** is associated with an **increase of performance score by ~ 0.25 points**.\n- Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in **PayRate** is **not** associated with an **increase of performance score**.\n- Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in **SpecialProjectsCount** is **not** associated with an **increase of performance score**.\n- ManagerID, as suspected, does not affect performance. It also does not make sense to say that increasing a unit in ManagerID would lead to an increase in performance score","3d391977":"Let's now drop some columns that are irrelevant","50e1755c":"For the features I chose the following: EmpSatisfaction, PayRate, ManagerID, SpecialProjectsCount, and EngagementSurvey\n\nEmployee Satisfaction had the highest correlation with employee performance. Payrate seemed like it would be worth exploring even though it had negligable correlation with employee performance. As for the managers, they also seemed to not have any correlation with employee performance.","9117bfa6":"Here we are getting an error. It seems that one of the dimensions chosen has missing values.
