Vincent Fredericq, the director-general of care home federation Femarbel, says the elderly were left behind in the rush to prepare hospitals. \u201cThey saw what happened in Italy and how their hospitals were overwhelmed. So there were instructions to hospitalize people from care homes as little as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were treated like the second class. And in the end, the hospitals were not overwhelmed \u2013 they actually had spare beds available in the intensive care units.\u201d Indeed, even at the disease\u2019s peak in Belgium, in early April, ICUs were only at 57 per cent capacity.\n\nBelgium is now testing the more than 240,000 residents and staff at nursing homes, and the early figures show a 9 per cent infection rate for care home residents and 4 per cent for personnel. But Mr Fredericq admits that it is hard to predict how many people died from the coronavirus in care homes. \u201cThe average age of residents is 85-86, and their average stay is just 16 months. There is an inevitable high mortality, so they could have died anyway,\u201d he says.\n\nBelgium also benefits from a relative political calm, and firm popular backing for the prime minister: Mrs Wilm\u00e9s is widely praised for her calm, clear and reassuring leadership. Scientists, like Mr Van Gucht, lead the daily briefings, not politicians. And Belgians generally comply with the restrictions, despite the occasional \u2018lockdown parties\u2019.\nhttps:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/coronavirus-belgium-death-toll-lockdown-trump-who-uk-spain-italy-a9494186.html","2936d1b7":"Mikhailo Polenok - dreamstime","a240bddd":"#The main wave of infections and Flattening the Curve. \n\nOfficials now believe that the main wave of infections came from Italy in the last week of February. \u201cWe were hit hard and suddenly in carnival holidays,\u201d says Mr Van Gucht. \u201cItaly is very popular with Belgians at that time of the year: the food is good, the ski is good, and you can go by car. We know it came from there because when we checked the genetic sequences, there were multiple interactions in Italy.\u201d\n\nBelgium now seems to have flattened the curve: on Friday, it reported 130 fatalities overall (83 in care homes), and 513 new cases. The first phase of Belgium\u2019s exit from the lockdowns will begin on Monday, with certain shops re-opening, and if the numbers stay low, schools will restart later this month.https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/coronavirus-belgium-death-toll-lockdown-trump-who-uk-spain-italy-a9494186.html","3628faac":"#Belgium has the highest coronavirus death rate in the world? by Leo Cendrowicz \n\nAccording to numbers collated by the Johns Hopkins University, Belgium leads the world in deaths per head of population, with the latest count on Friday showing it at 665 per million. By comparison, Britain\u2019s rate is 394, the US\u2019s is 193, Spain\u2019s is 525, and Italy\u2019s is 463. So why is Belgium\u2019s relative death toll so high?\n\nIn many ways, Belgium was well protected to weather the virus storm: it moved relatively swiftly to impose lockdown restrictions and its healthcare system is recognized as one of the best in the world. Yet as of Friday, it had recorded a total of 7,703 coronavirus deaths and 49,032 cases. In absolute fatalities, Belgium is in sixth place worldwide. Germany, next door, has registered just 6,632 deaths, but it has a population of 83 million, compared to Belgium\u2019s 11.5 million.https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/coronavirus-belgium-death-toll-lockdown-trump-who-uk-spain-italy-a9494186.html","261c0438":"#Counting Fatalities\n\nBut Belgium\u2019s high numbers have less to do with the spread of the disease and more to do with the way it counts fatalities. Its figures include all the deaths in the country\u2019s more than 1,500 nursing homes, even those untested for the virus. These numbers add up to more than half of the overall figure.\n\nAccording to Belgium's Federal Public Service for Health, just 46 per cent of the country's total official deaths were in hospitals where coronavirus cases were confirmed. But 53 per cent of the Belgian tally, or 4,100 people, were from care homes, and of these, 84 per cent are suspected but unconfirmed coronavirus deaths.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e9s says the government chose \u201cfull transparency when communicating deaths linked to Covid-19,\u201d even if it leads to \u201cnumbers that are sometimes overestimated.\u201d Health Minister Maggie De Block says Belgium is setting an example in diagnosing the disease. \u201cIn Europe, no country counts like the others.

But other countries are now adding care home deaths to their overall tally, including Britain \u2013 although the UK does not go as far as including those not confirmed by tests.\n\nSteven Van Gucht, the head of the viral disease division at the Sciensano Public-Health Institute, says he is not bothered by charts showing Belgium at the top. \u201cIf you want to compare our numbers with other countries, then you have to divide it by two,\u201d he says. Mr Van Gucht, who is also a virology professor at Ghent University, says the measure also helped increase political pressure to do more in care homes. \u201cWe do this because we want to save lives. In that way, the system worked,\u201d he says.\n\nBut the system is controversial, as it means deaths from diabetes, heart failure, hypertension and other problems are included in the Covid-19 tally. Virologist Marc Van Ranst, from Leuven University (KUL), has described it as \u201cstupid\u201d because it gives the impression that the coronavirus is the only cause of death in care homes.https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/coronavirus-belgium-death-toll-lockdown-trump-who-uk-spain-italy-a9494186.html","8004f105":"#\u201cHistory will show that Belgium got its numbers straight \u2013 that is the only thing the charts show,\u201d "}}
