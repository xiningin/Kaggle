It takes about 5-6 hours on the test set, using only CPU. \n\nI\u2019ve provided this kernel because a lot of people have problems making submissions. This method works and has never errored out for me. (Although I haven't tried making a submission using the GPU yet -- so no guarantees there.)\n\nIt uses BlazeFace for face extraction (see also [my BlazeFace kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/humananalog\/starter-blazeface-pytorch)) and ResNeXt50 as the classifier model.\n\nWe take the average prediction over 17 frames from each video. (Why 17? Using more frames makes the kernel slower, but doesn't appear to improve the score much. I used an odd number so we don't always land on even frames.)\n\n**Please use this kernel only to learn from...** Included is the checkpoint for a ResNeXt50 model that hasn't really been trained very well yet. I'm sure you can improve on it by training your own model!\n\nYou could use the included trained weights to get yourself an easy top-50 score on the leaderboard (as of 24 Jan 2020) but it\u2019s nicer to use it as a starting point for your own work. :-)","5341ce60":"## Import Required Libraries","3b22b258":"# Inference Kernel Demo - Analyzing Frames Per Video\n\nCredit to Wei Hao Khoong (Please view his kernel).\n\nI've noticed some people pointing out that varying `frames_per_video` does help in improving the public LB score.
