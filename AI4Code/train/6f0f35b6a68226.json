As a reminder, they have some candies which they plan to split evenly among themselves. For the sake of their friendship, any candies left over would be smashed. For example, if they collectively bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30 each and smash 1.\n\nYesterday, you wrote some code to calculate how many candies they'd have to smash, assuming they collected a particular number.\n\nBelow is a simple function that will calculate the number of candies to smash for *any* number of total candies.\n\nModify it so that it optionally takes a second argument representing the number of friends the candies are being split between. If no second argument is provided, it should assume 3 friends, as before.\n\nIf you're feeling extra fastidious, update the docstring to reflect this new behaviour (but we won't be checking for this).","ea26237a":"<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>\n\n(If you thought it would raise an exception, that's a perfectly reasonable guess. A large portion of learning Python is just trying stuff out and seeing what happens! A lot of arbitrary or at least subjective decisions go into designing a programming language, and it's not always possible to deduce from first principles how Python will handle a particular situation.)\n\nBut in this case, the `min` function gamely accepts our string inputs and seems to work as desired! Or, at least on the example in the docstring. However, there's a subtle problem afoot. Try experimenting with the function to see if you can find a set of inputs where it fails. Can you see where it's going wrong?","6d8376c6":"## 8. <span title=\"Spicy - this optional problem is intended to be extra difficult\" style=\"color: coral\">\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f<\/span>\n\nRead the function definition below.

If you have any questions, be sure to post them on the [forums](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn-forum).\n\nRemember that your notebook is private by default, and in order to share it with other people or ask for help with it, you'll need to make it public. First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also let's you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n\nI'll see you tomorrow for day 3.
