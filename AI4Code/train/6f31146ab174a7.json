Any suggestions for improvement or comments on poor coding practices are appreciated!","b62cd2c3":"## Retraining our model\n### We follow the same procedure as before, but now our training and test sets are black and white instead of gray-scale. Our score still isn't great, but it's a huge improvement.","7d676454":"## How did our model do?\n### You should have gotten around 0.10, or 10% accuracy. This is terrible. 10% accuracy is what get if you randomly guess a number. There are many ways to improve this, including not using a vector classifier, but here's a simple one to start. Let's just simplify our images by making them true black and white.\n\n- To make this easy, any pixel with a value simply becomes 1 and everything else remains 0.\n- We'll plot the same image again to see how it looks now that it's black and white. Look at the histogram now.","498716f1":"## Loading the data\n- We use panda's [read_csv][1]  to read train.csv into a [dataframe][2].\n- Then we separate our images and labels for supervised learning. \n- We also do a [train_test_split][3] to break our data into two sets, one for training and one for testing. This let's us measure how well our model was trained by later inputting some known test data.\n\n### For the sake of time, we're only using 5000 images. You should increase or decrease this number to see how it affects model training.\n\n\n  [1]: http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.read_csv.html\n  [2]: http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame\n  [3]: http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html"}}
