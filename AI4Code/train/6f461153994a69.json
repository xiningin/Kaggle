Only recently industries started talking about inclusion and diversity, and while this is a long term problem that needs a long term solution. One hypothesis that I thought, and certainly needs more data and study, is that currently women in data-science\/programming areas doesn't seem to be appreciated as its male counterpart. Maybe Kaggle could host or aim a campaign to the woman demographic audience?

The classification of \"other genders\" are much like man, but has a higher portion of \"Research Scientist\".\n* Just like \"time with programming\", \"time using ML\" has the same results: woman demographic has slightly less time using ML models, and other \"minorities genders\" has slightly more.\n* An interesting insight's that the women demographic is actually younger than man, which could potentially explain the difference of quantity of years programming, job and ML programming.
