The ideal solution for this challenge will be able to tell PASSNYC about the schools where the chances of improvements are highest. PASSNYC wants to recognize underperforming schools and recognize right proxy measures so that PASSNYC and its partners can provide outreach services to the needful. They have asked for 3 qualities in the analysis - \n- **Performance** - How well the need of PASSNYC services are there for recognized schools - By changing the threshold for deciding if a school is underperforming, PASSNYC can detect schools which needed their immediate help.\n- **Influential** - PASSNYC wants the winning entry to be influential to convince their stakeholders - In this analysis, we present a semi-supervised graph inference approach that solves the problem of limited SHSAT registration data and uses D5 SHSAT registration data and extrapolates it with label propagation algorithm to detect underperforming schools from other districts. We also provide driving factor analysis, revised proxies for deciding if a school is underperforming. These model are fairly advanced and simple so they will be easy for stakeholders and partners to understand.\n- **Shareable** - The complete analysis should be simple and sharable - the models we use are explained using visualization and are very easy to understand.","df9b6b78":"## The Above visual on 3 principal componants substantiate the Label propagation results\n** One can easily see that the schools performing low are very well seperated by well performing schools in lower dimensional space**","a9b216d3":"## Validation using principal componants analysis","8e896154":"#### Preparing Safety data for schools","4d800457":"## Merging to make master_df for Label propagation \n","ba385936":"## Important functions for creating Master data ","d85b6904":"### FInal results are provided in Performance_of_schools.csv file\n** Note**- When **predicted_underperfoming** variable takes the value 1, the school is underperforming else it's performing well.","6b6fff2b":"# Why PASSNYC should use this analysis (8 Resasons why!!) - \n\nThere are many reasons why PASSNYC should use this engine - \n\n| S. No. | Reason      |   Comment (explanation)       | \n| :----------: | :-----------------------------------: |:--------------------------:|\n|1. |  **Performance on limited data (Only D5)**   | This kernel uses a **semi-supervised learning** technique which uses the limited data e.g. a limited number of labels (D5 SHSAT data) and assigns underperforming schools in complete NY. ||\n|2. | **Two models - Semi-supervised and Supervised** | It provides **two model for qualifying schools as underperforming** - one being a semi-supervised model to assign a school as a purely statistical method and other models (supervised learning) to explain the process that can be used a call a school underperforming. ||\n|3. | **Modular Codes** | These kernels uses modular codes and uses a threshold on SHSAT appear rate and registration rate and ** these thresholds can be easily changed to get the schools needing immediate support** to schools underperforming.  PASSNYC can change these thresholds and re-run the model to make different strategies||\n|4. | **Speed** | These kernels run super fast (**less than a minute**) so if changing parameters and re-running the model to make more aggressive strategies are very easy.   ||\n|5. | **Causal relations\/ Driving factors** | This analysis finds **driving factors for each variables impacting the performance of schools** and establish causal relationships between variables. ||\n|6. | **Influential** | It provides driving factors and revised proxy measures, a decision tree diagram to explain the complete process which is much more likely to convince stakeholders ||\n|7. |**Revised proxy measures** | The decision trees analysis provides revised proxy measures used to assign a school as underperforming ||\n|8. | **Validation of results** | At the end validation is done using **Principal componant analysis** and schools are plotted along 3 principal componants, the plots itself validates the results, grouping low performing schools together in lower dimensions||\n\n\n","0e32594d":"# This analysis is a two kernel series -\n- **1. Kernel 1 (Label Propagation learning)** - In this kernel, we will construct a semi-supervised clustering model called label propagation and will use the limited data available (D5 SHSAT data) and assign if a school is underperforming or performing well. The school is underperforming or not is assigned on the basis SHSAT appearance rate and test registration rate. The threshold for assigning a school as underperforming is modular and PASSNYC can modify and re-run the model for a more or less aggressive targeting of underperforming schools. Apart from being very unique and first of its kind analysis on kaggle, this analysis runs very fast (less than a minute). At the end, a visualization on the map is made to show how the algorithm is spreading labels and showing underperforming schools on the map.\n\n\n\n- **2. Kernel 2 (Analyzing Driving Factors and Scope estimator)** - This is the second kernel for PASSNYC which effectively use sophisticated data analysis technique like Decision trees to get the revised proxy measures for the results we are getting using Label propagation results and Bayesian network and recognize the driving factor for SHSAT. It uses decision trees as trees are very easy to explain to stakeholders the rules behind assigning a school underperforming. It also uses provides a beautiful visualization of the complete tree.
