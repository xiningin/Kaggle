It is inspired by Richard Feynman's path integral formulation. That's why the python module to use it is called Feyn, and the Q in QLattice is for Quantum.\n\nAbzu provides free QLattices for non-commercial use to anyone. These free community QLattices gets allocated for us automatically if we use Feyn without an active subscription, as we will do in this notebook.
