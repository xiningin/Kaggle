However, we need to control it and bring it down to defeat Corona virus.","379afecf":"## What is the Impact of Travelling Restrictions on Controlling Spread of Corona Virus ?\n\nWith travelling restrictions including flight ban taking effect on 21st March 2020, we might see number of foreign cases reducing with time. This may also reduce local cases. Major factor in local cases is of course social distance, restrictions on gatherings, weather etc.\n\n### Reference\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/mar\/21\/pakistan-suspends-international-flights-for-two-weeks-to-stem-covid-19-spread\n","d769763b":"## Please Upvote, Share and Make a Contribution to Help us Fight Corona virus if Possible. Thanks for Appreciation.","cdb835dc":"## Facts\n\n1). Most the cases i.e. over 71% have direct foreign connection.\n2). 10% of those being tested due to symptoms are turning out to be Corona positive. \n3). Less than 1% of those who test positive are fatalities\n4). There have been many cases of people escaping from quarantine\n5). People don't understand quarantine, and self isolation at home\n\n\n## Policy\n\n1). Given the facts that most of the positive cases have foreign origin, we need to keep borders closed and country open. We are doing completely opposite.\n2). We need to increase testing bandwidth and make it easily available across the country to make sure that we do not miss out on potential outbreak.\n3). Since less than 1% of positive cases are fatalities, therefore spend most of the effort in testing and prevention.\n4). \n## Strategy\n\n1). Lockdown borders and not the whole country.  Avoid potentially dangerous spread through aggressive testing and quarantine.\n2). Adapt the strategy, if the ground realities change. \n3). Use selective but effective lockdown at local levels e.g. village, mohallah when needed.\n","873b072a":"## Corona Virus Testing\n\nCheap and large scale testing against Corna Virus is important for quickly isolating patients and stopping spread of the disease. This has been successfully demonstrated by South Korea. In case of Pakistan, testing capacity has been very limited so it is possible that there lots of undetected cases and hence infection rates will increase. Pakistan's low number of positive cases can be largely attributed to poor testing capability and capacity. ","de6923f2":"## Introduction\n\nPakistan may not be rich country with lots of resources, but it has so far held off Corona virus using a number of steps. This dataset is tracking those efforts and their impact towards Corona virus prevention.\n\nRelated Information about COVID-19\nCOVID-19 may not be fatal but it spreads faster than other diseases, like common cold. Every virus has Basic Reproduction number (R0) which implies how many people will get the disease from the infected person. As per inital reseach work R0 of COVID-19 is 2.7.\n\nCurrently the goal of all scientists around the world is to \"Flatten the Curve\". COVID-19 currently has exponential growth rate around the world which we will be seeing in the notebook ahead. Flattening the Curve typically implies even if the number of Confirmed Cases are increasing but the distribution of those cases should be over longer timestamp. To put it in simple words if say suppose COVID-19 is going infect 100K people then those many people should be infected in 1 year but not in a month.\n\nThe sole reason to Flatten the Curve is to reudce the load on the Medical Systems so as to increase the focus of Research to find the Medicine for the disease.\n\nEvery Pandemic has four stages:\n\nStage 1: Confirmed Cases come from other countries\n\nStage 2: Local Transmission Begins\n\nStage 3: Communities impacted with local transimission\n\nStage 4: Significant Transmission with no end in sight\n\nItaly and Korea are the two countries which are currently in Stage 4 While India is in Stage 2.\n\nOther ways to tackle the disease like Corona other than Travel Ban, Cross-Border shutdown, isolation, closure of some high risk market places, Contact Tracing and Quarantine.\n\n### Reference\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/neelkudu28\/covid-19-visualizations-predictions-forecasting","604786b0":"### As shown above, there has been travel restrictions","e20b09ab":"## Analysis of Data and Policy Suggestions","d78dba3a":"While it is expected that positive might increase, and we need to make sure that we have enough capacity to take care of critically ill patients.

Meanwhile, the population of Italy is ~62.1 million people (142.8 million more people live in Pakistan). We have positioned the outline of Italy near your home location of Lahore, PB, Pakistan.\n- Pakistan is about 2 times smaller than Iran. Iran is approximately 1,648,195 sq km, while Pakistan is approximately 796,095 sq km. Meanwhile, the population of Iran is ~82.0 million people (122.9 million more people live in Pakistan). We have positioned the outline of Iran near your home location of Lahore, PB, Pakistan.\n- Pakistan was much near to epicenter of Corona virus i.e. China. \n- Pakistan continued to receive thousands of visitors from Iran and China long after spread of Corona started.\n- Given Pakistan's close relationship with Iran and China means that Pakistan's day 1 is same as China when building any model to predict spread of Corona virus.\n- Pakistan continues to be high risk, and present status does not mean we can avoid bad situation in future due to failure of prevention\/avoidance efforts !","7ab1da38":"### More and more testing is being done as seen in graph. But still very limited testing being done can hide true number of local infections in Pakistan, and is a major concern at present.

With blockage of international flights, local travel restrictions and reduction in number of travellers from Iran\/China risk from travellers should reduce gradually in coming days.\n\n2). Limited testing being done can hide true number of local infections in Pakistan, and is a major concern at present. However, right now with increase in testing we are not seeing large increase in positive cases. \n\n3). Aggressive contact tracing is in place, and would help a lot in combating spread of disease.\n\n4). Pakistan is now at stage 2, and there is local spread which needs to be controlled through aggressive measures.\n\n5).
