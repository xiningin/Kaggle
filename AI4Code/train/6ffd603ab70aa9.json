However, in neural network, there is at least one hidden layer between input and output layer.\n* **What is deep, in order to say \"deep\" how many layer do I need to have:** When I ask this question to my teacher, he said that \"\"Deep\" is a relative term; it of course refers to the \"depth\" of a network, meaning how many hidden layers it has. \"How deep is your swimming pool?\" could be 12 feet or it might be two feet; nevertheless, it still has a depth--it has the quality of \"deepness\". 32 years ago, I used two or three hidden layers. That was the limit for the specialized hardware of the day. Just a few years ago, 20 layers was considered pretty deep. In October, Andrew Ng mentioned 152 layers was (one of?) the biggest commercial networks he knew of. Last week, I talked to someone at a big, famous company who said he was using \"thousands\". So I prefer to just stick with \"How deep?\"\"\n* **Why it is called hidden:** Because hidden layer does not see inputs(training set)\n* For example you have input, one hidden and output layers. When someone ask you \"hey my friend how many layers do your neural network have?\" The answer is \"I have 2 layer neural network\". Because while computing layer number input layer is ignored. \n* Lets see 2 layer neural network: \n<a href=\"http:\/\/ibb.co\/eF315x\"><img src=\"http:\/\/preview.ibb.co\/dajVyH\/9.jpg\" alt=\"9\" border=\"0\"><\/a>\n* Step by step we will learn this image.\n    * As you can see there is one hidden layer between input and output layers. And this hidden layer has 3 nodes. If yoube curious why I choose number of node 3, the answer is there is no reason, I only choose :). Number of node is hyperparameter like learning rate. Therefore we will see hyperparameters at the end of artificial neural network.\n    * Input and output layers do not change. They are same like logistic regression.\n    * In image, there is a tanh function that is unknown for you. It is a activation function like sigmoid function. Tanh activation function is better than sigmoid for hidden units bacause mean of its output is closer to zero so it centers the data better for the next layer. Also tanh activation function increase non linearity that cause our model learning better.\n    * As you can see with purple color there are two parts. Both parts are like logistic regression. The only difference is activation function, inputs and outputs.\n        * In logistic regression: input => output\n        * In 2 layer neural network: input => hidden layer => output. You can think that hidden layer is output of part 1 and input of part 2.\n* Thats all. We will follow the same path like logistic regression for 2 layer neural network.","cfd662ab":"<a id=\"13\"><\/a> <br>\n## Forward propagation\n* Forward propagation is almost same with logistic regression.\n* The only difference is we use tanh function and we make all process twice.\n* Also numpy has tanh function.

For example, lets look at our sign one.\n<a href=\"http:\/\/ibb.co\/dNgDJH\"><img src=\"http:\/\/preview.ibb.co\/mpD4Qx\/10.jpg\" alt=\"10\" border=\"0\"><\/a>\n* For example first hidden layer learns edges or basic shapes like line. When number of layer increase, layers start to learn more complex things like convex shapes or characteristic features like forefinger.\n* Lets create our model\n    * There are some hyperparameters we need to choose like learning rate, number of iterations, number of hidden layer, number of hidden units, type of activation functions. Woww it is too much :)\n    * These hyperparameters can be chosen intiutively if you spend a lot of time in deep learning world.\n    * However, if you do not spend too much time, the best way is to google it but it is not necessary. You need to try hyperparameters to find best one.\n    * In this tutorial our model will have 2 hidden layer with 8 and4 nodes, respectively. Because when number of hidden layer and node increase, it takes too much time. \n    * As a activation function we will use relu(first hidden layer), relu(second hidden layer) and sigmoid(output layer) respectively.\n    * Number of iteration will be 100.\n* Our way is same with previous parts however as you learn the logic behind deep learning, we can ease our job and use keras library for deeper neural networks.\n* First lets reshape our x_train, x_test, y_train and y_test.\n","6c5907db":"<a id=\"22\"><\/a> <br>\n## Implementing with keras library\nLets look at some parameters of keras library:\n* units: output dimensions of node\n* kernel_initializer: to initialize weights\n* activation: activation function, we use relu\n* input_dim: input dimension that is number of pixels in our images (785 px)\n* optimizer: we use adam optimizer\n    * Adam is one of the most effective optimization algorithms for training neural networks.\n    * Some advantages of Adam is that relatively low memory requirements and usually works well even with little tuning of hyperparameters\n* loss: Cost function is same.
