In classification, we used accuracy as a evaluation metric; in regression, we will use the R^2 score as well as the RMSE to evaluate our model performance. We will also use cross validation to optimize our model hyperparameters.","2285cb14":"<a id=\"p6\"><\/a>\n# 6. Submission\nLet's use our optimized model to predict on the Test Set! We will create a dataframe with the predictions and the IDs to submit.","791376aa":"<a id=\"p4\"><\/a>\n# 4. Feature Engineering\nOk, now that we have dealt with all the missing values, it looks like it's time for some feature engineering, the second part of our data preprocessing. We need to create feature vectors in order to get the data ready to be fed into our model as training data. This requires us to convert the categorical values into representative numbers.","e38800f8":"Yup! An empty table.","c6b6491d":"The RMSEs are small because of the log transformation we performed. So even a 0.1 RMSE may be significant in this case. ","d960e525":"**Ridge Model**","5e7dfa88":"**Numerical Imputing**\n\nWe'll impute with median since the distributions are probably very skewed.","b21c4f3e":"Now, the features with a lot of missing values have been taken care of! Let's move on to the features with fewer missing values.","7c0645a9":"## Places Where NaN Means Something\nIf you look at the data description file provided, you will see that for some categories, NaN actually means something. This means that if a value is NaN, the house might not have that certain attribute, which will affect the price of the house. Therefore, it is better to not drop, but fill in the null cell with a value called \"None\" which serves as its own category.","c872bce8":"**Defining Training\/Test Sets**\n\nWe drop the Id and SalePrice columns for the training set since those are not involved in predicting the Sale Price of a house. The SalePrice column will become our training target. Remember how we transformed SalePrice to make the distribution more normal? Well we can apply that here and make TransformedPrice the target instead of SalePrice. This will improve model performance and yield a much smaller RMSE because of the scale."}}
