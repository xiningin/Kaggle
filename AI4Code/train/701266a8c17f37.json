liability corporations registered in the calendar year. From the definition we can assume that a good sign for the economy would be to see these numbers grow over time. \n","8494de36":"### (ii) Men","7dee81eb":"# Why is Private Sector Important for India?\n\nThe importance of private sector in Indian economy has been very commendable in generating employment and thus eliminating poverty. Further, it also effected the following -\n* Increased quality of life\n* Increased access to essential items\n* Increased production opportunities\n* Lowered prices of essential items\n* Increased value of human capital\n* Improved social life of the middle class Indian\netc.\n\nThe importance of private sector in Indian economy can be witnessed from the tremendous growth of Indian BPOs, Indian software companies, Indian private banks and financial service companies. The manufacturing industry of India is flooded with private Indian companies and in fact they dominate the said industry. \n\nLet us now look at how India's Private Sector is progressing\n\n\n# Trade in services (% of GDP)\n\nTrade in Services refers to the sale and delivery of an intangible product, called a service, between a producer and consumer. An intangible product\/asset is something that lacks physical substance. Physical assets include for example machinery and buildings, and financial assets such as government securities, whereas an intangible asset is usually very hard to evaluate. Examples are patents, copyright, franchises, goodwill, trademarks. It also also includes software and other intangible computer based assets; these are all examples of intangible assets.\n\nHence, Trade in services that takes place between a producer and consumer that are, in legal terms, based in different countries is called International Trade in Services.\n\nInternational trade in services is defined by the Four Modes of Supply of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).\n\n* (Mode 1) Cross-Border Trade - which is defined as delivery of a service from the territory of one country into the territory of other country, e.g. remotely providing accounting services in one country for a company based in another country, or an airline flying between two international destinations\n* (Mode 2) Consumption Abroad - this mode covers supply of a service of one country to the service consumer of any other country, e.g. tourism, telemedicine, or study-abroad\n* (Mode 3) Commercial Presence - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country in the territory of any other country, e.g. a bank opening a physical branch or internet service provider offering internet services in another country\n* (Mode 4) Presence of Natural Persons - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country through the presence of natural persons in the territory of any other country, e.g. a business transferring an employee from one country to another for work duties (doctors or architects traveling and working abroad)\n\nA \"Natural person\" is a human being, as distinct from legal persons such as companies or organisations.\n\n**How is this important for India?**\n\nIndia is a developing country and world trade in services is important for emerging economies like China and India. Trade in services help promote economic transformation and helps enable other sectors to promote a balanced growth path.","d19aec3b":"# Reading Data and Cleanup","02ef971d":"## c) Profit Tax \n\nAs the name suggests, Profit tax is the amount of taxes on profits paid by the business.","ecd6eb1f":"With a score of 4.6 in 2017, India needs to work on this to improve its score thereby getting more firms to register. \n\n## d) Time Required to Register Property \n\nIt is the time required to register property is the number of calendar days needed for businesses to secure rights to property","77155918":"## d) Other Taxes Payable\n\nOther taxes payable by businesses include the amounts paid for property taxes; turnover taxes; and other small taxes such as municipal fees and vehicle and fuel taxes.","b60a9ff4":"A steady increase in the score shows India's growth in developing its private sector. The 2020 Ease of Doing Business Index is at 63, losing 14 points from 2019.","676ee7c8":"## (b) Cost of Business Start-Up Procedures \n\nIt is the cost to register a business. normalized by presenting it as a percentage of gross national income (GNI) per capita.\n\n### (i) Women","b412bf81":"2012 shows the highest number of new firms registered with 103K. The latest data we have is for 2016, with 93K new firms registered. \n\n\nNow that we know why is private sector important, let us now look at some factors that could affect the number of firms being registered.\n\n# Factors Affecting Private Sector\n\n## a) Average Time to Clear Exports Through Customs\n\nIt is the average number of days to clear direct exports through customs.\n","8c51fc99":"We see a decline to 22 days to obtain electricity service in 2014. However in 2016, Power Ministry made it mandatory to provide electricity connection within 15 days to the consumers in normal conditions. The ministry stated that the measures will drastically reduced the time taken for getting an electricity connection and will benefited citizens and industry alike.\n\n## c) Burden of Custom's Procedure\n\nBurden of Customs Procedure measures business executives' perceptions of their country's efficiency of customs procedures. The rating ranges from 1 to 7, with a higher score indicating greater efficiency.","e734adda":"We see, around years, 2011-12 and 2012-13 the balance of payments has increased, thus more vulnerability to sudden reversal of capital flows.\n\nHence, the priority has been therefore to reduce deficit (CAD) through improving trade balance. Efforts have been made to promote exports by diversifying the export commodity basket and export destinations. One instance to note is that to discourage the imports of gold which plays a significant role in causing trade deficit, customs duty on its import was raised from 6% to 8% and further to 10% in mid 2013. \n\n# Domestic Credit to Private Sector\n\nDomestic credit to private sector by banks refers to financial resources provided to the private sector by other depository corporations (deposit taking corporations except central banks), such as through loans, purchases of nonequity securities, and trade credits and other accounts receivable, that establish a claim for repayment. For some countries these claims include credit to public enterprises.\n\nLets see how did India fare in this over the years","85f1dfaf":"Thus we see, from 63 days we're down to 58 in 6 years. India will need to reduce this at a steeper rate if it needs more firm registrations. \n\n\n\n# Start-Ups\n\nA startup or startup is a company or project initiated by an entrepreneur to seek, effectively develop, and validate a scalable business model. With an expanding economy opening different avenues and technology revolutionizing the way people conduct businesses, there has also taken place greater democratization of entrepreneurial space. Putting a new business idea into action is no longer the preserve of a select few business families.\n\nBe it Flipkart, Snapdeal, Zomato, Paytm, Ola or OYO rooms, the common underlining factor behind them is that they have been started by the first generation of businessmen in their families. With the early startups having proved their mettle, the fading away of the initial scepticism and the maturing of the investor landscape, Indian startups today have earned the confidence of global investors and the startup ecosystem is experiencing a boom like never before. With the startup boom in India, let's look at what the data shows us for female\/male. This will also help to see if there is any discrimation between gender.\n\n\n## a) Start-Up Procedures to Register a Business:\n\nStart-up procedures are those required to start a business, including interactions to obtain necessary permits and licenses and to complete all inscriptions, verifications, and notifications to start operations. Data are for businesses with specific characteristics of ownership, size, and type of production.\n\n### (i) Women","8b394075":"This is a good sign with the number of days reducing from 15 to 6. But 6 is a long duration for companies\/firms to get their exports cleared.\n\n## b) Time to Obtain Electrical Connection \n\nIt is the average wait, in days, experienced to obtain an electrical connection from the day an establishment applies for it to the day it receives the service.","40af374e":"So we see changes over the years, making it easier to have your own start-up. Also that there is n discrimation which is a very good indicator.\n\n# Taxes\n\nThe business of job creation has simple ingredients \u2014 land, labour and capital \u2014 with multiple recipes possible in how they combine. An important signal in 2019's budget was the upfront and overdue recognition of job creators and the private sector as a partner in creating prosperity.\n\n## a) Time to Prepare\/Pay Taxes\n\nIt is the time to prepare and pay taxes is the time, in hours per year, it takes to prepare, file, and pay (or withhold) three major types of taxes: the corporate income tax, the value added or sales tax, and labor taxes, including payroll taxes and social security contributions.","335e4b83":"Thus we see a reduction is taxes post 2017, mostly because GST streamlined most of this.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWith this, I am concluding this kernel. In this exercise we learnt how important private sector is for Indian economy and how with the opening up of the indian economy FDI's bought improvement in the sector. We also saw how certain reforms and acts make it easier to start your own company in India.\n\n# References\n\n* http:\/\/www.economicsdiscussion.net\/balance-of-payment\/india-balance-of-payment\/balance-of-payments-of-india\/10133\n* https:\/\/cadmus.eui.eu\/bitstream\/handle\/1814\/44716\/Trade-in-Services-and-Economic-Transformation_Final-Nov2016.pdf?sequence=1\n* https:\/\/inc42.com\/resources\/its-a-boom-time-for-indian-startups-heres-why\/\n* http:\/\/www.iitk.ac.in\/siic\/d\/content\/why-opt-private-firm\n* https:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/","d8ab6469":"# Introduction\n\nThe private sector of Indian economy is the past few years have delineated significant development in terms of investment and in terms of its share in the gross domestic product. The key areas in private sector of Indian economy that have surpassed the public sector are transport, financial services etc\n\nIndian government has considered plans to take concrete steps to bring affect poverty alleviation through the creation of more job opportunities in the private sector of Indian economy, increase in the number of financial institutions in the private sector, to provide loans for purchase of houses, equipments, education, and for infrastructural development also. The private sector of Indian economy is recently showing its inclination to serve the society through women empowerment programs, aiding the people affected by natural calamities, extending help to the street children and so on. \n\nThe most interesting fact about the private sector of India economy is that though the overall pace of its development is comparatively slower than the public sector, still the investment of private sector in the recent past, i.e. in the first quarter of 1990 registered approximately 56 % which rose to nearly 71 % in the next quarter, accounting for an increase of 15 %. Certain steps taken by the Indian government are acting as the stepping stone of the private sector continued journey to success, include industrial delicensing, devaluation that was implemented previously.\n\nIn this kernel we'll understand how Private Sector works in India, its ranking w.r.t the world, various constraints or limitations it faces and the taxes it has to pay. These are some important factors to understand amongst others which I will be exploring in this kernel.\n\nDataset: https:\/\/data.world\/hdx\/0c245a24-dd0f-4484-bca5-902c2d5da92a\n\n\n# Importing Relevant Libraries","9c6403b3":"### (ii) Men","721ead66":"For five years from 2003-04 to 2007-08, India grew at an steady rate, close to adding 2% per year largely on account of information technology (IT) outsourcing and capital-intensive manufactures.\n\nThe IT boom was truly remarkable, contributed by the IT and communication revolution, and the financial deregulation in the US. India seized the opportunity, leveraging its human capital till the 2008 Great Depression. In 2018, the trade in services stood at 12.07% of a GDP of (2.72 trillion)\n\n# Insurance and Financial Services\n\nInsurance and financial services cover various types of insurance provided to nonresidents by resident insurance enterprises and vice versa, and financial intermediary and auxiliary services (except those of insurance enterprises and pension funds) exchanged between residents and nonresidents. The data we have is in measue of % of service imports\/exports, BoP.\n\nThe balance of payments, also known as balance of international payments and abbreviated B.O.P. or BoP, of a country is the record of all economic transactions between the residents of the country and the rest of the world in a particular period of time. The balance of payments includes all external visible and non-visible transactions of a country. This measure is important as it provides detailed information concerning the demand and supply of a country's currency. Also, a country's balance of payments data may signal its potential as a business partner for the rest of the world. If a country is grappling with a major balance of payments difficulty, it may not be able to expand imports from the outside world.\n\nA BoP crisis is also called a currency crisis, occurs when a nation is unable to pay for essential imports or service its external debt repayments. In a perfect scenario, the Balance of Payments (BoP) should be zero. That is, the money coming in and the money going out should balance out. A BoP surplus indicates that a country's exports are more than its imports. A BoP deficit, on the other hand, indicates that a country's imports are more than exports.","5386e208":"We see the increase in hours after 2017, which could be mostly attributed to GST coming into effect.\nGST is an Indirect Tax which has replaced many Indirect Taxes in India. The Goods and Service Tax Act was passed in the Parliament on 29th March 2017. The Act came into effect on 1st July 2017; Goods & Services Tax Law in India is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that is levied on every value addition.\n\n## b) Labor Tax and Contributions\n\nIt is the amount of taxes and mandatory contributions on labor paid by the business.","ba130abd":"The highest has been in 2013, with almost 52% of the GDP being given to private sector, aand touching 50 again in 2018. With the 2019 budget announcing the government\u2019s intent to tap overseas markets to raise debt, maybe in the coming years we will see more credit being given. A point to note is that a huge chunk of the domestic borrowing is by the government. That leaves very little scope to lend to the private sector. Low credit to the private sector means low capital available for expansion. A major hurdle for one of the major growth engines of the economy. With the government set to borrow overseas, a lot of capital is expected to free up at home.\n\n# Ease of Doing Business Score and Index\n\nThe ease of doing business score helps assess the absolute level of regulatory performance over time. It captures the gap of each economy from the best regulatory performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies\n\nAn economy\u2019s ease of doing business score is reflected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest and 100 represents the best performance. For example, an ease of doing business score of 75 means an economy was 25 percentage points away from the best regulatory performance constructed across all economies and across time.\n\nThe ease of doing business index is an index created jointly by Simeon Djankov and Gerhard Pohl, two leading economists at the Central and Eastern Europe sector of the World Bank Group. The academic research for the report was done jointly with professors Oliver Hart and Andrei Shleifer. Higher rankings (a low numerical value) indicate better, usually simpler, regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights. Empirical research funded by the World Bank to justify their work show that the economic growth impact of improving these regulations is strong."}}
