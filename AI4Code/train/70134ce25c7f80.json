Loading the data","767cd464":"## Machine Learning projects workflow - reusable functions\n\n### General:\n\nThis notebook will be revolving around structuring machine learning workflow.\nWriting your code in a way which makes it reusable does have a lot of advantages.\nFunctions written in this notebook are generally simple but enable easy change of parameters without change of output structure, so one can for example compute a few aggregates for a selected DataFrame and then concatenate all of them to a final training\/test DF.\n\nSometimes it is better to put a bit more time into structuring your functions properly, making them reusable in different projects. This way, one can build a code base for different types of ML tasks and often simply copy a set of functions to use them in a new project. Of course, not always everything can be used when copied as is but often a few slight changes or improvements will make code usable again. \n\n### Home Credit:\n\nIn Home Credit, some of the tables have similar structure and therefore the same function can be used on them for proper processing. There are exceptions though - Bureau Balance and Bureau require a different approach, where we first create aggregates for Bureau Balance using `SK_ID_BUREAU`, as this column is also present in Bureau, so Bureau Balance aggregates can be merged using this particular column. This is why in Bureau processing function one should account for merging the Bureau Balance onto Bureau first and then aggregating the Bureau itself. Of course, this process could be divided into two steps and two functions:\n\n1. merge Bureau Balance onto Bureau\n2. aggregate Bureau\n\nbut for educational purpose the first approach was chosen.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the fact that even though table structure may be the same, each DF may require a bit different approach to column processing, NaN imputation or dropping specific columns, which the model should not be trained on (such as `SK_ID_PREV`, `SK_ID_CURR` - in general index or ID columns).\n\nIn each of the processing\/preparation functions emphasis is also put on column renaming. Even though at first this may seem unnecessary, as the model can be trained on columns named `['1', '2', '3'...]`, checking feature importance or performing further feature selection in an informative way may prove impossible in such case. One more thing to keep in mind is the fact that if one wants to train XGB\/LGBM model on DataFrame, column names must be unique. That's one more reason to take care of this when preparing features for the model.\n\nKFold training function has been prepared in a way to enable both easy ensembling (through simple model parameters or splits changes) and easy selection of each fold test predictions. It is much easier to simply take a mean over column axis when having predictions for each fold in a separate column than to try recovering them for already averaged set ;).","902ffd26":"### 2.2.

KFold split and model training:\n\nPreparing a function for training in this way is useful for a number of reasons:\n- it is easy to change model parameters\n- it is easy to change number of folds\n- it is easy to change split seed to train on different splits\n\nTherefore a number of runs with very different parameters can be easily created for proper ensembling.","9f45298a":"### 4.

Parameters setting\n\nEven though some of the parameters can hardcoded and in many cases this will not make much difference, you never really know when you may want to use this parameter again, for example to keep files placement or model parameters consistent between functions. \n\nThis is the reason why it's better to have most of them structured as variables or even dictionaries (in cases where there are a lot of parameters).\n\nHere, we will just set the data directory one."}}
