","19e0ca0e":"**Introduction**","a272810e":"First, I chose four libraries for this. I chose pandas and numppy for data manipulation functions, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization functions.  ","19f62f22":"This notebook explores the women representation in the city property of San Francisco using visulization techniques. The goal of the is to find where women and men have larger representation in the different departments\/sources. The findings show that women have a significantly larger representation in the Port and men have a significantly larger representation in in the SFMTA, PUC and Airport departments. The Rec and Park and Library have slightly more women representation than men. The Administrator and RED departments hold a well balance equal amount between women and men. ","2520fb30":"Let's see how the data is structured:","de07ba77":"From the table of the data above, we see that there are places named by both male and female. So, now we should look at the count of female vs male.","1bfdbc55":"We can start visualizing the female vs male count of each department\/source.","2bc6cf1e":"With our cleaned data, we have the 59 places named either by females or males. These places are divided by eight different departments\/source, called administrator, Rec and Parks, library, RED, SFMTA, PUC, Port and airport. \n\nWe can see how many places are in each one below: ","442ab0cc":"Now we have 59 rows of unique, only female and male named places. Our data is now workable to start visualizing. ","e9d4653f":"**Summary**","e62e0603":"**Notebook Set-Up and Data Exploration Section**","fda42d65":"We know we have 53 male and 19 female named places. We can show this below:","9c3d8ee6":"**Summary Analysis**","abe6bdb5":"However, we can see from looking at just the beginning and ending rows that we have repeating names (example: \"George R. Moscone\"). This means we need to find the repeating names and take those out since they can bias our visulations of either gender. ","a78b2904":"Women have a significantly larger representation in the Port, almost doubling the amount of named places after men. That is the only area of significantly larger representation. Areas like the Administrator and RED departments hold a well balance equal amount between women and men, while the Rec and Park and Library have slightly more women representation. The women presences is non-exsistent in the SFMTA, PUC and Airport departments. It is *likely* to be highly focused in the Port, administrator, RED, Rec and park and library departments because (1) they are longer exstablished departments and (2) more women have broken into these fields. \n\nMen have a significantly larger representation in in the SFMTA, PUC and Airport, as no other women are represented in these departments. Men have a balanced representation in the Administrator and RED departments with women, and and slighly less represented in the Rec and Park and Library departments. ","d0d131b7":"**Visulization of Genders in Different Departments**","0a720e3e":"This notebook is about the analysis of the women representation in the city property of San Francisco. The goal of this is to do an EDA on the representation of men and women in various facilities of the city, and find where both genders are larger along with some possible reasons behind that. There's 82 places named by people in the city's property. The types of information included in the file is the department of the named place, name of the place, the person it's named after, the gender of the person, reference, comments, and following numbers about the different districts. I will use visualization techniques to show the disproportion between female and male named in the different areas, which I will the department information to be used as the different areas. ","ef9289e2":"Now we see that the data also holds information of female\/male, male\/male and male\/female named places. Since our goal is to find larger female and male named places in different areas, I will just leave out the places with shared names since that doesn't help us define the disproportion of the data.
