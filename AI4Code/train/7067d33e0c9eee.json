Pair plots are a great method to identify trends for follow-up analysis. With a single line of code we can see the relation between all numerical variables and their distributions, once you\u2019ve got yourself a nice cleaned dataset, one of the most effective starting tools is the pairs plot (also called a scatterplot matrix).

A high correlation means that two or more variables have a strong relationship with each other, while a weak correlation means that the variables are hardly related.

It can tell you about your outliers and what their values are. It can also tell you if your data is symmetrical, how tightly your data is grouped, and if and how your data is skewed.\n\n**But what is IQR?**\n\nIQR is simple the diference between Q3(25th percentile) and Q1(75th percentile), this metric can be use to find outliers in a variable, values above (Q3+1.5 * IQR) and values below (Q1-1.5 * IQR) are considered outliers, in a boxplot we can find all this values and use then to remove outliers from our data.","4c5bd431":"### Multivariate Analysis\n\n**What is multivariate analysis?**\n\nMultivariate analysis (MVA) is based on the statistical principle of multivariate statistics, which involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time.
