From the above, we saw how even though Levitating by Dua Lipa has charted the most amount of times in 2021, we don't see her in the top 5 Artists List. This is a clear indication of though, Dua Lipa has the most amount of time in Top 30. She has only 1-2 good songs from her album which helped her peak.\n<br>\n<b>This can mean that her song had a very high re-playability factor to it.<\/b>\n<br>\n2. We observe the same for other artists like Lil Nas X.\n<br>\n3. Artists like Weekend, Olivia Rodrigo and Doja Cat do not face the same issue and are on the top 5 of the artists as well as tracks list. Showing that they had more songs in their album which gained traction and at the same time had a high re-playability factor.\n<br>\n4. Finally we see artists like Justin Bieber and Bad Bunny who do not feature in top 5 of tracks list but evidently have a lot of songs that did chart.\n","4b3b06d1":"### 3. Explore the chart positions of the top 5 tracks which were on the charts the longest.\nSo here we will see the chart position line graph for the top 5 tracks which were in top 30 the longest, and try to infer some conclusion. ","a9724f9b":"#### Conclusion\nSimilar to Olivia, we see that Justin Bieber's song Peaches, has stayed on the charts for 7 months and going. This can also be attributed to the fact that Peaches was a fan favorite and trending song on TikTok as well as Reels.\n<br><br>\nAn interesting observation from the above 2 charts was that, it was Justin Bieber's Peaches which dethroned Olivia Rodrigo's Drivers License!","b9d5dee6":"2.

Does rank also depend on the duration of each song?\nHow does the duration of a song affect its standing in the charts? Are all songs which reach top spots are those in a particular duration frame? ","bc322086":"### Conclusion \nInitial observation here was to see which tracks dethrone which from the top spot, as well as determine for how long they reign over the charts. But we are greeted by another interesting and unintuitive observation!\n\n### Unituitive Observation:\nWe can see here songs like Blinding Lights and Levitating both at the 1,2 highest time on charts respectively. But we can see that though they have been on the charts the longest. They never once got into the top-3 of the charts. \n<br>\nMajor shock comes from Levitating which has been on the charts for every single week for 10 months straight and still never broke to the top 5 of the charts. \n<br><br>\nA possible factor to it can be the song always being in competition with other songs and never really ever being able to compete well enough to overcome them. \n<br>\nWe see that it reaches the 4th position months after its release! Which also in quite unintuitive because most songs usually reach the top of the charts when it is released and then progressively move down the ranks. \n<br>\nA possible explanation can again be explained by the trend setters of social media, like TikTok and Reels.","ff55bbcc":"1.

Meaning many songs in the top position are also those on the later positions. \n<br>\nBut we can still draw inference that 3-4 mins is the sweet spot for songs to be on the top of the chart. \n<br>\nAs we go down the charts the we see that all songs from 2~4 mins are still appreciated.\n<br><br>\nWe can therefore somewhat say that below 4 minutes is the essential time duration for a song to not be too much for the listeners. \n<br><br>\nInfact only 2 songs in top 5 were significantly over the 4 mins mark.","f80ab893":"# EDA","1c88da46":"## <br>","41a093e4":"#### Conclusion <br>\nOlivia completely dominates the first position for several weeks with her 2 songs, \n<ol>\n<li>Drivers License<\/li>\n<li>Good 4 U<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nNot only that, many of her songs from her album have been in top-15. <br>\nInfact 10\/11 Songs have actually been in the top 15. \n<br><br>\nAnother interesting factor we notice is that, her songs remain on the charts for a very long time(8 months). \n<br>\nA possible factor could be that those songs are quite hit on social media platforms like tiktok and instagram reels and hence tend to be trending for long.","72ed6fa2":"### 2.
