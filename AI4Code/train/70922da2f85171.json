Run this cell.","7d61fa8d":"# Exercise Introduction\n\nThe cameraman who shot our deep learning videos mentioned a problem that we can solve with deep learning.  \n\nHe offers a service that scans photographs to store them digitally.  He uses a machine that quickly scans many photos. But depending on the orientation of the original photo, many images are digitized sideways.  He fixes these manually, looking at each photo to determine which ones to rotate.\n\nIn this exercise, you will build a model that distinguishes which photos are sideways and which are upright, so an app could automatically rotate each image if necessary.\n\nIf you were going to sell this service commercially, you might use a large dataset to train the model. But you'll have great success with even a small dataset.  You'll work with a small dataset of dog pictures, half of which are rotated sideways.\n\nSpecifying and compiling the model look the same as in the example you've seen. But you'll need to make some changes to fit the model.\n\n**Run the following cell to set up automatic feedback.**","f5b1ab79":"# 4) Fit Model\n\n**Your training data is in the directory `..\/input\/dogs-gone-sideways\/images\/train`. The validation data is in `..\/input\/dogs-gone-sideways\/images\/val`**. Use that information when setting up `train_generator` and `validation_generator`.\n\nYou have 220 images of training data and 217 of validation data.  For the training generator, we set a batch size of 10. Figure out the appropriate value of `steps_per_epoch` in your `fit_generator` call.","13de646b":"That ran nearly instantaneously.  Deep learning models have a reputation for being computationally demanding.  Why did that run so quickly?\n\nAfter thinking about this, check your answer by uncommenting the cell below.","4fd38bc0":"# 3) Review the Compile Step\nYou provided three arguments in the compile step.  \n- optimizer\n- loss\n- metrics\n\nWhich arguments could affect the accuracy of the predictions that come out of the model?  After you have your answer, run the cell below to see the solution.","8abf0a39":"Any suggestions are most welcome!!","e3567736":"# 1) Specify the Model\n\nSince this is your first time, we'll provide some starter code for you to modify. You will probably copy and modify code the first few times you work on your own projects.\n\nThere are some important parts left blank in the following code."}}
