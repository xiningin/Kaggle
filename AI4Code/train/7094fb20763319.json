But Python has many more functions, and defining your own functions is a big part of python programming.\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn more about using and defining functions.","c04be338":"Python evaluates an expression like this from the inside out. First it calculates the value of `round(-2.01)`, then it provides help on the output of that expression.\n\n<small>(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers! After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the help output above will make more sense.)<\/small>\n\n`round` is a very simple function with a short docstring. `help` shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like `print`. Don't worry if the following output looks inscrutable... for now, just see if you can pick anything new out from this help.","be1b29cc":"Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:","24f82906":"# Your Turn\n\nFunctions open up a whole new world in Python programming. **[Try using them yourself](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/1275158)**.","6b0337f9":"The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. When we call `help()` on a function, it shows the docstring.","ec7768b9":"Good programmers use docstrings unless they expect to throw away the code soon after it's used (which is rare).  So, you should start writing docstrings, too!","f0e8faeb":"## Functions Applied to Functions\n\nHere's something that's powerful, though it can feel very abstract at first.  You can supply functions as arguments to other functions.  Some example may make this clearer:","070ee067":"## Default arguments\n\nWhen we called `help(print)`, we saw that the `print` function has several optional arguments. For example, we can specify a value for `sep` to put some special string in between our printed arguments:","a1e4ade4":"## Defining functions\n\nBuiltin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.","de57b0c0":"Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description. However, when I write a function, I can provide a description in what's called the **docstring**.\n\n### Docstrings","085d6b5b":"Functions that operate on other functions are called \"higher-order functions.\" You probably won't write your own for a little while. But there are higher-order functions built into Python that you might find useful to call. \n\nHere's an interesting example using the `max` function.\n\nBy default, `max` returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional `key` argument, it returns the argument `x` that maximizes `key(x)` (aka the 'argmax').","c8cf4259":"If you were looking for it, you might learn that print can take an argument called `sep`, and that this describes what we put between all the other arguments when we print them.","d58c9c31":"`help()` displays two things:\n\n1. the header of that function `round(number, ndigits=None)`. In this case, this tells us that `round()` takes an argument we can describe as `number`. Additionally, we can optionally give a separate argument which could be described as `ndigits`.\n2. A brief English description of what the function does. ","61cc0f7c":"Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of \"null\" in other languages.)\n\nWithout a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.","ef7ca318":"## Functions that don't return\n\nWhat would happen if we didn't include the `return` keyword in our function?","e666e225":"> **Aside:**\n> The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The `>>>` is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example, see [this docstring for the numpy function `np.eye`](https:\/\/github.com\/numpy\/numpy\/blob\/v1.14.2\/numpy\/lib\/twodim_base.py#L140-L194).","32d36e22":"But if we don't specify a value, `sep` is treated as having a default value of `' '` (a single space).","373b3b92":"Or maybe the `help()` function can tell us something about it.","b25505de":"**Common pitfall:** when you're looking up a function, remember to pass in the name of the function itself, and not the result of calling that function. \n\nWhat happens if we invoke help on a *call* to the function `round()`? Unhide the output of the cell below to see.","e3389bb9":"# Getting Help\n\nYou saw the `abs` function in the previous tutorial, but what if you've forgotten what it does?\n\nThe `help()` function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn. If you can remember how to use `help()`, you hold the key to understanding most other functions.\n\nHere is an example:","163843f3":"This creates a function called `least_difference`, which takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\nFunctions start with a header introduced by the `def` keyword. The indented block of code following the `:` is run when the function is called.\n\n`return` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.\n\nIs it clear what `least_difference()` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:"}}
