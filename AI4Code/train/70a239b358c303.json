any insights.","2b33cbf7":"This shows how both the crisis overlap leading to confirming our assumption that systemic crisis has an impact on banking crisis.\n\n## Exchange Rates Over The Years\n\nCurrency values fluctuate depending on several factors including a nation's economic activity and growth prospects, interest rates, and geopolitical risk. When currencies fluctuate wildly, they can create economic uncertainty and instability, affecting capital flows and international trade. The value of the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market is an important instrument in a central bank\u2019s toolkit, as well as a key consideration when it sets monetary policy. Directly or indirectly, currency levels affect a number of key economic variables.\n\nKeeping this in mind, let's visualize the exchange rate of the country vis-a-vis the USD . ","0ef7ea82":"What we see is that these countries faced fluctuating currency crisis even before they were hit with a banking crisis. For example look at Zimbabwe's currency crisis spread. This country faced a currency crisis on and off for around 10 years in total before it faced a banking crisis. ","05774c9e":"## Reading Data","bf7a66fc":"Again, like currency crisis, we see that the countries had an inflation crisis, despite not being hit by a banking crisis. \nInflation can be viewed positively or negatively depending on the individual viewpoint.\nThose with tangible assets, like property or stocked commodities, may like to see some inflation as that raises the value of their assets.\nPeople holding cash may not like inflation, as it erodes the value of their cash holdings.\nIdeally, an optimum level of inflation is required to promote spending to a certain extent instead of saving, thereby nurturing economic growth.","bc27aa8f":"The country that shows the highest count for systemic crisis is Central African Republic followed by Zimbabwe and Kenya.\nAs per the definition of systemic crisis, there should be a link between systemic crisis and banking crisis. Lets check if these countries had a banking crisis at the same time.","69f215d4":"## Systemic Crisis \n\nA systemic crisis is a domino effect in which a financial trouble spreads. between institutions and markets until it affects the whole monetary. and financial system with dire global economic consequences","33a53f95":"## Resources:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/econresdata\/ifdp\/2015\/files\/ifdp1153.pdf\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w5209.pdf","7b649a9c":"## Sovereign Domestic Debt Default\n\nSovereign debt is a central government's debt. It is debt issued by the national government in a foreign currency in order to finance the issuing country's growth and development.\n\nSovereign debt is usually created by borrowing government bonds and bills and issuing securities. Countries that are less creditworthy compared to others directly borrow from world organizations like The World Bank and other international financial institutions. An unfavorable change in exchange rates and an overly optimistic valuation of the payback from the projects financed by the debt can make it difficult for countries to repay sovereign debt.\n\nThe most important risk in sovereign debt is the risk of default by the issuing country. For this reason, countries with stable economies and political systems are considered to be less of a default risk in comparison to countries with a history of instability\n\nSovereign Domestic Debt is a debt owed to lenders who are within the country.","92caef1d":"## Inflation Crisis\n\nAs prices rise, a single unit of currency loses value as it buys fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power impacts the general cost of living for the common public which ultimately leads to a deceleration in economic growth. \n\nInflation is a quantitative measure of the rate at which the average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy increases over a period of time. It is the constant rise in the general level of prices where a unit of currency buys less than it did in prior periods. \n\nLet's look at the countries that were accounted for an inflation crisis","7041ba70":"This shows that the three countries default on external debt, despite not having a banking crisis as a premise. Even without the banking crisis they are marked to default on external debt.\n\n## Currency Crisis\n\nA currency crisis involves the sudden and steep decline in the value of a nation's currency, which causes negative ripple effects throughout the economy. It is the devaluation in a nation's currency matched by volatile markets and a lack of faith in the nation's economy. A currency crisis is sometimes predictable and is often sudden. It may be precipitated by governments, investors, central banks, or any combination of actors. But the result is always the same: The negative outlook causes wide-scale economic damage and a loss of capital.\n\nLet's take a look at the countries who were reported to have faced a currency crisis","e722c317":"This shows that during the times these two coutries faced a banking crisis, they also defaulted on the sovereign debts.\nFor example, for Angola, somewhere around late 1970's despite not having a banking crisis, the country defaulted for domestic default but quickly came back from it. After that, it was only around the begining of 1990, we see that a banking crisis, eventually lead the country to default again. Similarly, for Zimbabwe the country was already facing a banking crisis which eventually led it to default on domestic debts.\n\n## Sovereign External Debt Default\n\nExternal debt is the portion of a country's debt that was borrowed from foreign lenders, including commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions. These loans, including interest, must usually be paid in the currency in which the loan was made. To earn the needed currency, the borrowing country may sell and export goods to the lender's country.\n\nA debt crisis can occur if a country with a weak economy is not able to repay the external debt due to the inability to produce and sell goods and make a profitable return. \n\nIf a nation is unable or refuses to repay its external debt, it is said to be in a sovereign default. This can lead to the lenders withholding future releases of assets that might be needed by the borrowing nation. Such instances can have a rolling effect, wherein the borrower\u2019s currency collapses and that nation\u2019s overall economic growth is stalled.","b816bf9d":"We see only Angola and Zimbabwe defaulting. Let's take a look at a few other things for these two countries in particular","a2a35824":"## Importing Relevant Libraries","614598fb":"# Understanding Financial Crisis in Africa\n\nThe purpose of this notebook is not to come up with a model for predictions. This notebook is solely  EDA with a lot of theory. I find EDA to be one of the most interesting ways of understanding any domain. \nI am no expert in Economics, but with my limited understanding and ofcourse with all the help on the internet, I'll be exploring the features given in the dataset and if and whether they help in our understanding of the happenings\/warning signs of foreseeing a banking crisis or any financial crisis in a country.\n\nAt the end of the notebook are the resources I've taken information on. \nHope this helps!
