Here's your coding interview problem for today.\n\nThis problem was asked by Facebook.\n\nWrite a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] rotated by two becomes [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]. Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?"}}
