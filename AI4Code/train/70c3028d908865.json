They apply the model to an image at multiple locations and scales. High scoring regions of the image are considered detections.\n\nYolo use a totally different approach. It apply a single neural network to the full image. This network divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.\n\n<img src='https:\/\/pjreddie.com\/media\/image\/sayit.jpg' height=300 width=350\/>\n\n__YOLO model__ has several advantages over classifier-based systems. It looks at the whole image at test time so its predictions are informed by global context in the image. It also makes predictions with a single network evaluation unlike systems like ```R-CNN which require thousands for a single image```. This makes it extremely fast, more than __1000x faster than R-CNN and 100x faster than Fast R-CNN__. \n\n- See the paper of [YOLOv3(version 3)](https:\/\/pjreddie.com\/media\/files\/papers\/YOLOv3.pdf) for more details on the full system.","9d45b027":"## Note: \n\nI know this model is not accuractly detecting all wheat heads but when you trained for more epochs it will give better results. \n\n- Here i choose very less number of epochs to showcase all the thing to you how things are really working with  YOLOv5.\n\n- Do you guys want saved weight for a YOLOv5 model which i trained for around 5 hours if so let me know in the comment section. \n\n## <center>Hope you like it..........<\/center>","9ca0a957":"Output image like this\n\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/AIVenture0\/Global-Wheat-Detection-kaggle-challenge\/master\/wheat2.jpg\" height=300 width=550\/>","4b873b27":"# What has inspired me to write this notebook?\n\n- Since the time i participated in Global [Wheat Detection](kaggle.com\/c\/global-wheat-detection) challenge which is about ```Identify wheat heads using image analysis```.One Algorithms\/Model @YOLOv5 stand out among other models.
