(the lips that surround the vagina), with or without removal of the labia majora (the larger outer lips)\n\ntype 3 (infibulation) \u2013 narrowing the vaginal opening by creating a seal, formed by cutting and repositioning the labia.\n\nOther harmful procedures to the female genitals, including pricking, piercing, cutting, scraping or burning the area.\n\nFGM is often performed by traditional circumcisers or cutters who do not have any medical training. But in some countries it may be done by a medical professional.\n\nAnaesthetics and antiseptics are not generally used, and FGM is often carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades.\n\nFGM often happens against a girl's will without her consent, and girls may have to be forcibly restrained.https:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/conditions\/female-genital-mutilation-fgm\/","f23a3371":"#SOMALIA (2006); GUINEA (2012); SUDAN (2014) Female Genital Mutilation Prevalence by year.
