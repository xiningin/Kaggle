However, there are also certain females who have had no formal education past high school. Inspite of this, they took the survey is a commnedable thing. They should be encouraged to complete their education either full time or through part time courses. Also, the number of Master's qualification in India and US is way high than other countries.","01435652":"***An analysis of the 2019 Kaggle ML and DS Survey for Women's Representation in Machine Learning and Data Science ***\n** Gonna work on it **\n\n![](https:\/\/imgur.com\/FZS0gSi.png)\n\nIn the last few years, a lot of effort is being made in society to increase women's representation in the tech world. The idea behind these efforts is that attracting and retaining more women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will ultimately enhance innovation and creativity. Also, it is important to note here that when women are not involved in these fields, experiences, needs, and desires that are unique to women may be overlooked. Thus, our voices will only be heard when we have decent participation in society.\u00a0\nThe iconic photograph of **Katie Bowman in 2019**, watching the black hole's first photograph as it was being reconstructed, has inspired a lot of women.\n\n![](https:\/\/inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com\/images\/sizes\/katieboumanfacebookmain_resize_md.jpg)\n\nSimilarly, women like Grace Hopper, Marie Curie, Margaret Hamilton, and many other immensely talented females have been continuously regarded as idols and icons by many. They have time and again inspired us to follow our passions and do something incredible. And it's not like women haven't been making significant contributions to IT for decades. Still, women are substantially represented in STEM fields.\nA lot of companies today are coming forward to change the world of work. This year, even the United Nations celebrated International Women's Day under the official theme **#BalanceforBetter**, advocating a more gender-balanced world.\n\n### So,have we achieved parity. Are things improving?\nThe 2019 Kaggle ML & DS survey is an excellent place to start. Let's use our analysis skills to investigate whether things seem to be actually improving or is still much left to be done. Let the numbers speak for themselves.\n\n# What is the annual Kaggle\u00a0survey\n\nKaggle annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey is in its third year now. This year, as in [2017](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaggle\/kaggle-survey-2017) and [2018](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaggle\/kaggle-survey-2018\/), Kaggle has conducted an industry-wide survey that presents a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The Survey Challenges from 2017 and 2018 were very informative, and so is expected out of the 2019 survey also.\n\n# Objective\nThe objective of this notebook to analyze the survey data to answer an important question: is the women participation in STEM really improving or is it just a hype?\n\n# Methodology\nThis notebook will only focus on the women in ML and DS, thereby analyzing the answers of the female respondents solely. The analysis will be done in two steps:\n\n* Step 1 will comprise of the analysis of the 2019 Kaggle DS & ML survey for Female respondents.\n* Step 2 shall consist of the comparisons of the results in the 2019 study with the previous two surveys. This will present a better picture and will show whether are things are improving or not.\n\nIn this notebook, we shall analyze the female participation in the survey under 5 different categories, namely:\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*US4fqDrQqfEMfFm_MSxWkg.png)\n\n* Demographics\n* Education\u00a0\n* Professional Experience\u00a0\n* Job Role\n* Salary","1c219fe4":"Again, most of the respondents have the title of student, which could comprise both Undergraduate and Postgraduate level. This is closely followed by women in Data Scientist role. Interestingly, there are also women who are not employed but have responded to the survey. These women could not be working by choice or may be looking for jobs. We could connect to these women to understand if they are willing to work and could assist them in the same.","9fa190a6":"## Comparison of number of respondents w.r.t the previous surveys\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*lQOxGmQA8cNq73oErNqB-Q.png)\n\n","4ea35c13":"The young brigade is setting a good example.It seems Girls in 20s and early 30s are really gearing up to better the gender ration in the industry. What is also heartening is that there are also females respondents who are greater than 60 and 70 years of age. These women are definitely an inspiration for others.","f6889adc":"## 1.2 Daunting obstacles remain in Africa\n\nWhereas it is heartening to see that majority of the females respondents are from India.
