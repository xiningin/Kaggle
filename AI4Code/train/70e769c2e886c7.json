Using mathematical modeling, the authors reassess events during the Holocaust that led to the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto (1941\u20131942), with the eventual goal of deliberately killing ~450,000, mostly Jewish residents, many through widespread starvation and a large-scale typhus epidemic.\"\n\n\"The Nazis justified genocide supposedly to control the spread of disease. This exemplifies humanity\u2019s ability to turn upon itself, based on racially guided epidemiological principles, merely because of the appearance of a bacterium. Deadly disease and starvation dynamics are explored using modeling and the maths of food ration cards. Strangely, the epidemic was curtailed and was brought to a sudden halt before winter, when typhus normally accelerates. A far more massive epidemic outbreak was prevented through the antiepidemic efforts by the often considered incompetent and corrupt ghetto leadership and the Herculean efforts of ghetto doctors.\"","4ddae732":"#Typhus less contagious, but deadlier, than COVID-19.

It is less contagious, but deadlier, than COVID-19.\n\nWhile the two diseases spread and behave differently, the researchers said that there are still parallels between them and lessons that can be learnt in the present.\n\nWhat happened in the Warsaw Ghetto a microcosm of COVID-19 days, or rather like a parallel universe, at least in terms of contagion and its outcomes.\n\nThe methods perfected by infectious disease experts from centuries of dealing with these pandemic-like events are our best defence.\nhttps:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-8557607\/Social-distancing-explain-tens-thousands-survived-typhus-outbreak-Warsaw-Ghetto.html","24be45ea":"#Social distancing rather than a 'miracle', By Ian Randall for Mailonline. \nPublished: 19:00 BST, 24 July 2020\n\n\"That may explain how tens of thousands of Jews survived a typhus outbreak in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. High population density and squalid conditions were ideal for typhus to spread. However, the Jewish population used various measures to combat the disease.\"\n\n\"These included quarantines, lectures on safety and a secret medical university. Social distancing, while unenforced, was seen as 'basic common sense by all'. Researchers modelled how the disease would have spread without such action.\"\n\n\"They found that it would have engulfed two\u2013three times the number of victims. The population in the Ghetto was so high that an average of 9.2 people occupied each individual room \u2014 a density up to ten times higher than in any city today. Between this and its squalid conditions, experts have said that the enclosure presented the 'perfect breeding ground' for the typhus bacteria to spread.\"\n\n\"Overall, it is estimated that as many as 120,00 people in the Ghetto were infected by the fever in 1941 \u2014 with some 30,000 Jews ultimately dying from the infection alone. Come October of that year, however \u2014 just as the outbreak was expected to intensify as the winter set in \u2014 the epidemic suddenly petered out.\"\n\n\"This 'inexplicable' turn of events went on to be hailed by the survivors as a miracle.\" \nhttps:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-8557607\/Social-distancing-explain-tens-thousands-survived-typhus-outbreak-Warsaw-Ghetto.html","ae0722be":"#Social distancing and community health programmes likely ended the outbreak\n\nUsing state-of-the-art mathematical modelling and historical documents, experts led from Israel's Tel Aviv University have concluded that a combination of social distancing and community health programmes likely ended the outbreak.\n\nThe findings, the team said, underscore the 'critical' importance of the active cooperation of local communities in efforts to defeat epidemics and pandemics \u2014 including COVID-19 \u2014 rather than relying solely on government regulations.\n\nThe research (DOI: 10.1126\/sciadv.abc0927)found evidence of well-organised training courses covering public hygiene and infectious diseases, along with hundreds of public lectures on fighting typhus and an underground university for young medical students.\n\nHygiene and apartment cleanliness were encouraged and sometimes enforced, while social distancing was considered as being basic common sense and home quarantining was not an uncommon practice.https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-8557607\/Social-distancing-explain-tens-thousands-survived-typhus-outbreak-Warsaw-Ghetto.html","58bff294":"#Codes from Paul Mooney https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/paultimothymooney\/what-is-inside-of-the-mueller-report\/notebook","e7d5a622":"#Extraordinary curtailment of massive typhus epidemic in the Warsaw Ghetto (DOI: 10.1126\/sciadv.abc0927)\n\n![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTmU9sbJeM1aI6eK7W-GhwvIqioLbtpSgSF3LB4O3l6tErJayq_kVrGDzelZ4s6SNWJNp_aSaLphgcdKOdqoE_aUCy22cT47932dA&usqp=CAU&ec=45702845)timnovate.wordpress.com"}}
