concentrated \u201csyrup\u201d and Final Step of diluting\/filling\/labeling\/testing\/distributing. \n\nComparing to a soft drink factory, the production of a vaccine can be divided into two stages: first the manufacture of the concentrated \u201csyrup\u201d, then the final step of diluting, filling, labeling, testing and distributing. \n\nThe 220 million doses guaranteed so far in Brazil will go through formulation and packaging, which is far from simple because it involves a product sensitive, for example, to temperature variation. \u201cThe final processing of a vaccine can be as complex as the production of the IFA raw material itself\u201d, says Krieger, from Fiocruz.\n\nOnce this stage of filling is over, Brazil will learn to produce the raw material for the two vaccines. Fiocruz and Butantan promise to dominate this process in 12 months. However, it would be an unprecedented feat in Brazil, given that the two laboratories took an average of 10 years to assimilate the technology of other vaccines. \n\nToday, Fiocruz participates in the transfer of technology for the development of rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines. These partnerships started in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and have not yet been concluded. At the Butantan Institute, the agreement to produce the flu vaccine started in 1999 and was only concluded in 2013. \"The transfer of technology is not as fast as we would like, but it depends on the interest of the parties involved\", says Homma.\n\n\n#Innovative technology never applied commercially\n\nThe Oxford vaccine brings an extra difficulty: it uses innovative technology never applied commercially, which can bring challenges that factories are unaware of. \u201cThe production of this type of vaccine is carried out today by universities and research laboratories, but nothing on a large scale\u201d, says biomedical researcher Diego Moura Tanajura, professor at the Federal University of Sergipe.\nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/reporterbrasil.org.br\/2020\/08\/vacina-da-covid-19-em-janeiro-saiba-o-que-pode-atrasar-a-producao-no-brasil\/&prev=search&pto=aue","fc3c30f1":"\"Our final processing plants are at the top of capacity,\u201d said Akira Homma, scientific advisor and former president of Fiocruz, in an interview with Rep\u00f3rter Brasil in February, before the pandemic. \n\nThis happened due to the various vaccines incorporated in recent years at Fiocruz (such as rotavirus, pneumococcal and tetraviral). In addition, yellow fever and measles vaccines have increased production due to the recent disease outbreaks in S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\nMarco Krieger, Vice President of Production and Innovation in Health at Fiocruz, says that the problems have been solved with the extension of work shifts, and that Fiocruz will be able to process 40 million monthly doses of the Oxford vaccine \u201cwithout compromising any other projects.\"\n\nIn the case of Butantan, the adaptation of the factory for the filling of the Chinese vaccine will be simpler, since it is a technology dominated by the institute. \"Butantan has a productive structure that is not adapted for this vaccine from Covid-19, so it needs to be adapted for large-scale production, \"\n\nThe greatest difficulty for the institute will be to renovate the factory to produce the raw material. The expectation is to spend R $ 130 million on the project from private donations, but the funds have not yet arrived. \nhttps:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/reporterbrasil.org.br\/2020\/08\/vacina-da-covid-19-em-janeiro-saiba-o-que-pode-atrasar-a-producao-no-brasil\/&prev=search&pto=aue","cdae333e":"#The 5 Stages of COVID-19 Vaccine Development, by Hallie Levine\n\nPRECLINICAL STAGE: HOW WILL THIS VACCINE WORK?\n\nThis research-intensive stage is designed to find natural or synthetic antigens\u2014foreign substances that induce an immune reaction in your body\u2014that trigger the same reaction an actual virus or bacteria would. Identifying the right antigen or antigens can often take up to four years.\n\nPHASES 1\/2A AND 2B: IS IT SAFE, AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT DOSE?\n\nPhase 1 testing marks the first time the vaccine is tested in a small group of adults, usually between 20 to 80 people, to evaluate its safety and measure the immune response it generates. Phase 2a studies aim to determine the most effective dose, and expand the safety experience with the vaccine.\n\nPHASE 3: HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE VACCINE?\n\nIn this stage of the clinical trial, even more volunteers receive the vaccine to study whether it's effective.\nBefore volunteers are vaccinated, they will be tested to make sure they currently do not have the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Half of the group will be assigned to receive the vaccine; the other half will receive a placebo. Then they will all be followed closely for up to two years to see if they do develop COVID-19-related symptoms, such as fever, headache, shortness of breath, dry cough or gastrointestinal distress.\n\nIt may be that some people do go on to develop COVID-19, even after having been vaccinated, but they may have substantially milder symptoms than those who develop COVID-19 in a control group.\n\nREGULATORY APPROVAL AND LICENSURE: IS IT READY FOR THE WORLD?\n\nAfter a successful Phase 3 trial, vaccine manufacturers submit an application to regulatory bodies such as the European Commission or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). At this stage, clinical trial data is reviewed to make sure the vaccine is safe and effective.\n\nPHASE 4: WILL IT STAY SAFE DOWN THE ROAD?\n\nEven after the vaccine is approved and licensed, regulatory agencies stay involved, continuing to monitor production; inspecting manufacturing facilities; and testing vaccines for potency, safety and purity.\nhttps:\/\/www.jnj.com\/innovation\/the-5-stages-of-covid-19-vaccine-development-what-you-need-to-know-about-how-a-clinical-trial-works","52d8e37c":"#What can delay production in Brazil, by Diego Junqueira \n\nOne of the most complicated parts is production, \u201cPharmaceutical companies want to get this product to market quickly. Their forecast is ultra-optimistic \u201d, says Ricardo Gazzinelli (researcher at Fiocruz Minas and coordinator of the National Institute of Science and Technology for Vaccines), who heads the study of a Brazilian vaccine for covid-19 - and has no involvement with the Oxford project.\n\nWhen a vaccine is approved, there will be a demand for all inputs for many places in the world. Will there be enough inputs to produce all the necessary vaccine?\n\nBRAZILIAN FACTORIES WILL HAVE TO BE ADAPTED\n\nBoth Fiocruz and Butantan need to renovate their factories not only to fill covid-19 vaccines, but mainly for the production of the raw material.

However, this chapter also identifies seven other SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) strongly related to vaccines and six additional SDGs related to vaccines, leading to a total of 14 vaccine-related goals in 17 SDGs.\n\nTwo of these goals are related to innovation and technological development of vaccines (SDG9 and SDG17). The authors examine vaccine performance indicators and current technological and regulatory obstacles to achieve these goals, particularly affecting developing countries, and propose STI governance strategies to overcome these gaps and increase access to vaccines. Policy recommendations for vaccine funding and incentives for innovation, development, and vaccine production are made. Recommendations are also given for specific vaccine STI (Sexually transmitted infections) performance indicators and strategies to achieve the 14 vaccine-related SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/343763444_Vaccine_Innovation_and_Global_Sustainability_Governance_Challenges_for_Sustainable_Development_Goals","d1b48d56":"#The time it will take to get the vaccine out and reach everyone is \"the time for patience\"\n\nThe time it will take to get the vaccine out and reach everyone is \"the time for patience\".

Its immediate pretext was a law that made vaccination against smallpox mandatory , but it is also associated with deeper causes, such as the urban reforms being carried out by Mayor Pereira Passos and the sanitation campaigns led by doctor Oswaldo Cruz .\n\nOswaldo Cruz, who took over the General Directorate of Public Health in 1903, was responsible for the city's sanitation campaign, which aimed to eradicate yellow fever, bubonic plague and smallpox. To this end, in June 1904, the government made a proposal for a law that made vaccination of the population mandatory. The law sparked heated debates between lawmakers and the population, and despite the strong opposition campaign, it was passed on. \n\nThe trigger of the revolt was the publication of a project to regulate the application of the mandatory vaccine in the newspaper A Not\u00edcias , on January 9, 1904.\n\nOn November 16, a state of siege and the suspension of mandatory vaccination was declared . Given the systematic and extinct repression of the triggering cause, the movement was ebbing. In the repression that followed the revolt, the police forces arrested a number of suspects and individuals considered disorderly, whether they were related to the revolt or not. The total balance was 945 people imprisoned on Ilha das Cobras , 30 dead, 110 injured and 461 deported to the state of Acre . https:\/\/translate.google.com.br\/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https:\/\/pt.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Revolta_da_Vacina&prev=search&pto=aue\n\n![](https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-KqXI33x9tmk\/XEeqOl_82VI\/AAAAAAAAXCQ\/x5IoyAaf1dk5oD9TvMp7iZ_uUdyVEB_UwCLcBGAs\/s640\/charge%2Brevolta%2Bda%2Bvacina%2B7.PNG)suportegeografico77.blogspot.com","87edbd4e":"#Not very helping.

Despite this, the S\u00e3o Paulo institute is unable to produce on a large scale all stages of coronavac (name of the Chinese vaccine). It is as if Butantan had the right oven but lacked an ingredient to make the complete recipe, in an analogy used by Covas . That missing ingredient is the raw material.\n\n#The longer Brazil takes to master all stages of production, the longer dependence on foreign companies will last. \n\nAnd that will make all the difference, because, in the case of the Oxford vaccine, the raw material will only be sold at cost while the pandemic declaration by the WHO lasts. China, on the other hand, has already declared that it will not charge royalties if the country finds a vaccine against covid-19 (the product will be considered a global public good). \n\nAlmost R 2 billion will be invested to enable the production of the Oxford vaccine in Brazil. About R 1.3 billion will be paid to Astrazeneca in exchange for the complete technology and raw material for the 100 million doses, according to the Ministry of Health - the multinational says it will receive a lower value, close to R 1 billion.\n\nNO REFUNDS IF THE VACCINE FAILS HUMAN TESTING.\n\nIt is a risky purchase. If the vaccine fails human testing, there will be no doses, and the money will not be returned.

It will be necessary to ensure ample vaccine coverage and caution in the assessment of safety,  the most. \n\n\nTHE FAST-TRACK PROCESS\n\nThe fast-track process is necessary due to the urgency of the pandemic. But we will not have all the important information with this acceleration. The approval for the emergency use of vaccines responds to the anomalous situation that we live in, but caution is needed with the safety assessment.\n\nEfficacy results can be evaluated in a shorter time, using statistical instruments and comparing results in vaccinated and non-vaccinated people. The same is valid for safety data that refer to mild events, such as fever, pain located in the place of inoculation and tiredness. But this is not the case for rare events, which can be more serious and only become apparent with a much larger number of people vaccinated.\n\nFor this, there is stage four of vaccine development, when pharmacovigilance is carried out. For example, 10 million people are vaccinated, evaluated in a certain period of time. This is necessary because such effects, if any, will be detectable. We also do not know the duration of the immunity conferred. That is why vaccines, even if approved on an emergency basis, will continue to be evaluated.\n\nVaccines are among humanity's greatest achievements, but they are not trivial to develop. That is why there are so few. But so much money has never been invested, so much research has been done and there has been so much involvement by governments and institutions.
