These are Forward and Backward Propagations. From left to right, we call it \"Forward Propagation\", and from right to left we call it \"Backward Propagation\". At first we multiply our each feature with its weight value and add a bias value to it. After doing that, we obtain the 'z' and we put it to a function called \"Sigmoid function\". After this process, we simply get the label value but it's not that easy. We do these steps until our cost value -which is obtained by the sum of all loss values -is close to zero. In order to update our weight and bias, we apply backward propagation steps. From there, we just take the derivative of cost function for each step and substract it from the current bias and weight values.
