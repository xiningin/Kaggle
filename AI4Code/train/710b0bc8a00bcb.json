As a data sientist, I would suggest 'HELP' to use their funds by focusing more on the countries which belong to the cluster named, 'Under-developed countries', where demography-wise need is the highest for - public health infrastructure, better life expectancy and lesser rate of infant\/child mortality\n2. Countries that suffer economically, such economic condition indicators can be like - low net income\/person or low GDP\/capita\n3. Focus on such countries where trading is not balanced in terms of service\/products both. Low export indicates lower production, this trade deficit can harm a nation's economy.

And the minimum GDPP is as low as 231\n- By looking at the import\/export data it is visible that there is a huge gap between the import-export data. Such countries are importing much more than exporting. So, production in such countries are very low.
