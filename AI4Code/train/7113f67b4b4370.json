You will be making a quiz similar to this. You may choose your topic. It might look something like this:\n\n```\nI will tell you where to go on vacation!\n\nWhat kind of weather do you like? (warm, cold, neutral)\nwarm\n\nWhat language do you want to speak on vacation? (English, Spanish, French)\nEnglish\n\nCan you afford a flight overseas? (yes, no)\nno\n\nYou are going on vacation to Richmond, Virginia!\n```\n\n\n**Option 2: Choose your own adventure**\n\nYou may have to google \"choose your own adventure\" to see how it works, or check with your peers around you. It might look something like this:\n```\nThere are three doors in front of you, which do you go through? (type door 1, door 2, or door 3)\ndoor 1\n\nBehind door 1 is a lion. What do you do? (fight it, run away, accept death)\nfight it\n\nYou fought it and survived! You lost a leg though.\n```\n\n\n**Want to make it better?**\n* add questions, options, or results\n* make it so that a user can enter multiple versions (\"yes\" and \"Yes\" both work)\n* add a mini game to it!\n* anything else!\n","5c29fec7":"### Rubric","0c6f1b70":"write my conditional tree and map out how put all of the questions into the code.\nUse Software devoplement life style to plan code.\nlook at notes if need help,\nafter done making the conditional tree put it in code.\nwrite 5 places.","df6d9aec":"# Code","6d0923c0":"Ankith","d45dbcd3":"Here, write a 1 paragraph reflection answering the following questions:\nThe hardest part of the code was to know what questions to write and on how to write the code.
