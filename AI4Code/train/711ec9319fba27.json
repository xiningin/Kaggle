Area Number of Rooms'**: Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city\n* **'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms'**: Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city\n* **'Area Population'**: Population of city hou se is located in\n* **'Price'**: Price that the house sold at\n* **'Address'**: Address for the house","bb1c30ad":"## Q.
