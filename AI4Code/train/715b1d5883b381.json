Understanding the Competition\nThis competition is part of the NFL\u2019s annual 1st and Future Competition, which has been designed to spur innovation in athlete safety and performance.\n\nThe NFL is actively addressing the need for a computer vision system to detect on-field helmet impacts as part of the \u201cDigital Athlete\u201d platform, and the league is calling on Kagglers to help.\n\nIn this competition, it is expected to develop a computer vision model that automatically detects helmet impacts that occur on the field. The dataset is of more than one thousand definitive head impacts from thousands of game images, labelled video from the sidelines and end zones, and player tracking data.\n\nThe data also documents the position, speed, acceleration, and orientation for every player on the field during NFL games.\n\nThis competition is evaluated using a micro F1 score at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.35.\n\n","95435e55":"120 unique videos that comprise of two views of one game play each.\nTherefore, 60 gameplays with two views of each.","130a774a":"# 4.

It has been associated with helmet and helmet impact labels, which has to be used for building a helmet impact detection system.\n\n* **Tracking Data:**\n    Tracking data consists of tracking for all players in the provided 60 plays.\n\n\n### Data files:\n\n* **train_labels.csv** - Helmet tracking and collision labels for the training set.\n* **sample_submission.csv** - A valid sample submission file.\n* **image_labels.csv** - contains the bounding boxes corresponding to the images.\n* **[train\/test]_player_tracking.csv** - Each player wears a sensor that allows us to precisely locate them on the field.\n\n\n\n### Folders:\n* **\/train\/** contains the mp4 video files for the training plays. \n  (Both an endzone and sideline view.)\n    \n* **\/test\/** contains the videos for the test set. \n    \n* **\/images\/** contains the additional annotated images of player helmets."}}
