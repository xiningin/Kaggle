Below are the tutorials that I'm using because I'm still bad at coding: \n\n* [Visualising Data with Bokeh and Pandas](https:\/\/programminghistorian.org\/en\/lessons\/visualizing-with-bokeh)\n* [A Complete Guide to an Interactive Geographical Map using Python](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/a-complete-guide-to-an-interactive-geographical-map-using-python-f4c5197e23e0)\n* [Bookeh Documentation (which is great!)](https:\/\/docs.bokeh.org\/en\/latest\/docs\/user_guide\/quickstart.html)\n\nI'll leave in some of my mistakes so that beginners like me can understand where my frustrations are so that they know they're not alone in finding this difficult! \n\n[66 days of data - data viz project notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ojlovespigs\/data-viz-project-66daysofdata) (this is the first one I did!)","a262b811":"To explain a lot of the mess that was above -- I was trying to make the countries the x axis but it simply never worked. All of the tutorials I looked at seemed to make sense until I put it into practice... \n\n... They worked on the assumption that both axes would be numerical data. I was using \"categorical data\" (names of countries). So I never received an error message, nor did I recieve anything useful. \n\nIn order to handle categorical data, I'd need to use \"x_range\" in the figure() object in order for it to be registered. I think NOW I can add interactivity. \n\nNo one told me no error message can be worse than an error message. **NO ONE.**\n\nI'll add the interactivity as a different cell so that it isn't so confusing.
