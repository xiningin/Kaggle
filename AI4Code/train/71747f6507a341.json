This is also directed towards the students to make it the part of their online portfolio and show it to prospective employers.\n\n##**Scenario**\nCyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company\u2019s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Cyclistic finance analysts have found that the annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Now the marketing team is aimed at converting casual riders to annual members. But in order to do so, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ and what can be done in order to achieve their goal.\n\n##**Business Task**\nThe business task which is given to me is, how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\n##**Data Sources**\nThe data has been provided by Motivate International Inc. under this license. Data is a collection of 12 months bike trips data from June 2020 to May 2021. Size of the data is approximately 700mb which is difficult to work on in spreadsheet softwares as well as SQL. The most suitable option for this analysis is the use of R which can both handle this big data and also provide powerful visualizations too.","7ad10dbe":"**Key Findings**\nThe average use of rides stay the same for members through out the week.\nThe average use of rides is stay low during the week for casuals but become high during the weekends.\nThe average trip duration for casuals remain high at any day of the week where as it remains low but almost constant for the members during the week.\nThe no. of rides taken by casuals decrease significantly during the winters which is also true for the members but it decreases at a much lower rate for them.\nThe use of docked bike is much more than the classic bike and the electric bike for the members whereas the casuals use all of the bikes almost equally without a significant difference between any of them.\nadd Codeadd Markdown","b313e139":"Creating a .csv file for further use for analysis in Excel, Tableau or other tools.","db0c2001":"Data in the start_station_id & end_station_id columns of june20, july20, aug20, sep20, oct20, nov20 is inconsistent with the remaining dataframes because the data type in these columns is double where as data type in the similar columns of other dataframes is character. So in order to make data consistent we have to change the data type of doubles into characters as well. The reason for this and not the other way around is because if we convert characters into doubles then there may be a chance where the data will be truncated but if we convert doubles into characters then the data will not be harmed.","27de9041":"Reading and Assigning 12 Months Trip Data to new variables","0cb29944":"Now we have cleaned the data by removing rows which have faulty data so now we do not need those columns for Data Analysis.

This can mean that the casuals use the rides mainly for recreational purposes whereas the members use it both for commuting to their work\/study places and also for recreation on weekends. Also the average usage of rides by the members stay the same through out the week whereas the average usage of rides by the casuals stay on the low during the week days while become high during the weekend.","4dacceda":"#**Cleanup and Inspection of Data***","f720c0e1":"The difference between the average ride duration of casuals and the members remains high through out the week. If we look at the average trip duration for members, it stays almost constant through out the week which can also mean that the members having access to the rides every day only use the rides for selected period of time daily whereas the casuals when rent the ride for any day, they spend a lot of time using the rides. It can also imply that the casuals who use the rides each day are mostly new customers otherwise they would go for a membership.","3cd12b48":"#**Combining the data into a single file**","88ddd4ad":"#**Descriptive Analysis**","44893b15":"##**End of case study**\n\nThankyou.","33a9bd6e":"**Loading important packages**","345229b2":"The number of rows before and after the merge of the data frames are equal which means that the data is merged successfully.","c50dee3e":"The number of rides for both the members as well as casuals show no particular pattern through out the year but one thing which can be concluded from the graph is that the no. of rides by the casual customers are low in quantity during the winters in the months of Jan, Feb, Mar as well as Nov and Dec and continue to rise towards the start of summers and decline during the start of winters. This is also true in the case of members as well but the overall amount of number of rides is high as compared to casuals."}}
