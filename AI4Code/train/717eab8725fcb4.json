Once we have these distances for all the frontiers, we simply choose the frontier with the maximum distance(i.e from the closest support vector ).\n\nFor simple cases it is easy to find a straight line to classify the features. But in some cases, we need to map a vector to a higher dimension plane so that they get segregated from each other.
