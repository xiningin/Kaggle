This brings the sport of basketball into the spotlight and many basketball fanatics get into the work of predicting the winners and rooting for their favorites. Basketball is a fairly popular game in the US and is [ranked second to](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Basketball_in_the_United_States) American football. However, for a person like me, who is born in India, my familiarity with March madness is on a lower side. Things would have been different if this were a competition for predicting [**IPL**](https:\/\/www.iplt20.com\/) winners. The **Indian Premier League** (**IPL**) is a professional [**Twenty20 cricket**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twenty20_cricket \"Twenty20 cricket\") league in [India](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/India \"India\") contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. So, before exploring the dataset, I shall first explain the whole concept of NCAA March Madness and how the format is designed. Hopefully, this will help the people to actually understand a large amount of dataset and not be daunted by it.\n\n# **NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament**\n\n \n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*2fU29HRgk4ySJ_l1N5NaJw.jpeg)\n\nThis tournament is a knockout tournament where the loser is immediately eliminated from the tournament. Since it is mostly played in march, hence it has been accorded the title of **March Madness**. The first edition took place in 1939 and has been regularly held since then. the Women\u2019s Championship was inaugurated in the 1981\u201382 season.\n\n# Format\n\nThe male edition tournament comprises of **68** teams that compete in **7** rounds for the National Championship Title. However, the number of Teams in the Women\u2019s edition is **64**.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*TaaEJ3zTwhuU67QPqqrkaA.png)\n\n---\n\n# Selection\n\nThe selection procedure takes place by two methods:\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*s7gpAnvzL-mQ0lKlzc8xXQ.png)\n\n## 1. Automatic\n\n32 Teams get selected in this way.\n\n-   Men\u2019s Division 1 Team comprises of **353** Teams.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*DBT72cUKGLIvXmjO7mBgyQ.png)\n\n-   Each one of those teams belongs to **32** [conferences](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_NCAA_conferences).\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*rq4HBtMnQeGsiI7hOmBfIA.png)\n\n-   Each of those conferences conducts a tournament and if a time wins the tournament, they get selected for the NCAA.\n\n  \n\n## 2. At Large\n\nThe second selection process is called \u2018At Large\u2019 where The NCAA selection committee convenes at the final days of the regular season and decides which 36 teams which are not the Automatic qualifiers can be sent to the playoffs. This selection is based on multiple stats and rankings.\n\n---\n\n## Selection Sunday\n\nThese \u201cat-large\u201d teams are announced in a nationally televised event on the Sunday preceding the [\u201cFirst Four\u201d play-in games](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Opening_Round_game \"NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game\"). This Sunday is called \u2018Selection Sunday and is on March 15.\n\n## Seeding\n\nAfter all the 68(64 in case of Women), have been decided, the selection committee ranks them in a process called seeding where each team gets a ranking from 1 to 68. Then **First Four** play-in games are contested between teams holding the four lowest-seeded automatic bids and the four lowest-seeded at-large bids.\n\nThe Teams are then split into 4 regions of 16 Teams each. Each team is now ranked from 1 to 16 in each region. After the [First Four](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/First_Four \"First Four\"), the tournament occurs during the course of three weekends, at pre-selected neutral sites across the United States. Here, the first round matches are determined by pitting the top team in the region with the lowest-seeded team in that region and so on. This ranking is the team\u2019s seed.\n\n# March Madness Begins\n![](https:\/\/www.ncaa.com\/sites\/default\/files\/public\/styles\/original\/public-s3\/images\/2020\/02\/12\/kelly-campbell-depaul-2020-ncaa.jpg?itok=suRzKxqw)\n\n## First Round\n\nThe First round consisting of 64 teams playing in 32 games over the course of a week. From here 32 teams emerge as winners and go on to the second round.\n\n## Sweet Sixteen\n\nNext, the sweet sixteen round takes place, which sees the elimination of 16 teams. Rest of the 16 teams move forward.\n\n## Elite Eight\n\nThe next fight is for the Elite Eight as only 8 teams remain in the competition.\n\n## Final Four\n![](https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/2fMOp0fPmvwwCgLXUK\/giphy.gif)\nThe penultimate round of the tournament where the 4 teams contest to reserve a place in the finals. Four teams, one from each region (East, South, Midwest, and West), compete in a preselected location for the national championship.\n \n ---\n\n# Who are Cinderellas?\n\nUpsets do happen in the tournament and sometimes the underdogs, who are seeded low, deliver an unexpected. They are called Cinderellas.\n\n\nSo, this was a background behind the NCAA Baskerball tournament. Now let's have a look at the datasets provided.I shall be analysing the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament data. I assume the Men's tournament data should also be on the same lines.","812c2dc4":"### 4.
