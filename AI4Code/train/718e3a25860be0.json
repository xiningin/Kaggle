Recall that in outer joins everytime a value in the joining field on the left table does not have a corresponding value on the right table, the corresponding row in the new table has Null values for all right table fields. One way to check that all records are consistent and complete is to check for Null values post-join, as we do here.\n\n*Aside*: Why note just do an inner join?\nIf you are assuming that all records are complete and match on the field you desire, an inner join will do the same thing as an outer join. However, in the event you are wrong or a mistake is made, an outer join followed by a null-check will catch it. (Comparing before\/after # of rows for inner join is equivalent, but requires keeping track of before\/after row #'s. Outer join is easier.)","37d56718":"## RF","c63d7935":"We'll be using the popular data manipulation framework `pandas`.

We speculate that this may have cost them a higher standing in the competition. One reason this may be the case is that a little exploratory data analysis reveals that there are often periods where stores are closed, typically for refurbishment. Before and after these periods, there are naturally spikes in sales that one might expect. By ommitting this data from their training, the authors gave up the ability to leverage information about these periods to predict this otherwise volatile behavior.","2c0349a7":"## Create datasets","33f7a4c4":"We can use `head()` to get a quick look at the contents of each table:\n* train: Contains store information on a daily basis, tracks things like sales, customers, whether that day was a holdiay, etc.\n* store: general info about the store including competition, etc.\n* store_states: maps store to state it is in\n* state_names: Maps state abbreviations to names\n* googletrend: trend data for particular week\/state\n* weather: weather conditions for each state\n* test: Same as training table, w\/o sales and customers\n","1329cd16":"In time series data, cross-validation is not random.

As such, we've created a class to handle this type of data.\n\nWe'll define a function `get_elapsed` for cumulative counting across a sorted dataframe. Given a particular field `fld` to monitor, this function will start tracking time since the last occurrence of that field.
