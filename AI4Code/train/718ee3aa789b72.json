Deleting the outlier observations**","eb417930":"## Variable Transformation","70efc16d":"**Mean and Standard Deviation Method:** For this outlier detection method, the mean and standard deviation of the residuals are calculated and compared. If a value is a certain number of standard deviations away from the mean, that data point is identified as an outlier. The specified number of standard deviations is called the threshold. The default value is 3. This method can fail to detect outliers because the outliers increase the standard deviation. The more extreme the outlier, the more the standard deviation is affected.\n\n**Z Score:** Z score is an important concept in statistics. Z score is also called standard score. This score helps to understand if a data value is greater or smaller than mean and how far away it is from the mean. More specifically, Z score tells how many standard deviations away a data point is from the mean.\n\n**IQR-Boxplot:** For this outlier detection method, the median of the residuals is calculated, along with the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile. The difference between the 25th and 75th percentile is the interquartile deviation (IQD). Then, the difference is calculated between each historical value and the residual median. If the historical value is a certain number of Median Absolute Deviation(MAD) away from the median of the residuals, that value is classified as an outlier. The default threshold is 2.22, which is equivalent to 3 standard deviations or MADs. This method is somewhat susceptible to influence from extreme outliers, but less so than the mean and standard deviation method. Box plots are based on this approach. The median and interquartile deviation method can be used for both symmetric and asymmetric data.\n\n- lower inner fence: Q1 - 1.5*IQ\n- upper inner fence: Q3 + 1.5*IQ\n- lower outer fence: Q1 - 3*IQ\n- upper outer fence: Q3 + 3*IQ","9d0a7844":"We can also use **apply()** function.","ab177c20":"### Normalization(0-1 Scaling)","91cfbda3":"We can also impute missing data by categorical variables.","e365e57b":"For a real world example, we will use tips dataset of Seaborn.","f4b30e3a":"**1.
