It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.\n\n**Content**\n\nThe dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species)."}}
