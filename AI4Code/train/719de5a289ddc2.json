What does it actually mean?\n<br\/>\n\nIn short, the error bar basically represents the standard deviation of a data set. It also allows us to know about overlaping and the statistical significance of it.\n<br\/>\n\nFor more details: [Error Bar](https:\/\/www.biologyforlife.com\/interpreting-error-bars.html)","d9f9423b":"<br\/>\n\n## Importing necessary libraries","0cc63b4f":"<br\/>\n\n## Don't bother about bar colors\n\nSeaborn provides us a lot of color palette. Just put their name in 'palette' parameter and choose which one is suitable for you. 'spring', 'coolwarm', 'winter_r', 'husl' are one of them. Explore the rest yourself!\n<br\/>\n\nNote: But if you wan't to have one color in your plot, use 'color' parameter instead of 'palette'. You can also change the saturation of the color by setting up different values to 'saturation' parameter.","80fd6c36":"<br\/>\n\n## First let's create a simple barplot","5ac525a8":"##### What does this barplot mean?\nIt shows us the relationship between weekday and amount of tips.
