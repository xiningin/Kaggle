It is not wise to just delete them, or blindly replace them with the median\/mean\/mode. (Without knowing why the data is missing in the first place, we are unable to come up with a foolproof method for imputing the missing data). One could check some of the links here for further reading.\n\n- [columbia stats notes](http:\/\/www.stat.columbia.edu\/~gelman\/arm\/missing.pdf)\n\n- [data imputation using regression](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/shashankasubrahmanya\/missing-data-imputation-using-regression\/notebook)\n\n- [regression imputation stochastic vs deterministic](https:\/\/statisticsglobe.com\/regression-imputation-stochastic-vs-deterministic\/)\n\n- [statistical modelling for imputation and outliers](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/caicell\/statistical-modeling-imputation-outliers\/notebook#3.-Imputation-and-Outliers)\n\n--- \n\nAnd today we are going to talk about a few ways of handling missing data, however, there are a lot of methods, and we shall not be greedy and attempt to understand all in one single session.\n\nAlso, bear in mind that filling in missing values may not just necessary mean filling in values that are not present. We should however be aware that certain data entries automatically convert NA\/NAN values to 0. Therefore, even if you use `df.isnull()` to check and found that **there are no missing values**, that does not mean imputation is not needed. So a good habit is also to check if the numbers make sense or not. For example, if we are modelling the height of New York people and there are many people with height 0 cm, then it does not even make sense to begin with (although if you use `isnull` it will not show), so sometimes you have to be sharp and spot outlier values, and either remove them or impute them.\n\n**Some users said that it is convenient to work on concatenated training and test set while dealing with missing values, otherwise the filled data may overfit to separate training or test sets. I welcome people to discuss in the comments section on this. However, note for the parts below, I will not use the concatenated set to impute missing values.**\n\nThe amount of missing values in Age, Embarked and Fare features are relatively smaller compared to the total samples, but roughly 80% of the Cabin feature is missing. Missing values in Age, Embarked and Fare features can be filled with descriptive statistical measures, but that wouldn't work for Cabin feature. \n\n\n","5fc23130":"At this step, we can actually build a **baseline model** such that we predict all women survived and all men died. Or we can predict that every time we encounter a unseen data, we predict 74% of the women survived and 18 of the men died. In both cases, we are just using the 2 hypothesized model as baselines - any other models must perform better than this. Note that if you read the Titanic overview, they gave you a excel file where the output is predicted just by assuming all women survived.\n\n<br>\n\nAlso, we retrospectively knew that women and child are prioritized to board the safety boat back then and thus explains the reason that female has such a high survival rate. In reality, if we are given a real world problem, it is our job to establish some plausible explanation that female has a much more significant survival rate than men - and that needs further digging.\n","61f4279f":"However, we wish to use Cross Validation to find out the accuracy scores, as demonstrated in the next section.","8dbe3f47":"As said earlier, there are a few ways to fill in the missing data when the number of missing values are so small. It is reasonable to fill Fare's missing values with the median value.\n\nTest['Fare'] = Test['Fare'].fillna(Test['Fare'].median())\n\n<br>\n\nHowever, we can be more observant here and see that Fare is related to Pclass and Parch in our correlation heatmap in the **training set**. So we can approach it this way: Assuming that the correlation holds for the Test set as well (we can check the heatmap of the test set as well, but I try to refrain myself from doing that), meaning that Fare is most related to Pclass and Parch in the Test set; Since Mr Thomas is of Pclass 3 and Parch 0, we thus focus on the passengers who are all from Pclass 3 and Parch 0 and take the median fare of those passengers who are all from Pclass 3 and Parch 0.","38db9816":"### 5.0.2) Separating dependent and independent variables <a name=\"sep\"><\/a>","49cf9964":"#### **Comparing the distribution of age before imputation and after imputation**\n\nIn this small subsection I attempt to compare the distribution of age vs survival before imputation and after imputation but failed to find an elegant way to write it out, so bear with the messy codes - I will edit the codes once I can find a short way to plot them. \n","24a82c0d":"### 4.3 Features to be dropped or added<a id=\"drop\"><\/a>\n\nAs a beginner, it is always difficult for me to find out which features that are important in a ML algorithm. So why not we start off with what features we can remove first? Just like doing a MCQ exam, if we are not entirely sure of the correct choice, we should do some elimination first to reduce the complexity of the problem.\n\n1. For example: Features with high collinearity can be removed.\n<br>\n\n2. Features with no significant importance to the model can be removed.\n<br>\n\n3. Features with too many categories can be removed - usually those are unique identification features - like Identity number, Name, Reference number of people. These features do not need to be included in the model. However, do note that one can harvest features from those unwanted features - Later we can see how we split features for the Name Category.\n<br>\n\n4.

I will continue and update it to explain other models like random forest and the likes - slowly progressing more complicated models. But always remember, start simple first, do not be greedy and attempt to understand all at one go.\n\nThis kernel is still updating in progress. It will be constantly updated with good information. **If you find it resourceful, or detailed, or lacking clarity on any aspect, please comment and let me know, I just want to be improve along with the rest.**","f45f9f6d":"The above 2 plots showed that passengers boarding from Cherbourg (C) has a better chance of survival. However, one should always question what a graph gives you; In this case, it is not **immediately obvious** why a boarding place has anything to do with one's **survival rate**. A statistical visualization can only bring you this far, it is now your turn to dig out why. (Of course, it may be entirely random that the survivors embarked from Cherbourg).\n\n<br>\n\n**Hypothesis:** As far as our analysis went, it is reasonable to assume that female has a better survival rate than male. Also we have reasonable evidence to think that people with higher Pclass have a higher survival rate. So maybe Cherbourg is a **\"better\"** city than the other 2 such that most passengers boarding from Cherbourg has a higher Pclass than the rest of the city. Or it could be that Cherbourg has a higher Female:Male ratio and thus most people that embarked from Cherbourg are females? We shall test our hypothesis out.\n\n<br>\n\n","a11f7d01":"One thing is for sure when I read the above few graphs, that is passengers who travelled alone seems to have a lower survival rate than the others.","3ebfa282":"### 2.2) Import Datasets <a id=\"data\"><\/a>\n\nOur second step is to import our datasets, in this case, we import train and test datasets. There are various ways to import your datasets into python. Here I give an overview of what train and test datasets mean.\n<br>\n\n**Training and Testing Sets**\n\n   a) **Training data:** Training data is the information used to train an algorithm. The training data includes both input data and the corresponding expected output. We can train different machine learning algorithms on the training data, in the hopes of finding one best algorithm for a particular problem that predicts well. Bear in mind that even if our algorithm performs extremely well on the training data, it may be a result of overfitting, and may not replicate the same accuracy when the algorithm is applied to some unseen (test) data. \n\n   b) **Testing data:** On the other hand, includes only input data, not the corresponding expected output. The testing data is used to assess how well your algorithm was trained, and to estimate model properties.\n   \n<br>\n     \nSo in our training data, we see that our second column says whether the passenger survived or not. The survived column is our output.  And in our test data, the output is not there, it is for us to TEST if our model developed based on the training set is accurate. However the preceding sentence seems to have a problem, IF, in the real world, we do not have the 'answers' for the test data, how then, would we be able to tell how well the training algorithm is performing on the test set. To resolve that issue, we usually perform train test split\/cross validation method on the given training set first. See section 5.03 for more details.","85d7cb4a":"### 3.2.6) Plot Parch, SibSp against Survived  <a id=\"fare\"><\/a>","fa6f8ee1":"#### **Important final note for imputation**","6a5a144c":"Either train.count() or train.info() gives you a rough idea on how many missing values are there for each variable.

Here I am open to comments on how to deal with issues like this, when some of the categorical levels have too little people to be indicate any underlying pattern.

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, rather than modeling this response $Y$ directly with $X$, logistic regression models the probability that $Y$ belongs to a particular category. One can see the from the below figure, the first row says that the tumour size is 1 cm and our data says that the patient's tumour is not malignant (thank god!). But as we said, we want the probability of the tumour being malignant **given** $X = 1$cm. So we write down the probability as shown below (just get this intuition first and don't wonder how are we going to find the probability first!).\n\n    ![1](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/ghnreigns\/imagesss\/master\/logistic-8.jpg)\n\n   For this, in a simple (one variable only) logistic regression model, we can define our output $Y$ as a probability defined as $$P(Y=1~|~ X)$$\n    \n   **So to reiterate, instead of modelling our $Y$ directly with $X$, we aim to find a model that can model the probability of $Y$ given $X$.** But why? How does getting a probability help us? Although it should be obvious that $P(Y=1~|~X)$ should fall in between $0$ and $1$ since it is a probability, **but** it does not answer our question of whether you are in class 1 or 0 because ultimately, we are interested in finding out our output value which is either a 1 or a 0.\n\n   I DO NOT CARE if you told me you found that  $P(Y=1~|~X =1.1 \\text{ cm}) = 0.2349538$ which is neither 0 or 1? So this is where **classification threshold** comes in. You need to pre-define a threshold (default is usually 0.5). As a result, if we use a classification threshold of 0.5, then we will predict a $Y = \\text{Yes } (1)$ for any $P(Y=1|~X) > 0.5$. To write it more compactly, we define the following indicator function. (For more experienced peeps, there is connection with AUC,ROC curves here as well!)\n\n   \\begin{equation}\n     Y=\\begin{cases}\n       1, & \\text{if $P(Y=1~|~X) \\geq 0.5$}\\\\\n       0, & \\text{if $P(Y=1~|~X < 0.5$}\\\\\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\end{equation}\n   \n   As a result if your tumour size is 1.1 cm, then the probability of your tumour is malignant is $0.2349538$, which is less than 0.5 and we predict your as a No (not malignant). However, the threshold is there for a reason, usually, in medical and healthcare industry, we tend to be more conservative with our predictions as we have 0 tolerance for False Negatives. We rather give you a false alarm than to classify you as No Malignancy when in fact you are already at the last stage of your life. So we can tune and change our threshold to something like $P(Y=1~|~X) >0.1$ and in this case, $0.2349538$ will be in the Yes class. \n\n   I know we are going off the tracks, but I hope I have provided you with some intuition on how modelling the $P(Y=1~|~X)$ as a function of $X$ makes sense here.","afbbb3cf":"The idea is to fill the missing values of Age by the median of the Pclass and Sibsp.

Imagine we are in the shoes of the famous statistician DR Cox in the year 1958, we are building logistic regression from scratch, and we tried to hypothesize that the probability $p(X) = P(Y=1~|~X)$ can be modelled the same way as **linear regression?** But soon realised that modelling $p(X) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1X$ is not good since its range gives values out of $[0,1]$. In order to overcome this we can make a transformation and fit the sigmoid\/logistic function which forces the output $p(X)$ to be in $[0,1]$.\n\n    - Since the transformation may not be intuitive, I have made a simple explanation above, and showed steps on how to model $P(X)$ as a sigmoid function.\n\n        Sigmoid in logistic regression:\n\n    $$p(X) = \\dfrac{1}{1+\\exp^{-1}{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}}$$\n\n    - So, we have effectively build a model, and in fact it is a probabilistic model behaving as a bernoulli distribution. To recover the probability $p(X)$, we have to estimate the coefficients (parameters) in $$p(X) = \\dfrac{1}{1+\\exp^{-1}{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}}$$ and we use a method called **Maximum Likelihood (I will do a part 2 on this as it is also a big topic)**.\n\n    - Once we recover the coefficients $\\beta_0, \\beta_1$, we can simply plug in the coefficients and the respective values of $X$ to get $p(X)$. \n\n    - Once we get the $p(X)$, we can define a indicator function as our classification threshold (mentioned earlier) and subsequently, get all the values of $Y$.","f923e41f":"It is easy to spot some obvious features to drop, especially features that are uniquely and randomly assigned to each passenger.

First we use our data = train and extract x = Sex column and y = Survived column. Next the underlying idea is to group the data by sex, so there are male and female. Then in each category of male and female, there are the survived or not by the \"Survived column\" represented by 0 and 1. Our estimator = np.mean = function mean and that means, for each category male and female, calculate their MEAN survived; for example there are 2 male with 0,1 and 3 females with 1,0,1, and by applying the estimator mean we have (0+1)\/2 = 0.5 and (1+0+1)\/3 = 2\/3 which means 50% of the males survived and 66.6% of the females survived.

For example, if we have detect_outliers(train, 2, [\"Age\", \"SibSp\", \"Parch\", \"Fare\"]), it means that we are looking at the data set called train and the columns involved are age, sibsp, parch and fare. However, if there is this guy called John and his age is 100, he definitely will be flagged out as an outlier , but is it fair to just consider John as an outlier just because he is old? So the author of the kernel that I linked earlier defines an outlier iff the person has more than 2 outliers at any one time. For instance, we only consider John as an outlier if he has n>2 outliers on him at the same time. For we find that John has age 100 and sibsp = 30  and fare as 1000000, and we have find out that these values of John are all outliers in its own right, then John has > n =2 columns as outliers, so then only can we consider john as an outlier. \n<br>\n\n2. outliers_indices = [] creates an empty list which we will use later.\n<br>\n\n3. for col in features: for col in features: ........(a bunch of code) means the below: let features be ['Age,'SibSp',...], for  each col, or rather for each element in features, we do the following bunch of code, starting from Age -- finish age and loop back to the start and do SibSp etc.\n\n    For the first loop, the column we iterate through is age. In age, we find the lower quartile and upper quartile of age and the IQR, making sure we ignore NAN values by np.nanpercentile (usually people use np.percentile, take note and in that case it is troublesome because if we do not ignore nan values, the lower bound and upperbound for age will both be nan because there are too many nan values.)\n    \n    outlier_step = 1.5 times IQR and whenever age is less than Q1- outlierstep or more than Q3+ outlierstep. So the code outlier_list_col returns column vector of row numbers whose ages are outliers. When printed out this line, we have \nInt64Index([33, 54, 96, 116, 280, 456, 493, 630, 672, 745, 851], dtype='int64'), meaning row 33, 54, 96... are the rows of Age being an outlier.\n<br>\n\n4. Also at this step, you can print(col,Q1-outlier_step,Q3+outlier_step) and return the range of outlier for each col.\n<br>\n\n5. Now onto the next code,  outliers_indices.extend(outlier_list_col), recall the first line we have an empty list for outliers_indices =[]. Now we put each element in the column vector of row number index for age into the empty list []. So for example, row 33 and 54 are age outliers, then the outliers_indices = [33,54]; Now we have finished 1 loop, loop back again\nbut for the next column sibsp, rinse and repeat until the end of columns. For example, John is row 33, and he is outlier for age and sibsp and fare. so the final outliers_indices.extend will return a list like [33,.....,33,......,33.....] with 33 appearing 3 times. \n<br>\n\n6. We have finished with the loops! Now we look at the next code. outliers_indices = Counter(outliers_indices)\nCounter function gives you a dictionary, same example, Ivan is row number 7. So in the dictionary returned by counter, we will see something like {7:3,.......} where 7:3 is key value pair meaning, row 7 occured 3 times in the old list.

The following long wall of text is extracted from various sources\/kernels.\n\n<br>\n\nIn the dataset `Age, Embarked, Fare and Cabin` features have missing values.  \n\nThere are multiple ways to deal with missing values in dataset and chosen strategy highly depends on type feature type, amount of missing values, size of dataset and etc.  \n\n\n**Missing - Data Mechanism**\n\nTo decide how to handle missing data, it is helpful to know why they are missing. We consider four general \u201cmissingness mechanisms,\u201d moving from the simplest to the most general.\n\n<br>\n\n**Suppose you are modelling weight (Y) as a function of sex (X). Some respondents wouldn't disclose their weight, so you are missing some values for Y. There are three possible mechanisms for the nondisclosure:**\n\n1. **Missingness Completely At Random ( MCAR):** Missing completely at random (MCAR) is the only missing data mechanism that can actually be verified. When we say data are missing completely at random, we mean that the missingness has nothing to do with the person being studied. For example, a questionnaire might be lost in the post, or a blood sample might be damaged in the lab. Of course, this is not **completely random**, but the underlying idea is the missing data is not related to the subject of the missing data. [reference](https:\/\/cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com\/blog.nus.edu.sg\/dist\/4\/6502\/files\/2018\/06\/mcartest-zlxtj7.pdf)\n\n   There may be no particular reason at all why some respondents told you their weights and others didn't. That is, the probability that Y is missing may has no relationship to X or Y. In this case our data is missing completely at random (MCAR).\n\n<br>\n\n\n2. **Missing At Random (MAR):** Missing at random (MAR) means that the missingness can be explained by variables on which you have full information. It's not a testable assumption, but there are cases where it is reasonable vs. not.\n\n   For example, take political opinion polls. Many people refuse to answer. If you assume that the reasons people refuse to answer are entirely based on demographics, and if you have those demographics on each person, then the data is MAR. It is known that some of the reasons why people refuse to answer can be based on demographics (for instance, people at both low and high incomes are less likely to answer than those in the middle), but there's really no way to know if that is the full explanation.\n\n   So, the question becomes \"is it full enough?\". Often, methods like multiple imputation work better than other methods as long as the data isn't very missing not at random. [reference](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23090\/distinguishing-missing-at-random-mar-from-missing-completely-at-random-mcar)\n\n   One sex may be less likely to disclose its weight. That is, the probability that Y is missing depends only on the value of X. Such data are missing at random (MAR).\n\n<br>\n\n3. **Missing Not At Random (MNAR):** Heavy (or light) people may be less likely to disclose their weight. That is, the probability that Y is missing depends on the unobserved value of Y itself. Such data are not missing at random or missing not at random (MNAR) and requires attention or else it will heavily bias your inference.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n**Possible solutions to deal with missing values in Continuous Variables (Refer to https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/volhaleusha\/titanic-tutorial-encoding-feature-eng-81-8#Part-4:-Explore-Target-Variable):**\n\n1. Complete Case Analysis CCA (discard observations where any value is missing in any variable) - doesn't work if there are many features missing or on small datasets. \n    <br>\n    \n2. Mean and median imputation (substitute missing values with mean feature value (for Gaussian features) and median (if a variable is not Gaussian) \n    - normally good strategy if data is missing completely at random\n    - but if there is a dependency between why data is missing and target it is better to additionally create a separate variable to capture NAs\n    - changes the original distribution of variable and can distort covariance with other variables $\\to$ if too much can influence prediction in a negative way\n    \n      <br>\n      \n3.

[A good answer](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/23090\/distinguishing-missing-at-random-mar-from-missing-completely-at-random-mcar)\n\n<br>\n\n**LAST BUT NOT LEAST**\n\nhttps:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/95083\/imputation-before-or-after-splitting-into-train-and-test\n\nI see quite a lot of people on Kaggle performing imputation on both the \"Training\" and \"Test\" datasets in one setting - i.e. If one wants to use the mean of the dataset to impute the missing values, instead of performing the desired imputation method on the training set first, and replicate the process to the test set, he\/she combines the training and test set and perform the method on the combined set. This is confusing, to say the very least, as a newbie, I googled up and see some answers to this:\n\n<br>\n\nThe division between training and test set is an attempt to replicate the situation where you have past information and are building a model which you will test on future as-yet unknown information: the training set takes the place of the past and the test set takes the place of the future, so you only get to test your trained model once.\n\n<br>\n\nKeeping the past\/future analogy in mind, this means anything you do to pre-process or process your data, such as imputing missing values, you should do on the training set alone. You can then remember what you did to your training set if your test set also needs pre-processing or imputing, so that you do it the same way on both sets.\n\n<br>\n\nIf you use the test data to affect the training data, then the test data is being used to build your model, so it ceases to be test data and will not provide a fair test of your model. You risk overfitting, and it was to discourage this that you separated out the test data in the first place.\n\n<br>\n\nSo personally, given a situation where you want to perform, say, median imputation, I would strongly recommend to do it on the training and test set separately, instead of combining the two sets and do a median imputation on it.\n\n**Another reasonable question that follows from the above**\n\nWhat if the missing values only happen in the test set and not in the training set. What should we do then? Again, please have a discussion on this if you know the answer.","41745b77":"Bear in mind, we can use plot 1 when our categorical pclass does not have many categories\/levels. What if pclass has 30 different levels. Then our graph will look messy. This is why I also used a line plot in plot 2 to illustrate that line plot can be a useful visualization tool as well.\n\n<br>\n\nFrom the above 2 plots, we have the same conclusion, in Pclass 1, 63 percent of the passengers in Pclass 1 survived. In Pclass 2, 47.3 percent of passengers in Pclass 2 survived. In Pclass 3, 24.2 percent of Pclass 3 passengers survived. **So we have a feel that the the better your class, the higher your chance of survival.**\n\n<br>\n\nBut do recall in our first part 3.3.1, we did see that gender DO affect one's chance of survival. We can further confirm our hypothesis by plotting Gender + Pclass vs Survival Rate.\n\n<br>\n\n**How many men and women survived grouped by their Passenger Class?**\n\nHere is a neat code from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/poonaml\/titanic-survival-prediction-end-to-end-ml-pipeline to plot this.\n\nOne may ask what can we get from this plot? Well for a start, we do know that women has a much higher survival rate than men, so is this still true if we categorize them by different Pclass? Apparently, you will see later that for Pclass 1 and 2, women still maintain a very high survival rate, but in Pclass 3, we can see the women's survival rate dip down by quite a lot. This may suggest Pclass 3 is the \"poorer\" people's class - and hence they are valued less when evacuating (unfortunately life is unfair).\n\nAlso note that we can see in a correlation heatmap, fare and pclass are quite strongly correlated with a value of 0.55. So we reckon higher fare corresponds to Pclass 1.\n\n\n<br>\n\nOne side note on the coding part below: catplot returns you a function called g which is a FacetGrid object with the plot on it for further tweaking. So the below code is how we usually add on different plottings on the facetgrid itself. Note there is a difference between the way we did on barplot, on barplot it returns you a function called ax which is a single grid.\n","3a88be1f":"### 5.1.3) Step 3: ROC and AUC <a name=\"roc\"><\/a>\n\nBelow is the code for averaging out 10 fold cross validation for AUC score.","6dd9bab2":"2.

We will do some basic overview of the survival rate in different categories.","83b921bb":"### 2.1) Importing Libraries <a id=\"library\"><\/a>\n\nThis is our very first step, we shall import the necessary libraries that we want into python.

Of course, in regression wise, correlation matrix can be used to detect multi collinearity or say outliers.\n\n\nBy default, sns.heatmap will not include categorical features which are not factorized. As a result, the heatmap below did not include those categorical variables, only the columns with numerical are plotted against each other.\n\nSo since some categorical variables are not inside this map, we need to view their correlation with the other variables seperately. For example, our earlier plot suggests that \"sex\/gender\" being female has a higher survival rate than males. Note that it is difficult to compare correlation of categorical and continuous variables and hence it brings up to the next section - where we plot more graphs to attempt to obtain an intuition between all the variables.","ca59c46a":"Indeed, there are only 3 females out of the 18 nobles and all of them survived!

Also, the example that I will use in this article is based on Logisitic Regression algorithm, however, it is important to keep in mind that the concept of ROC and AUC can apply to more than just Logistic Regression.\n\n<br>\n\n\nA ROC curve shows you performance across a range of different classification thresholds and a confusion matrix only shows you one (typically when $\\text{Pr}(y>0.5)$).\n\n<br>\n\nA confusion matrix can be used to measure the performance of a particular classifier with a fixed threshold. Given a set of input cases, the classifier scores each one, and score above the threshold are labelled Class 1 and scores below the threshold are labelled Class 2. \n\nThe ROC curve, on the other hand, examines the performance of a classifier *without fixing the threshold*. Given a set of input cases, the classifier scores each one. The ROC curve is then generated by testing every possible threshold and plotting each result as a point on the curve.\n\nThe ROC curve is useful when you want to test your classifier over a range of sensitivities\/specificities. This may or may not be a desirable thing to do. Perhaps you want very high sensitivity and don't care much about specificity - in this case, the AUC metric will be less desirable, because it will take into account thresholds with high specificity. The confusion matrix, on the other hand, could be generated with a fixed threshold known to yield high sensitivity, and would only be evaluated for that particular threshold.\n\nA confusion matrix evaluates one particular classifier with a fixed threshold, while the AUC evaluates that classifier over all possible thresholds.","55d9540b":"**Pclass vs Embarked**\n","93749872":"## 8) Part 2: Maximum Likelihood  <a id=\"ls2\"><\/a>","e8574172":"**Age Distribution**\n\nAge is a variable that we can create bins for, but that will be another topic for another time.

Although we have gone through a lot of ideas just now, it would be meaningless if we cannot find a suitable function (equation) to model $p(X)$ and $X$. \n\n   **Hypothesis 1: The Linear Hypothesis**\n\n   Hmm, so we got quite some success hypothesizing linear regression models with linear functions, can we try that too on $p(X)$ and $X$? Consider that we \"guess\/hypothesize\" that $p(X)$ have a **linear relationship** with $X$ as follows: \n\n    $$p(X) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 X$$\n\n   However the problem with this modelling is that for very large Tumour sizes $X$, say $X=10 \\text{ cm}$, then our $p(X)$ may take values greater than $1$. And for extremely small Tumour sizes $X$, say those very small benign lumps, which may be $X=0.05 \\text{ cm}$ in size, then $p(X)$ may take negative values. In any case, no matter how likely or unlikely one is to find his\/her tumour to be malignant, how big or small the tumour size is, our $p(X)$ should only output values between $0$ and $1$ because $p(X)$ is a probability. Hence our linear model may be accurate to a certain extent, but not sensible.\n\n   **Hypothesis 2**\n\n   Instead of the linear hypothesis, we come up with another one, recall that we learnt that probability and odds have similar definition. And recall that $$\\text{odds} = \\dfrac{P(Y=1~|~X)}{1-P(Y=1~|~X)}$$\n\n   So why not model the odds against $X$? If we can successfully do that, then we can easily get the probability $P(Y=1~|~X)$ since odds and probability are in a if and only if relationship. So let us try: $$\\text{odds} = \\dfrac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X$$\n\n   But ALAS! We soon realise that the odds can only take on values from $0$ to $\\infty$, but the problem still exists for the $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X$ since some $X$ values can output negative values.\n\n   But we are close, and if one has **some** mathematical backgrounds, then we know that if we take the log or ln of $\\text{odds}$ then we can have the desired results.\n\n   **Hypothesis 3: The Chosen one**\n\n   If we finally consider the modelling of the logarithm of the odds, against the variable $X$, where we still assume a linear relationship, then we may be good to go because the logarithm of the odds gives a range of $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ and matches well with $\\beta_0+\\beta_1X$.      \n\n   With this we have achieved a regression model, with the output of the model being the logarithm or ln of the odds. i.e: the modelled equation is as follows:\n\n    $$\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}\\right) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1X$$\n\n   The main reason we reach this step is because both sides of the equation can take in the same range, and thus makes more mathematical sense now. We have yet to estimate or found what the coefficients $\\beta_0, \\beta_1$ are. This is just a logical and sound hypothesis.\n\n   **Recovering the Logistic Function from log odds**\n\n   So in the previous paragraph we have settled on a hypothesis that there is a **linear relationship** between the predictor variable $X$ and the **log-odds** of the event that $Y=1$. However, do not forget what our original aim is, we modelled log odds against $X$ simply because the relationship can be mathematically justified, we ultimately want to find the probability of $Y=1$ given $X$. And that is easy, by some reverse engineering, once $\\beta_0, \\beta_1$ are fixed, we do some manipulation:\n\n    \n$$\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}\\right) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1X \\iff  \\dfrac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} = \\exp{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}   \\iff p(X)  = \\dfrac{\\exp{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}}{\\exp{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}+1} \\iff p(X) = \\dfrac{1}{1+\\exp^{-1}{(\\beta_0+\\beta_1X)}}$$\n\n\n   **Given the log odd mode (logit model actually), we can recover the probability of $Y=1$ given $X$ for each $X$.**\n","ec7ccffb":"### 4.1.2) Missing Values: Embarked <a id=\"emb\"><\/a>","d3767128":"### 3.2.5) Plot Fare against Survived  <a id=\"fare\"><\/a>\n","3724136e":"**Fill in missing values for Age.**\n\n**Age has quite a lot of missing values**.

Why not? Suppose that we are trying to predict the medical condition of a patient in the emergency room on the basis of her symptoms. In this simplified example, there are three possible diagnoses: stroke, drug overdose, and epileptic seizure. We could consider encoding these values as a quantitative response variable, $Y$, as follows: \n\n   \\begin{equation}\n     Y=\\begin{cases}  \n       1, & \\text{if stroke}\\\\\n       2, & \\text{if drug overdose}\\\\\n       3, & \\text{if epileptic seizure}\\\\\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\end{equation}\n   \n   Using this coding, least squares could be used to fit a linear regression model to predict $Y$ on the basis of a set of predictors $X_{1}$, . . . , $X_{p}$. Unfortunately, this coding implies an ordering on the outcomes, putting drug overdose in between stroke and epileptic seizure, and insisting that the difference between stroke and drug overdose is the same as the difference between drug overdose and epileptic seizure. In practice there is no particular reason that this needs to be the case. For instance, one could choose an\n    equally reasonable coding,\n\n   \\begin{equation}\n     Y=\\begin{cases}\n       1, & \\text{if epileptic seizure}\\\\\n       2, & \\text{if stroke}\\\\\n       3, & \\text{if drug overdose}\\\\\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\end{equation}\n\n   which would imply a totally different relationship among the three conditions. Each of these codings would produce fundamentally different linear models that would ultimately lead to different sets of predictions on test observations.\n\n   If the response variable's values did take on a natural ordering, such as mild, moderate, and severe, and we felt the gap between mild and moderate was similar to the gap between moderate and severe, then a 1, 2, 3 coding would be reasonable. Unfortunately, in general there is no natural way to convert a qualitative response variable with more than two levels into a quantitative response that is ready for linear regression.\n\n   For a binary (two level) qualitative response, the situation is better. For instance, perhaps there are only two possibilities for the patient's medical condition: stroke and drug overdose. We could then potentially use the dummy variable approach to code the response as follows:\n\n   \\begin{equation}\n     Y=\\begin{cases}\n       0, & \\text{if stroke}\\\\\n       1, & \\text{if drug overdose}\\\\\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\end{equation}\n   \n   We could then fit a linear regression to this binary response, and predict drug overdose if $\\hat{Y}>0.5$ and stroke otherwise. In the binary case it is not hard to show that even if we flip the above coding, linear regression will produce the same final predictions.\n\n   For a binary response with a $0-1$ coding as above, regression by least squares does make sense; it can be shown that the $X\\hat{\\beta}$ obtained using linear regression is in fact an estimate of $\\text{Pr}(\\text{Drug Overdoes}~|~X)$ in this special case. However, if we use linear regression, some of our estimates might be outside the $[0$, 1$]$ interval , making them hard to interpret as probabilities!\n\n   However, the dummy variable approach cannot be easily extended to accommodate qualitative responses with more than **two levels!!!** For these reasons, it is preferable to use a classification method that is truly suited for qualitative response values, such as the ones presented next.","2abf0cdb":"**Now remember our feature scaling earlier on train test split?**\n\nHowever, be very careful that in K-Fold Cross Validation, we do not feature scale separately, this is because as explained earlier, in K-Fold we want to plug in the entire training set.

It is a very basic idea and there is no hard and fast rule which encoding method to use for every question. But in general, that is a rules of thumb to follow: But always bear in mind not to employ any method blindly.\n\nAlways remember, you have to decide what encoding method to use before you run the model. For example, before you use random forest algorithm, you have to process the data into something the computer can understand. Here we introduce 2 ways of encoding.\n\n---\n\n- **Label Encoding:** For example, there is this feature called Embarked in our dataset, represented by \"S\", \"C\", \"Q\". Now the computer only likes to work with numbers, and as a result we need to convert S, C, Q into numbers. We can simply label $$S = 0, C = 1, Q = 2$$ and this is called Label Encoding (simply assigning numbers to the categorical variable in a sequential manner).\n\n    However, Label Encoding has a big caveat, whenever you use this encoding method, the Embarked category now has a inherent ordered relationship; Signifying that C = 1 has more weight than S = 0, and Q = 2 has more weight than C = 1 and S = 0. \n\n   The problem with this is when an algorithm (for eg, a logistic classification model makes USE OF THE WEIGHT in their calculation, and this is disastrous). \n\n   The algorithm learns: \n   \n   $$\\text{Prediction_of_survival_rate = weight_of_embarked * embarked + weight_of_gender * gender + ...... + bias}$$\n   \n   Now if you want to predict person A's survival rate based on the label encoding of where he\/she embarked, you will have a problem. \n   \n   If person A comes from Southampton, and person B comes from Queenstown, both are of the same gender (Male) and let weight_of_embarked = 10, weight_of_gender = 20.\n   \n   Then the Prediction_of_survival_rate for person A = 10 * 0 + $\\epsilon$ = $\\epsilon$ and the Prediction_of_survival_rate for person B = 10 * 2 + $\\epsilon$  = 20 + $\\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ is a positive number (representing weight_of_gender * gender but we know that the value for both is the same).\n   \n   So naturally, our model is gonna say that person B has a much higher survival rate than person A. I believe one can already get a feel of what is going wrong here. The caveat of Label Encoding is that we unknowingly assigned a hierarcy to each variable - signifying that an ordered relationship will not work properly in this situation. There are exceptions however, decision tree model is invariant to the encoding's order, so it may be fine to use Label Encoder, the rule of thumb is you have to know your algorithm does not depend on the \"number\" that is encoded.\n\n        if embarked == 0 (aka = S) then\n            do this decision\n        elif embarked == 1 (aka = C) then\n            do that decision\n        elif embarked == 2 (aka = Q) then\n            do last decision\n  \n    In the above example, we see that it does not matter what the embarked is encoded as, as it does not affect the end result.\n\n---\n\n- **One Hot Encoding**\n\n[ref](https:\/\/medium.com\/@michaeldelsole\/what-is-one-hot-encoding-and-how-to-do-it-f0ae272f1179)\n\nInitially, apple is labeled 1, chicken labeled as 2, broccoli labeled as 3. The idea now is that under the food name column, there are 3 categories, namely, apple, chicken and broccoli. Now for each category, we create an additional binary column for each category.\n\n<br>\n\nSo back to our Titanic example, the column name (feature) is Embarked, with 3 categories inside, S, C and Q. Now with one hot encoding, the distance for S, C and Q are equal. \n\n<br>\n\nS: [1,0,0]\n\nC: [0,1,0]\n\nQ: [0,0,1]\n\nSo if we treat each of the above as a column vector, the distance between each pair of cities\/Embarked is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n<br>\n\n\n4. There is some caveats for one hot encoding. One is for the Sklearn package in python, Sklearn\u2019s one hot encoder does not actually know how to convert categories to numbers, it only knows how to convert numbers to binary. We have to use the labelencoder first to convert categories to numbers.\n\n    Also recognize that while one hot encoding reduces noise in your data that would have otherwise been cause by incorrect ordinal relationships, it also greatly increases the dimensionality of your data. High dimensionality has its own set of problems in machine learning, such as the curse of dimensionality. For example, if we were to think that ticket ID is important for our study, then there are literally 891 categories in the ticket ID feature. That would mean 891 new attributes\/features after one hot encoding.\n<br>\n\n5. A general rule of thumb for Label Encoder vs One Hot encoder is as follows:\n\n    i) If the categorical features are ordinal ones, use label encoder. For example, if I were to bin the Fare feature into category features such as: Cheap price, Normal price, Expensive price. Then it does make sense to say cheap = 0, normal = 1 and expensive = 2. However do note that LabelEncoder does not know what does 'cheap', 'normal' and 'expensive' mean. So it just assigns labels in order of appearance.\n\n    ii) If non-ordinal relation, use one hot encoder.\n","c61aa182":"### 5.1.2) Step 2: Accuracy of the Model <a name=\"Accuracy\"><\/a>\n\nAfter we choose our way to train the model and get the result and outcomes, it is natural for us to consider the performances of the model! Now the very first step we want to check is the accuracy of the model! The formula for accuracy is simply given by \n\n\n$$\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{Number of correctly classified cases}}{\\text{Number of all cases}}$$\n\n\n<br>\n\nAnd as seen in below, we first showed all our accuracy scores for each fold in the K-Fold CV validation, and the values are pretty close to each other with a standard deviation of 0.02733 - which in my opinion is a very acceptable range (one can further do some testing to show that the SD is justifiable low).\n\n<br>\n\nSo our final accuracy score for Logistic Regression is 82.82 percent. But is that good enough? No. Let me give you one more problem. \n\n<br>\n\nFor example, in our Titanic Problem, we want to classify data into survive or dead. And to make the example simple, we have 1000 data set in which we achieved an 80% accuracy, that is we predicted 800\/1000 correctly. This 80% accuracy seems reasonable, but however it can still be extremely bad if we have many False Positives or False Negatives. In our case, let's say we have exactly 500 people who died and 500 people who lived - Our algorithm predicts 500\/500 correctly for those people who survived, however only 300\/500 correctly for those who died. Yes, the total accuracy does add up to 80 percent and it looks good on paper, but we realised that this algorithm is extremely incapable of prediction for people who died, and that can be a big problem because in reality, we may have say, 900 people who died and 100 who survived, one can imagine how disastrous it can be if we applied the algorithm and it will give you a much lower total accuracy rate!\n\n<br>\n\nWe shall explore some popular metrics to further ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE of the model - An extension to evaluate how accurate the model performs.\n","2d4cdfea":"Since fare is all filled up, we compare the fare distribution as below. Also when you look carefully at the plot below, I compared the test and training set's distribution of Fare vs Survival rate side by side and realized that the training set is not so \"smooth\" as compared to the test set. This has an underlying problem, and the idea is that when our algorithm is searching for patterns in the training set, our algorithm might adapt to certain underlying patters in the training set that DO NOT exist in the test set  - as a result, the machine learning algorithm may not be able to generalize well to the test set - which is why when we use a certain algorithm on our training set, it seems to give us a high accuracy like 80% but when we do it on the test set, it becomes much lower at maybe 75%.","d1e31f16":"## 6) Other Machine Learning Models <a id=\"classifiers\"><\/a>","e06ac387":"#### **Data Types are Important for EDA** \n\nFrom the above:\n\nThere are 5 object features: Name, Sex, Ticket, Cabin and Embarked.\n\n- Two of them: Cabin and Ticket are mixed type (numbers+ string)\n- Sex is binary category\n- Embarked is category\n- Name is text\n\nThere are 6 numeric features: Pclass, Age, PassengerID, SibSp, Parch, Fare.\n\n- Age and Fare are continuous\n- Pclass is ordinal category\n- SibSp and Parch are discrete ordinal\n- Target: Survived is binary categorical\n\n**Checking on you: Why do we need to pay particular attention to the data types? How are they important?**\n\nRefer: https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/data-types-in-statistics-347e152e8bee\n\n","79413993":"So the idea is we split our training data into 4 datasets, x_train means the training set without the outcome values (no survived column), x_train will serve as the training set. Now y_train set is the set of survived values corresponding to the x_train set. Similarly, we have **x_test which is also extracted from the training set (PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION THAT x_test IS NOT REFERRING TO THE TEST SET given to us)**, but serving the purpose as test set here. And y_test set is the set of survived values corresponding to the x_test set.\n\n<br>\n\nNow train_size = 0.8, test_size = 0.2 just means we split the data set into 80 percent of training data, and 20 percent test data.\n\n<br>\n\nRandom_state is basically used for reproducing your problem the same every time it is run. If you do not use a randomstate in traintestsplit, every time you make the split you might get a different set of train and test data points and will not help you in debugging in case you get an issue. Note, it does not matter which integer value you use for random state, as long as you set it to one integer value and keep to it throughout.\n\n<br>\n\nHowever, there are many ways to **split** dataset, and sometimes other ways are superior. For example cross validation is a better way in general. However, in **Time Series** problems, train-test split or train-test-validation split might just prove to be superior because why would you care about errors in the past? You should care about errors you would make in the future. In that sense, you want to partition your dataset in past TS datapoints and the most current datapoints and perform MSE or Log Loss ( depending on whether this is classification or regression ) to evaluate how well your model can predict into the future.\n\n<br>\n\n\n**Cross Validation**\n\nWe talk about K-Fold Cross Validation (CV) first, note that there are many cross validation methods. But we have to start simple and talk about the easiest but also an efficient one here. K-Fold CV is literally performing train test split numerous times (or rather k times), but on different train test splits. If you have a data set of 1000, and set k = 10, then your dataset will be divided into 10 folds of dataset, with dataset 1 to dataset 10 each having 100 data inside. We will take dataset 1 to 9 as the \"training set\" and dataset 10 as the \"test set\" and perform the model on it, then we take dataset 1 to 8 and dataset 10 as the training set and let dataset 9 be the test set and perform the model on it. We do this iteratively (?) for 10 times until each dataset has been part of the training set. We will get 10 outputs of accuracy values and we take the average of them to be the final accuracy value.\n\n<br>\n\nCross-validation is usually the preferred method because it gives your model the opportunity to train on multiple train-test splits. This gives you a better indication of how well your model will perform on unseen data.

Well, to me this is not an obvious answer - but one intuitive explanation is as follows.\n\n- We assumed that the missing age values are Missing at Random (MAR) read: https:\/\/statisticalhorizons.com\/missing-at-random.\n\n<br>\n\n- Data on Y are said to be missing at random if the probability of missing data on Y is unrelated to the value of Y, after controlling for other variables in the analysis. To express this more formally, suppose there are only two variables X and Y, where X always is observed and Y sometimes is missing. MAR means that $$\\text{Pr}(Y \\text{missing}~|~Y,X) = \\text{Pr}(Y \\text{missing}~|~X)$$\n\n<br>\n\n- Since the missing values are MAR, it should be the case that the pre-imputation distribution should be similar to the after-imputation distribution.

Let us try,\n\n#### Category variables count\n\nThe below plot is very useful:\n\n\n1. We first create a plot grid, with subplots on it, we define the figure size as usual, and now we pass some more conditions in it, we want to make plot multiple graphs on a grid of say 2 by 3 grid. In this way, if your code consists of repetitive graphing of a bar chart in the same fashion, we can just run a loop on this grid! \n\n2. For example, we want to plot a very simple frequency count for titanic's categorical variables, namely, survived, pclass, sex, sibsp, parch and embarked. So we can run the below code.\n\n3. Note for (u,v,z) in [[\"Survived\",0,0],[\"Pclass\",0,1],[\"Sex\",0,2], [\"SibSp\",1,0], [\"Parch\",1,1],[\"Embarked\",1,2]] just means for each element (u,v,z) in the list, we have u,v,z corresponding to each cross product in the list. Note, to say it explicitly, u is \"survived\", \"pclass\", etc.. v =0,1,2,..., z = 0,1,2,...\n\n    Now I am telling you that you need to pass 3 elements (u,v,z) in the for loop, but when you are creating the code the first time, you may not realise at first, so the computational thinking is you write out the codes like how you would manually:\n    \n    -sns.barplot(x = train[\"Survived\"].value_counts().index,y = train[\"Survived\"].value_counts(), ax  = myplot[0,0])\n    -sns.barplot(x = train[\"Pclass\"].value_counts().index,y = train[\"Pclass\"].value_counts(), ax  = myplot[0,1])\n    -sns.barplot(x = train[\"Sex\"].value_counts().index,y = train[\"Sex\"].value_counts(), ax  = myplot[0,2])\n    etc...\n    \n    So I suspect you need to loop through the categorical variables, survived, pclass, sex etc. And of course since you are plotting your graph on a 2x3 grid, we let our first graph appears in the place [0,0], second graph appears in the place [0,1], etc... So we want to loop through 3 things! So I should tell myself I need 3 elements to loop through in the for loop.

I think feature engineering efforts mainly have two goals:\n\na) Preparing the proper input dataset, compatible with the machine learning algorithm requirements.\n\nb) Improving the performance of machine learning models.\n\n<br>\n\nHere we will introduce a few feature engineering techniques, but may or may not go through all as this kernel is update in progress.\n\n","1621ef19":"First you need to be very clear about what a **probability distribution is.** Consider that we have 10 students and we model their marks where the full marks of the test is 16\/16. Define a random variable $X$ where $X$ represents the marks of each student. Assume further that this **random variable** $X$ is following a **normal distribution** with $\\mu = 11$ and $\\sigma = 3$, can we find the probability distribution for the marks of the whole cohort (10 students)? Yes we can, because we have the parameters. If you do not know what is the meaning of parameters, please go revise on it, it is very important for you to understand that the **parameter** decides the probability distribution of any model. \n\nRecall the general formula for the pdf of the normal distribution is $$f(X = x) = \\dfrac{e^{-(x-\\mu)^2}\/(2\\sigma^2)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}$$\nand in normal distribution once we have the mean and standard deviation of the dataset, we can recover the whole pdf of the model, hence the mean and standard deviation are our parameters.  So let us say we want to find $P(11 < X < 13~|~\\mu = 11, \\sigma = 3)$, we can easily find it to be around $0.31 = 31\\%$, we can basically find any probabilities **as long as we are given the parameters**. So, **we must have the correct mindset that,** probability density functions (or pmf alike) are legitimate functions that takes in any $X = x$ and outputs the probability of this $x$ **happening**. (Of course in continuous distribution we are usually only interested in the range of $x$, but for the purpose of intuition, we do not need to be so pedantic).\n\n**Likelihood Function**\n\nHowever, in the real world setting, more often than not, we have the data $X$, like we have conveniently the scores of all the 10 students above, which **could be a random sample taken** from the whole school's population. Now we are tasked to find the probability distribution of the whole population (say 10,000 students), and we would have calculate it ever so easily **if we knew what the parameters were!?** Unfortunately we do not have the true parameters.\n\nOur main motivation now is to find the **parameter**, because without it, we cannot complete the task of finding the distribution of the population. We can never know the real\/true parameter $\\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma)$, but we can obtain a good estimator of it, by making use of the data that we do have! In this scenario we were given 10 data points (in real life it is usually much more), say the 10 data points are $$\\mathbf{X} = [3,9,4,10,12,16,5,11,9,9]$$\n\nSo we do a sleight of hand using our original **probability density function**, $P(X = x~|~ \\theta)$. Instead of being a function of $X = x$ where $\\theta$ is known, we instead let $X = x$ be fixed, and let $\\theta$ be the variable now. The idea is that this function now is **NO LONGER a function of** $X=x$, and is instead a function of $\\theta$, where it takes in all possible values of $\\theta$, and outputs a value called the \\textbf{likelihood value.} So now, in a less informal way, our new function looks like $$P(\\mathbf{X} = [3,9,4,10,12,16,5,11,9,9]~|~ \\theta)$$ and it means **what is the probability of OBSERVING these data points, given different values of theta.** One needs to plot the graph of likelihood out to get a better idea (Wikipedia).  \n\nSo imagine our function (plot likelihood value vs parameter) has a local\/global maximum, and that maximum is what we are finding ultimately. Because it is reasonable for us to believe that, the **parameter** that gives us the maximum value of $P(\\mathbf{X} = [3,9,4,10,12,16,5,11,9,9]~|~ \\theta)$ will suggest that **given these 10 data points**, this $\\theta$ that we just found, gives us the highest **likelihood\/probability** that these 10 points are actually observed. \n\nWe formally define this function to be $$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta~|~ X = x) = P(X = x~|~\\theta) $$\n\nI cannot emphasize enough that even those the likelihood function $\\mathcal{L}$ and the probability function $P$ have the exact same form, they are fundamentally different in which one is a function of the parameter $\\theta$, and the other is a function of the data points $X = x$.\n\n**Maximizing the likelihood function**\n\nMany of us may not have rigourous mathematical background, and hence when I said we are trying to find the value of $\\theta$ that maximizes $\\mathcal{L}$, we might be stunned, indeed, the most intuitive way is to try out every possible theta and see which theta gives us the highest value; or if you can try differentiating $\\mathcal{L}$ and set the derivative to $0$ to solve for $\\theta$. In any case, our intuition is to maximize this function. We will illustrate the idea of maximum likelihood with a simple example below.\n\n**Example**\n\nInspired and credits to [Jonny Brooks-Bartlett](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/probability-concepts-explained-maximum-likelihood-estimation-c7b4342fdbb1) as the example is almost similar.\n\n- Let's say we have a population of 1000 students and a random sample of 3 university students are taken with their respective marks for a Machine learning test. The data are distributed below in python (generate some data of 3 students marks). \n    \n- First, we always have to come up with a hypothesized model first, and in this case, based on these 3 sample data points, we make a simple plot and since the plot looks somewhat normal, we hypothesize that our model should be of a normal distribution (do be reminded this is just for illustration, 3 points may be too little for us to hypothesize a model in many scenarios).\n    \n- Our aim is to come up with a normal distribution for this 1000 students marks. In order to do that, we need to find the parameters and recall that in normal distribution, our parameters are the mean $\\mu$ and the standard deviation  $\\sigma$. So we have to find the best parameters that best describe our observed 3 sample points.\n    \n- Note that from our previous section, we know that we just need to maximize the likelihood function given by $$\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma)~|~ X = [9,9.5,11]\\right) = P\\left(X = [9,9.5,11]~;~ \\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma)\\right)$$\n\n- Here the author made a very good point that we shall use ; instead of | to indicate probability function. However some people like to use | as probability function can be described in a conditional way.\n    \n- And since our assumption that this 3 data points are independent of each other, our joint pdf equation can be simplified to \n    \n    \n$$P\\left(X = [9,9.5,11]~;~ \\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma)\\right) = P(9;\\theta = [\\mu, \\sigma]) \\cdot P(9.5;\\theta = [\\mu, \\sigma]) \\cdot  P(11;\\theta = [\\mu, \\sigma]) = \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{(9-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{(9.5-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{(11-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)~~~~~~~~(2.1)$$\n\nEquation 2.1 above is the joint probability of observing these 3 points and is a function of the parameters, so we suffice to find the parameters that maximize this function. So the intuition is to differentiate equation 2.1 and set it to 0, and solve for the parameter $\\theta$.\n\n- However, the expression in 2.1 is very difficult to differentiate, and that is why it is very common to see we take log\/ln on both sides of the expression \n\n$\\ln\\mathcal{L} = \\ln\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(9-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(9.5-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(11-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]$\n\nand instead maximize the new log-likelihood function instead. But some may be confused, when we solve the \\textbf{parameters} for the above equation, will our parameter still be the one that actually maximizes our equation 2.1? Yes, it does, the proof can be found here (for those who are curious). [proof](https:\/\/math.stackexchange.com\/questions\/647835\/why-does-finding-the-x-that-maximizes-lnfx-is-the-same-as-finding-the#_=_)\n\n- We simplify the above $\\ln\\mathcal{L}$ function to get $$\\ln\\mathcal{L} = -3\\ln(\\sigma)-1.5\\ln(2\\pi) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\left[(9-\\mu)^2+(9.5-\\mu)^2+(11-\\mu)^2\\right]~~~(2.2)$$\n\n- We take the partial derivatives with respect to $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ respectively and set to $0$ to solve equation 2.2, thereby getting our $\\theta$.\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathcal{L})}{\\partial \\mu} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma^2}[9+9.5+11-3\\mu] = 0 \\implies \\mu = 9.833$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathcal{L})}{\\partial \\sigma} = -\\dfrac{3}{\\sigma} + 4\\sigma^{-3}\\left[(9-\\mu)^2+(9.5-\\mu)^2+(11-\\mu)^2\\right] =0 \\implies \\sigma = 1.7$$\n\n- So now we have found the estimate of the real parameter of the population, and we can therefore infer that our populations' probability density function.\n\n- However, we are not really done yet, this example was easy and therefore can be calculated with hand. In reality, there is no closed form solution expression for the coefficient values that maximize the likelihood function, so that an iterative process must be used instead; for example Newton's method. This process begins with a tentative solution, revises it slightly to see if it can be improved, and repeats this revision until no more improvement is made, at which point the process is said to have converged.(Wikipedia)\n\n**It is important to realise that if convergence for the model is not reached, the coefficients\/parameters you obtained may not be meaningful. Therefore, certain assumptions need to be fulfilled for logistic regression.**\n\n**Assumptions of logistic regression and Regularization will be mentioned in part III, which is also the final part of the Logistic Regression Trilogy**.
