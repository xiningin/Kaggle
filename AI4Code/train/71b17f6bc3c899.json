This technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects. In our case, we're going to try to figure out the input's favorite genres from the movies and ratings given.\n\nLet's begin by creating an input user to recommend movies to:\n\nNotice: To add more movies, simply increase the amount of elements in the userInput. Feel free to add more in! Just be sure to write it in with capital letters and if a movie starts with a \"The\", like \"The Matrix\" then write it in like this: 'Matrix, The' .","3d982627":"We're going to start by learning the input's preferences, so let's get the subset of movies that the input has watched from the Dataframe containing genres defined with binary values.","21035ac8":"<img src='https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/S5GWr1r\/Content-recommendation.png'>","e937902a":"With that, let's also split the values in the Genres column into a list of Genres to simplify future use. This can be achieved by applying Python's split string function on the correct column.","e7395769":"We'll only need the actual genre table, so let's clean this up a bit by resetting the index and dropping the movieId, title, genres and year columns.","7622cd83":"# **Explore Files**","e514a9d5":"# Recommendations","3dc0fc15":"# **Preprocessing**","fae1be18":"Now we're ready to start learning the input's preferences!\n\nTo do this, we're going to turn each genre into weights. We can do this by using the input's reviews and multiplying them into the input's genre table and then summing up the resulting table by column. This operation is actually a dot product between a matrix and a vector, so we can simply accomplish by calling Pandas's \"dot\" function.","c15d97e9":"Since keeping genres in a list format isn't optimal for the content-based recommendation system technique, we will use the One Hot Encoding technique to convert the list of genres to a vector where each column corresponds to one possible value of the feature. This encoding is needed for feeding categorical data. In this case, we store every different genre in columns that contain either 1 or 0. 1 shows that a movie has that genre and 0 shows that it doesn't. Let's also store this dataframe in another variable since genres won't be important for our first recommendation system.","80c288d3":"# Advantages and Disadvantages of Content-Based Filtering\n\n<h2>Advantages<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Learns user's preferences<\/li>\n<li>Highly personalized for the user<\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<h2>Disadvantages<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn't take into account what others think of the item, so low quality item recommendations might happen<\/li>\n<li>Extracting data is not always intuitive<\/li>\n<li>Determining what characteristics of the item the user dislikes or likes is not always obvious<\/li>\n    <\/ul>","fe3ac78c":"Let's remove the year from the title column by using pandas' replace function and store in a new year column.","bc90cbcf":"<h2>Recommendation systems<\/h2> They are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user.

Using this, we can recommend movies that satisfy the user's preferences.\n\nLet's start by extracting the genre table from the original dataframe:","f01a2312":"Add movieId to input user\nWith the input complete, let's extract the input movie's ID's from the movies dataframe and add them into it.\n\nWe can achieve this by first filtering out the rows that contain the input movie's title and then merging this subset with the input dataframe. We also drop unnecessary columns for the input to save memory space."}}
