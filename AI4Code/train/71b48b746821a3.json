The advantages of support vector machines are: Effective in high dimensional spaces. Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n#### Can SVM be used for more than 2 classes?\n>In its most simple type, SVM doesn't support multiclass classification natively. It supports binary classification and separating data points into two classes. For multiclass classification, the same principle is utilized after breaking down the multiclassification problem into multiple binary classification problems.\n\nfor more information about svms you can read these articles:\n\nhttps:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/svm.html\n\nhttps:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/support-vector-machine-introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-934a444fca47","82bb10e9":"# Split the Dataset to Train and Test:","759fe3a8":"# Predicting Test data:","fab85dae":"# Train the Model:","a3e1d167":"# Evaluating the Model:","bc437075":"#### as you can see, our model accuracy is not good! for solving that we use grid search to find best hyperparameters for our model.","1129ac73":"#### with grid search, our model accuracy is about 80.","0b03671c":"in this notbook i use titanic dataset."}}
