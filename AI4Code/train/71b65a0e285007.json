We'll compare that later to the US (overall) and other countries. ","e7e487d7":"At this moment, New York State is a global center (unfortunately) in the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 testing was deployed late in the US vs. elsewhere. However, to its credit, the NY State Department of Health is now providing good and timely data on COVID-19 testing. I'll examine some of it here, and also shows how the NY State data compares with data from the rest of the world. Feel free to make constructive suggestions on how to improve on this. (I can't figure out how to take the up to date data automatically from the NY State site. I tried but Kaggle would only read the first 1000 rows automatically, so I had to load it  manually. So if you know how to do that, I'd appreciate it--please put it in the comments below.)","84db2ebc":"Westchester has been hard hit, but has been testing aggressively. Queens, Brooklyn (Kings County) and Nassua are moving up the charts. ","4e65e954":"The above data is from ourworldindata.org, which is a non-profit based out of Oxford,supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. As you can see, the US is still behind some countries like Italy, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, but has made improvements in testing capabilities. Korea used to be a leader but some others have surpassed it, but likely because those countries are in such bad shape and need to conduct more tests than Korea (e.g., Italy). On the whole, though, the hard-hit counties in New York state are well ahead of the US, on a national basis (e.g., Westchester has tested over 8% of its population, while the US has tested under 1.5%). So a concern is that the rest of the US doesn't really know where it stands, having done relatively little testing compared with NY. While they may have had fewer cases, to some degree that's due to lack of testing. \n","9f68f422":"Westchester also leads in terms of percent of the population testing positive--closing in on 3%. ","e69186e7":"So in the US we're doing about 0.8 tests per thousand people in the population right now. Acccording to some estimates, we need to be doing 5 millions tests per day to partially open the economy (that's about 15 tests per thousand in the US population of 328 million). And some estimates require 30 million tests per day in the US in order to fully open the economy.
