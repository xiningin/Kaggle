Management believes that Par\u2019s market share could be increased with the introduction of a cut-resistant, longer-lasting golf ball. Therefore, the research group at Par has been investigating a new golf ball coating designed to resist cuts and provide a more durable ball. The tests with the coating have been promising. One of the researchers voiced concern about the effect of the new coating on driving distances. Par would like the new cut-resistant ball to offer driving distances comparable to those of the current-model golf ball. To compare the driving distances for the two balls, 40 balls of both the new and current models were subjected to distance tests. The testing was performed with a mechanical hitting machine so that any difference between the mean distances for the two models could be attributed to a difference in the design.<\/strong>**","f5be5091":"# <strong style = \"font-family : Roboto ; color : crimson\"> 3. Define a Significance Level <\/strong>\n\n<strong style = \"font-family : Raleway ; font-size : 18px\"> The significance level, also known as alpha or \u03b1, is a measure of the strength of the evidence that must be present in your sample before you will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the effect is statistically significant. It is calculated as: 1-confidence coeffecient (confidence coeffecient is confidence level divided by 100).
