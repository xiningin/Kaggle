You'll notice that the encoder below has two output layers, one for the latent distribution mean (z_mu) and the other for its variance (z_log_sigma).","8d15f8e0":"## *1. Introduction*\nI spent a rainy weekend recently learning about autoencoders using TensorFlow and Keras in Python. I learned that variational autoencoders (VAEs) can be used to visualize high-dimensional data in a meaningful, lower-dimensional space. In this kernel, I go over some details about autoencoding and autoencoders, especially VAEs, before constructing and training a deep VAE on the MNIST data from the Digit Recognizer competition. We'll see how the data cluster in the lower-dimensional space according to their digit class. Plotting the test set data in this space shows where the images with unknown digit classes fall with respect to the known digit classes.\n\nThe code here borrows heavily from Fran&ccedil;ois Chollet's example VAE from his book [Deep Learning with Python](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet\/dp\/1617294438\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1520470984&sr=8-1&keywords=francois+chollet). You can find a repo of examples from the book (including the one that inspired this kernel) [here on GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/brilliantFire\/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks).\n\n### *A. What is autoencoding?*\nAutoencoding is much like what it sounds in the sense that the input and 'output' are essentially the same. It's an algorithm for data compression where the functions for compression and decompression are *learned from the data*. It's considered more of a *semi-supervised* learning method as opposed to a truly *unsupervised* one since it's not entirely 'targetless'. Instead it learns the targets from the data itself.\n\nDespite all this talk of data compression, autoencoders aren't typically used for that purpose. In practice, you're much more likely to see them being used to preprocess data (as in denoising - think images but it doesn't have to be ;) ) or for dimensionality reduction. In fact, the hidden layers of simple autoencoders are doing something like principal component analysis (PCA), another method traditionally used for dimensionality reduction.\n\n### *B. Autoencoders*\nGenerally autoencoders have three parts: an encoder, a decoder, and a 'loss' function that maps one to the other. For the simplest autoencoders - the sort that compress and then reconstruct the original inputs from the compressed representation - we can think of the 'loss' as describing the amount of information lost in the process of reconstruction. Typically when people are talking about autoencoders, they're talking about ones where the encoders and decoders are neural networks (in our case deep convnets). In training the autoencoder, we're optimizing the parameters of the neural networks to minimize the 'loss' (or distance) and we do that by stochastic gradient descent (yet another topic for another post). \n\n### *C. The Variational Variety*\nThere's a bunch of different kinds of autoencoders but for this post I'm going to concentrate on one type called a *variational autoencoder*. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) don't learn to morph the data in and out of a compressed representation of itself like the 'vanilla' autoencoders I described above. Instead, they learn the parameters of the probability distribution that the data came from. These types of autoencoders have much in common with latent factor analysis (if you know something about that). The encoder and decoder learn models that are in terms of underlying, unobserved *latent* variables. It's essentially an inference model and a generative model daisy-chained together.\n\n![A variational autoencoder](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZN6MyTx.png)\n\nVAEs have received a lot of attention because of their *generative* ability (though they seem to be falling out of fashion in favor of general adversarial networks, or GANs, in that regard). Since they learn about the distribution the inputs came from, we can sample from that distribution to generate novel data. As we'll see, VAEs can also be used to cluster data in useful ways.","e2fbab03":"## 5. *Results*  \n### *A. Clustering of digits in the latent space*\nWe can make predictions on the validation set using the encoder network. This has the effect of translating the images from the 784-dimensional input space into the 2-dimensional latent space. When we color-code those translated data points according to their *known* digit class, we can see how the digits cluster together.","78847a58":"## 4. *Train the VAE*\nFinally, we fit the model.","fb044fa8":"### *D. Loss*\nWe need one more thing and that's something that will calculate the unique loss function the VAE requires. Recall that the VAE is trained using a loss function with two components:  \n\n1. 'Reconstruction loss' - This is the cross-entropy describing the errors between the decoded samples from the latent distribution and the original inputs.  \n2. The Kullback-Liebler divergence between the latent distribution and the prior (this acts as a sort of regularization term).  \n\nWe define a custom layer class that calculates the loss. ","8289bc4a":"We can take a look at a few random images. The bottom right panel shows one of the more difficult-to-classify digits (even for humans!).","14a98a90":"### *4.

Split into training & validation sets*\nDespite being trained in a semi-supervised way, the VAE algorithm entails minimizing a 'loss' function. As we'll see shortly, that loss is actually two different 'losses' combined, one that describes the difference between the input images and the images reconstructed from samples from the latent distribution, and another that is the difference between the latent distribution and the prior (the inputs). We can calculate this loss on a validation set with each training epoch as an estimate of how the model describes data it was not trained on.  \n\nRemember that we've combined the original train and test data so the *new* train and validation sets that we make below will each have some images with missing ('11') labels.","dd108b50":"We want to train the autoencoder with as many images as possible.
