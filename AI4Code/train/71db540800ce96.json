Transparent Colors in Lego Sets\n<p>The <code>colors<\/code> data has a column named <code>is_trans<\/code> that indicates whether a color is transparent or not.

Introduction\n<p>Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one). Did you know by the way that \"Lego\" was derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means \"play well\"?
