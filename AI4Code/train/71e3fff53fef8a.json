has the least number of countries.\n* Most of the Countries have a population of 400k to 17 million and Countries with small population are much more common than that with larger populations.\n* Smaller cointries are more common than larger ones with areas ranging from 4k to 400k square miles.\n* Thinly populated cointries are more common.\n* Most of the Counries have very little coastline wrt to their land area.\n* Half of the world' population havE of 92% literacy and above.\n* Net migration is moderately corelated to GDP as people generally flock to countries with high GDP.\n* Most of the people around the world don't own a phone, while a few have more than a one phone.\n* Most of the countries have less than 20% arable land, they use less than 5% to grow crops.\n* Agricultural sector contributes to less than 25% of 75% coubtries of the world, Industrial sector makes one third of the world occupation\/profession, Service sector contributes to about two third of the world occupation\/profession.\n* Eatern countries Asia contribute more than half of the World's population with China and India is the top two populous countries with USA as a distant thrid.\n* African Countries have the highest mortality rate.\n* East Asia and West Europe has the higest population densities with Monaco, macau, Singapore, Honk kong has the highest pop. density, each of them are city-country, or micro-state.\n* Clear negative correlation between literacy and infant mortality rate, showing highly literate countries have low mortality rate.\n* Both Birth and Death rate have a high correlation with Infant Mortality rate (eg:Sub-Saharan Africa has the Highest Death and Infant mortality rate).\n* Unfortunatey about 11% of the countries have Deathrate higher than birthrate.\n* Some how Climate 2 and 5 favour high GDP.\n* West European Countries, Oceania along with US, Canada and Japan have the highest GDPs in the world.\n* Higher GDP Countries don't rely on Agriculture as much as the poorer countries.\n* GDP is highly correlated with Service sector.\n* GDP grows as Industries grows and then falls after a certain threshold.\n* And on a very sad note, the standard deviation of GDP per capita is higher than the mean, which shows how uneually wealthy some countries are, thus countries like Luxembourg, Norway and Us are way too rich while countries like Somalia, Sierra Leone\tand Tanzania are very poor.","37c8478d":"### Climate vs GDP","306ccc3a":"**Observations**\n* Sub-Saharan Africa region has the higest number of countries\n* Baltics region has the least
