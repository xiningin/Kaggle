A\/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or \"two-sample hypothesis testing\" as used in the field of statistics. A\/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.\n\n<font color = 'blue'>\nContent: \n\n1.

Business Problem\nA ...... company recently introduced a new bidding type, \u201caverage bidding\u201d, as an alternative to its exisiting bidding type, called \u201cmaximum bidding\u201d. One of our clients, --------.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A\/B test to understand if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.\n\nIn this A\/B test, --------.com randomly splits its audience into two equally sized groups, e.g. the test and the control group. A --------- company ad campaign with \u201cmaximum bidding\u201d is served to \u201ccontrol group\u201d and another campaign with \u201caverage bidding\u201d is served to the \u201ctest group\u201d.\n\nThe A\/B test has run for 1 month and --------.com now expects you to analyze and present the results of this A\/B test.\n\n\nYou should answer the following questions in your presentation:\n\n* How would you define the hypothesis of this A\/B test?\n* Can we conclude statistically significant results?\n* Which statistical test did you use, and why?\n* Based on your answer to Question 2, what would be your recommendation to client?","4037d39d":"<a id = \"2\"><\/a><br>\n## 2.
