Despite being commonly referred as *Waterloo battle*, direct meaning of this word is the municipality, not the famous Napoleon's combat. Thus Waterloo might be a battle, but primarily it is a geographic name, thus the pair is *neutral*.\n2. **Is Bauerstein a doctor?** Given you have just read Agatha Cristie's novel *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, you may recall Dr. Bauerstein and give a positive answer. We should account for no prior knowledge of Agatha Cristie and in this case Bauersten is just a random surname, so the pair is *neutral*.\n3. **Are Alfred Inglethorp and Bauerstein the same person?** Obviously they are not, given you are familiar with Agatha Cristie's *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*. On the other hand, the pair is not \"Agatha Cristie's Bauerstein\" vs \"Agatha Cristie's Alfred Inglethorp\", so we should treat those names without any connection to the original novel. In this case those are just random surnames, which are different and are thus *contradictionary*.\n\nOne might argue the last statement, as sometimes a person has two names. For example, how would you label the pair *Agatha Cristie* and *Mary Westmacott*? (the latter is one of her pseudonyms)\n* Following the logic of *Alfred Inglethorp vs Bauerstein*, as the names are different, we should say it is *contradictionary*.\n* Given the knowledge that Mary Westmacott is Agatha Cristie's pseudonym, we should say it is an *entailement*.\n* Given the knowledge that there are thousands of people with the very same name, Agatha Christie, the pair might be *neutral*.\n\nThis leads to a conclusion, that humans judge on the meaning of the sentence pairs given **prior knowledge** and **context**. \n\nIn certain cases one could interprete the very same pairs of sentences differently given different knowledge and context.\n\n> Should our model be aware of the Agatha Cristie and Napoleon? \n\n![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/www.forwardit.lv\/kaggle\/napoleon_vs_agatha_cristie.png)","9468d746":"![](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/www.forwardit.lv\/kaggle\/headline.png)","4d7a0fb2":"# Resources\n\n1. https:\/\/www.arxiv-vanity.com\/papers\/1803.02324\/","d23d365e":"Let's inspect one of the sentence pairs consisting of: \"Yes, sir\" and \"I will take care of that right away Sir\".

Yes sir!\n\nDespite having very similar meaning, the resulting label is different depending on sentence order! Why is this happening? Word count. **Longer sentence naturally conveys more information than a shorter one**\n1. In case longer sentence is a hypothesis (as in Case 1), we could assume the pair is more likely to be contradictory (or at least neutral), because longer sentence have more chances to contain information that contradicts a premise.\n2. In case longer sentence is a premise (as in Case 2) the pair is more likely to be entailed, just because shorter hypothesis has fewer chances to be contradictory.\n\nLet's check this idea by introducing additional feature - **word count ratio**:"}}
