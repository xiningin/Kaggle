Many small equities are independant of the main market since they are not included in some indexes or they have too small market cap to influence the indexes.\n\n![DAG showing the 7 Industries and surrounding Equities](https:\/\/www.elmtreegarden.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/BN-of-top-pure-equities.jpg)\n\nOops. This DAG does not show arc directions. I'll try and update this soon so you can see Parent\/Child relations.\n\nWith the model above, external forces can be modeled with a markov blanket over the Equity to be estimated. By example, to estimate Equity 61 volatility, we need Equities ((parent) 84 , (children) 96, 76, 73, 86 63, 113, 77 as external forces. A more simple example is Equity 6 which if the target, we need only it's parent Equity 63 as an external force.\n\nBNs offer this very tractable solution.

Index funds are grouping of stock portfolios over a given type of stock. The matrix of prices in df Price was used to learn this BN.

Bayesia.com\n\n![BN of Price dT](https:\/\/www.elmtreegarden.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/BN-of-price-dT.jpg)\n\nTo find other stock relationships, I think I will first remove the Index stocks and re-cluster the variables. Equities (29, 69, 124, 43, 50, 44, 14, 111, 56) all seem to be index funds.\n\nSome stock \"types' have emerged: Equities (35, 119, 32) are in same class (industry?). Also Equities (36, 124,56) are in a class.\n\nNote that many stocks have no connections with the BN. Maybe I can improve this by: \n1. Increasing the number of bins that the stock dT can have. This BN based on 3 Kmeans bins (will try 5 Kmeans bins with log transformation) and perhaps a larger sample size (1% used here).\n2. Eliminating the Index funds from the network before learning.\n\nOr maybe these small stocks, not included in the indexes, will be more independant and have greater volatility? Small caliber companies will have greater price volatility so it is natural they will produce lots of WAP. Example Equity 0.\n\nThe Indexes will have an accumilation of Caliber from each Equity from which they are composed. I predict this will mean that the indexes will have lowest WAP. Example Equity 29.\n\n## Strategy for models of External Forces\nBased on the DAG of \"Index Funds\" above, I will try to make different Hamiltonian Models for three types of Equities:\n1. \"Index Funds\": Equities (29, 69, 124, 43, 50, 44, 14, 111, 56) all have greatest mutual information with each other. Build a BN showing this network of external forces for each fund.External forces will be modeled with a probabilistic structural equation, such as force = b1 x dT1 + b2 x dT2 + ... using other funds as forces.\n2. \"Heavily Traded Equities\": Equities (1, 10, 36, 123, 39, 41, 99, 32, 35, 108, 119, 2, 93, 125, 13, 51, 6, 63, 81, 61, 84, 120, 17, 20, 26, 28, 34, 42, 47, 48, 52, 62, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 77, 80, 85, 86, 95, 96, 100, 101, 109, 113, 122, 46, 8, 15) that produce a BN with Index Funds ignored. External forces will be modeled with a probabilistic structural equation, such as force = b1 x dT1 + b2 x dT2 + ...\n3. \"Low Volume Equities\": Equities (0,3,4,5,7,9,11,16,18,19,21,22,23,27,30,31,33,37,38,40,53,55,58,59,60,66,68,72,74,75,78,82,83,87,88,89,90,94,97,98,102,103,104,105,107,110,112,114,115,116,118,126) the remaining equities with weak mutual information to other equities and Funds will be assumed to have no external forces. This should simplify the solution of the Hamiltonian to Book Caliber and Trades.\n","34b02824":"## Calculate the Sum of Forces on an Equity\n\nI will use the simple Bayesian Network model of Composite equities first, since they are just 9 equities and will use least memory","c9db4153":"## Work in progress\nNext Steps:\n1.

Solve for most likely price volatility given most recent History<br>","6bb97845":"# Energy Equations for each Equity Type","8b20c036":"# Hamiltonian Equation for a Marketplace described as Energy\n\nAssuming natural forces apply to the business of a Marketplace and that cash is conserved, then the total energy of the Marketplace is the sum of the Potential Energy in the Book, plus the Kinetic Energy of transactions, less Marketplace transaction costs, plus the sum of external forces that weigh on or lift up equity prices in the Book. Consistant with the conservation of energy, the sum of these energies will remain constant over time so that the change in Marketplace energy over time tau is 0. The first solution of the equation is momentum of the price of each equity while the second order solution will be the final value of each equity T(t<sub>f<\/sub>)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.elmtreegarden.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/image-768x103.png)\n\nU is business value = Nk x Tk<br>\ndU is the change in business value = Nk x dTk<br>\nNk = equity shares outstanding<br>\nPrice change of Equity k = dTk = (T(t=tf)-T(t=0)\/T(t=0)<br>\nQ is internal energy of business including cash<br>\nW are costs of operations<br>\n\u03d5i - \u03d5j  is potential produced by seller i and buyer j<br>\n\u03d5i - \u03d5j = 1 \/ (Ti - Tj) is potential to Trade<br>\nNi, is number of units traded. It is a vector with length i.<br>\n\nLet T(EQ(t)) be the market price of equity EQ at time t. The expected value of T, is market price. If either buyers or sellers place no bids, then T is unidentifiable and price volatility is maximum and N, shares traded, is zero. As many buyers and sellers 'crowd' the marketplace with bids, volatility, del T, will decline and N, shares traded, will increase.\n\nThis contest has given us data on the \"Target\" del T = dT\/T. Actual price of the Equity k is T<sub>k<\/sub>. I'll need to consider how this affects the formulation of the Hamiltonian.\n\n## Caliber of the Book's Price\/Volume distribution S (T,N|<sub>H<\/sub>)\n\nS (T,N|<sub>H<\/sub>) is read: \"*Caliber of T and N given History H.*\" Or the \"*Caliber of the Book's price\/volume distribution (buyers and sellers) over History H.*\" Or **Book Caliber**.\n\nAs the system emerges into the \"now\", Book Caliber is the cross section area of the possible futures the system may take on consistant with the History. The book with most possible trading options will have the least volatility. With more choices of trades (bigger Caliber) the marketmaker is more likely to find optimal (Ta ~= Tb) conditions for trading. Low Book Caliber indicates few trading choices for the marketmaker and fewer options to find optimal trades. If log base 2 is used then S ** 2 is the marketmakers number of choices.\n\n![image.png](attachment:a676d032-7c9b-4b87-aa21-31c8bca4b40c.png)\n\nBook Caliber is measured directly from the Book of Orders for each History. del Q in the Hamiltonian above, then is the change in potential energy of the Book of Orders over a History.\n\n## Change in potential (or internal) Energy dQ = dT S + T dS + dCash\n\nThe potential energy change of a company can be described in three terms:\n1. S dT\/dt: Caliber x Change in market price of Equity \n2. T dS\/dt: Price x Change in Goodwill. Goodwill of traders is a proxy for company's customer Goodwill.\n3. dCash\/dt: Free cash flow (cash is \"Socialized Free Energy\" per [Wayne])\n\n## Kinetic Energy of Equity Sales\n\nConductance of business, N shares sold at price T, occurs when agreement on N and T exists. As (Ti - Tj) grows larger, trading declines. Volume, N, is constrained to min(Ni, Nj). Kinetic energy of cash flow of trades in a History is the sum of T<sub>i<\/sub> * N<sub>i<\/sub>. This information comes from the Trades.\n\nSales is an exchange of potential energy for free energy. The Seller gets Free Energy (cash) and the Buyer obtains Potential Energy of the Equity. Energy of the trade is NT. No Energy is created. Energy changes form in the balance sheet of each trader. This leads me to believe that the sum of Kinetic = 0. Unless we seek more than an estimate of dT.\n\nI will assume that the marketmaker makes no profit in these trades. But I suspect that W, trading costs, are a function of T<sub>k<\/sub> and N<sub>i<\/sub>. So that W = r x T<sub>k<\/sub> x N<sub>i<\/sub>\n\n## External Forces\n\nEach book is influenced by many external forces. The price of equity A and equity B may have mutual information, this is to say each imparts a force on each other's price, or that dT1 = force(dT2). These forces may be modeled using a simple Bayesian Network, **BN**. The DAG of the model will indicate the forces on each Equity impossed by price changes in other Equities. \n\nIn the equation above, X<sub>i<\/sub> is an external force on and equities price T causing a price change dx<sub>i<\/sub>. We have 112 Equities in our Book, so to see how each equity directly affects another's price, we need a 112 X 112 matrix to model these forces. But using a BN to describe the data we will find a much smaller Mutual Information matrix (found below as a BN model of dT).\n\nComposit Equities (or Index Equities) have been found. I will model these 8 Equities as a BN.\n\nI'll also look for \"Industries\" or groups of Equities in nearly same business. Those found are color coded in the BN of \"Big\" Equities below. \n\nTaxes are another external force. Sellers of equities pay a Tax on Gains. This can be seen as \"Work\" produced by sellers too. But I see Taxes as an external force in this notebook, since I will assume each trader pays the same tax rate on gains. One Tax rate seems like a reasonable assumption. Taxes fit better the model as Work since they produce a cash flow. External forces from other Equities however cause no cash flow, but rather affect the Equity's price T.\n\n## Energy Change Equation\n\nApplying the assumptions above here is the final model of each Equity's Energy.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.elmtreegarden.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/final-dU.jpg)\n\nThe Parents and Children both place direct forces on an Equity in these DAGs. So the model Hamiltonian of any Equity is:\n\n![](https:\/\/www.elmtreegarden.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/final-dU-w-BN-constants-k.jpg)\n\nIf there would be no overall Jacobian of the traders, or that traders have no control of the market, then the Hamiltonian presents a differential equation, whose solution is the future trajectory of the 'un-controlled' system. Here is some algebra on the Hamiltonian to reach the differential equation of price T:\n\n![](https:\/\/www.elmtreegarden.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/differential-equation-of-price-2.jpg)\n\nI will use these two general equations and try to solve for dT\/dt, which can be transformed to the target sigma.\n\nIn [Kirk] the author presents Pontryagin's minimum principle's method of finding the optimum trajectory of a dynamic system. These items are like a recipe for problem set-up and will produce the final differential equation whose solution predicts the future states of the marketplace; dT(t), and N(t). Guessing dT(t) is the goal of this competition.\n\n1. a defined coordinate system and system states\n2. the Hamiltonian\n3. initial and final conditions\n4. constraints\n5. the Jacobian J, which is the measure of performance to minimize. \n\nAs I remember the biggest challenge is problem set-up. Instead of using Calculus to solve the differential equations, I'll try to use numerical calculus to produce the Equity's future trajectory.\n\n### The Jacobian is the goal of Traders\n\nThe goal of traders is to increase the value of their portfolio of Equities and cash while managing risk. I think then a good measure of their portfolio's value = T S N + cash. Risk is 1\/ S . And S is the goal Caliber of their Book of Equities.\n\nThe goal of Composit funds is to maintain a certain distribution of Stocks S*. With each trader's order for Composit shares, an order for an equal amount of the basket of stocks in the Composit by the Composit.\n\nA greedy trader, one seeking arbitrage, will have goal to maximize the quantity = TN + cash.\n\n## References\nWayne, James J., 2013. \u201cFundamental Equation of Economics,\u201d MPRA Paper 50695, University Library of Munich, Germany.<br>\nRoss, Michael I.; \"A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control\", Second Edition, Collegiate Publishers<br>\nKirk, Donald,J., 1967, \u201cOptimal Control Theory\u201d, Prentice Hall<br>\nHamill, Patrick, 2014, \u201cLagrangians and Hamiltonians: A Student Guide to\u201d, Cambridge University Press<br>\nJaynes, E.T., \u201cThe Minimum Entropy Production Principle\u201c,<br>\nWikiPedia, \u201cThermodynamic Potential\u201c,<br>\nJones, J., 2021, \"[Fundamental Equation of Business Potentials](https:\/\/www.elmtreegarden.com\/bayesian-networks\/fundamental-equation-of-business-potentials\/)\", ElmTreeGarden.com<br>\nConrady, Stefan, 2018 \"[Knowledge Discovery In Financial Data](https:\/\/www.bayesia.com\/hubfs\/2018-06-19%20Knowledge%20Discovery%20in%20Financial%20Data\/2018-06-19%20Knowledge%20Discovery%20in%20Financial%20Data%20Chicago.pdf)\",bayesia.com<br>\n\n## Dedication\nThanks to my good friend and CPA, Jerry Eaton, who encourages me to write on this topic.","728f7dd5":"## Bayesian Network Showing 4 Classes of Index Funds\n\nThese equities have tremendous mutual information as seen by line thickness in the following DAG.
