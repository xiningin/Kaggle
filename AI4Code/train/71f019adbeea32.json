All of them include at least some retired health care workers (HCP), some of whom may have no longer been working as HCP.

I'll show a table of fractions with the absolute numbers, below.","578d7895":"# Introduction\n<p>\nTo do a proper job on this task, one would need highly detailed data on each clinician infected with COVID-19. But for privacy reasons, that data is highly unlikely to be made available to amateurs like us.  Also, it's not clear that even the experts, like the US CDC, has good data on this (see below).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nA fallback might be to do a careful search of local newspapers and published obituaries.  This is a big job.  It could be crowdsourced if the idea is found interesting enough.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAs a fallback-to-the-fallback, one could use several online memorial lists of health workers who have succumbed to COVID-19.  The data collection processes are obscure and probably biased, but the result could at least be a pointer to things to look at with better data, and give some idea whether it's worth proceeding with better data collection.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe published lists I've found so far require a lot of hand-work to make them machine readable, but I've done this.  There are also copyright questions (one web site has already refused to allow me to make their list available on Kaggle).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe published memorial lists do give occupational data\/medical specialty for the deceased, which is what I plan to concentrate on.","18ab4ec1":"# Executive Summary\n<p>\nIt's hard to characterize the populations of clinicians most likely to contract COVID-19.  It is possible to get a feel for the breakdown by specialty\/occupation by using online lists set up as memorials to healthcare workers who have died of COVID-19.  The data is likely incomplete and biased, but may suggest a direction for better studies.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nOffhand, I would have expected Emergency Medicine personnel to dominate the list.  In data for several countries, nurses, healthcare assistants and support workers always comprise a large share of the fallen.  Interestingly, though, General Practitioners are the specialty among physicians, not Emergency Medicine.  Admittedly this may be partly to do with how I have coded the occupations, but I don't think this entirely accounts for this effect.  It may be worth looking into ways to protect General Practitioners better.","afcaa89b":"# Italian Data from the FNOMCeO List\n<p>\nThe following plot shows the raw counts of workers by specialty\/occupation.","172e392b":"# Published Studies on Clinicians Dying of COVID-19\n<p>\nA recent CDC study:\n<\/p>\n<p>\nCharacteristics of Health Care Personnel with COVID-19 \u2014 United States, February 12\u2013April 9, 2020\n<\/p>\n<p>\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/69\/wr\/mm6915e6.htm\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe authors note that since healthcare-worker status was only avaiable for 16% of reported cases nationwide, their data is likely only only a subset.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere is a Chinese study which does break down deaths by medical specialty:\n<\/p>\n<p>\nDeath from Covid-19 of 23 Health Care Workers in China\n<\/p>\n<p>\nhttps:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMc2005696?rss=searchAndBrowse\n"}}
