Until recently child marriages(Marriage at a very young age) were very prominent in India. With time the number of child marriages have decreased but still in the rural parts of India these practices still persist. We will visualize Rural India and Urban India for this, since literacy rate in Urban region is more the amount of child marriages will certainly be less as compared to Rural areas.\n**","333dd766":"**Here we see that theres not much difference in the percentage of marriages in different agge groups in lower ages. So we cant really say that religion affects the age of marriage.**\n\n# Conclusion\n**We see that child marriage is still quite prominent in India, more in Rural areas than Urban. We also see that religion might not be a determining factor for the same. So the most obvious reasons would be poverty and illiteracy.**\n\nThis was my first ever visualisation notebook. Please critique it and tell me what you think and what else could be added. Some more ideas I had were including sex of individuals. This visualisation doesnt tell something concrete and was mostly to practice my skills and hence would be pretty sloppy.\n\nDatasets were obtained from \"censusindia.gov.in\" and cleaned in google sheets.\n\nThanks for reading!!","a29254c5":"**Above graph shows Percentage of marriages in different age groups in India. We can see that most marriages are done between the age of 18 to 21, which is still pretty young. We also see that almost 2% of marriages are done before the age of 10, this figure is very worrying. The total number of marriages done are 640,021,008, 2% of that is 12,800,420. This number is still very high. **\n\n**Next we will see a visualization of Rural v\/s Urban.**","fc6ec5a2":"**Above graph shows the percentage of marriages in each age group in Rural as well as Urban areas. We can immediately see that the total number of marriages in rural areas is more. Also marriage at a young age is also very common in rural. One of the reasons could be the low literacy rate and maybe poverty.**\n\n**Now lets look at distribution by religious communities. This time we would use line charts to visualise the percentage by religions.**"}}
