Python functions are allowed much more flexibility. The `print` function is a good example of this:","5359f6bc":"## Functions that don't return\n\nWhat would happen if we didn't include the `return` keyword in our function?","de3f3c0a":"This creates a function called `least_difference`, which takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\nFunctions start with a header introduced by the `def` keyword. The indented block of code following the `:` is run when the function is called.\n\n`return` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.\n\nIs it clear what `least_difference()` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:","9fa13b52":"> **Aside: example calls**\n> The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The `>>>` is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example of, see [this docstring for the numpy function `np.eye`](https:\/\/github.com\/numpy\/numpy\/blob\/v1.14.2\/numpy\/lib\/twodim_base.py#L140-L194).","c6e14620":"We can even ask Python to print `f` out:","a9433b63":"Python evaluates an expression like this from the inside out. First it calculates the value of `abs(-2)`, then it provides help on whatever the value of that expression is.\n\n<small>(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers! In Python, even something as simple-seeming as an integer is actually an object with a fair amount of internal complexity. After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the voluminous help output above will make more sense.)<\/small>\n\n`abs` is a very simple function with a short docstring. `help` shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like `print`:","9a3278c2":"Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of \"null\" in other languages.)\n\nWithout a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.","11d5c2da":"Or maybe the `help()` function can tell us something about it.","edf0a501":"## Defining functions\n\nBuiltin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.","5691fc8a":"The syntax for creating them may be different, but `f` and `x` in the code above aren't so fundamentally different.

This opens up some interesting possibilities - we can *call* the function we receive as an argument.","ad7025a5":"With judicious use of lambdas, you can occasionally solve complex problems in a single line.
