We can see that it has an Id column that points to the Id of the picture that the row is refering to. Also we have a lot of binary data - Eyes, Face, Near,... - that labels whether the image contains a view of the respective column name. At last we have the Pawpularity score.","04904919":"At least to me, these pictures do not seem very different; maybe a lot of noise in the data.

The dataset consists of both images and tabular data, where the tabular data just describes the content in the image. The task is to predict the Pawpularity score - a measure for quality of the given picture; aiming to generate traction.","a6f538ef":"This gives a good visual interpretation of the values in our CSV file. Now I am going to take a quick look at the distribution of our target variable, the Pawpularity score.","645914cb":"We can see some correlations, but overall the predictor variables do not seem to give us much information about the Pawpularity score itself. It rather only states the obvious. For example Eyes and Face have a high positive relationship, meaning that if the face is visible, then the eyes are aswell and vice versa. Maybe we can get a bit more intuition for the score based on looking at extreme values, i.e. pictures with a very low or high Pawpularity score."}}
