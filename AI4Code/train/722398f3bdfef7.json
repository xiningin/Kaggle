From that device, we collect the data 3 days consecutively with 10 minutes time interval for each measurement. Then, the collected data should be explored and analyzed by conductiong Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insight related to gained data.\nThe aim for this project is to learn to design, plan, and build the IoT Devices that not just to use it, but for gaining more information. \n\nWe got the data from 1-10-2021 to 7-10-2021. For any reason, i decide to use data from 2-10-2021 to 6-10-2021.\nI use two separated kind of data, one for temperature and the other is for lux.\nWe have 582 row of data for this moment, it's coherently correct for data that gained for 4 days (4 * 24 * 6 = 576, 4 days, in each days is 24 hours, in each hours is 6 datas).\n\nThe data have a lot of NaN value, so we need preprocess it and work with it.\nAlso, either the temperature measurement or the light intensity measurement, it is relatively have a big error.\nI will explain it later.","1cd4d076":"> Since the time columns is considered as object type, we have to convert it to datetime format to make it more convenient when dealing with timeseries plot\n\nAlso, let's convert it from UTC timezone to Indonesian West Time Zone (WIB) UTC+7.
