It was created by a software engineer in Brooklyn for his partner.\"\n\n\n\"Josh Wardle, a software engineer in Brooklyn, knew his partner loved word games, so he created a guessing game for just the two of them. As a play on his last name, he named it Wordle.\"\n\n\"But after the couple played for months, and after it rapidly became an obsession in his family\u2019s WhatsApp group once he introduced it to relatives, Mr. Wardle thought he might be on to something and released it to the rest of the world in October.\"\n\n\"Few such popular corners of the internet are as low-frills as the website, which Mr. Wardle built himself as a side project. There are no ads or flashing banners; no windows pop up or ask for money. There is merely the game on a black background.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/01\/03\/technology\/wordle-word-game-creator.html","fd9ad796":"#That sucks since I was not able to visualize anything!","c54a1690":"#Code by Rishi Patel https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/patelris\/ner-using-spacy-roberta","c19fda4c":"#Since I could not visualize anything I'll find another text to check how this code works.","dafa0b4f":"Acknowledgement:\n\nRishi Patel https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/patelris\/ner-using-spacy-roberta"}}
