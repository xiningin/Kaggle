2020;9:e49979 DOI: 10.7554\/eLife.49979\n\n\"In high-income countries, the biggest cause of premature death, defined as death before 70 years, is smoking of manufactured cigarettes. Smoking-related disease was responsible for about 41 million deaths in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, cumulatively, from 1960 to 2020. Every million cigarettes smoked leads to one death in the US and Canada, but slightly more than one death in the UK. The 21st century hazards reveal that smokers who start smoking early in adult life and do not quit lose a decade of life expectancy versus non-smokers. Cessation, particularly before age 40 years, yields large reductions in mortality risk. Up to two-thirds of deaths among smokers are avoidable at non-smoking death rates, and former smokers have about only a quarter of the excess risk of death compared to current smokers. The gap between scientific and popular understanding of smoking hazards is surprisingly large.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/elifesciences.org\/articles\/49979","8bfc7403":"\"Scientific evidence for the causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer is based on studies of individuals and groups, studies in animals and humans, studies that are observational or experimental, studies in laboratories and communities, and studies in both underdeveloped and developed countries.\"\n\n\"The scientific evidence collected is applicable to both groups and individuals. The probability of causation, which is calculated based on the attributable fraction for the association between smoking and lung cancer, could be utilized as evidence to prove causality in individuals.\"\n\nCitation:  Author Khang, Young-Ho, Published - 2015\/05\/31 - e2015026 \"Causality between Smoking and Lung Cancer among Groups and Individuals: Addressing Issues in Tobacco Litigation in South Korea\"\nVL 37 - DOI 10.4178\/epih\/e2015026 - Journal Epidemiology and Health\n\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/277964448_Causality_between_Smoking_and_Lung_Cancer_among_Groups_and_Individuals_Addressing_Issues_in_Tobacco_Litigation_in_South_Korea","2b7819f5":"**<span style=\"color:#008080;\">When A and B are correlated, there are at least four possible explanations<\/span>**\n\nA causes B\n\nB causes A\n\nA and B are both caused by a third variable, C.\n\nChance (the correlation is spurious).\n\n\"So how was the causal link between cigarettes and lung cancer established? In the 50s and 60s a large number of studies came out that confirmed the correlation. Furthermore, studies also showed that heavier smokers suffered more cancer than lighter smokers, and that pipe smokers developed more lip cancer while cigarette smokers developed more lung cancer.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/correlation-does-not-imply-causation-92e4832a6713"}}
