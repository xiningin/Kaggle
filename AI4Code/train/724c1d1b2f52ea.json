Here's your coding interview problem for today.\n\nThis problem was asked by Amazon.\n\nGiven a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one with the maximum length, return any one.\n\nFor example, the longest palindromic substring of \"aabcdcb\" is \"bcdcb\". The longest palindromic substring of \"bananas\" is \"anana\"."}}
