The choices we make in this step to address data issues can impact downstream steps and the result itself. For example, it can be tricky to address missing data when we don't know why it's missing. Is it missing completely at random or not? It can also be tricky to address outliers if we do not understand the domain and problem context enough.","8783507f":"## Step 1: Set-up and understand data\nThis step helps uncover issues that we will want to address in the next step and take into account when building and evaluating our model.

It is not an alternative to actually taking the time to learn. What it aims to do is help someone get started fast and gain intuitive understanding of the typical steps early on.","b00cc046":"## Learn more\nIf you found this example interesting, you may also want to check out:\n\n* [Machine learning in minutes - very fast fundamental examples in Python](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jamiemorales\/machine-learning-in-minutes-very-fast-examples)\n* [List of machine learning methods & datasets](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jamiemorales\/list-of-machine-learning-methods-datasets)\n\nThanks for reading.
