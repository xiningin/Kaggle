If you're somewhat like me you will think twice before going through this whole document.\n\n## TLDR Version\nThis dataset contains information on suicide rates between 1985 and 2015 for 100 countries in the world. Year 2016 is included in the data but it is assumed to be incomplete. Not all countries are present in all years. It is divided in age groups and gender. I start analyzing changes over years and find a peak in 1995 which I later attribute to Russia's increasing suicides. \n\nI then group the countries into regions but found nothing of interest. In countries granularity I plot the top 10 for both extremes (low and high) for all years and more recently. While in the low end the top 10 didn't change a lot, the high suicide rates top 10 changed quite a bit for the last few years. \n\nI proceed analysing age groups and gender to find a pattern of higher number of suicides in males and older people. This varies for each country but it is an overall trend. I do not analyse generations.\n\nOn looking at GDP I plot its correlation with suicide rates for every country and find two different clusters of countries which I name low and high quadrants. Both have opposite correlations between SR and GDP. I discuss my personal opinion on that by the end of chapter 4.\n\nI later add data on Religion and world temperature. The analysis suggests higher temperatures and a more religious country lowers suicide rates. \n\nIn chapter 6 I provide an interactive dashboard to see how each country in the dataset is doing. Finally, in chapter 7, I present this work's conclusions.","4cc183d7":"We do have an increase in the number of countries since the beginning of the dataset.

It is a mess. I intentionally hid the legend because I don't want to look at each country just yet;\n- Some countries do show a positive correlation, some show a negative correlation and some look just random.;\n- Money alone is definitely not a factor (we wouldn't have opposite effects otherwise). We can also say that those *apparent correlations* are most likely **not causations**.\n- It looks like the countries in our plot mostly reside in two quadrants, Low SR\/GDP and High SR\/GDP. \n- On top of that, countries that are in the 'Low Quadrant' seem to have a positive correlation with GDP, while the countries in the 'High Quadrant' don't.\n\nWell, this is still too messy.
