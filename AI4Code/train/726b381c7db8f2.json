RNNs process a time series step-by-step, maintaining an internal state summarizing the information they've seen so far. For more details, read the [RNN tutorial](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/sequences\/recurrent). In this tutorial, you will use a specialized RNN layer called Long Short Term Memory ([LSTM](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/versions\/r2.0\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/keras\/layers\/LSTM))\n\nLet's now use `tf.data` to shuffle, batch, and cache the dataset.","96d7175e":"In this plot and subsequent similar plots, the history and the future data are sampled every hour.","5c5c5dba":"Let's take a glance at the data.","cc0220e1":"As you can see above, an observation is recorded every 10 mintues. This means that, for a single hour, you will have 6 observations. Similarly, a single day will contain 144 (6x24) observations.\n\nGiven a specific time, let's say you want to predict the temperature 6 hours in the future. In order to make this prediction, you choose to use 5 days of observations. Thus, you would create a window containing the last 720(5x144) observations to train the model. Many such configurations are possible, making this dataset a good one to experiment with.\n\nThe function below returns the above described windows of time for the model to train on. The parameter history_size is the size of the past window of information. The target_size is how far in the future does the model need to learn to predict. The target_size is the label that needs to be predicted.\n","e9ebc202":"### Single step model\nIn a single step setup, the model learns to predict a single point in the future based on some history provided.\n\nThe below function performs the same windowing task as below, however, here it samples the past observation based on the step size given.","b010f179":"It is important to scale features before training a neural network. Standardization is a common way of doing this scaling by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.You could also use a `tf.keras.utils.normalize` method that rescales the values into a range of [0,1].","c7adc931":"The following visualisation should help you understand how the data is represented after batching.\n\n![Time Series](images\/time_series.png)","41dacc23":"Let's check out a sample data-point.","6fb294ca":"Let's standardize the data.","2f5957f0":"## Next steps\nThis tutorial was a quick introduction to time series forecasting using an RNN.

This means that, for a single hour, you will have 6 observations. Similarly, a single day will contain 144 (6x24) observations. \n\nGiven a specific time, let's say you want to predict the temperature 6 hours in the future. In order to make this prediction, you choose to use 5 days of observations. Thus, you would create a window containing the last 720(5x144) observations to train the model. Many such configurations are possible, making this dataset a good one to experiment with.\n\nThe function below returns the above described windows of time for the model to train on. The parameter `history_size` is the size of the past window of information. The `target_size` is how far in the future does the model need to learn to predict. The `target_size` is the label that needs to be predicted.","12b8d15b":"Let's train the model now.

These were collected every 10 minutes, beginning in 2003. For efficiency, you will use only the data collected between 2009 and 2016.

Thus, unlike a single step model, where only a single future point is predicted, a multi-step model predict a sequence of the future.\n\nFor the multi-step model, the training data again consists of recordings over the past five days sampled every hour. However, here, the model needs to learn to predict the temperature for the next 12 hours. Since an obversation is taken every 10 minutes, the output is 72 predictions. For this task, the dataset needs to be prepared accordingly, thus the first step is just to create it again, but with a different target window.","3b03e12d":"In this tutorial, the network is shown data from the last five (5) days, i.e. 720 observations that are sampled every hour. The sampling is done every one hour since a drastic change is not expected within 60 minutes. Thus, 120 observation represent history of the last five days.  For the single step prediction model, the label for a datapoint is the temperature 12 hours into the future. In order to create a label for this, the temperature after 72(12*6) observations is used.","03ce37b1":"In both the following tutorials, the first 300,000 rows of the data will be the training dataset, and there remaining will be the validation dataset.
