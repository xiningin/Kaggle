This shows that there are places where users should be interacting vs. those where it's wasted.\n\nWe also see that worlds have similar patterns. For example, in the Crystal Caves shown an the bottom there are many cases of even interacting on left and right compared to the asymmetric behaviour of the other worlds. It also seems that Tree Top City has many more vertical lines - totally in line with tree tops!\n\nTo create a new feature, we could define 'hit boxes' based on these diagrams and then judge any coordinate event as good or bad. If it's inside the hit box it is good and if not it is bad. This could be an interesting feature to experiment with! (To some degree it should be correlated with number of events since the more bad events, the more total events as you will likely need to do the same amount of good events to complete the game).\n\nNext, how about ordering by the game type? We should be able to see the similar ones more readily.","d31ef7cf":"## Conclusion\nBy looking in more detail at the coordinate events, we're able to see some interesting patterns in the data.

We should also get various game information to help us later on. We won't be looking at Clip events since they aren't interesting in terms of interaction and we'll filter only coordinate events first.","751f1877":"# Drawing Pictures With Coordinate Events\nWe have x, y positions for the coordinates that users are interacting with when they are doing various activities. Let's see if we can plot the interactions to get an idea about how these activities are played and possible generate useful features.","f7d4251d":"Comparing activities and games to assessments, the latter seems to have many more different spots to interact with - difficult! Though, there are some activities which are more similar. For example, Flower Waterer or Chow Time - these might be better indicators for performance on assessments than more simple games like \"Crystals Rules\".","c98e575a":"We'll also load the order of the games for plotting later on.\n\nTaken from the [competiton creators](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/data-science-bowl-2019\/discussion\/121215).","8a3472f8":"## Read Data\n\nRead in all the data and process to get some convenient lists.\n\nSome functions taken from this [kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/braquino\/890-features)."}}
