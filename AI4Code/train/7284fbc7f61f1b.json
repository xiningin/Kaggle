(A k-nearest neighbor defines an edge in the graph for each observation if another observation one of its k-nearest neighbor's)\n\n2. We define a matrix S measuring the similarity between to nodes (observations) that are connected using a pre-defined distance measure.\n\n3. Next define a Laplacian graph for each feature.\n\n4. Afterwards, we compute the Laplacian score.\n\n5. Finally, we select the n best (n lowest Laplacian scores), where n is the number features we want.\n\n\nBecause calculating Laplacian scores is highly computational, in the cross validation (CV) Pipeline, I will only apply Laplacian score to 10,000 highly variable features when the method is pre-specified.","7ea18391":"The follow code demonstrates my implementation of fisher's score. Fisher score for feature selection is a supervised method. The fisher function calculates the mean and the standard deviation of the case and control observations the training set seperately for a given gene and apply it to the formula of the score.

Since predictive accuracy was lackluster for even the model on the known genes associated with ALS it may be that \"ALSFRS_Class_Median\" is poor target variable for the transcriptomic data.\n\nThere are some limitations to the feature selection methods that I utilized. For example, since calculating the Laplacian score is has a high computational cost, I had to implement the method on only the 10,000 most variable genes in the datasets. By using this approach, there is a hidden assumption that genes with more variance are usually going to be stronger predictors. However, this may not always be the case. It is possible that there could be features that are strong predictors of the target that are outside the top 10,000 variable genes,which are neglected from this approach. One disadvantage Fisher score is that it is calculated using information from cases and controls in the training set. If it happens that the training set has one of two the groups underrepresented in the split, then it hurts the accuracy of the results.\n\n\nNevertheless, the results seem promising from our CV pipeline.
