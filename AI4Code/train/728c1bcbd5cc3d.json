The usual performance of hemodialysis treatments in collective rooms increases the risk. The specific information at this time in this regard is very limited. This manuscript includes a proposal for action to prevent infection in the Nephrology Services, and in particular in Hemodialysis Units, with the objective of early identification of patients who meet the definition of a suspected case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and propose circuits and mechanisms to carry out hemodialysis treatments. They are recommendations in continuous review and can be modified if the epidemiological situation, the diagnostic and therapeutic options so require.","b206fb0b":"#Codes from Paul Mooney https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/paultimothymooney\/most-common-words-in-the-cord-19-dataset","756cfe22":"\u201cPhysicians are having to be creative in these circumstances and other types of dialysis machines require specifically trained dialysis nurses which are hard to find,\u201d https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Health\/doctors-coronavirus-kidney-link-worry-grows-dialysis-machines\/story?id=70271389","1831d543":"\"An estimated 40 million adults in the U.S. have chronic kidney disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Experts anticipate even more Americans will develop kidney ailments as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, but the extent of the kidney damage in confirmed coronavirus patients remains unclear. \n\nStudies and clinical anecdotes indicate that the coronavirus can attack the kidneys, leading to kidney failure or, in patients with existing kidney disease, exacerbate matters. Compounding the issue is that kidney disease is made worse in patients who require mechanical ventilation, like many patients with severe cases of the coronavirus. Without dialysis, fluid can accumulate in the lung when the kidneys can't remove enough fluid and toxins from the body.\n\nExperts cited a growing need for both dialysis machines and the fluid required to dialyze patients. Because manufacturing new machines can be an arduous process,It was suggested that states with fewer cases donate machines to the \u201chot spots\u201d \u2013 not unlike the reallocation of ventilators in recent weeks. \n\u201cThey have had trouble getting the fluids needed for dialysis. Machines are needed as well but getting them can be complicated. One way that they can address this is by asking those not seeing as much kidney disease and coronavirus to reallocate their supplies to the hot spots.\u201d https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Health\/doctors-coronavirus-kidney-link-worry-grows-dialysis-machines\/story?id=70271389","a606ec0e":"#As doctors see coronavirus-kidney link, worry grows over dialysis machines.\n\nBy Dr.L.Nedda Dastmalchi, Jay Bhatt and Lucien Bruggeman 22 April 2020 https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Health\/doctors-coronavirus-kidney-link-worry-grows-dialysis-machines\/story?id=70271389\n\n\u201cEveryone is advertising there are not enough ventilators, that's what they were afraid of, whether patients were going to have a ventilator or not. People are getting better from the ventilator. The lung is getting clearer, but they're not getting dialysis. And that's why people are dying.\" \n\nA possible dearth of various life-saving equipment has for weeks nipped at the heels of the novel coronavirus\u2019 spread. But as the disease has begun to appear linked to kidney issues, a new round of ethical questions are being raised about who gets treatment and who doesn\u2019t \u2013 And the fears that otherwise potentially preventable deaths might occur as a result of dialysis equipment shortages.","a57a6f25":"kidney.org","21ce0f68":"Since the columns are named by numbers I couldn't use the codes that I knew.
