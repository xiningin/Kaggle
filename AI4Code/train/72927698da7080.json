As a regular subway rider myself, my personal impression is that it happens the most because of bad weather. From this dataset, the top 5 reasons that caused subway delay in May 2019 are: MUSC, MUPAA, TUSC, SUDP and MUATC. After matching the codes to a TTC document \"ttc-subway-delay_codes\". A more human-readible version of the reasons are:\n1.\tMUSC - Miscellaneous Speed Control\n2.\tMUPAA - Passenger Assistance Alarm Activated - No Trouble Found\n3.\tTUSC - Operator Overspeeding\n4.\tSUDP - Disorderly Patron\n5.\tMUATC - ATC Project\nSpeed control due to various reasons is one of the top reasons for subway delay followed by false alarms. Riders are not the only one slowing down the subway,delay also happens when an operator violate a signal or failed to monitor the train doors. \"Disorderly patrons\" is the 4th most frequent reason which includes disruptive, agreesive behaviours from riders \n","11b0eff9":"To import all the necessary libraries ","e5ef8533":"This is a high-level analysis of the TTC subway delay dataset from https:\/\/open.toronto.ca\/dataset\/ttc-subway-delay-data\/. The Open Data Portal is an initiative to meet the growing demand for open data. It provides momentum to the development of technology and data literacy. Publicizing the datasets means that people will be able to download, visualize, interpret data and eventually draw insights. Browsing through the open data catalogue, I found this topic interesting while discovering the frequency of certain types of reasons that are causing subway delay. This dataset captures TTC subway delay details in terms of station, delay code, date, bound, etc. for May 2019. Drawing a statistically confident conclusion with this sample size is challenging. However, it provides some directional read on frenquency, type of delay that could affect Torontonian's everyday life. \n\n\nI also came across this report https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/ttc-subway-delays-1.4068358 written in 2017 where CBC analyzed major reasons of TTC subway delay. Not surprisingly, the findings still hold compared to May 2019 as shown in the visualization below in terms of hours of delay by the station.\n![](https:\/\/i.cbc.ca\/1.4069523.1492099175!\/fileImage\/httpImage\/image.jpeg_gen\/derivatives\/original_780\/ttc-chart.jpeg)\n\nTo save whoever is reading this some time, here're some takeaways:\n1. Budget more time for your commute on Thursdays and Fridays, especially when you will be traveling southbound.\n2. Kipling, Finch, Kennedy BD, Bloor and Sheppard stations experienced a frequent delay in May 2019. If you happen to commute from these listed stations and always found yourself being late, try heading out 10 min (totally arbitrary) earlier than your routine schedule and see if it works out.\n3. TTC employees also cause delays\n\nSource:https:\/\/open.toronto.ca\/dataset\/ttc-subway-delay-data\/","3b177cad":"This dataset captures mostly categorical values such as station, bound, vehicle and delay type.
