Another reason - more elder experts are switching career from other spheres to DS.\n\nIt is interesting to note that men are interested in DS up to 69 and women - up to 54. The largest group of specialists among men is up to 44, among women up to 34.","043a85a7":"I think it is quite amazing that a lot of people do some kind or research or try innovative things. A lot of people do research or try to apply new methods, some other people build technologically sound solutions.","83594ca1":"**Who knows others? Please write in the comments**","a5d12ba1":"If we talk about salaries, it is important to understand several things:\n- some Ukrainians work in USA and other countries and as a result have quite high salaries;\n- those working in Kyiv and some other big cities have good salaries;\n- and people working in other cities usually have much lower salary.\n\n100k is possible, but difficult to achieve - this is usually a level of head of DS.\n50k is a level of a senior DS.\n~30k is a level of a middle DS.\n\nBy the way, did you notice a rich person with 500k$+? I wonder who that person is :)"}}
