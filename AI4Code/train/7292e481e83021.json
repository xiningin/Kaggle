If one listens to mainstream radio, or follows popular spotify playlists, these artists will be familiar. ","30758a83":"Big thanks to PavanKalyan from Kaggle for creating such a user friendly dataset. The ultimate purpose for this exercise was to find insights about the Spotify Top 100 Songs using Matplotlib and Pandas. ","f44e0c80":"From the box and whisker plot above, some clear trends start to emerge from the Spotify Top 100. Over 50% of the top 100 songs have a faster beat\/pace, of 100 to about 130 BPM. The top 100 songs also have a high energy and danceability rating, given the majority of the songs have a rating of over 50. The songs also tend to have a low liveness (likely hood of being a live recording) which indicates the vast majority of the spotify top 100 songs are studio recorded. ","85660a65":"To provide better visualization, the features were divided up into two groups to make two box and whisker plots. From the plot above, other insights start to emerge. The median song length was around 215 seconds with more than half of all songs being between about 190 and 230 seconds. Which indicates that songs between 3 and 4 minutes are most preferred by listeners. Acousticness and speechiness also have low ratings for the top 100 songs, indicating that listeners like electric\/synthetic styles with low amounts of non musical speech. ","4fa52ae8":"In conclusion, through the use of Pandas and Matplotlib I was able to gather high level insights from the Spotify Top 100. The top 100 songs were generally a type of pop or rap, about 3 to 4 minutes in length, with high energy, high danceability, high pace, and used electric\/synthetic instruments.","f615858a":"Dance pop by far had the most appreanances on the Spotify Top 100 than any other genre. However, it is interesting to note that while 8 out of the 10 genres for the Spotify Top 100 are all a type of pop or rap, there is distinction between the different groups. This indicates that either artists, labels, or listeners consider these genres to have distinct sub-genres. An interesting follow up study, assuming the data is available, would be to track these different sub-genres over time and see how they began to rise in popularity. "}}
