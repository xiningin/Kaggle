This is done either via clustering or community detection.\n\n- Some of the most popular approaches are hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. These methods compute a **distance metric between cells (often based on a low-dimensional representation, such as PCA, tSNE or UMAP), and then iteratively group cells together based on these distances.**\n\n- **Community detection methods (also referred to as 'graph-based clustering') partition the neighbor graph. The neighbor graph treats each cell as a node, with edges connecting each node to its k nearest neighbors (based on similar distance metrics described above). The graph is then partitioned into modules based on these connectivities. These methods are typically faster than other clustering methods with similar effectiveness.**\n\n- All clustering or community detection methods have is a resolution parameter that controls how fine- or coarse-grained the inferred clusters are.
