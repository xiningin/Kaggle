Closing Remarks<\/a>\n\nOur analysis has unearthed some serious flaws in the Data World. It appears that the hype around Data Science has not been over yet. The proliferation of new innovative tools and technologies have been proved handy, without doubt; however, sometimes we get duped too because of too much dependency on them, such as building prototypes without even conducting an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) properly. The result, therefore, is less generalized and flawed insights and predictions, thus causing a fiasco in the decision-making process. Here goes a brief summary of our observations.\n\n<ul>\n<li> <p><b>Data Quality.<\/b> The quality of the extracted insights depends on the data quality to a great extent. If the collected data incorporates biases, flawed understanding or judgement, and\/or does not include the necessary dimensions to answer the specific questions, Data Science can't help much. For instance, survey data may be prone to individual biases in understanding and judgement. If the duration of a survey is too long, the respondents may get distracted. Moreover, if the survey is designed with too many goals in mind, some important questions may be left out. Hence, it is recommended to design a survey with a couple of concrete objectives in mind and ensure the necessary dimensions are included to answer the relevant questions while keeping the total survey duration to a tolerable degree.<\/p> <\/li>\n\n<li> <p><b>Depletion in the DS Job Field.<\/b> The health-checkup of the Kaggle Respondents has yielded a sheer disappointment. Only 30.92% of the Survey Respondents conform to the core concept of Data Science. Majority of them are occasional DS\/ML problem solvers (56.8%); a few of this group perform DS activites in the regular job, however, without caring about the prior analysis and understanding of the data (14.8%) - seems data is in wrong hands! This situation provokes the questions: <br>\n    <ul>\n    <li> <b>Lack of Analysis\/Understanding of Data.<\/b> Is the practical adoption of Data Science inherently flawed?<\/li>\n    <li> <b>Surplus in Data Enthusiasts.<\/b> Is there an ongoing depletion in the Data Science job market?<\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/p><\/li>\n\n<li> <p><b>Flaws in Recruitment.<\/b> There are some serious flaws creeping through the DS recruitment process. The roles are sometimes hazy (e.g., Product\/Project Manager, DBA, Developer Advocate) and do not always indicate the need\/implementation of DS skillset, therefore, job search and hiring by title may not serve the intended purpose. A notable fraction of the group with title Data Scientist\/Analyst do not have expertise in Python\/R\/MATLAB (8.4%). A small group has been found out for whom the minimal educational requirement of a Bachelor's degree had been waived (5.1%).<\/p> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p> The inherent inconsistencies and flaws in adoption give us an impression that the Data Science World is in Dystopia. This calls for a need to perform a health-checkup and curation of the Data Science Workforce on a regular interval. Most importantly, we need a proactive strategy to educate the Data Science Practitioners; a well-defined induction process is the need of the hour. Based on the Kaggle Survey data, we have strived to get them acquanited with the regular activities, basic tools and learning platforms. But there is still a lot of to be done here. Just like other STEM fields, the Data Science Practitioners need to follow a set of strictures delineating the exact steps while conducting a specific Data Science activity. Domain knowledge plays an important role in connecting the observations to the real-world phenomena. There may be other nuances which vary from one domain to the other.
