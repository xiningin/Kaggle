wealthier passengers in the higher classes tend to be older, which makes sense.

We\u2019ll be trying to predict a classification: survival or deceased. We\u2019ll use a \u201csemi-cleaned\u201d version of the titanic dataset. Also, we have made two separate files for training and testing. The training data can be found by clicking [here](https:\/\/github.com\/meetnandu05\/LogisticRegression\/blob\/master\/titanic_train.csv) and the test data can be found by clicking [here](https:\/\/github.com\/meetnandu05\/LogisticRegression\/blob\/master\/titanic_test.csv).","0ec27f9c":"As we can see, there are 4 categorical columns namely Name, Sex, Ticket and Embarked. Out of these 4, the Name and Ticket column have no relationship with whether the person survived or not. \n\nSo we drop these 2 columns and we convert the other two columns into numerical values. Then the data will be ready for the model.","786af5ab":"We can now see there are no null values in the Age column.","a37c0587":"## Logistic Regression\n\nLogistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary classes. The outcome or target variable is dichotomous in nature. Dichotomous means there are only two possible classes. \n\nThe real life example of classification example would be, to categorize the mail as spam or not spam, to categorize the tumor as malignant or benign and to categorize the transaction as fraudulent or genuine. All these problem\u2019s answers are in categorical form i.e. Yes or No. and that is why they are two class classification problems.","0a1e37c2":"## Converting Categorical Features\n\nWe\u2019ll need to convert categorical features to dummy variables. Otherwise the machine learning algorithm won\u2019t be able to directly take in those features as inputs.","d8828d3c":"## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nLet\u2019s begin some exploratory data analysis. \n\nWe\u2019ll start by checking out missing data. We can use seaborn to create a simple heatmap to see where we are missing data.","cd8ac5e1":"Now let\u2019s check that heat map again.","7debb00e":"## Get the Data\n\nFirst, let us now import the data and let\u2019s look at how this data looks.","67d2c31d":"Roughly 20 percent of the Age data is missing. The proportion of Age missing is likely small enough for reasonable replacement with some form of imputation. \n\nLooking at the Cabin column, it looks like we are just missing too much of that data to do something useful with at a basic level. We\u2019ll probably drop this or change it to another feature like \u201cCabin Known: 1 or 0\u201d.","04887ac6":"## Data Cleaning\n\nWe want to fill in missing age data instead of just dropping the missing age data rows. \n\nOne way to do this is by filling in the mean age of all the passengers (imputation). However we can be smarter about this and check the average age by passenger class. \n\nLet's show the average age of people belonging to different class in the ship."}}
