For this project, I have used the publically available data presented by \"Motivate International Inc.\" I have downloaded the latest 12 months Cyclistic bike-sharing Zipped data according to the instruction and up-loaded it into Kaggle under the name of \"bike-share capstone project\". The latest 12 months data seems to be organized. However, there are some minor changes and missing values which will be identified. From the huge data set, we have already shorted and filtered the latest 12 months' data. Determine the credibility of the data. Data was imported from https:\/\/divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com\/index.html which is a credible source. \n\n**Deliverable**\n   \n  A description of all data sources used.
