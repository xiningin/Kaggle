You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n\n#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Colab**. [Google Colab](https:\/\/colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab. \n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https:\/\/www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https:\/\/docs.conda.io\/projects\/conda\/en\/latest\/user-guide\/install\/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.","55c0880d":"Initialy, both the training and validation losses seem to decrease over time. However, if you train the model for long enough, you will notice that the training loss continues to decrease, while the validation loss stops decreasing, and even starts to increase after a certain point! \n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/1QU0m.png\" style=\"max-width:400px;\">\n\nThis phenomenon is called **overfitting**, and it is the no. 1 why many machine learning models give rather terrible results on real-world data. It happens because the model, in an attempt to minimize the loss, starts to learn patters are are unique to the training data, sometimes even memorizing specific training examples. Because of this, the model does not generalize well to previously unseen data.\n\n\nFollowing are some common stragegies for avoiding overfitting:\n\n- Gathering and generating more training data, or adding noise to it\n- Using regularization techniques like batch normalization & dropout\n- Early stopping of model's training, when validation loss starts to increase\n\nWe will cover these topics in more detail in the next tutorial in this series, and learn how we can reach an accuracy of **over 90%** by making minor but important changes to our model.","b5372b64":"The above directory structure (one folder per class) is used by many computer vision datasets, and most deep learning libraries provide utilites for working with such datasets. We can use the `ImageFolder` class from `torchvision` to load the data as PyTorch tensors.","f45c3331":"## Training and Validation Datasets\n\nWhile building real world machine learning models, it is quite common to split the dataset into 3 parts:\n\n1. **Training set** - used to train the model i.e. compute the loss and adjust the weights of the model using gradient descent.\n2. **Validation set** - used to evaluate the model while training, adjust hyperparameters (learning rate etc.) and pick the best version of the model.\n3. **Test set** - used to compare different models, or different types of modeling approaches, and report the final accuracy of the model.\n\nSince there's no predefined validation set, we can set aside a small portion (5000 images) of the training set to be used as the validation set. We'll use the `random_split` helper method from PyTorch to do this. To ensure that we always create the same validation set, we'll also set a seed for the random number generator.","5e6dfc27":"Let's make one final commit using `jovian`.","9d8216a1":"Once again, let's save and commit the notebook before we proceed further.","7f08c533":"Let's look at a sample element from the training dataset.

Here's how you can save the model.","42e2090e":"We can look at batches of images from the dataset using the `make_grid` method from `torchvision`.

This suggests that we might need to use a more powerful model to capture the relationship between the images and the labels more accurately. This can be done by adding more convolutional layers to our model, or incrasing the no. of channels in each convolutional layer, or by using regularization techniques.\n\nWe can also plot the training and validation losses to study the trend.","b3ca45d9":"For multi-channel images, a different kernel is applied to each channels, and the outputs are added together pixel-wise. \n\nChecking out the following articles to gain a better understanding of convolutions:\n\n1.
