Note that this data only includes incidents in which the officers used his or her gun to cause the fatality. This doesn't include other fatal methods.\n\nThese dataset suffers from many shortcomings: \n\n*   The demographic data lost its source of origin. Those datasets are for year 2015. Therefore, aggregating them with the fatal_police_shooting dataset, which is from 2015 to 2017, to analyze and build the model doesn't give the most accurate result.\n*   The data collected is not enough to predict the victim's race. Several factors like demographic of the location where the incidents happened, median income, or general status of the victims before getting shot were not indicative enough to make any conclusion about their race. Some other features that may help are information of the officers, criminal history of the victims, for what reason did the officers approached the victims.\n*   The datas are only from 2015 to 2017, therefore, we cannot make any inferences outside of that timeframe.\n\nWith many assumptions made during analyzing these data, some conclusions were able to be made:\n\n*   White victims tend to be the oldest in the group and Native American victims tend to be the youngest.\n*   Many victims were having sign of mental illness, some of them attacked the officers during the incidents, and the most common weapon the victims were armed with was gun.\n*   Races other than White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American were a lot more likely to get shot when they commit a crime.\n*   Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey officers were the most likely to make the fatal shots.\n\n\n","7a898bd7":"Time and total death are not correlated.","6d9becee":"Trying to combine demographic with fatal_police_shooting to make a single dataset.\nWe need to fix the mitmatch in city naming convention between fatal_police_shooting and demographic","b61759de":"It is clear that white accounts for the majority of the population in the US","c3bc2bed":"Calculating steps:\n* Since the datasets provided from FBI:UCR don't have categories for non-Hispanic of each of the other races, I calculated that by multiplying total cases of each race by the percentage of non-Hispanic cases, assuming that each of the other races shares the same proportion of Hispanic\/non-Hispanic.\n* Note that the FatalPoliceShootingUS only have records from Jan 2015 to July 2017. However, the datasets from FBI:UCR have the total cases for each year 2015, 2016, and 2017. Therefore, we have to add the total of each of the year to find the total cases during the period. Besides, for 2017, assuming number of cases are not affected by the time of a year, I multiply the total cases in 2017 by 7\/12 to get the estimate of total cases in the first 7 months of 2017.\n\nResults:\n* The percentage of criminals being shot for the Others race is disproportionally high.\n* Among the other races, although there are differences between the proportion of each race being killed, the bias is not significant.","6be538f8":"The ADA Boost Classifier model does suprisingly better in the test set than in the training set. KNN and ADABoost are comparatively equal in making decisions about the victim's race. However, the accuracy for both models are too low, only around 0.5. With these accuracy scores and the different behaviors of the two models discussed above, we can conclude that using these models' prediction are not better than blind guess. As demonstrated below, with the proportion of White victims being 0.497, setting a model to always predict 'W' will also be able to achieve a similar result.","73c765e9":"About 2\/3 of the victims were attacking the police before getting shot. This could also influence the officers' decisions.","7c6204e4":"This chart shows that Black and Native American are much more likely to be shot. The proportion and Black being shot is almost three times higher than White.\n\nHowever, this chart still have a caveat: total death per race divided by the total population per race may not be a good representation for the racial bias. \n\nSince most of these cases happened when the victims were suspected or alledged to be criminal, taking total death divided by the total population doesn't illustrate the racial bias of the police toward the criminals. Instead, the denominator should be some value that represent the number of crimes of that race.\n\nAssuming that all of the police making these fatal shots were all properly trained, we can say that these victims were making some act of crimes during the incident.\n\nIn this case, I set the denominator to be total arrest cases for each city in the US. Although death divided arrest doesn't give us any concrete value (people cannot be both shot and arrested), total arrest cases are a good representation of crimes in an area and therefore, the fraction would give us a better estimate about fatal shooting cases and criminals in each city."}}
