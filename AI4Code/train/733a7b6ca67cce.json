Analysis of cancelled orders - it might be useful to compares segments from cancellations perspective","2cbe24d2":"# Step 5: Conclustion and first insights\n### Some insigths about recency of purchases by customers\n\nAccoridng to data around 57% of clients are in 'high recency' segments. This might be an indicator for improving the retention of buyers, introducing the loyalty program. The business should challenge the stategy in acquisition channels that bring a lot of customers who stay in 'high recency - low amount' segment. \nSpecial treament in re-activation should be done to 'high recency - high amount' as those are more valueable customers for the business.\n\nAs we have retrieved from rules here we can also track the percentage of users who made a purchase less than 71.5 days ago. A possible KPI of improvements in this area of business might be the percentage of customers who made purchase less than 71.5 days ago. The greater this percentage gets - the better.\n\nAt the same time, there should be a mechanism to prevent the transfer of customers from segments with low recency into segments with high recency. It might be profitable to create special offers for customers who got close to turning into 'high recency' customer. Specifically, if the customer did not buy anyting between less than 60-70 days ago, it might be worth trying to give such customer a special offer.","ecea4789":"# Step 1. Read csv, explore NA values and some pre-cleaning of data","66321e2a":"#### As we can see cancelled orders are also marked with minus sign in terms of quantity. Now we can remove all rows associated with cancelled orders. It will allow us to make a segmentation of our customers in terms of recency, frequency and monetary value regardless whether a customer made cancellations. \n\n#### Cancelled orders should be treated in a separate analyis as well as customers who cancel orders. This can be done in a different task of finding patterns in cancelled orders. Moreover, we can be interested in taking a thorough look at cancelled orders from customers that belong to the most valueable segments. So there will be a follow-up notebook with EDA on customers that cancel orders.","239a47d2":"#### Silhouette score also confirms the suggestion that 4 is an optimal number of clusters.\n#### Let's also compare the speed and performance of MiniBatchKmeans with default KMeans algorithm from skickit-learn.","5c0978dd":"# Step 3.

Nevetheless, there is a dramatic improvement in terms of runtime using MiniBatchKMeans in comparison to default KMeans algorithm (17.2 seconds vs 4 min 49 seconds in total run time of cell). \n\n#### Thereby, we can use MiniBatchKMeans algorithm on large datasets, (scikit-learn [documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) says n >= 10k observations) to find the optimal number of clusters for KMeans algorithm to save our time.","8834d1b9":"### There are 3 columns of numeric types. However, Customer ID column should be treated as categorical variable because one id represents one customer, it does not imply any numeric meaning. Other five columns are categorical type.\n","c34128cd":"### As we can see on the plots above, the distribution of variables of interest does not look like normal. There are outliers in the dataset in terms of recency, frequency of purchases and amount spent by customers. Altough these outliers probably skew the distribution of variables of intereset from normailty into non-normality, arguably we should keep these observations in our dataset. If we get rid of these \"outlier\" observations, we can lose a valueable information about users who bring a big part of revenue or number of purchases. \n\n### Instead we can try to transform the distribution of the selected variables. This will allow us to utilize these variables for customer segmentation without any concerns about non-normality of variables' distributions.","f76e6f36":"#### The majority of na values are in Customer ID column.
