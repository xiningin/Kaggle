For instance, you can get the x- and y-coordinates of a Point from the `x` and `y` attributes, respectively.","38cc405a":"In the code cell above, since the CRS of the `regions` GeoDataFrame is set to EPSG 32630 (a \"Mercator\" projection), the area calculation is slightly less accurate than if we had used an equal-area projection like \"Africa Albers Equal Area Conic\".\n\nBut this yields the area of Ghana as approximately 239585 square kilometers, which is not too far off from [the correct answer](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=area+of+ghana).","c2f71166":"How do you interpret that?\n\nCoordinate reference systems are referenced by [European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG)](http:\/\/www.epsg.org\/) codes.\n\nThis GeoDataFrame uses [EPSG 32630](https:\/\/epsg.io\/32630), which is more commonly called the \"Mercator\" projection. This projection preserves angles (making it useful for sea navigation) and slightly distorts area. \n\nHowever, when creating a GeoDataFrame from a CSV file, we have to set the CRS.  [EPSG 4326](https:\/\/epsg.io\/4326) corresponds to coordinates in latitude and longitude.","e5058982":"# Introduction\n\nThe maps you create in this course portray the surface of the earth in two dimensions.  But, as you know, the world is actually a three-dimensional globe. So we have to use a method called a **map projection** to render it as a flat surface.  \n\nMap projections can't be 100% accurate.  Each projection distorts the surface of the Earth in some way, while retaining some useful property.  For instance,\n- the *equal-area* projections (like \"Lambert Cylindrical Equal Area\", or \"Africa Albers Equal Area Conic\") preserve area.  This is a good choice, if you'd like to calculate the area of a country or city, for example.\n- the *equidistant* projections (like \"Azimuthal Equidistant projection\") preserve distance.  This would be a good choice for calculating flight distance.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/noBRRNR.png\" width=\"700\">\n<b>List of map projections<\/b> (<a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/2kOHTBs\">Source<\/a>)<br\/><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nWe use a **coordinate reference system (CRS)** to show how the projected points correspond to real locations on Earth.  In this tutorial, you'll learn more about coordinate reference systems, along with how to use them in GeoPandas.","786d9e9f":"# Setting the CRS\n\nWhen we create a GeoDataFrame from a shapefile, the CRS is already imported for us. ","cfc36058":"The `to_crs()` method modifies only the \"geometry\" column: all other columns are left as-is.","23b0d786":"In the code cell above, to create a GeoDataFrame from a CSV file, we needed to use both Pandas and GeoPandas:\n- We begin by creating a DataFrame containing columns with latitude and longitude coordinates.\n- To convert it to a GeoDataFrame, we use `gpd.GeoDataFrame()`.  \n- The `gpd.points_from_xy()` function creates `Point` objects from the latitude and longitude columns.","bcda7eea":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

For instance, the proj4 string to convert to latitude\/longitude coordinates is as follows:\n```\n+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n```","614c13fd":"# Re-projecting\n\nRe-projecting refers to the process of changing the CRS.  This is done in GeoPandas with the `to_crs()` method.\n\nWhen plotting multiple GeoDataFrames, it's important that they all use the same CRS.  In the code cell below, we change the CRS of the `facilities` GeoDataFrame to match the CRS of `regions` before plotting it."}}
