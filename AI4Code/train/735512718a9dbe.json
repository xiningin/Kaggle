Drop unimportant columns.\n2. Drop duplicates rows.\n3. Replace zero values with NaN.\n4. Replace NaN values with mean.\n5. Add new column `profit`.\n6. Convert ` release_date` column to Date datatype.","744aa41a":">**Observations:** \n>- There are 5696 zero values rows in `budget_adj`, 6016 zero values row in `revenue_adj` It is a huge amount of missing data for these two columnes. In order not to drop more than 50% of the data that will affect my statistics and visualization result, I decided to retain these rows and replace them with mean values.","ceec33be":"#### Datatype of columns\nAccording to the cell below, we can notice that ``release_date`` is not using the date datatype, ``budget_adj`` and ``revenue_adj`` are float datatype so we will changeing datatypes in the data cleaning step.

The minimum value for runtime is 0 which means that there could be a number of values of zero value in `runtime`.\nConsidering the impact of dropping all the rows with zero might impact my analysis, I will first mark the zero values as NaN so that I can replace them with mean values in the next section."}}
