Interpreted language: the language is processed by the interpreter at runtime, like PHP or PERL, so you don\u2019t have to compile the program before execution.\n2. Interactive: you can directly interact with the interpreter at the Python prompt for writing your program.\n3. Perfect for beginners: for beginner-level programmers, Python is a great choice as it supports the development of applications ranging from games to browsers to text processing.\n\n**Main Components\/Highlights of Python**\n\nIn the above section, we have studied about Introduction to Python, so now we are going ahead with the main components of Python that are as explained below:\n\n**Functions**\nIn Python, there are inbuilt functions that help in retrieving or returning the actual value. For example Mathematical functions. It is the collection of blocks which can be run at any time where the programmers want or required the functionality.\n\n**Classes**\nIn Python, it defines the structure of variable and statement that needs to execute and in classes functions are also defined to execute.\n\n**Modules**\nIn Python, it groups the functions and classes. It is used for string manipulation, character manipulation, web programming, and graphics programming.\n\n**Packages**\nIn Python, packages are used to run the set of instructions, importing of libraries, etc."}}
