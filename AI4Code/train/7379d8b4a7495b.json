Globally, over 1.2 billion children are out of the classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Research suggests that online learning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay. While countries are at different points in their COVID-19 infection rates, worldwide there are currently more than 1.2 billion children in 186 countries affected by school closures due to the pandemic. In Denmark, children up to the age of 11 are returning to nurseries and schools after initially closing on 12 March, but in South Korea students are responding to roll calls from their teachers online. With this sudden shift away from the classroom in many parts of the globe, some are wondering whether the adoption of online learning will continue to persist post-pandemic, and how such a shift would impact the worldwide education market.\nNote: Copied from the kaggle source\n\nNote: Copied from the kaggle source\n","79e818e7":"> Name\tDescription\ndistrict_id\tThe unique identifier of the school district \nstate\tThe state where the district resides in \nlocale\tNCES locale classification that categorizes U.S. territory into four types of areas: City, Suburban, Town, and Rural.
