As a first step, check the language of the notebook by selecting **File > Language**.  If it's not Python, change the language to Python now.\n\n![tut7_default_lang](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FcQhCjF.png)\n\nThe notebook should hvae some default code.  **_Please erase this code, and replace it with the code in the cell below._**  (_This is the same code that you used in all of the exercises to set up your Python environment._)","7ece36d0":"The next step is to attach a dataset, before writing code to visualize it.  (_You learned how to do that in the previous tutorial._) \n\nThen, once you have generated a figure, you need only save it as an image file that you can easily add to your presentations!"}}
