This LMS allows users to have access to educational resources as long as they have an internet connection. This system also tracks learners progress such as how many times they read or watch an educational material. **Using these data, we will want to find out the factors that are linked to the success of the students. **\n\n## Looking into the columns \n- Gender - student's gender (nominal: 'Male' or 'Female\u2019)\n\n- Nationality- student's nationality \n\n- Place of birth- student's Place of birth \n\n- Educational Stages- educational level student belong\n\n- Grade Levels- grade student belongs\n\n- Section ID- classroom student belongs\n\n- Topic- course topic\n\n- Semester- school year semester \n\n- Parent responsible for student\n\n- Raised hand- how many times the student raises his\/her hand on classroom \n\n- Visited resources- how many times the student visits a course content\n\n- Viewing announcements-how many times the student checks the new announcements\n\n- Discussion groups- how many times the student participate on discussion groups\n\n- Parent Answering Survey- parent answered the surveys which are provided from school or not\n\n- Parent School Satisfaction- the Degree of parent satisfaction from school\n\n- Student Absence Days-the number of absence days for each student\n\n- Class:\n * Low-Level: interval includes values from 0 to 69,\n * Middle-Level: interval includes values from 70 to 89,\n * High-Level: interval includes values from 90-100.\n\n## Objective\n- Identify key factors that has an impact on the success of the student","ee4ad17c":"#### Sweet! Nothing to remove!\n\n#### Now lets have a summary of the data using .describe(include = 'all')","49d9f557":"## What do we see here?\n- Using the examples on raised hands, we see that students with H class tend to be actively asking questions among all topics.","8a4c9ccf":"## Let's visualise distribution and correlation of numeric variables using pairplot","a35a7fee":"# Overview of topics among different classes","1ada480b":"# Looking into nationality among classes","3c35c36c":"## What do we see here?\n- A huge proportion of students were at lower school or middle school. We do see an improvement in the student's results (L classes decreases from lower level to middle school, M and H classes increase significantly). There could be various reason why this happen:\n * Better resources were catered to middle school students\n * As people are more familiar with the resources on the LMS, they know where and how to improve the efficiency of their study sessions \n * Less resources are catered to teaching high school students","c49768f4":"## What do we see here?\n- People in the L class have very low participation rates as we see the distribution to be right skewed.\n- People in the H class have high participation rates and utilises the resources on the platform\n- People in the M class are widely distrubuted. As M class represents majority of the dataset, that could be the reason why it's evenly distributed.","3466d42c":"# Looking into different stage of education among classes","1d221e69":"## What do we see here?\n- It seems that we observed a lower number of males in H class, as majority are found in M and followed by L. We observed an equal number of females in both H and M classes, with a little over 20 in L.\n- We also need to understand that 305 out of 480 people are males. Could it be that the females are deprived of education and that motivates them to work harder? or is it simply the fact that less females are aware of this platform? ","14382395":"# Summary\n- It seems that students who did well on the LMS are those that participated actively on the system (high raised hands, high participation in discussion, high views on announcement and resources).\n- It also seems that Mums are the ones that produce better students. I believe that is the case since most men are away from their families due to work.\n- Low absence day from class produces better students. Similar to how professors encourage their students to attend lectures.","a27e84a2":"## What do we see here?\n- It seems that mothers produce better students than fathers. \n- What I can say is that most of the fathers are busy working to provide for the family. This means they are mostly away from their children. If the child has a mother to guide him or her, he or she will tend to do well due to the support. ","dd1da124":"# Overview of whether student absence will affect performance","1683abd5":"## What do we see here?\n- It seems that majority of the dataset is obtained from Kuwait and Jordan, with Kuwait having the most number in L class.\n- This does not mean that the rest of the other countries do not have access to a proper education system, it just meant that there are more student from Kuwait and Jordan utilising the platform.","3a01d4cf":"## What do we see here\n- It seems that those that are absence below 7 times were performing way better than those exceeding 7. Majority of class L students have high absence days. ","872fcae7":"# Which parent in charge will produce better student?"}}
