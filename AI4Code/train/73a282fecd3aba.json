You\u2019ve copied, edited and run your first Kaggle notebook.\n\n**What do do next:**\nExplore the [dataset](http:\/\/) behind this demo\nLearn more about image classification in [Kaggle's Deep Learning micro-course](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/deep-learning)\nTry your hand at a [Kaggle competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/competitions) that uses image classification","4cffc303":"Hi, I'm Kaggler Kai. I adopted a dog recently from a shelter, and I am curious what kind of dog he might be. I found a great model for image classification and want to try it out. Can you help me?\n\n**Step One** Copy and Edit this notebook, to make your own version you can edit and run. Go ahead and look for that button and click it. \n\nGreat! You should now have your own editable version of this notebook. \n\n**Step Two** Now, run the code cell below to load the model and get access to all of the images from the shelter's website.\n\n(To run a block of code, click on it, then click the play button next to it.)"}}
