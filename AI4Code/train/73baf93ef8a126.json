When an indie game company created Among Us in 2018, it was greeted with little fanfare. The multiplayer game remained under the radar as many games do - until the summer of the pandemic.<\/p>\n    \n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">To all the Among Us newbies here is a brief explanation of how the game works.\nAmong Us is a multiplayer game where between four and 10 players are dropped onto an alien spaceship. Each player is designated a private role as a 'crewmate' or 'impostor'. Crewmates must run around the ship and try to complete a set of tasks while trying to root out and avoid getting killed by the one or several impostors. Players can be voted off the ship, so each game becomes one of survival: Successfully vote off the impostors, or complete all your tasks to win.\n\n<\/p>","2784eebe":"<h2><strong><center>Who wins? The Imposter or the Crewmates<\/center><\/strong><\/h2>\nWhile playing Among us, I have always felt it's the imposters who win more often than the crewmates. Is that the real case?","7d980562":"<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Finishing the tasks automatically makes the crewmate as winner but for wins of crewmate in the data, task completed and task not completed are 50-50. This shows the crewmates have won even without finishing the tasks by ejecting the imposters. So there is particular strategy to win.<\/p>","e40c2db0":"This shows that the imposter:crewmate ratio is 1:4. Though being a crewmate is challenging and mysterious, getting the same role a million times in a row, the players find it to be repetitive.","a51b2822":"<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The win-loss percent for both crewmate and imposter is 50 - 50. This implies there is no assumption that imposters win often than crewmate. Probably, in a game where there are 7 crewmates and 3 imposters, the chances are high for the imposters to win.<p>","b6fade66":"<h2><strong><center>When do you win?<\/center><\/strong><\/h2>","59d18e23":"<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><b>Imposter:<\/b> It is obvious that the chance of imposter winning is high when not ejected.

As said earlier, at the start of each round, players are assigned one of two roles: either a 'Crewmate' who has to complete simple tasks and survive or the 'Imposter' whose goal it is to kill the crew. <\/p>\n    \n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Being the Imposter is the most nerve-wracking but exciting of the two roles. Gamers have to carefully plot out a series of murders while avoiding suspicion. There's nothing quite like the rush of successfully killing everyone in a round or turning other players against each other. Unfortunately,<b>THERE'S NO WAY TO GUARANTEE BEING THE IMPOSTER EVERY ROUND.<\/b> Among Us randomly selects a players' roles, meaning there's no special trick that players can use to influence their chances of being the imposter in every lobby they join. <\/p>\n  "}}
