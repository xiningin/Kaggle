To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **scatter plots** to understand patterns in the data.\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou work for a major candy producer, and your goal is to write a report that your company can use to guide the design of its next product.  Soon after starting your research, you stumble across this [very interesting dataset](https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking\/) containing results from a fun survey to crowdsource favorite candies.\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.","cbf2d46b":"#### Part B\n\nYou decide to dedicate a section of your report to the fact that chocolate candies tend to be more popular than candies without chocolate.

Put `'chocolate'` on the (horizontal) x-axis, and `'winpercent'` on the (vertical) y-axis.","ff2d1aa5":"## Step 5: Chocolate!\n\nIn the code cell below, create a scatter plot to show the relationship between `'pricepercent'` (on the horizontal x-axis) and `'winpercent'` (on the vertical y-axis).

Run the following cell to set up our feedback system.","a7579c98":"The dataset contains 83 rows, where each corresponds to a different candy bar.  There are 13 columns:\n- `'competitorname'` contains the name of the candy bar. \n- the next **9** columns (from `'chocolate'` to `'pluribus'`) describe the candy.  For instance, rows with chocolate candies have `\"Yes\"` in the `'chocolate'` column (and candies without chocolate have `\"No\"` in the same column).\n- `'sugarpercent'` provides some indication of the amount of sugar, where higher values signify higher sugar content.\n- `'pricepercent'` shows the price per unit, relative to the other candies in the dataset.\n- `'winpercent'` is calculated from the survey results; higher values indicate that the candy was more popular with survey respondents.\n\nUse the first five rows of the data to answer the questions below.","6e7748b8":"#### Part B\n\nAccording to the plot above, is there a **slight** correlation between `'winpercent'` and `'sugarpercent'`?
