CNN\n## 3.1 Define the model","e5e3b854":"The network is copied from the MNIST notebook.\n\n> I used the Keras Sequential API, where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n> \n> The first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I chose to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n> \n> The CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n> \n> The second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important. \n> \n> Combining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n> \n> Dropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting. \n> \n> 'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network. \n> \n> The Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional\/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n> \n> In the end i used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier.

The higher LR, the bigger are the steps and the quicker is the convergence. However the sampling is very poor with an high LR and the optimizer could probably fall into a local minima.\n\nIts better to have a decreasing learning rate during the training to reach efficiently the global minimum of the loss function. \n\nTo keep the advantage of the fast computation time with a high LR, i decreased the LR dynamically every X steps (epochs) depending if it is necessary (when accuracy is not improved).\n\nWith the ReduceLROnPlateau function from Keras.callbacks, i choose to reduce the LR by half if the accuracy is not improved after 3 epochs.","63ff24ed":"## 3.2 Set the optimizer and annealer\n\nOnce our layers are added to the model, we need to set up a score function, a loss function and an optimisation algorithm.\n\nWe define the loss function to measure how poorly our model performs on images with known labels. It is the error rate between the oberved labels and the predicted ones. We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the \"categorical_crossentropy\".\n\nThe most important function is the optimizer. This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss. \n\nI choosed RMSprop (with default values), it is a very effective optimizer. The RMSProp update adjusts the Adagrad method in a very simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.\nWe could also have used Stochastic Gradient Descent ('sgd') optimizer, but it is slower than RMSprop.\n\nThe metric function \"accuracy\" is used is to evaluate the performance our model.\nThis metric function is similar to the loss function, except that the results from the metric evaluation are not used when training the model (only for evaluation).","6a7bd9ce":"The train and validation sets are separated by StratifiedKFold. This should allow for more samples to be used for training as opposed to using a train\/val split.\n\nSince we have 131 000 training images of balanced labels (see 2.1 Load data), StratifiedKFold doesn't cause some labels to be over represented in the validation set.

Some popular augmentations people use are grayscales, horizontal flips, vertical flips, random crops, color jitters, translations, rotations, and much more. \n\nBy applying just a couple of these transformations to our training data, we can easily double or triple the number of training examples and create a very robust model.","0ffd6e6f":"Confusion matrix can be very helpfull to see your model drawbacks.\n\nI plot the confusion matrix of the validation results.","aaebea1b":"\n\n** you found this notebook helpful or you just liked it , some upvotes would be very much appreciated - That will keep me motivated :)**\n","943cd960":"Let's investigate for errors. \n\nI want to see the most important errors .
