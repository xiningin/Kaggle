However, although a highly profitable industry as a whole, every movie produced also requires a high level of investment from studios, producers, etc. with little guarantee that there will be a return on investment. A movie's profitability is increasingly elusive with the shift in consumer behavior towards media consumption and [rising marketing costs](http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/200-million-rising-hollywood-struggles-721818). \n \nThe unpredicatability of a movie's profitability was highlighted recently with the failure of the movie [\"The Great Wall\"](http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/what-great-walls-box-office-flop-will-cost-studios-981602). Financed through a joint partnership between the US and China, the movie was expected to be a huge success. Nonetheless, the movie only made 34.8 million US dollars in the North American box office, in comparison with a production budget of 150 million US dollars. \n\nOn the other hand, [Amazon](http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-investing-well-over-3-billion-in-video-says-analyst-2016-12) has been investing over 3 billion US dollars annually in original content with various success stories such as their investment in \"Manchester in the Sea\", which recieved six Oscar nominations in 2017. \n\nThe profitability of an individual film is highly unpredictable, but industry investors would be put at ease if there could be some understanding of whether their investments will be worthwhile. Therefore, we want to look at the best indicators to predict a film\u2019s success. We define a film's success by its domestic box office revenue.\n\n## Data ##\n\nData comes from the \"TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset\" containing movie data for over 5000 movies made in the past 100 years.
