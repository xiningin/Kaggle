In 1948, an original cohort of 5,209 men and women between 30 and 62 years old were recruited from Framingham, MA. An Offspring Cohort began in 1971, an Omni Cohort in 1994, a Third Generation Cohort in 2002, a New Offspring Spouse Cohort in 2004 and a Second Generation Omni Cohort in 2003. Core research in the dataset focuses on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The data include biological specimens, molecular genetic data, phenotype data, samples, images, participant vascular functioning data, physiological data, demographic data, and ECG data.It is a collaborative project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University.","1474bb80":"#### Attributes\n\n#### Demographic\n* Sex: male or female\n* Age: Age of the patient\n* Education: no further information provided\n\n#### Behavioral\n* Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker\n* Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day\n\n#### Information on medical history\n* BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication \n* Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke\n* Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive \n* Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes\n\n#### Information on current medical condition\n* Tot Chol: total cholesterol level\n* Sys BP: systolic blood pressure\n* Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure\n* BMI: Body Mass Index\n* Heart Rate: heart rate - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.\n* Glucose: glucose level\n\n#### Target variable to predict\n* TenYearCHD: 10 year risk of coronary heart disease (binary: \u201c1:Yes\u201d, \u201c0:No\u201d)","cdc8507c":"## Mean Difference"}}
