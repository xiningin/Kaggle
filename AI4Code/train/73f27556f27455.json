The SDGs provide a working definition of social good and will serve as a guide in our work to harness the power of data for social good. \n\nWe are hoping this effort will encourage government agencies to publish more open data and leverage external expertise to prioritise and acelerate progress. You are welcome to participate.

(Social) Enterpreneurs in the medical space could also use this as research data.\n\nThis starter-notebook gets you started with Ghana's Health facilities dataset (source: data.gov.gh).\n\n### Call to Action - Domain Experts (Public Health Officials)\nThis data, in combination with other datasets could provide a means of understanding **Healthcare access** in Ghana. Highlighting deprived areas for prioritisation. It also forms a good bases for understanding Ghana's Health Infrastructure. To this end we, are calling on **Domain Experts (Public Health directors\/leaders)** to provide direction (what questions are worth answering?) and additional open data to continue to improve our understanding of Ghana's health infrastructure and disaster readiness.\n\nAreas of you can help include, 1) we think that health facility are\/should have a hierachical classification(e.g. Korle-bu is highest ranked facility) so that we can begin to measure **Access per Population** and thus propose the most valuable places to have new facilities. 2) **support the publishing of more Open Data for richer understanding and data-driven decisions.** 3) **Provide the questions that are valuable to answer**\n\n### Call to Action - Data professionals\/enthusiats\nThis starter kernel (notebook) provides a quick and dirty understanding of the dataset. Put your skills to use and come up with your own discoveries to make the world a better place. e.g are there areas whose healthcare needs should be prioritised and improved? 2) Which other dataset will be useful.\n\n### Observations from Exploratory Analysis\n- A **total of 3756** health facilities were listed in the dataset.\n- Clinics are the most common of the *25 listed types of facilities - **1171 (31%)**\n- Majory (58 %) of facilities are government owned. **(2210 out of 3756)**\n- a total of **171** districts were listed. This implies some districts are missing.\n- There were 12 types of ownerships, but the most common Three are Government, Private, and Quasi-Government.\n- A couple of errors in the dataset [ gps locations, record deduplication for Clinic\/clinic...]\n\n### Questions Worth Exploring further\n- At the last election Ghana listed 275 districts, in this Health Facilities dataset there are 171 districts, are there any districts missing that require attention?\n- Compute a measure **access per population** that will enable highlighting of deprived areas for, decision makers prioritise where to set-up new facilities or up-grade existing facilities.\n\n### Call for data\nWe will be glad if below data and more are plublished as open data\n- Ghana health facility hierachy\/classification\n- Facility Capacities\n- (Maternal) Mortality by facility\n\n\n*- info requires correction.\n\nBy: [easimadi](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/easimadi\/)  \nDate: 08-Aug-2018  \nAcknowledgement: [data.gov.gh](data.gov.gh), [datanix](https:\/\/www.datanix.co.uk\/blog), [iipgh](https:\/\/www.iipgh.org\/)  \n","131d6e06":"## 2.2.3 <a id=\"e4\">Do owners have preference for a particular Falicity?<a>","7e463caa":"## 2.2.2 <a id=\"e3\">What is the ownership structure like in the regions?<a>"}}
