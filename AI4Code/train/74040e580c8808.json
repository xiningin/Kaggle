We then plot a bar graph of the Age Range vs the number of different food that particular age range has tasted. \n\nAccording to the bar graph,as the age range increases the number of food they have tasted also increases. \n\nWe would use other visualisation techniques to prove the same. ","c34aeaa9":"# Trying out more variety of food as you grow older.\n\nIt is a known fact that as people grow older their appetite decreases and they have  atendency to eat less. However,the chance of an older person to have eaten more variety of food is more than that of a younger person.A person of age range 40-50 is expected to have tasted more variety of food than a child of age group 10-20.It is because a person of age 40 had more oppurtunities to try a new variety of food than a person who is 20 years old now.We are going to prove this theory based on this data. \n\nFirst,let's have a look at the data. ","2a88cef5":"Using the lamda function,we sum the values of \"True\" ie \"1\" across the columns starting from the first category of food.

","1b6fab23":"# Conclusion\n\nAll the plots clearly show that with age the chance of having tasted a food increases. \nHowever given more data it would be a better analysis since a lot of different types of food are not covered. Moreover if additional data of diseases like one having diabetes or pressure is given,a broader analysis could have done.
