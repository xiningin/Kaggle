We continuously need to predict correct values, impute missing ones, and find links between various data artefacts such as schemas and records. We need to stop treating data cleaning as a piecemeal exercise (resolving different types of errors in isolation), and instead leverage all signals and resources (such as constraints, available statistics, and dictionaries) to accurately predict corrective actions.\n\nThe primary goal of data cleaning is to detect and remove errors and **anomalies** to increase the value of data in analytics and decision making. While it has been the focus of many researchers for several years, individual problems have been addressed separately. These include missing value imputation, outliers detection, transformations, integrity constraints violations detection and repair, consistent query answering, deduplication, and many other related problems such as profiling and constraints mining.[8]","a659a9a7":"<a id=\"33\"><\/a> <br>\n## 7-4 K-Nearest Neighbours\nIn **Machine Learning**, the **k-nearest neighbors algorithm** (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\nIn k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\nIn k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.","9a4f78f0":"\nWe can get a quick idea of how many instances (rows) and how many attributes (columns) the data contains with the shape property.\n\nYou should see 150 instances and 5 attributes:","3131f543":"<a id=\"24\"><\/a> <br>\n### 6-2-6 pairplot","bd545aba":"to check the first 5 rows of the data set, we can use head(5).","0bc4d566":"> jupyter notebook\n> ","49d470be":"It looks like perhaps two of the input variables have a Gaussian distribution.

That's why the name DieTanic. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget.\n\nIt took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.\n\nwe will use the classic titanic data set. This dataset contains information about **11 different variables**:\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s9.picofile.com\/file\/8340453092\/Titanic_feature.png\" height=\"500\" width=\"500\">\n\n* Survival\n* Pclass\n* Name\n* Sex\n* Age\n* SibSp\n* Parch\n* Ticket\n* Fare\n* Cabin\n* Embarked\n\n<a id=\"4\"><\/a> <br>\n### 3-3-1 Why am I  using Titanic dataset\n\n1- This is a good project because it is so well understood.\n\n2- Attributes are numeric and categorical so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.\n\n3- It is a ML problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\n\n4- we can define problem as clustering(unsupervised algorithm) project too.\n\n5- because we love   **Kaggle** :-) .\n\n<a id=\"5\"><\/a> <br>\n### 3-2 Aim\nIt is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.

Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson\n\n    c. Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.\n\n4. **Pclass** ==>> A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n    * 1st = Upper\n    * 2nd = Middle\n    * 3rd = Lower\n5. **Embarked** ==>> nominal datatype \n6. **Name** ==>> nominal datatype .

Now we cannot sort or give any ordering to such variables. They are also known as Nominal Variables.\n\n**Categorical Features in the dataset: Sex,Embarked.**\n<a id=\"4\"><\/a> <br>\n### 3-3-1-2 Ordinal\nAn ordinal variable is similar to categorical values, but the difference between them is that we can have relative ordering or sorting between the values. For eg: If we have a feature like Height with values Tall, Medium, Short, then Height is a ordinal variable. Here we can have a relative sort in the variable.\n\n**Ordinal Features in the dataset: PClass**\n\n### 3-3-1-3 Continous:\nA feature is said to be continous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the features column.\n\n**Continous Features in the dataset: Age**\n\n**<< Note >>**\n> You must answer the following question:\nHow does your company expact to use and benfit from your model.","693e0569":"<a id=\"17\"><\/a> <br>\n## 6-1 Data Collection\n**Data collection** is the process of gathering and measuring data, information or any variables of interest in a standardized and established manner that enables the collector to answer or test hypothesis and evaluate outcomes of the particular collection.[techopedia]\nI start Collection Data by the training and testing datasets into Pandas DataFrames\n","5c40e008":" <img src=\"http:\/\/s8.picofile.com\/file\/8338227868\/packages.png\">\n","831de22e":"to check out how many null info are on the dataset, we can use **isnull().sum()","600895cd":" <a id=\"1\"><\/a> <br>\n## 1- Introduction\nThis is a **comprehensive ML techniques with python** , that I have spent for more than two months to complete it.\n\nit is clear that everyone in this community is familiar with Titanic dataset but if you need to review your information about the dataset please visit this [link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\/data).\n\nI have tried to help **beginners**  in Kaggle how to face machine learning problems. and I think it is a great opportunity for who want to learn machine learning workflow with python completely.\nI have covered most of the methods that are implemented for **Titanic** until **2018**, you can start to learn and review your knowledge about ML with a perfect dataset and try to learn and memorize the workflow for your journey in Data science world.\n <a id=\"1\"><\/a> <br>\n## 1-1 Courses\nThere are a lot of online courses that can help you develop your knowledge, here I have just  listed some of them:\n\n1.

It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\n\n**What is the difference between accuracy and precision?**\n\"Accuracy\" and \"precision\" are general terms throughout science. A good way to internalize the difference are the common \"bullseye diagrams\". In machine learning\/statistics as a whole, accuracy vs. precision is analogous to bias vs. variance.","07468e6c":"as you can see in the below in python, it is so easy perform some query on the dataframe:","687cffbb":"<a id=\"23\"><\/a> <br>\n### 6-2-5 violinplots"}}
