Checking Stationarity of Time Series Data\n* From the plot of data we can see that the it is stationary, though we have to check it statistically. ### Check Stationarity of a Time Series\n\nA TS is said to be stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance remain constant over time. But why is it important? Most of the TS models work on the assumption that the TS is stationary. Intuitively, we can state that if a TS has a particular behaviour over time, there is a very high probability that it will follow the same in the future. Also, the theories related to stationary series are more mature and easier to implement as compared to non-stationary series.\n\nStationarity is defined using very strict criterion. However, for practical purposes we can assume the series to be stationary if it has constant statistical properties over time, ie. the following:\n\n* constant mean (For different time slots)\n* constant variance (For different time slots)\n* (Rolling mean\/variance should be checked and should be constant)\n* an autocovariance that does not depend on time\n* Two test for stationarity: ADF & KPSS test\n\nhttps:\/\/www.statsmodels.org\/stable\/examples\/notebooks\/generated\/stationarity_detrending_adf_kpss.html\n\n## Perform Augumented Dickey-Fuller test:\nDickey-Fuller Test: This is one of the statistical tests for checking stationarity. Here the null hypothesis is that the TS is non-stationary. The test results comprise of a Test Statistic and some Critical Values for difference confidence levels. If the \u2018Test Statistic\u2019 is less than the \u2018Critical Value\u2019, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the series is stationary.\n\n* Null Hypothesis - Series is not stationary\n\n* Alternate Hypothesis - Series is stationary","1ea351ed":"## Checking the distribution by making histogram and kde plot","6151b7d8":"### checking the definition of decompostion for additive nature time series data\n* y(t) = Trend + Seasonality + Noise","14783faa":"## Plotting the data using seaborn boxplot","696af978":"## Weighted moving average\n### Weighted moving average = (tweighting factor) + ((t-1)weighting factor-1) + ((t-n) * weighting factor-n)\/n\n* This is similar as rolling average except, we multiply with weighting factor so that more weight is given to recent data.\n* this function is not availbele, we have to make our own","571164c3":"# ACF and PACF plots:\n* Running the example creates a 2D plot showing the lag value along the x-axis and the correlation on the y-axis between -1 and 1.\n\n* Confidence intervals are drawn as a cone.

Autocorrelation plot\n* We can assume the distribution of each variable fits a Gaussian (bell curve) distribution. If this is the case, we can use the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient to summarize the correlation between the variables.\n\n* The Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient is a number between -1 and 1 that describes a negative or positive correlation respectively. A value of zero indicates no correlation.\n\n* We can calculate the correlation for time series observations with observations with previous time steps, called lags. Because the correlation of the time series observations is calculated with values of the same series at previous times, this is called a serial correlation, or an autocorrelation.\n\n* A plot of the autocorrelation of a time series by lag is called the AutoCorrelation Function, or the acronym ACF. This plot is sometimes called a correlogram or an autocorrelation plot.\n\n* This helps us to find if current value depends on previous values.
