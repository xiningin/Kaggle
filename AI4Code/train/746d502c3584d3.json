Doing placement as part of the course provides huge benefit by providing great working experience and increase your employability when you are ready to enter the market. No, you won't be just making coffee although you will be responsible for quite a fair amount of general administrative duties. Since you are considered an employee in the company. you will have the opportunity to develop your skills through meatier assignments. After you have completed your job placement, you may be given the opportunity to join the company if you exceed their expectations! \n\nFor this dataset, we have created the following objectives to answer common questions frequently asked.\n\n## Objectives\n1. Which factor influenced a candidate in getting placed?\n2. Does percentage matters for one to get placed?\n3. Which degree specialization is much demanded by corporate?\n4. Play with the data conducting all statistical tests.","c2145d73":"- It seems like work experience has no effect on job placement.","a1db2912":"## ROC curve\n- The dotted line represents the ROC curve of a purely random classifier; a good classifier stays as far away from that line as possible (toward the top-left corner).","70aa2319":"It seems like more males are able to obtain the job placement.
