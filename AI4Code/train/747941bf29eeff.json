Also the stop words have been removed along with the words with length shorter than 3 characters to reduce some stray words.","4e5d89bf":"We can now see the most frequent and rare words in the cleaned_text column based on idf score.

LSA is basically singular value decomposition.\n\nSVD decomposes the original DTM into three matrices S=U.(sigma).(V.T). Here the matrix U denotes the document-topic matrix while (V) is the topic-term matrix.\n\nEach row of the matrix U(document-term matrix) is the vector representation of the corresponding document. The length of these vectors is the number of desired topics. Vector representation for the terms in our data can be found in the matrix V (term-topic matrix).\n\nSo, SVD gives us vectors for every document and term in our data. The length of each vector would be k. We can then use these vectors to find similar words and similar documents using the cosine similarity method.\n\nWe can use the truncatedSVD function to implement LSA. The n_components parameter is the number of topics we wish to extract. The model is then fit and transformed on the result given by vectorizer.\n\nLastly note that LSA and LSI (I for indexing) are the same and the later is just sometimes used in information retrieval contexts.","c8daaef4":"![photo](https:\/\/analyticssteps.com\/backend\/media\/thumbnail\/5248416\/336284_1571738616_LSA-and-LDA-banner-image.jpg)","2b8a48f8":"> we are only interested in Text column","4568453b":"> Similalry for other documents we can do this. However note that values don't add to 1 as in LSA it is not probabiltiy of a topic in a document.","24a863be":"You can clearly see the difference after removal of stopwords and some shorter words.","65057da5":"Now we can get a list of the important words for each of the 10 topics as shown. For simplicity here I have shown 10 words for each topic.","9b66b5eb":"### EXTRACTING THE FEATURES AND CREATING THE DOCUMENT-TERM-MATRIX ( DTM )\nA document-term matrix or term-document matrix is a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. In a document-term matrix, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms.\n\nSome important points:-\n\n1) LSA is generally implemented with Tfidf values everywhere and not with the Count Vectorizer.\n\n2) max_features depends on your computing power and also on eval. metric (coherence score is a metric for topic model). Try the value that gives best eval. metric and doesn't limits processing power.\n\n3) Default values for min_df & max_df worked well.\n\n4) Can try different values for ngram_range.","ce8f1cad":"> Note that the values in a particular row adds to 1. This is beacuse each value denotes the % contribution of the corressponding topic in the document.","5f329db4":"### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\nLDA is the most popular technique.The topics then generate words based on their probability distribution.
