The lack of nucleoli in the nucleus is also observed.","acb31e73":"#### 18. Vesicles and Punctuate Cytosolic Patterns\n\nVesicles and punctuate cytosolic patterns are small cytosolic circular compartments.  There are several oraganelles and other cellular components in this category (Duplicate classes; Douglas et al 2018).\n\n1. Vesicles - Vesicles participate in cellular transport.\n2. Peroxisomes - Peroxisomes break down amino acids and fatty acids, and detoxify poisions.\n3. Endosomes - Endosomes are important in sorting compartments.\n4. Lysosomes - Lysosomes are in animal cells and break down various biomolecules and organelles.\n5. Lipid Droplets - Lipid droplets are important in fat storage.\n6. Cytoplasmic Bodies - Cytoplasmic bodies are distinct cytosolic organelles.\n\nAs shown below, the protein of interest in the organelles and other cellular components is showing in the cell in the overlay image.

Nuclear Speckles\n\nNuclear speckles are clusters enriched in pre-mRNA splicing factors, such as spliceosomes.  As described above, pre-mRNA has to undergo processing before translation can occur.  One way pre-mRNA undergoes processing is through removing extra pieces of RNA that do not belong in the final mRNA molecule.  This extra pieces of RNA is called an intron.  The coding part of RNA is called an exon (Douglas et al 2018; Nuclear Speckles).  ","f1ad69e2":"#### Quadruple Label - Cytosol, Nucleoli, Nucleoplasm, and Plasma Membrane\n\nThere are noticable differences between images in this category.  There are reasons for these differences.  Staining spatial arrangement and intensity is dependent on the arrangement of the proteins and the amount of proteins expressed.  Some of the images are blurred and have differences in intensity.  This may be caused by staining differences or protocol error.","0fd0dcf5":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)\nDouglas, Matthew, et al. Biology 2e. Rice University, 2018. ","a39def2b":"#### 7. Endoplasmic Reticulum\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is a tubular membraneous network that spreads through the cytoplasm and is continuous through the nuclear membrane.  There is the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.  The rough endoplasmic reticulum contains ribosomes and synthesizes proteins.  The smooth endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes lipids and biomolecules (Endoplasmic Reticulum).\n\nAs shown below, the protein of interest in the endoplasmic reticulum will show up in the cell.  The overlay image shows that the protein of interest in the endoplasmic reticulum in the cell.  Keep in mind that the protein of interest, which is green, may not be the same as protein used to highlight the endoplasmic reticulum, which is yellow.","3923d994":"### How Do the Organelles Appear Microscopically and What Are Their Functions?","19a303be":"**Negative Image 1**","efb486c2":"There are twenty different types of amino acids.  The amino acids have similar structure.  They differ in their side chain or R group.  The differences in R group is what creates the differences in structure and function in proteins.  Below are the different R groups for the amino acids.  It might be overwelming to look at all the structures.  The point is not to memorize the structures but to understand the differences in the structure and how these differences may influence protein structure and function (Douglas et al 2018).","5f60bb91":"#### Triple Label - Cytosol, Nucleoplasm. and Plasma Membrane\n\nThere are noticable differences between images in this category.

Nucleoplasm\n\nThe nucleoplasm is a semi-solid fluid that is inside the nucleus (Douglas et al 2018).  The nucleoplasm can be stained with DAPI, which is a special dye that binds to certain nucleotides, which appears as blue in the image.  DAPI does not bind to the nucleoli becuase there are lower amounts of DNA in that area.  The greeen in the protein is the protein of interest.  The protein of interest staining may vary according to the amount of protein in the cell and the spatial arragement of the protein (Nucleoplasm).  As shown below, the protein of interest in the nucleoplasm will show up throughout the area of the nucleus.  The overlay image shows that there is a stong dispersion between the protein of interest in the nucleoplasm and the nucleus."}}
