Here are some tips:\n- In this example, we've completely ignored the time, considering that all articles were available to be recommended to users at any time. A better approach would be to filter only articles that were available for users at a given time.\n- You could leverage the available contextual information to model users preferences across time (period of day, day of week, month), location (country and state\/district) and devices (browser, mobile native app).  \nThis contextual information can be easily incorporated in [Learn-to-Rank](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Learning_to_rank) models (like XGBoost Gradient Boosting Decision Trees with ranking objective), Logistic models (with categorical features [One-Hot encoded](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) or [Feature Hashed](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feature_hashing)), and [Wide & Deep models](https:\/\/ai.googleblog.com\/2016\/06\/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html), which is implemented in [TensorFlow](https:\/\/docs.w3cub.com\/tensorflow~guide\/tutorials\/wide_and_deep\/).

This approach is very simple to implement, but usually do not scale well for many users. A nice Python implementation of this approach in available in [Crab](http:\/\/muricoca.github.io\/crab\/).\n- **Model-based**: This approach, models are developed using different machine learning algorithms to recommend items to users.

A more robust evaluation approach could be to split train and test sets by a reference date, where the train set is composed by all interactions before that date, and the test set are interactions after that date.

The objective of a RecSys is to recommend relevant items for users, based on their preference. Preference and relevance are subjective, and they are generally inferred by items users have consumed previously.  \nThe main families of methods for RecSys are:  \n- [**Collaborative Filtering**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Collaborative_filtering): This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.   \n- [**Content-Based Filtering**](http:\/\/recommender-systems.org\/content-based-filtering\/): This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.  \n- **Hybrid methods**:  Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.","9d2c2528":"As there are different interactions types, we associate them with a weight or strength, assuming that, for example, a comment in an article indicates a higher interest of the user on the item than a like, or than a simple view.","243f04c7":"# Popularity model","69a8763d":"Let's test the best model (Hybrid) for my user.","8fa31d25":"Latent factor models compress user-item matrix into a low-dimensional representation in terms of latent factors. One advantage of using this approach is that instead of having a high dimensional matrix containing abundant number of missing values we will be dealing with a much smaller matrix in lower-dimensional space.  \nA reduced presentation could be utilized for either user-based or item-based neighborhood algorithms that are presented in the previous section. There are several advantages with this paradigm. It handles the sparsity of the original matrix better than memory based ones. Also comparing similarity on the resulting matrix is much more scalable especially in dealing with large sparse datasets.  ","ee863931":"Content-based filtering approaches leverage description or attributes from items the user has interacted to recommend similar items. It depends only on the user previous choices, making this method robust to avoid the *cold-start* problem.\nFor textual items, like articles, news and books, it is simple to use the raw text to build item profiles and user profiles.  \nHere we are using a very popular technique in information retrieval (search engines) named [TF-IDF](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tf%E2%80%93idf). This technique converts unstructured text into a vector structure, where each word is represented by a position in the vector, and the value measures how relevant a given word is for an article. As all items will be represented in the same [Vector Space Model](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vector_space_model), it is to compute similarity between articles.  \nSee this [presentation](https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/gabrielspmoreira\/discovering-users-topics-of-interest-in-recommender-systems-tdc-sp-2016) (from slide 30) for more information on TF-IDF and Cosine similarity."}}
