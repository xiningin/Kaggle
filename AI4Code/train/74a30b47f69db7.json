In this problem, you'll amend the code to create an agent that can also block its opponent from winning.  In particular, your agent should:\n- Select a winning move, if one is available.\n- Otherwise, it selects a move to block the opponent from winning, if the opponent has a move that it can play in its next turn to win the game. \n- If neither the agent nor the opponent can win in their next moves, the agent selects a random move.\n\nTo help you with this exercise, you are encouraged to start with the agent from the previous exercise.  \n\n**To check if the opponent has a winning move, you can use the `check_winning_move()` function, but you'll need to supply a different value for the `piece` argument.**  ","4359629a":"### 5) Submit to the competition\n\nNow, it's time to make your first submission to the competition!

(_If there is more than one move that lets the agent win the game, the agent can select any of them._)\n- Otherwise, it should select a random move.\n\nTo help you with this goal, we provide some helper functions in the code cell below.

To check if the agent can win in the next move, you should set `piece=obs.mark`.\n\n**To complete this exercise, you need to define `agent_q1()` in the code cell below.  To do this, you're encouraged to use the `check_winning_move()` function.**  \n\nThe `drop_piece()` function (defined in the code cell above) is called in the `check_winning_move()` function.
