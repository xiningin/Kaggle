Aquifer Doganella\n\nType: Aquifer\n\nDescription: The wells field Doganella is fed by two underground aquifers not fed by rivers or lakes but fed by meteoric infiltration. The upper aquifer is a water table with a thickness of about 30m. The lower aquifer is a semi-confined artesian aquifer with a thickness of 50m and is located inside lavas and tufa products. These aquifers are accessed through wells called Well 1, ..., Well 9. Approximately 80% of the drainage volumes come from the artesian aquifer. The aquifer levels are influenced by the following parameters: rainfall, humidity, subsoil, temperatures and drainage volumes.","f29495a3":"We can see that Pozzo 1 is shallow-depth groundwater, while another groundwater sources are deeper.
