Like `sweetviz` it is very easy to use and understand**","6c1b2506":"# Thank You :)","26046f2c":"# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)\n\n**EDA** is a technique,widely use for data analysis purpose. EDA is used to get insights out of your data for better model building. EDA is basically intersection of **statistics** and **visualization**.\n\nIn this notebook we will do EDA in very simple way. We will do EDA by using two very popular modules\n\n    1. sweetviz\n    2. autoviz\n   \nBoth of these modules are very simple to use.","dad6519d":"# Sweetviz\n\n**sweetviz is python library used for Exploratory Data Analysis.** It's a very simple to use and easy to understand it's output.

Download it and run it on your browser :)**","8dee080c":"**The output of sweetviz library is a html file. We need to provide a filename with html tag in `show_html` function.**"}}
