Scatter plots are created to show pairwise relationships and in the diagonal, the distribution plot is created to show the distribution of the data in the column.\n\nWe can also use pairplot for showcasing variables subset or even for plotting several types of variables on rows and columns.\n\nLet us understand the syntax of the pairplot() function below."}}
