Each row will be an instance of a kill by a player e.g after player A kills player B, given the current situation, what is the probability that player A's team wins that round.  We're going to add in situational features like what side the player is on, economic (dis)adv, player (dis)adv, if the bomb is planted etc.  This is currently my best guess on how SixteenZero does it but I'm sure they have more sophisticated methods and their own way of modelling the states.  The model should try to get as best classifier AUC as possible since having precise probabilities will accurately determine player performance.  \n\n\n---\n\n## Feature Creation\n\nLet's filter just for competitive maps and trim off the tail ranks","9aca2636":"## Training Models","2993d936":"### Adding in Men Advantage Matchup","de32f0d4":"### Starting Feature Matrix - Kills Only & Target Variable\nWe want to get the kills only so we need to find the moment that the player died.

It's similar to RWS\/HLTV rating in the sense that it's a kill-based assessment method but differs in that it's a more dynamic system to determine impact by taking into account situational environment.  The HLTV and RWS measure all linearly scale to the player's round performance tied to their aggregate kills, death, trades, bomb plants, etc.  While they measure **how well** a player achieved certain actions, they don't measure **the impact** it's had on the actual round. PRI is a good first step toward that direction in assessing the effectiveness of players by re-focusing the objective on winning the round and attributing the player's each individual kill to how much additional % chance did they add to their team winning the round.\n\nMathematically, A Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by a series of states with assigned possible actions, given each action, there's a wide range of other states it can be in with positive probability.\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/ad\/Markov_Decision_Process.svg\/800px-Markov_Decision_Process.svg.png)\nAfter transitioning to that state, there's also a reward given to the player for his\/her actions in the previous state.  If we think of each state as the current's game situation: is it post-plant? what's the economic advantage of a team? how many seconds are left? How many players are left?  And ultimately, did the player win that round?  Each of the players reward is the incremental probability that their action led to them winning the round.\n","92c864d5":"## Example: Calculating PRI for the first Pistol Round\n\nBad way to go about it but in actual practice, we can modify the demo parser to output initial round states. By the way, the Accuracy was about 82% before adding in Initial round states. This is just for the first pistol round on a de_dust2 game"}}
