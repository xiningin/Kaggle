Morevover about 20% students are missing their families, friends and relatives, this suggests that many students are separated from their families, friends and relatives due to pandemic.\n\n\n- We Also found out that about 45% students reported no change in their weight whereas 37% reported a weight gain and 18% students reported weight loss.\n\n\n- Finally we infer that Music is the best Stress-Busters among students followed by Extra-Activities such as drawing, writing, sketching etc. and then Internet Surfing is third on list for entertainment sources, also Online Gaming have also gained popularity among students for beating stress.","2159f3b4":"### Note :\n1.
