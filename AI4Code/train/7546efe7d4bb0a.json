The general steps are:\n- Step 1: Calculate the AD Statistic for each distribution, using the formula above.\n- Step 2: Find the statistic\u2019s p-value (probability value). The formula for the p-value depends on the value for the AD statistic from Step 1.

The test gives you a W value; small values indicate your sample is not normally distributed (you can reject the null hypothesis that your population is normally distributed if your values are under a certain threshold). The formula for the W value is:**\n\n![image.png](attachment:a6424078-13d1-4e9d-9aaa-2a809d3e3344.png)\n\nwhere:\n- xi are the ordered random sample values\n- ai are constants generated from the covariances, variances and means of the sample (size n) from a normally distributed sample.\n\n**The test has limitations, most importantly that the test has a bias by sample size.
