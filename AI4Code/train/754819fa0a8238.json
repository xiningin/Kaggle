At first I thought that when number_of_previous_late_payments_90_days_or_more has a value 1 or more that means that number_of_previous_late_payments_up_to_89_days and number_of_previous_late_payments_up_to_59_days would also have a value at least 1, e.g. if a person made a late payment after 91 days then it would be counted in all three columns since 91 days is more than 90, 89 and 59 days. But looking at data it seems that it is not the case. Whatever the reason for it there is strong correlation between these three. Two of them will be dropped before training model as they are heavily correlated. MIght be later readded to check how it affects the model.","28888a67":"data has 10 features, not counting id and target column\n","e45c48b8":"Target class is highly inbalanced.
