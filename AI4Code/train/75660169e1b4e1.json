However, in March cases of the disease were observed in other regions as well. **Delhi**, **Karnataka** and **Uttar Pradesh** started seeing steep rise in cases in March.

While **Kerala**, **Maharashtra** and **Uttar Pradesh** saw highest number of Indian cases, **Haryana**, **Rajasthan** and **Telengana** recorded highest number of foreign cases. Haryana is a hub of offices of many multinational companies while Telangana is an important IT hub. Rajasthan is a major tourist state.
