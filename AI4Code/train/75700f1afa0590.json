Recently, these vaccines have been evaluated as delivery vectors for heterologous antigens, as a means of simultaneous vaccination against two pathogens. The general consensus from published studies is that these vaccine vectors have the potential to be both safe and efficacious. However, some of the commonly employed vectors, for example Salmonella and adenovirus, often have **pre-existing immune responses in the host and this has the potential to modify the subsequent immune response to a vectored antigen**. This review examines the literature on this topic, and concludes that for bacterial vectors there can in fact, in some cases, be an enhancement in immunogenicity, typically humoral, w**hile for viral vectors pre-existing immunity is a hindrance for subsequent induction of cell-mediated responses**.\n* #### Abstract2\nUnderstanding **immune responses to viral infections** is crucial to progress in the quest for effective infection prevention and control. The **host immunity involves various mechanisms to combat viral infections**. Under certain circumstances, a **viral infection or vaccination** may result in a subverted immune system, which may lead to an exacerbated illness. Clinical evidence of enhanced illness by preexisting antibodies from vaccination, infection or maternal passive immunity is available for several viruses and is presumptively proposed for other viruses. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. It has been confirmed that certain infection- and\/or** vaccine-induced immunity could exacerbate viral infectivity** in Fc receptor- or complement bearing cells- mediated mechanisms. Considering that **antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) is a major obstacle in vaccine development**, there are continues efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms through identification of the epitopes and antibodies responsible for disease enhancement or protection. **This review discusses the recent findings on virally induced ADE**, and highlights the potential mechanisms leading to this condition.\n* #### Abstract3\n**Viral subunit vaccines often contain immunodominant** non-neutralizing epitopes that **divert host immune responses**. These epitopes should be eliminated in vaccine design, but there is no reliable method for evaluating an epitope's capacity to **elicit neutralizing immune responses**. Here we introduce a new concept \u2018neutralizing immunogenicity index' (NII) to evaluate an epitope's neutralizing immunogenicity. To determine the NII, we mask the epitope with a glycan probe and then assess the epitope's contribution to the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity. As proof-of-concept, we measure the NII for different epitopes on an immunogen comprised of the receptor-binding domain from MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Further, we design a variant form of this vaccine by masking an epitope that has a negative NII score. This engineered vaccine demonstrates significantly enhanced efficacy in protecting transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Our study may guide the rational design of highly effective subunit vaccines to combat MERS-CoV and other life-threatening viruses.\n","bd3dabed":"Print the Output.","cb188bc5":"### Our Results for SciBert with next sentence prediction\nWe had very poor results when running the task: *Methods evaluating potential complication of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients.* We decided to remove the SciBert with next sentence model from our final results.","d4e77a5f":"<a id=\"Doc2vec\"><\/a>\n## Doc2vec with Word Mover's Distance \n<hr>\nDoc2vec is very similar to word2vec with a slight altercation that allows the model to consider which document a particular word comes from.

The problem began in 2018 when unusually heavy rains on the Arabian Peninsula allowed populations to boom over several generations. In October 2019, the locusts swarmed south into Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, and in late December, they spread to Kenya, causing the worst infestation there in 70 years. Somalia\u2014which last week declared a national emergency and asked for increased food aid\u2014has already lost 100,000 hectares of crops and pasture. Another generation of locusts will likely hatch this month and cause more damage. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations called for $70 million to fight the outbreak with pesticides and help farmers. ### Glaciology After dropping sensors and a torpedo-shaped robot through a 700-meter hole in the ice, scientists in Antarctica last week revealed the first direct evidence that warm ocean temperatures around the rapidly retreating Thwaites Glacier could destabilize the key ice sheet. Researchers are worried because Thwaites\u2014larger than the state of Illinois\u2014helps block the ocean from reaching and warming the even bigger, unstable West Antarctic Ice Sheet, whose melting could eventually drive meters of sea level rise. Battling 2 months of stormy conditions, the team measured ocean waters beneath Thwaites at more than 2\u00b0C above the freezing point. The robot, Icefin (above, shown operating elsewhere in Antarctica), provided the first images of the glacier's grounding zone, the mysterious boundary where the floating coastal ice sheet attaches to bedrock. The project is part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a multiyear effort by the United States and the United Kingdom that is wrapping up its first full field season. ### Leadership Some researchers in Colombia are calling for a little-known molecular biologist appointed as the country's first ever science minister to resign. They are outraged by reports that she treated cancer patients with a fungal extract, without running a formal clinical trial. \u201cWe can only regret that the course of how to do science in our country has been left in the hands of pseudoscience,\u201d the Colombian Association of Medical Faculties wrote in a statement. In December 2019, Mabel Gisela Torres Torres was appointed to lead the newly created Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. In January, she told a newspaper she did not seek formal ethical, safety, and efficacy reviews of her work with patients because she believed the fungus posed no threat to human health. Her Ph.D. adviser has defended her and notes that metabolites in the fungi Torres studied have shown potential as a cancer treatment in cell and mouse studies. ### Environmental science !\n* #### Abstract2\nSIMPLE SUMMARY: Feline upper respiratory infection is a common disease in animal shelters. Without monitoring, effective control and prevention is difficult. We looked at a software system (a) used in shelters across the United States to determine if it can be used to track URI frequency and risk factors in a population. Reports from the software system (a) were compared to data collected manually. This showed that data currently collected were not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors. However, potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases. ABSTRACT: Objective\u2014Feline upper respiratory infection (URI) is a common, multi-factorial infectious disease syndrome endemic to many animal shelters. Although a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in shelter cats, URI is seldom formally monitored in shelter cat populations. Without monitoring, effective control and prevention of this often endemic disease is difficult. We looked at an integrated case management software system (a) for animal care organizations, widely used in shelters across the United States. Shelter staff routinely enter information regarding individual animals and disease status, but do not commonly use the software system to track frequency of disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if the software system (a) can be used to track URI frequency and selected risk factors in a population, and to evaluate the quality and completeness of the data as currently collected in a shelter. Design (type of study)\u2014Descriptive Survey. Animals (or Sample)\u2014317 cats in an animal shelter. Procedures\u2014Reports from the software system (a) containing data regarding daily inventory, daily intake, animal identification, location, age, vaccination status, URI diagnosis and URI duration were evaluated. The reports were compared to data collected manually by an observer (Ann Therese Kommedal) to assess discrepancies, completeness, timeliness, availability and accuracy. Data were collected 6 days a week over a 4 week period. Results\u2014Comparisons between the software system (a) reports and manually collected reports showed that 93% of inventory reports were complete and of these 99% were accurate. Fifty-two percent of the vaccination reports were complete, of which 97% were accurate. The accuracy of the software system\u2019s age reports was 76%. Two-hundred and twenty-three cats were assigned a positive or negative URI diagnosis by the observer. The predictive value of the URI status in the software system (a) was below 60% both for positive and negative URI diagnosis. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance\u2014data currently collected and entered into the software systems in the study shelter, was not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors, due to issues with both data quality and capture. However, the potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases. Relevant data points, i.e., health status at intake and outcome, vaccination date and status, as well as age, should be made mandatory to facilitate more useful data collection and reporting.\n* #### Abstract3\nSIMPLE SUMMARY: Pecking-related problems are common in intensive egg production, diminishing hen welfare and production performance, and negatively affecting sustainability. Beak trimming is a common practice to control these problems, but in Finland beak trimming is prohibited. Finnish egg producers have decades-long experience of egg production with intact-beaked hens. This experience, and their management of pecking-related problems, could benefit producers in other countries. The online questionnaire aimed to gather information about Finnish farmers\u2019 attitudes towards beak trimming, their estimation of the seriousness of pecking problems in their laying hen flocks, common risk factors and the best practices to prevent attendant problems. The questionnaire received 35 responses. Finnish egg producers appeared strongly to support a policy of not trimming beaks. Motivation against beak trimming was explained by considering it to be unnecessary and unethical. Most respondents did not regard pecking-related problems as being very severe in their flocks. Lighting, feeding and flock management problems represented the most important risk factors regarding pecking problems. Generally, the same topics were highlighted as being the most important intervention measures for managing an on-going pecking problem. The study indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy as a component of sustainable egg production. ABSTRACT: Pecking-related problems are common in intensive egg production, compromising hen welfare, causing farmers economic losses and negatively affecting sustainability. These problems are often controlled by beak trimming, which in Finland is prohibited. An online questionnaire aimed to collect information from farmers about pecking-related problems in Finnish laying hen flocks, important risk factors and the best experiences to prevent the problems. Additionally, the farmers\u2019 attitudes towards beak trimming were examined. We received 35 responses, which represents about 13% of all Finnish laying hen farms with \u2265300 laying hens. The majority of respondents stated that a maximum of 5\u20137% incidence of feather pecking or 1\u20132% incidence of cannibalism would be tolerable. The majority of respondents (74%) expressed that they would definitely not use beak-trimmed hens. Only two respondents indicated that they would probably use beak-trimmed hens were the practice permitted. Among risk factors, light intensity earned the highest mean (6.3), on a scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important). Other important problems included those that occurred during rearing, feeding, flock management and problems with drinking water equipment (mean 5.9, each). The most important intervention measures included optimal lighting and feeding, flock management, and removing the pecker and victim. Concluding, Finnish farmers had strong negative attitudes towards beak trimming. The study underlines the importance of flock management, especially lighting and feeding, in preventing pecking problems and indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy into sustainable egg production.","83dc7758":"### Our Results for BERT with Cosine Distance \nWe had very poor results when running the task: *Methods evaluating potential complication of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients.* We decided to remove the BERT model from our final results.\n","7c9dde4c":"### Our Results for TF-IDF\nThe following abstracts are the top 3 results after running the task: *Methods evaluating potential complication of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients.*","0d862d0a":"# Content :\n<hr>\n* [Pros and Cons](#pandc)\n* [Setup](#setup)\n* [Data loading and Cleaning](#data)\n* [TF-IDF with Cosine distance](#TF-IDF)\n* [Topic Modeling with Cosine distance](#Topic-Modeling)\n* [Knowledge based methods: Wordnet](#Wordnet)\n* [Doc2vec with Word Mover's Distance ](#Doc2vec)\n* [Pre-trained Word2vec with Word Mover's Distance](#Word2vec)\n* [BERT with Cosine Distance ](#BERT-cos)\n* [SciBert with Cosine distance](#SciBert-cos)\n* [SciBert with Next Sentence Prediction](#SciBert-next)\n* [Results](#Results)","585b3d6d":"Select a task to run the models on.","d47cd61b":"### Running the Topic Modeling with Cosine distance Model","36d27c6e":"\nTopic Modeling helper functions: ","2e2da287":"Wordnet helper functions:","d3eb51b5":"### Our Results for Wordnet\nThe following abstracts are the top 3 results after running the task: *Methods evaluating potential complication of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients.*\n","5e84d3fa":"### Our Results for Topic Modeling with Cosine distance\nThe following abstracts are the top 3 results after running the task: *Methods evaluating potential complication of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients.*","206ea61a":"Word2vec helper functions:","0f49a67f":"<a id=\"SciBert-cos\"><\/a>\n## SciBERT with Cosine distance\n<hr>\nSciBERT (https:\/\/github.com\/allenai\/scibert) is a BERT model that is specifically pre-trained on medical journal articles.

","b1b409e9":"* #### Abstract1\nFor almost 60\u2003years, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) has been the key player in monitoring the evolution and spread of influenza viruses and recommending the strains to be used in human influenza vaccines. The GISRS has also worked to continually monitor and assess the risk posed by potential pandemic viruses and to guide appropriate public health responses. \u2022 \u2002The expanded and enhanced role of the GISRS following the adoption of the International Health Regulations (2005), recognition of the continuing threat posed by avian H5N1 and the aftermath of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provide an opportune time to critically review the process by which influenza vaccine viruses are selected. In addition to identifying potential areas for improvement, such a review will also help to promote greater appreciation by the wider influenza and policy\u2010making community of the complexity of influenza vaccine virus selection. \u2022 \u2002The selection process is highly coordinated and involves continual year\u2010round integration of virological data and epidemiological information by National Influenza Centres (NICs), thorough antigenic and genetic characterization of viruses by WHO Collaborating Centres (WHOCCs) as part of selecting suitable candidate vaccine viruses, and the preparation of suitable reassortants and corresponding reagents for vaccine standardization by WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories (ERLs). \u2022 \u2002Ensuring the optimal effectiveness of vaccines has been assisted in recent years by advances in molecular diagnosis and the availability of more extensive genetic sequence data. However, there remain a number of challenging constraints including variations in the assays used, the possibility of complications resulting from non\u2010antigenic changes, the limited availability of suitable vaccine viruses and the requirement for recommendations to be made up to a year in advance of the peak of influenza season because of production constraints. \u2022 \u2002Effective collaboration and coordination between human and animal influenza networks is increasingly recognized as an essential requirement for the improved integration of data on animal and human viruses, the identification of unusual influenza A viruses infecting human, the evaluation of pandemic risk and the selection of candidate viruses for pandemic vaccines. \u2022 \u2002Training workshops, assessments and donations have led to significant increases in trained laboratory personnel and equipment with resulting expansion in both geographical surveillance coverage and in the capacities of NICs and other laboratories. This has resulted in a significant increase in the volume of information reported to WHO on the spread, intensity and impact of influenza. In addition, initiatives such as the WHO Shipment Fund Project have facilitated the timely sharing of clinical specimens and virus isolates and contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the global distribution and temporal circulation of different viruses. It will be important to sustain and build upon the gains made in these and other areas. \u2022 \u2002Although the haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is likely to remain the assay of choice for the antigenic characterization of viruses in the foreseeable future, alternative assays \u2013 for example based upon advanced recombinant DNA and protein technologies \u2013 may be more adaptable to automation. Other technologies such as microtitre neuraminidase inhibition assays may also have significant implications for both vaccine virus selection and vaccine development. \u2022 \u2002Microneutralization assays provide an important adjunct to the HAI assay in virus antigenic characterization. Improvements in the use and potential automation of such assays should facilitate large\u2010scale serological studies, while other advanced techniques such as epitope mapping should allow for a more accurate assessment of the quality of a protective immune response and aid the development of additional criteria for measuring immunity. \u2022 \u2002Standardized seroepidemiological surveys to assess the impact of influenza in a population could help to establish well\u2010characterized banks of age\u2010stratified representative sera as a national, regional and global resource, while providing direct evidence of the specific benefits of vaccination. \u2022 \u2002Advances in high\u2010throughput genetic sequencing coupled with advanced bioinformatics tools, together with more X\u2010ray crystallographic data, should accelerate understanding of the genetic and phenotypic changes that underlie virus evolution and more specifically help to predict the influence of amino acid changes on virus antigenicity. \u2022 \u2002Complex mathematical modelling techniques are increasingly being used to gain insights into the evolution and epidemiology of influenza viruses. However, their value in predicting the timing and nature of future antigenic and genetic changes is likely to be limited at present. The application of simpler non\u2010mechanistic statistical algorithms, such as those already used as the basis of antigenic cartography, and phylogenetic modelling are more likely to be useful in facilitating vaccine virus selection and in aiding assessment of the pandemic potential of avian and other animal influenza viruses. \u2022 \u2002The adoption of alternative vaccine technologies \u2013 such as live\u2010attenuated, quadrivalent or non\u2010HA\u2010based vaccines \u2013 has significant implications for vaccine virus selection, as well as for vaccine regulatory and manufacturing processes. Recent collaboration between the GISRS and vaccine manufacturers has resulted in the increased availability of egg isolates and high\u2010growth reassortants for vaccine production, the development of qualified cell cultures and the investigation of alternative methods of vaccine potency testing. WHO will continue to support these and other efforts to increase the reliability and timeliness of the global influenza vaccine supply. \u2022 \u2002The WHO GISRS and its partners are continually working to identify improvements, harness new technologies and strengthen and sustain collaboration. WHO will continue in its central role of coordinating worldwide expertise to meet the increasing public health need for influenza vaccines and will support efforts to improve the vaccine virus selection process, including through the convening of periodic international consultations.\n* #### Abstract2\nuntington\u2019s dementia: a conundrum in fluid management H.

In addition to natural outbreaks, there is the potential for exposure to VEEV via aerosolized virus particles. There are currently no FDA-licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies for VEEV. Passive immunotherapy is an approved method used to protect individuals against several pathogens and toxins. Human polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) are ideal, but this is dependent upon serum from convalescent human donors, which is in limited supply. Non-human-derived PAbs can have serious immunoreactivity complications, and when \u201chumanized,\u201d these antibodies may exhibit reduced neutralization efficiency. To address these issues, transchromosomic (Tc) bovines have been created, which can produce potent neutralizing human antibodies in response to hyperimmunization. In these studies, we have immunized these bovines with different VEEV immunogens and evaluated the protective efficacy of purified preparations of the resultant human polyclonal antisera against low- and high-dose VEEV challenges. These studies demonstrate that prophylactic or therapeutic administration of the polyclonal antibody preparations (TcPAbs) can protect mice against lethal subcutaneous or aerosol challenge with VEEV. Furthermore, significant protection against unrelated coinfecting viral pathogens can be conferred by combining individual virus-specific TcPAb preparations. IMPORTANCE With the globalization and spread or potential aerosol release of emerging infectious diseases, it will be critical to develop platforms that are able to produce therapeutics in a short time frame. By using a transchromosomic (Tc) bovine platform, it is theoretically possible to produce antigen-specific highly neutralizing therapeutic polyclonal human antibody (TcPAb) preparations in 6 months or less. In this study, we demonstrate that Tc bovine-derived Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)-specific TcPAbs are highly effective against VEEV infection that mimics not only the natural route of infection but also infection via aerosol exposure. Additionally, we show that combinatorial TcPAb preparations can be used to treat coinfections with divergent pathogens, demonstrating that the Tc bovine platform could be beneficial in areas where multiple infectious diseases occur contemporaneously or in the case of multipathogen release.","1339e4bd":"Match the ranks with their corresponding article.","0473675a":"<a id=\"TF-IDF\"><\/a>\n## TF-IDF with Cosine distance\n<hr>\nTerm Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a basic NLP method that determines the importance of an individual word relative to a document.

Although vaccination with a DNA prime\/recombinant vaccinia-vectored vaccine boost strategy has been found to be effective in some trials with non-human primate\/simian\/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) models, it remains unclear whether this vaccination strategy could elicit mature equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) Env-specific **antibodies**, thus protecting vaccinated horses against EIAV infection. Therefore, in this pilot study we vaccinated horses using a strategy based on DNA prime\/recombinant Tiantan vaccinia (rTTV)-vectored vaccines encoding EIAV env and gag genes, and observed the development of Env-specific antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and p26-specific antibodies. Vaccination with DNA induced low titer, low avidity, and the predominant recognition of linear epitopes by Env-specific antibodies, which was enhanced by boosting vaccinations with rTTV vaccines. However, the maturation levels of Env-specific antibodies induced by the DNA\/rTTV vaccines were significantly lower than those induced by the attenuated vaccine EIAV(FDDV). Additionally, DNA\/rTTV vaccines did not elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. After challenge with a virulent EIAV strain, all of the vaccinees and control horses died from EIAV disease. These data indicate that the regimen of DNA prime\/rTTV vaccine boost did not induce mature Env-specific antibodies, which might have contributed to immune protection failure.\n* #### Abstract2\nA **vaccine** for equine coronavirus (ECoV) is so far unavailable. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is antigenically related to ECoV; it is therefore possible that BCoV vaccine will induce antibodies against ECoV in horses. This study investigated antibody response to ECoV in horses inoculated with BCoV vaccine. Virus neutralization tests showed that antibody titers against ECoV increased in all six horses tested at 14 days post inoculation, although the antibody titers were lower against ECoV than against BCoV. This study showed that BCoV vaccine provides horses with antibodies against ECoV to some extent. It is unclear whether antibodies provided by BCoV vaccine are effective against ECoV, and therefore ECoV challenge studies are needed to evaluate efficacy of the vaccine in the future.\n* #### Abstract3\nBACKGROUND: The **development of a protective vaccine** against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is an alternative approach for interrupting the domestic cycle of Leishmania infantum. Given the importance of sand fly salivary proteins as potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in the last few decades. In this context, we previously immunized dogs with a vaccine composed of L. braziliensis antigens plus saponin as the adjuvant and sand fly salivary gland extract (LBSapSal vaccine). This vaccine elicited an increase in both anti-saliva and anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes, higher counts of specific circulating CD8(+) T cells, and high NO production. METHODS: We investigated the immunogenicity and protective effect of LBSapSal vaccination after intradermal challenge with 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(7) late-log-phase L. infantum promastigotes in the presence of sand fly saliva of Lutzomyia longipalpis. The dogs were followed for up to 885 days after challenge. RESULTS: The LBSapSal vaccine presents extensive antigenic diversity with persistent humoral and cellular immune responses, indicating resistance against CVL is triggered by high levels of total IgG and its subtypes (IgG1 and IgG2); expansion of circulating CD5(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and is Leishmania-specific; and reduction of splenic parasite load. CONCLUSIONS: These results encourage further study of vaccine strategies addressing Leishmania antigens in combination with proteins present in the saliva of the vector.","07b8cedf":"* #### Abstract1\nIt is of great interest to understand the molecular details of the pathways that constitute species barriers to viral infection.

The methods used to identify species-specific restriction to retroviral infection, and the identification of TRIM5\u03b1 itself, are outlined. TRIM5\u03b1 mediates an early postentry block to sensitive retroviral infection, usually before viral DNA synthesis. Results from mutational analysis of TRIM5\u03b1 and their contribution to a mechanistic model for TRIM5\u03b1 antiviral activity are discussed.

Since viruses are potent inducers of gamma interferon production and elicit immune responses most probably mediated by Th1 cells, like B-cell immunoglobulin G2a secretion, we analyzed interleukin-12 message expression after infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and mouse adenovirus. Our results indicated that the message for the p40 component of interleukin-12 was transiently increased shortly after infection. Interleukin-12 was expressed mainly by macrophages. Therefore, production of interleukin-12 might constitute the initial event that would determine the subsequent characteristics of the immune response elicited by viral infections.\n* #### Abstract3\nRecent studies have shown that natural infection by HIV-2 leads to the elicitation of high titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against primary HIV-2 strains (T. I. de Silva, et al., J. Virol. 86:930\u2013946, 2012; R. Kong, et al., J. Virol. 86:947\u2013960, 2012; G. Ozkaya Sahin, et al., J. Virol. 86:961\u2013971, 2012). Here, we describe the envelope (Env) binding and neutralization properties of 15 anti-HIV-2 human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 14 of which were newly generated from 9 chronically infected subjects. All 15 MAbs bound specifically to HIV-2 gp120 monomers and neutralized heterologous primary virus strains HIV-2(7312A) and HIV-2(ST). Ten of 15 MAbs neutralized a third heterologous primary virus strain, HIV-2(UC1). The median 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) for these MAbs were surprisingly low, ranging from 0.007 to 0.028 \u03bcg\/ml. Competitive Env binding studies revealed three MAb competition groups: CG-I, CG-II, and CG-III. Using peptide scanning, site-directed mutagenesis, chimeric Env constructions, and single-cycle virus neutralization assays, we mapped the epitope of CG-I antibodies to a linear region in variable loop 3 (V3), the epitope of CG-II antibodies to a conformational region centered on the carboxy terminus of V4, and the epitope(s) of CG-III antibodies to conformational regions associated with CD4- and coreceptor-binding sites. HIV-2 Env is thus highly immunogenic in vivo and elicits antibodies having diverse epitope specificities, high potency, and wide breadth. In contrast to the HIV-1 Env trimer, which is generally well shielded from antibody binding and neutralization, HIV-2 is surprisingly vulnerable to broadly reactive NAbs. The availability of 15 human MAbs targeting diverse HIV-2 Env epitopes can facilitate comparative studies of HIV\/SIV Env structure, function, antigenicity, and immunogenicity.","57ecba0d":"<a id=\"setup\"><\/a>\n# Setup\n<hr>\nWe ran this Notebook on a 20 core, 32GB Ram, GPU machine.

We sought to investigate **antibody-dependent enhancement** of feline infectious peritonitis virus infection of primary feline peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Enhancement of infection was assessed, after indirect immunofluorescent-antibody labelling of infected cells, by determining the ratio between the number of cells infected in the presence and absence of virus-specific antibody. Infection enhancement was initially demonstrated by using heat-inactivated, virus-specific feline antiserum. Functional compatibility between murine immunoglobulin molecules and feline Fc receptors was demonstrated by using murine anti-sheep erythrocyte serum and an antibody-coated sheep erythrocyte phagocytosis assay. Thirty-seven murine monoclonal antibodies specific for the nucleocapsid, membrane, or spike proteins of feline infectious peritonitis virus or transmissible gastroenteritis virus were assayed for their ability to enhance the infectivity of feline infectious peritonitis virus. Infection enhancement was mediated by a subset of spike protein-specific monoclonal antibodies. A distinct correlation was seen between the ability of a monoclonal antibody to cause virus neutralization in a routine cell culture neutralization assay and its ability to mediate infection enhancement of macrophages. Infection enhancement was shown to be Fc receptor mediated by blockade of antibody-Fc receptor interaction using staphylococcal protein A. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that antibody-dependent enhancement of feline infectious peritonitis virus infectivity is mediated by antibody directed against specific sites on the spike protein.\n* #### Abstract2\n2013 marks a milestone year for **plasmid DNA vaccine development** as a first-in-class cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA vaccine enters pivotal phase 3 testing.

The vaccine\u2019s planned initial indication under investigation is for prevention of CMV reactivation in CMV-seropositive (CMV(+)) recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 proof-of-concept study provided initial evidence of the safety of this product in CMV(+) HCT recipients who underwent immune ablation conditioning regimens. This study revealed a significant reduction in viral load endpoints and increased frequencies of pp65-specific interferon-\u03b3-producing T cells in vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients. The results of this endpoint-defining trial provided the basis for defining the primary and secondary endpoints of a global phase 3 trial in HCT recipients.

However, there are **limited data defining the immune response** to the inactivated vaccine in this population. METHODS: This prospective study compared the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the trivalent subvirion influenza vaccine in pediatric liver transplant recipients with those in their healthy siblings. All subjects received inactivated influenza vaccine. Hemagglutination inhibition and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays for New Caledonia and Shanghai strains were performed at baseline, after each vaccine dose, and 3 months after the series. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold increase in antibody titers; seroprotection was defined as an antibody titer \u22651:40. An increase in the number of T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 was considered to be a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot response. RESULTS: After 1 dose of vaccine, transplant recipients achieved rates of antibody seroprotection and seroconversion that were similar to those achieved by their healthy siblings. However, for both influenza strains, IFN-\u03b3 responses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot were significantly attenuated in transplant recipients after 2 doses of vaccine. No cases of influenza or vaccine-related serious adverse events were documented in the study. CONCLUSIONS: The diminished cell-mediated immune response to influenza vaccination that was observed in pediatric liver transplant recipients suggests that the current vaccine strategy may not provide optimal protection. Because of concerns regarding potential emergence of more virulent influenza strains, further studies are warranted to determine if IFN-\u03b3 responses are predictive of efficacy and to identify the optimal vaccination strategy to protect populations with a high risk of infection.\n","23365b45":"* #### Abstract1\nDNA vaccination has been developed in the last two decades in human and animal species as a promising alternative to conventional vaccination. It consists in the injection, in the muscle, for example, of plasmid DNA encoding the vaccinating polypeptide. Electroporation which forces the entrance of the plasmid DNA in cells at the injection point has been described as a powerful and promising strategy to enhance DNA vaccine efficacy. Due to the fact that the vaccine is composed of DNA, close attention on the fate of the plasmid DNA upon vaccination has to be taken into account, especially at the injection point. To perform such studies, the muscle injection point has to be precisely recovered and collected several weeks after injection. This is even more difficult for large and growing animals. A technique has been developed to localize precisely and collect efficiently the muscle injection points in growing piglets 6 weeks after DNA vaccination accompanied or not by electroporation. Electroporation did not significantly increase the level of remaining plasmids compared to nonelectroporated piglets, and, in all the cases, the levels were below the limit recommended by the FDA to research integration events of plasmid DNA into the host DNA.\n* #### Abstract2\nReplication-competent controlled virus vectors were derived from the virulent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) wild-type strain 17syn+ by placing one or two replication-essential genes under the stringent control of a gene switch that is coactivated by heat and an antiprogestin. Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wild-type virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors\u2014which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines\u2014induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wild-type virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and a second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated, vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific cellular immune responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus, as well as a hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a severalfold enhancement of these immune responses. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation\/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, the necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and by activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above-mentioned hypothesis and suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention\/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.\n* #### Abstract3\nCoronavirus contains three envelope proteins, M, E and S, and a nucleocapsid, which consists of genomic RNA and N protein, within the viral envelope. We studied the macromolecular interactions involved in coronavirus assembly in cells infected with a murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated an interaction between N protein and M protein in infected cells. Pulse-labeling experiments showed that newly synthesized, unglycosylated M protein interacted with N protein in a pre-Golgi compartment, which is part of the MHV budding site. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses further revealed that M protein interacted with only genomic-length MHV mRNA, mRNA 1, while N protein interacted with all MHV mRNAs. These data indicated that M protein interacted with the nucleocapsid, consisting of N protein and mRNA 1, in infected cells. The M protein-nucleocapsid interaction occurred in the absence of S and E proteins. Intracellular M protein-N protein interaction was maintained after removal of viral RNAs by RNase treatment. However, the M protein-N protein interaction did not occur in cells coexpressing M protein and N protein alone. These data indicated that while the M protein-N protein interaction, which is independent of viral RNA, occurred in the M protein-nucleocapsid complex, some MHV function(s) was necessary for the initiation of M protein-nucleocapsid interaction. The M protein-nucleocapsid interaction, which occurred near or at the MHV budding site, most probably represented the process of specific packaging of the MHV genome into MHV particles.","1ace6cad":"Doc2vec helper functions:","eb8c8d6e":"BERT helper functions:","8b5bffb0":"### Pros\n1. Is not overly reliant on one single method due to the ensemble framework.\n2. Uses a variety of NLP tools ranging from more basic methods such as TF-IDF all the way to BERT.\n3. Contains both pre-trained methods and methods trained on the actual data. Thus a compromise between relying on prior knowledge and the raw data.\n\n \n\n### Cons\n1. Pre-processing of the data is very standard for a NLP problem, could be extended.\n2. The method could be made faster, the runtime is slow when doing on-demand searches. \n3. Only explored one type of topic modeling, could also explore LSD.","a7420ab2":"### Running the BERT with Cosine Distance model \n","faea6e3a":"<a id=\"Wordnet\"><\/a>\n## Knowledge based methods: Wordnet\n<hr>\nWordnet is a method for building a so-called knowledge graph. Knowledge graphs map the relationship between different words by using a graph that has more general terms in the middle of the graph and more specific terms along the terminal nodes. These graphs can be used to measure the distance between words. That is, words that can be reached on the graph in fewer steps are considered more similar. Therefore two sentences or documents can be compared by calculating the pairwise distance between every word.\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/5hMgdHP\/wordnet-figure.png\" alt=\"wordnet-figure\" border=\"0\">","55fbb6fe":"You must download the Bert and Word2vec models from [here](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1q91MEExCliyz-mmp8bWCn6L7_lm8mHIF?usp=sharing) and place them in a local folder called 'bin'","15d3dd45":"### Running the Doc2vec model ","854b3abe":"<a id=\"pandc\"><\/a>\n# Pros and Cons of our Approach:\n<hr>","c3049a74":"### Running the TF-IDF Model"}}
