Here are a few ideas:\n* Try chaging the hyperparameters to achieve a higher accuracy within fewer epochs. You use the comparison table on the Jovian.ml project page to compare your experiments.\n* Try adding more convolutional layers, or increasing the number of channels in each convolutional layer\n* Try using a feedforward neural network and see what's the maximum accuracy you can achieve\n* Read about some of the startegies mentioned above for reducing overfitting and achieving better results, and try to implement them by looking into the PyTorch docs.\n* Modify this notebook to train a model for a different dataset (e.g. CIFAR100 or ImageNet)\n\nIn the next tutorial, we will continue to improve our model's accuracy using techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization and dropout. We will also learn about residual networks (or ResNets), a small but critical change to the model architecture that will significantly boost the performance of our model.

For this tutorial, we'll use the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of 60000 32x32 px colour images in 10 classes. Here are some sample images from the dataset:\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/709\/1*LyV7_xga4jUHdx4_jHk1PQ.png\" style=\"max-width:480px\">\n","6c8fdd07":"## System Setup\n\nThis notebook is hosted on [Jovian.ml](https:\/\/www.jovian.ml), a platform for sharing data science projects. If you want to follow along and run the code as you read, you can choose the \"Run on Kaggle\" option from the \"Run\" dropdown above. \n\nOtherwise, to run the code on your machine, you can clone the notebook, install the required dependencies using [conda](https:\/\/conda.io), and start Jupyter by running the following commands:\n\n```\npip install jovian --upgrade           # Install the jovian library \njovian clone 05-cifar10-cnn            # Download notebook & dependencies\ncd 05-cifar10-cnn                      # Enter the created directory \nconda create -n 05-cifar10-cnn         # Create virtual env\nconda activate 05-cifar10-cnn          # Activate virtual env\nconda install jupyter                  # Install Jupyter\njupyter notebook                       # Start Jupyter\n```\n\nOn older versions of conda, you might need to run `source activate 05-cifar10-cnn` to activate the environment. For a more detailed explanation of the above steps, check out the System setup section in the [first notebook](https:\/\/jovian.ml\/aakashns\/01-pytorch-basics). \n\nBefore you start executing the code below, you may want to clear the cell outputs by selecting \"Kernel > Restart and Clear Output\" from the Jupyter notebook menu bar, to avoid confus\n\nWe begin by importing the required modules & libraries.","71164998":"Our model reaches an accuracy of around 75%, and by looking at the graph, it seems unlikely that the model will achieve an accuracy higher than 80% even after training for a long time. This suggests that we might need to use a more powerful model to capture the relationship between the images and the labels more accurately. This can be done by adding more convolutional layers to our model, or incrasing the no. of channels in each convolutional layer, or by using regularization techniques.\n\nWe can also plot the training and validation losses to study the trend.","7ec36c3f":"Once again, let's save and commit our work using `jovian` before proceeding further.","ba63a30e":"Let's define a helper function `predict_image`, which returns the predicted label for a single image tensor.","c8dc2e5f":"It's important to record the hyperparameters of every experiment you do, to replicate it later and compare it against other experiments.

However, if you train the model for long enough, you will notice that the training loss continues to decrease, while the validation loss stops decreasing, and even starts to increase after a certain point! \n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/1QU0m.png\" style=\"max-width:400px;\">\n\nThis phenomenon is called **overfitting**, and it is the no. 1 why many machine learning models give rather terrible results on real-world data. It happens because the model, in an attempt to minimize the loss, starts to learn patters are are unique to the training data, sometimes even memorizing specific training examples. Because of this, the model does not generalize well to previously unseen data.\n\n\nFollowing are some common stragegies for avoiding overfitting:\n\n- Gathering and generating more training data, or adding noise to it\n- Using regularization techniques like batch normalization & dropout\n- Early stopping of model's training, when validation loss starts to increase\n\nWe will cover these topics in more detail in the next tutorial in this series, and learn how we can reach an accuracy of **over 90%** by making minor but important changes to our model.","41d27aeb":"To seamlessly use a GPU, if one is available, we define a couple of helper functions (`get_default_device` & `to_device`) and a helper class `DeviceDataLoader` to move our model & data to the GPU as required.

We expect these values to be similar to those for the validation set. If not, we might need a better validation set that has similar data and distribution as the test set (which often comes from real world data).","a681e706":"`jovian.commit` uploads the notebook to your [Jovian.ml](https:\/\/www.jovian.ml) account and creates a sharable link for your notebook as shown above.

You can also download all the files together using the *Download Zip* option in the *Clone* dropdown.\n\nData science work is often fragmented across many different platforms (Git for code, Dropbox\/S3 for datasets & artifacts, spreadsheets for hyperparameters, metrics etc.) which can make it difficult to share and reproduce experiments. Jovian.ml solves this by capturing everyting related to a data science project on a single platform, while providing a seamless workflow for capturing, sharing and reproducting your work.

For this tutorial however, we will use a convolutional neural network, using the `nn.Conv2d` class from PyTorch.\n\n> The 2D convolution is a fairly simple operation at heart: you start with a kernel, which is simply a small matrix of weights. This kernel \u201cslides\u201d over the 2D input data, performing an elementwise multiplication with the part of the input it is currently on, and then summing up the results into a single output pixel. - [Source](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1)\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1070\/1*Zx-ZMLKab7VOCQTxdZ1OAw.gif\" style=\"max-width:400px;\">\n\n\nLet us implement a convolution operation on a 1 channel image with a 3x3 kernel.","a2d8c6a5":"Let's verify that the model produces the expected output on a batch of training data.

We'll use the `random_split` helper method from PyTorch to do this. To ensure that we always create the same validation set, we'll also set a seed for the random number generator.","6c108cc3":"The dataset is extracted to the directory `data\/cifar10`.
