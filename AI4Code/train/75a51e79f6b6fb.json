That's why BJK's stock price value and trading volume increased rapidly, actually they are both peak points, and then they both returned to normalcy.

The derbies between Galatasaray and Fenerbahce is always more intense than other derbies. So we can count GS and FB are best two teams in the league and Besiktas comes after them.

In my opinion, the reason of rapid decrease of prices in 2011 is chicane lawsuit that affects all sports clubs in Turkey and it caused a panic in investments in sports clubs, especially from foreigner investors. Moreover, the reason of the jump in 2016 of the stock price of BJK was they were really succesful both in Champions League and Turkish Super League, they were leader in their Champions League group and their game was near perfect in Turkish Super League. Surely there are other factors that affect stock prices of these assets like country risk and the strategies that these clubs CEO's follow. However, I find these jumps and downs more interesting."}}
