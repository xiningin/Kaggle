Thanks to the large scale advertisement, I can't seem to get the ad out of my head. Needless to say, Trivago was the main platform I used for my hotel booking. The main few things I will usually consider include prices per night, distance of hotel from attractions and restaurants, availability of free breakfasts, scenery in hotel room, cleaniness of hotel room and of course, availability of free wifi. In this dataset, we ae able to know different types of bookings (i.e type of hotel, duration of stay, types of visitors, types of booking, etc).\n\n# Column information\n- **Hotel**\n * H1: Resort hotel\n * H2: City hotel\n- **is_canceled**\n * 1: Canceled \n * 0: Not canceled\n- **lead_time**\n * No of days thaat elapsed between entering date of booking into property management system and arrival date\n- **arrival_date_year**\n * Year of arrival date (2015-2017)\n- **arrival_date_month**\n * Month of arrival date (Jan - Dec)\n- **arrival_date_week_numberr**\n * Week number of year for arrival date (1-53)\n- **arrival_date_day_of_month**\n * Day of arrival date\n- **stays_in_weekend_nights**\n * No of weekend nights (Sat\/Sun) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel\n- **stays_in_week_nights**\n * No of week nights (Mon - Fri) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel\n- **Adults** \n- **Children**\n- **Babies**\n- **meal** \n * Type of meal booked.

Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons.\n- **assigned_room_type**\n * Code for the type of room assigned to the booking. Sometimes the assigned room type differs from the reserved room type due to hotel operation reasons (e.g. overbooking) or by customer request. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons.\n- **booking_changes**\n * Number of changes\/amendments made to the booking from the moment the booking was entered on the PMS until the moment of check-in or cancellation\n- **deposit_type**\n * Indication on if the customer made a deposit to guarantee the booking.
