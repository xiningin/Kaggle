LIME\n\nSkater can leverage LIME to explain model predictions. Typically, its `LimeTabularExplainer` class helps in explaining predictions on tabular (i.e. matrix) data. For numerical features, it perturbs them by sampling from a Normal(0,1) and doing the inverse operation of mean-centering and scaling, according to the means and stds in the training data. For categorical features, it perturbs by sampling according to the training distribution, and making a binary feature that is 1 when the value is the same as the instance being explained. The `explain_instance()` function generates explanations for a prediction. First, we generate neighborhood data by randomly perturbing features from the instance. We then learn locally weighted linear (surrogate) models on this neighborhood data to explain each of the classes in an interpretable way.","3424099b":"> __Tip:__ As in our case, If you don\u2019t have a separate held-out dataset, you can fit `PermutationImportance` on the same data as used for training; this still allows to inspect the model, but doesn\u2019t show which features are important for **generalization**. So you'd better use your _validation dataset_, if you have one, for computing your features permutation importances.","36e7edad":"## Feature Importances with SHAP\n\nThis basically takes the average of the SHAP value magnitudes across the dataset and plots it as a simple bar chart.","73230abe":"Eli5 provides a way to compute feature importances for any black-box estimator by measuring how score decreases when a feature is not available; the method is also known as \u201cpermutation importance\u201d or \u201cMean Decrease Accuracy (MDA). This is **more reliable** but this technique is **computationally slow** with a big number of features.","88b264a4":"> The above visualization can be interacted with in multiple ways. The visualization shows for exemple some interesting model prediction pattern decisions. For exemple :\n>\n>- The first 90 test samples all probably are classified as 'Hight Quality' wines and that have a hight alcohol degree (> 11.3) that you can highlight by choosing in the left menu 'alcohol effects'\n>- If you display the 'alcohol' feature with the top drop-down menu, you can confirm that the alcohol level begin to play an important role in pushing upward the prediction at a level around 11.3.\n>- for 'pH', we can confirm a behavioral shift of the model after 3.5, as seen before.

SHAP has c++ implementations supporting  *XGBoost*, *LightGBM*, *CatBoost*, and *scikit-learn* tree models.\n\nSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. Typically, SHAP values try to explain the output of a model (function) as a sum of the effects of each feature being introduced into a conditional expectation. Importantly, for non-linear functions the order in which features are introduced matters. The SHAP values result from averaging over all possible orderings. Proofs from game theory show this is the only possible consistent approach. \n\nAn intuitive way to understand the Shapley value is the following: The feature values enter a room in random order. All feature values in the room participate in the game (= contribute to the prediction). The Shapley value __$\u03d5_{ij}$__ is the average marginal contribution of feature value __$x_{ij}$__ by joining whatever features already entered the room before, i.e.\n\n$$\\phi_{ij}=\\sum_{\\text{All.orderings}}val(\\{\\text{features.before.j}\\}\\cup{}x_{ij})-val(\\{\\text{features.before.j}\\})$$\n\nThe following figure from the KDD 18 paper, [_Consistent Individualized Feature Attribution for Tree Ensembles_](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1802.03888.pdf) summarizes this in a nice way!\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6Rc1dsa.png)","7d291a59":"#  ELI5 Model Interpretation\n\nAccording to their documentation, __[ELI5](https:\/\/github.com\/TeamHG-Memex\/eli5)__ (\"Explain Like I'm 5\") is a Python library which helps to debug machine learning classifiers and regressors and explain their predictions in an easy to understand an intuitive way.

Craven described as the TREPAN algorithm. \n\nWe recommend checking out the following excellent papers on the TREPAN algorithm to build surrogate trees.\n - [_Mark W. Craven(1996) EXTRACTING COMPREHENSIBLE MODELS FROM TRAINED NEURAL NETWORKS_](http:\/\/ftp.cs.wisc.edu\/machine-learning\/shavlik-group\/craven.thesis.pdf)\n - [_Mark W. Craven and Jude W. Shavlik(NIPS, 96). Extracting Thee-Structured Representations of Thained Networks_](https:\/\/papers.nips.cc\/paper\/1152-extracting-tree-structured-representations-of-trained-networks.pdf)\n\nBriefly, Trepan constructs a decision tree in a best-first manner. It maintains a queue of leaves which are expanded into subtrees as they are removed from the queue. With each node in the queue, Trepan stores,\n\n - a subset of the training examples, \n - another set of instances (query instances),\n - a set of constraints. \n\nThe stored subset of training examples consists simply of those examples that reach the node. The query instances are used, along with the training examples, to select the splitting test if the node is an internal node or to determine the class\nlabel if it is a leaf. The constraint set describes the conditions that instances must satisfy in order to reach the node; this information is used when drawing a set of query instances for a newly created node. The process of expanding a node in Trepan is much like it is in conventional decision tree algorithms: a splitting test is selected for the node, and a child is created for each outcome of the test. Each child is either made a leaf of the tree or put into the queue for future expansion.\n\n\nFor Skater's implementation, for building explainable surrogate models, the base estimator (\"Oracle\") could be any form of a supervised learning predictive model - our black box model. The explanations are approximated using Decision Trees (both for Classification\/Regression) by learning decision boundaries similar to that learned by the Oracle (predictions from the base model are used for learning the Decision Tree representation). The implementation also generates a fidelity score to quantify tree based surrogate model\u2019s approximation to the Oracle. Ideally, the score should be 0 for truthful explanation both globally and locally. Let's check this out in action!\n\n__NOTE:__ The implementation is currently experimental and might change in future.","d30d222d":"> As you can see, features are ordered in differents ways by these different criterions.

","225c77a4":"__[FairML](https:\/\/github.com\/adebayoj\/fairml)__ is a new Python library that audits black-box predictive models. The basic idea behind FairML (and many other attempts to audit or interpret model behavior) is to measure a model\u2019s dependence on its inputs by changing them. If a small change to an input feature dramatically changes the output, the model is sensitive to the feature.\n\nBut what if the input attributes are correlated?\n\nThe trick used here to counter this multicollinearity is **orthogonal projection**. FairML orthogonally projects the input to measure the dependence of the predictive model on each attribute. Orthogonal projection of vectors is important because it allows us to completely remove the linear dependence between attributes. If two vectors are orthogonal to one another, then no linear transformation of one vector can produce the other. This intuition underlies the feature dependence measure.\n\nOne advantage of FairML is that it can audit any classifier or regressor. FairML only requires that it has a `predict function`.\n\nSee [FairML: Auditing Black-Box Predictive Models](https:\/\/blog.fastforwardlabs.com\/2017\/03\/09\/fairml-auditing-black-box-predictive-models.html) by the author for an exemple of use-case.","23411028":"### Surrogate Model Performance Evaluation","ee5e94ab":"ICE plots are similar to PD plots but offer a more detailled view about the behavior of near similar clusters around the PD plot average curve.

A user can optionally pass data samples to the examples keyword argument. This is only used to infer output types and formats. Out of the box, skater allows models return numpy arrays and pandas dataframes.\n\n- Operationalized Model: If your model is accessible through an API, use a `DeployedModel`, which wraps the requests library. `DeployedModels` require two functions, an input formatter and an output formatter, which speak to the requests library for posting and parsing. The input formatter takes a pandas DataFrame or a numpy ndarray, and returns an object (such as a dict) that can be converted to JSON to be posted.
