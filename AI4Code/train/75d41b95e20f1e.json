For each document, you'll create a dictionary of boolean values for each class.\n\nFor example, if a text is \"ham\", we need a dictionary {'ham': True, 'spam': False}. The model is looking for these labels inside another dictionary with the key 'cats'.","e0e4a884":"A common task in NLP is text classification. This is \"classification\" in the conventional machine learning sense, and it is applied to text. Examples include spam detection, sentiment analysis, and tagging customer queries.\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn text classification with spaCy. The classifier will detect spam messages, a common functionality in most email clients. Here is an overview of the data you'll use:","642fa40c":"Evaluating the model is straightforward once you have the predictions. To measure the accuracy, calculate how many correct predictions are made on some test data, divided by the total number of predictions.","4f20be0c":"This is just one training loop (or epoch) through the data. The model will typically need multiple epochs. Use another loop for more epochs, and optionally re-shuffle the training data at the begining of each loop.","8bc4e9a2":"# Text Classification","f6261a19":"Now you are ready to train the model. First, create an optimizer using nlp.begin_training(). spaCy uses this optimizer to update the model. In general it's more efficient to train models in small batches. spaCy provides the minibatch function that returns a generator yielding minibatches for training. Finally, the minibatches are split into texts and labels, then used with nlp.update to update the model's parameters.","c6a60d03":"# Training a Text Categorizer Model","cdd7a18f":"Machine learning models don't learn from raw text data. Instead, you need to convert the text to something numeric.\n\nThe simplest common representation is a variation of one-hot encoding. You represent each document as a vector of term frequencies for each term in the vocabulary. The vocabulary is built from all the tokens (terms) in the corpus (the collection of documents).\n\nAs an example, take the sentences \"Tea is life. Tea is love.\" and \"Tea is healthy, calming, and delicious.\" as our corpus. The vocabulary then is {\"tea\", \"is\", \"life\", \"love\", \"healthy\", \"calming\", \"and\", \"delicious\"} (ignoring punctuation).\n\nFor each document, count up how many times a term occurs, and place that count in the appropriate element of a vector. The first sentence has \"tea\" twice and that is the first position in our vocabulary, so we put the number 2 in the first element of the vector. Our sentences as vectors then look like\n\nv1v2=[22110000]=[11001111]\n \nThis is called the bag of words representation. You can see that documents with similar terms will have similar vectors. Vocabularies frequently have tens of thousands of terms, so these vectors can be very large.\n\nAnother common representation is TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency). TF-IDF is similar to bag of words except that each term count is scaled by the term's frequency in the corpus. Using TF-IDF can potentially improve your models. You won't need it here. Feel free to look it up though!","9356ac6b":"Now that you have a trained model, you can make predictions with the predict() method. The input text needs to be tokenized with nlp.tokenizer. Then you pass the tokens to the predict method which returns scores. The scores are the probability the input text belongs to the classes.","a6f37967":"The scores are used to predict a single class or label by choosing the label with the highest probability. You get the index of the highest probability with scores.argmax, then use the index to get the label string from textcat.labels","01e33307":"Then we combine the texts and labels into a single list.","a6e7eb43":"# Bag of Words","17fd0cb6":"Since the classes are either ham or spam, we set \"exclusive_classes\" to True. We've also configured it with the bag of words (\"bow\") architecture. spaCy provides a convolutional neural network architecture as well, but it's more complex than you need for now.\n\nNext we'll add the labels to the model. Here \"ham\" are for the real messages, \"spam\" are spam messages.","3012d3a8":"# Building a Bag of Words model","3308ce93":"Once you have your documents in a bag of words representation, you can use those vectors as input to any machine learning model. spaCy handles the bag of words conversion and building a simple linear model for you with the TextCategorizer class.\n\nThe TextCategorizer is a spaCy pipe. Pipes are classes for processing and transforming tokens. When you create a spaCy model with nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm'), there are default pipes that perform part of speech tagging, entity recognition, and other transformations. When you run text through a model doc = nlp(\"Some text here\"), the output of the pipes are attached to the tokens in the doc object. The lemmas for token.lemma_ come from one of these pipes.\n\nYou can remove or add pipes to models. What we'll do here is create an empty model without any pipes (other than a tokenizer, since all models always have a tokenizer). Then, we'll create a TextCategorizer pipe and add it to the empty model."}}
