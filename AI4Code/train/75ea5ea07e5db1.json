Below, I\u2019ll demonstrate a way how to run correlation analysis using Python Pandas and read a heatmap. \n\nFrom a business perspective, correlation analysis helps you to answer questions like: \n* What is the relationship between 2 features? \n* Are they dependent or independent? \n* Do they increase and decrease together (positive correlation)?\n* Does one of them increase when the other decrease and vice versa (negative correlation)? \n* Or are they not correlated?"}}
