The above diamond has a height of 10. Here's a 4-line diamond:\n\n```\n \/\\ \n\/\/\\\\\n\\\\\/\/\n \\\/ \n```\n\n(You can assume your function will only be called with even numbers)","095fcc51":"## 1.\n\nThere is a saying that \"Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data, and 20% of their time complaining about cleaning data.\" Let's see if you can write a function to help clean US zip code data. Given a string, it should return whether or not that string represents a valid zip code. For our purposes, a valid zip code is any string consisting of exactly 5 digits.\n\nHINT: `str` has a method that will be useful here. Use `help(str)` to review a list of string methods.","ab9fb165":"## 3.\n\nNow the researcher wants to supply multiple keywords to search for.

But she wants to focus her attention on articles including a specific word. Complete the function below to help her filter her list of articles.\n\nYour function should meet the following criteria\n\n- Do not include documents where the keyword string shows up only as a part of a larger word. For example, if she were looking for the keyword \u201cclosed\u201d, you would not include the string \u201cenclosed.\u201d \n- She does not want you to distinguish upper case from lower case letters. So the phrase \u201cClosed the case.\u201d would be included when the keyword is \u201cclosed\u201d\n- Do not let periods or commas affect what is matched. \u201cIt is closed.\u201d would be included when the keyword is \u201cclosed\u201d.

You\u2019ve received a tip-off that the wheel has some exploitable bias where the probability of landing on a given number changes depending on the number previously landed on. Analyze a list containing a history of roulette spins. \n\nReturn a dictionary where the keys are numbers on the roulette wheel, and the values are dictionaries mapping numbers on the wheel to probabilities, such that `d[n1][n2]` is an estimate of the probability that the next spin will land on n2, given that the previous spin landed on n1.","f68fd224":"## 0. \n\nLet's start with a string lightning round to warm up.
