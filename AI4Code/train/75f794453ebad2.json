Might be new and intimidating. But no worries,\nfollowing the documentation helped me. https:\/\/docs.fast.ai\/tutorial.tabular\n\nHere we are using fastai TabularPandas library. Which will do all the preprocessing for us.\nbefore that splitting our data into validation set to have a fair amount of idea that we are not overfitting the data. valid_pct= 0.2 means (as you may have guessed by now) it means 20% validation data.\n\ny_names, using column we are targetting to be predicted.\nprocs are [Categorify, FillMissing,Normalize], Convering objects into category, filling the missing value and normalizing the content for quick processing.\n\n\nNOTE:\nTabularpandas function creates a new column if there is any missing value spotted in any particular feature(only float or int column). for example: lets say Fare has a missing value somewhere. It will create a new column named 'Fare_na' where it will have integer values (1 or 2).

We are not altering test data at all. Only using new features(Like how we generate new features). Number of rows remains same in both test and training data.\n\nWe will be using newly released fastai2.0 library and standard sklearn. fastai2.0 is worth checking out https:\/\/docs.fast.ai\/ It is more fast and efficient. With this, we can minimize our effort for preprocessing and gain better results.\n","37217ecf":"Now you would be thinking why we are dropping the 'Fare_na' column. The reason is, originally we trained model on 24 features. But as you know that tabularpandas function creates a new column if there is any missing value spotted in any particular feature.\n\nHere, our test data had some Fare values missing so the function created the boolean column this lead to 25 features. If you try to pass without dropping Fare_na column, it will give you the error that model was trained on 24 features and we are passing 25. That's why dropping Fare_na feature.
