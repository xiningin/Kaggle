Plucking the right data out of our data representation is critical to getting work done.\n\nHowever, the data does not always come in the format we want it. So you'll usually have to reformat it for the task at hand. Fortunately you can build the skills you need for this in the following exercises.\n\nLoad the data and our feedback system by running the following cell.","f36dcc57":"## 1.\n\nWhat is the median of the `points` column in the `reviews` DataFrame?","d22d14e1":"# Keep going\nContinue to **[grouping and sorting](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/grouping-and-sorting-reference)**.","385acce8":"## 2. \nWhat countries are represented in the dataset?

A score of 95 or higher counts as 3 stars, a score of at least 85 but less than 95 is 2 stars. Any other score is 1 star.\n\nAlso, the Canadian Vintners Association bought a lot of ads on the site, so any wines from Canada should automatically get 3 stars, regardless of points.\n\nCreate a series `star_ratings` with the number of stars corresponding to each review in the dataset.","b6ff29e9":"## 4.\nCreate variable `centered_price` containing a version of the `price` column with the mean price subtracted.\n\n(Note: this 'centering' transformation is a common preprocessing step before applying various machine learning algorithms.)
