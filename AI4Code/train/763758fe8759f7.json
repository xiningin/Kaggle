Selecting one seamlessly launches the game - assuming the user has a good enough internet connection for the large amount of streaming data needed.\nBut ahead of the planned launch, Apple said its app store rules require that each game is submitted individually for review.\nSince Microsoft plans to add and remove games on the service constantly, it said it did \"not have a path\" to bring the service to Apple's iOS.\nHowever, Apple released updated guidelines last month which explicitly said that \"open internet and web browser apps\" are a viable way for game streaming to work, clarifying the rules for Microsoft and other streaming apps.\nMicrosoft now appears to have opted for this route.\nIs game streaming bad for the environment?\nXbox brings blockbuster games to smartphones\nOther cloud gaming apps have already chosen a similar path.\nGoogle Stadia has a web-browser-based option for the PC gaming market, and users have found ways to get it running on iOS through third-party apps that are essentially customised web browsers.\nAnd Amazon, which recently announced its Luna game-streaming service, has said it will work on iPhones and iPads at launch through the browser.\n\"\"\"","676a1018":"svm_clftfidf.predict([text])","637f57cf":"# SVM CLASSIFIER","bd6ae589":"Converting into BOW model : We will use SVM to Classify","bea31b49":"Now we need to remove stopwords.
