If your data fail to meet this assumption because you have a confounding variable that you need to control for statistically, use an ANOVA with blocking variables.\n* **Normally-distributed response variable:**\n The values of the dependent variable follow a normal distribution.\n* **Homogeneity of variance:** The variation within each group being compared is similar for every group. If the variances are different among the groups, then ANOVA probably isn\u2019t the right fit for the data.\n\nWe know so far that our data meets the first two assumptions,let's check for the third,i.e., homogeneity of variable to decide whether One-Way Anova is the right test.","f395d140":"1.**What proportion of the Bird Population has a higher chance of being Critically Endangered?**\n\nThe answer to this question about the entire population has to be given from our data that is a random sample of our population.\n* **OUR TASK**:Obtain a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of critically endangered birds\n* What we mean by 95% confidence interval is that \u201cwe are confident that in 95% of the samplings, the samples will have the **proportion of birds having higher chances of being critically endangered** that can create the interval covering the **population proportion of birds that have higher chances of being critically endangered**\u201d","a8d3bbcf":"The species with IUCN Status:**Least Concerned** and **Near Threatened** don't have 0 in the confidence interval now,which indicates that the difference between Annual change(%) of the two groups is statistically significant.Near threatened groups see higher Average Annual Change than Least concerned.\n* Now we get a significant outcome.We can report it as not significant at 0.05, but a significant difference is present at alpha = 0.06.
