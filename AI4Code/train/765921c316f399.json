Each time one staff member or patient tests positive, all staff down tools. While all these union demands are being met, nothing happens\u2026 for up to two weeks,\" \n\nSeveral doctors defended the strike action, saying that frontline staff had been pushed to the limit, not just by Covid-19, but by years of exploitation.\n\n\"Staff have been chronically exploited, abused and neglected for years and now they're being asked to do something that could potentially kill them. There's an institutional burn-out,\" \n\nThere is general agreement among unions and medical staff that the current crisis is the direct result of many years of systematic underfunding, mismanagement and corruption in one of South Africa's most notoriously badly-run provinces.\n\n\"They have historic issues of staff-shortages, labour problems, lack of leadership and, sadly, corruption, cronyism, and fiscal mismanagement.
