We need to understand this topic in order to set up right recommendation system. So what is tf-idf?\n\nTF-IDF is a weight factor which a word display important into document and had been calculated with statistics method. TF-IDF method use to a lot domains (sentiment analysis, RS, stop words filterin etc.) This method is divided into two. Fistly we will analyze Term Frequency(TF).\n\n### Term Frequency\n\nIt express odds a word that is found document. For example \"Jandino: Whatever it Takes\" is a document. Odds of \"Jandino\" is 1\/4 (number of Jandino \/ number of words in document)\n\n### Inverse Document Frequency\n\nIt express logaritmic value of the ratio number of document and number of the word that contains document.\n\n**TF-IDF method used as multipy TF value and IDF value. (TF * IDF)**\n\nI applied this method in my model. And I found between similarity with cosine distance. ","d0fae15d":"Let's get to know our dataset.","ea90265b":"We see 5 data row in above.

We don't know how to fill them. So I will use feautres that don't contain missing value. Also, we need to use text data to develop content based recommendation system model. Therefore I will get type, title, listed_in and description features.  ","71e18a59":"In this above. Our model brought the recommendations. We wanted to bring acording to Transformes series movie. Firstly it brought to Transformers movies.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n* In this notebook. I worked to explain content based recommendation system.\n* Content based RS models are powerful in new item recommendation. \n* In general it is used TF-IDF and Word2Vec model while content based RS designs.\n* TF-IDF method is the method which explains words frequency in document.\n* It can be created a recommendation model by using cosine distance with the aid of TF-IDF weights.\n\nIf you benefit this notebook. Please upvote for my motivastion. I will be waiting your mind in comments. Your comments are so important to improve my skills. Thanks to your votes and comments.","7fe54643":"Let get to know feature that we will use:\n\n* type: media type (movie, tv show etc.)\n* title: media name\n* listed_in: place where it listed.\n* description: information about media\n\nIn order to apply content based recommendation system, fistly we will clean text data and combine them.","29f608df":"Let's try our model whether works right.","e33e784b":"# Content Based Recommendation Systems\n\nRecommendation systems are the systems that users predict future prefecences by using their past experiences and prefences. RS uses to a lot domains such as social media and e-commerce. Percent of 80 being watched movies and series on Netflix and percent of 60 being watched videos on Youtube has been explored by using thanks to recommendation systems. Amazon is in debt to recommendations systems percent of 35 of its gain. \n\nRecommendation systems are divided into three:\n\n* Collaborative Filtering\n* Content Based RS\n* Hybrid Models\n\nIn this notebook we are going to discuss content based RS.\n\n## Content Based Recommendation Systems\n\n* CB are the systems that create a recommendation system by capturing similarity relationship between items according to comments, description or attributes of items which users interact. \n* It is used to models such as TF_IDF and Word2Vec in order to capture similarity.\n* It is very powerful that a item adding newly is recommend. \n* CB Filtering Approachs always provides apparent recommendation in order to use content descriprions. For example, if users have never used items having specific key words, it has no chance of recommendation. \n* The reason for this, designed model is always the special the user at hand. So experience of similar users is not benefited. This tends to reduce the variety of non-ideal recommended items. \n* Other disavantage in CB, although it is so powerful for present item recommendation, it is not successful in new user recommendation. In general they create hybrid model by combining content based filtering and collaborative filtering. "}}
