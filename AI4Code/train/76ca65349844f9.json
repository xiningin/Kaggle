Hence, It is advisable to walk more than ride to increase your chances of victory","eef44b2a":"* Let's explore each feature pair one by one to understand their impact on winPercentile","2fa94025":"> Earlier we saw that, more kills can help you secure place in top10 percentile. Above plot depicts that more boostscan really help you in securing more kills. As an ex-pubg player, I agree with this observation. Boost helps player to gain higher agility and movement speed, which in turn might help in getting more kills","79760b3b":"## More kills imply higher chance of winning?","a655784d":"> Well, this plot clearly shows that boosts have been super important part of players victory. \n* So, Let's explore 'boosts' feature a little more","47dda336":"> **Trivia** : Suppose there are only two players left in the final zone. But, this final zone is at the place where these two players cannot kill\/damage each other. For example, i) one player inside underground tunnel and one above ground ii) one player on top of sharp hill and other at the valley. In such cases, **heals** are the only option to survive even when final zone ends!! Basically, when zone ends, remaining players' health will start to decrease at rapid pace. So, if you keep taking heals then you can survive until other player(s) dies inside zone. And voila, you win!!!","fdad6f71":"## Few interesting findings\/facts- maximum value from each feature","eddd1ec3":"> Above plot implies that the players who comes in top 20 percentile(0.8-1.0) prefer to swim than use boat to cross a river. I also agree with this outcome. When you swim, it will be difficult for an enemy to spot you in river. If you use boat then you will be spotted right away because of boat's noise. So, better to swim to cross a river than using a boat.","2c865b69":"## Should I walk more or drive more(use vehicle to move around)?","39adb75f":"> Though we got relatively high correlation(0.58) between, weaponsAcquired and win percentile, above plot shows that it doesn't seem to be the case. Hence, a player can use only 3-4 different weapons with refill and still win.","f0ab6f14":"> If you want to increase your chance of coming in top 10 places, get atleast 3 kills ;)","5354c084":"## If I want to cross a river, should I swim or use boat ? ","0536b36c":"> As players fight till the end, they need more heals. Other players will try to kill you and you need to be alive to win the game. Also, if you are left outside of zone, it will continuously decrease your health. Heal is the only option to get your health back. So, it seems obvious observation that the more heals, the better the chances of your vicotry! ","f486d8b3":"## Do boosts help to win the game?"}}
