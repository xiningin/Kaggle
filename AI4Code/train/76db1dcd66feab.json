Basing these segments off customer\u2019s purchase behavior gives crucial insight into the type of marketing which should be used to target them and to move them between segments.\n\nFrequency and monetary values are core to calculating the customer lifetime value (CLV); meanwhile, recency gives insight into customer engagement and indicates the likelihood of that customer coming back again.\n\nThe Pareto principle states that for many outcomes roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, so 80% of the revenue could be attributable to 20% of your customers. This means that the most purchasing and most loyal customers are important to remain.\nIt is important to acquiring new customers, however it will costs more to make new friends then to remain the established good one.\n\n\nThe company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts, and many customers of the company are wholesalers, so this online store has seasonal characteristic, its peak season based on different festivals, for example: customers will purchase and stock up big amount of product before Christmas.\n\n\n**In this online retail data set, K-means clustering has gave 3 ClusterID:**\n\n* 0-Best customer(highR\/highF\/highM): this customer segmentation shows customer has high loyalty, who visit the retail store most recent, high frequently purchased and have purchased with high amount of goods, therefore this segmentation is the best customer who brings the highlest value to the company. \"Recency\" shows customer from this segmentation purchase 1-2 months ago before December with monetary amount of 1300-2200\u00a3, so the online store could start to prepare and send marketing information to customer before Octorber to increase customer's attention, the company should give most of the marketing budget to this segmentation. The company could launch new product information through email marketing for promotion, provide VIP service to increase customer satisfaction, send customer questionaire to know the need of specific product and prepare enough stock. Furthermore, can trace back the CustomerID in order to know this customer segmentation's demographic,geographic,psychographics,etc, information to predict the customer buying behavior, and combine with \"frequency\" and \"Monetary\" data to predict customer life cycle in this segmentation.\n\n\n* 1-Passive customer(lowR\/lowF\/lowM): Customer visit online store 5-9 months ago, with very low purchase amount and very low buying frequency, should reduce or withdrawal budget for marketing and service for this segmentation.  \n\n\n* 2-Potential customer(highR\/lowF\/lowM): customer have purchased recently few times, with small amount of goods. Apply more detailed customer segmentation in this segmentation, in order to know the reason of low frequency and low purchase amount.The customer could be new customer who purchase frist time through this online store, or existing customer who purchase small amount in general. The company should create marketing strategy by understanding each sub-segmentation's customer pain point and needs, in order to transfer this customer segmentation into the Best Customer segmentation.\n\n\n**Conclusion**: \n\nThis company is mainly towards B2B market, there are three customer segmantations, the company should mainly focus on increase customer stickiness and customer loyalty and customer satisfaction of Cluster0 customer, understand different sub-segmentation of cluster2 customer and create personalised marketing strategy for transfering it to the best customer segmentation, and reduce\/withdrawal budget for Cluster1 customer.","2aadb8be":"# 4. prepare the data by RFM model","5eb0594f":"**About the dataset**\n\nOnline retail is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01\/12\/2010 - 09\/12\/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. \nThe company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. \nMany customers of the company are wholesalers.","cea5a473":"# 3.
