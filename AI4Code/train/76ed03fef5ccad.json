Male from group B and C have more outliers as compared to other ethno-gender group. \n* The group E seems to be high performing group amongst all other groups. It has median score of 220 and 221 for male and female respectively. \n* Females from the the group A are worst performers with the median of just 183 for female and 191 for male.\n* In all groups except E ,males are performing better than females\n\n##hover over the graph to see the median values*\n"}}
