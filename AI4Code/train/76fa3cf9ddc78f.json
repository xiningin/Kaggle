For e.g. mail classification as primary, social, promotions, forums. We are going to use One Vs Rest (OVR) algorithm.\n \nThis is also called as one vs all algorithm. As name suggest in this algorithm we choose one class and put all other classes into second virtual class and run the binary logistic regression on it. We repeat this procedure for all the classes in the dataset. So we actually end up with binary classifiers designed to recognize each class in dataset\n \nFor prediction on given data, our algorithm returns probabilities for each class in the dataset and whichever class has the highest probability is our prediction","7eef83a4":"## Model Score\nCheck the model score using test data","d259cd38":"# Data Understanding\nDataset contains 10 classes(0 to 9 digits).
