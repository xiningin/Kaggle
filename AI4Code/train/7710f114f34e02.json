As well as people get used to their local water and get better immunity to it.\nSo, subjective conclusion for particular region's water quality and people's immunity to it can't be generalized for the rest of the world.\n\nThese considerations put in doubt the consistency of the data supplied.\n\nThanks to previous contributors, it was shown that the correlations between parameters are very low.\nAs to me, this is good. This means that the parameters measured are independent and can be used for characterizing the water samples.\nAnd one doesn't waste the resources for measuring parameters with high correlation or well-established relationship.\n\nBut look at the following lists:\n- [National Primary Drinking Water Standards](https:\/\/www.water-research.net\/index.php\/standards\/primary-standards)\n- [National Secondary Drinking Water Standards](https:\/\/water-research.net\/index.php\/standards\/secondary-standards)\n\nAren't there too many of them? And which ones do we have in our data?\nDo we have enough data to determine not only theoretical but applied value of water potability?\nWill those potability values be consistent with well-known established standards?\nAnd moreover, which of our parameters are also not primary but even secondary?\n\nLet's take a look at the following table.\n**<center>Water Quality Allowed Values\n<br>by WHO (World Health Organization), USA, Canada<\/center>**\n\n | N | Parameter | Allowed Value | Importance | Comment |Reference Link |\n |---|---|---|---|---|----|\n | 0 | ph | 6.5 to 8.5 | Secondary | No guidelines | [WHO](https:\/\/www.who.int\/water_sanitation_health\/dwq\/chemicals\/ph_revised_2007_clean_version.pdf)\n | 1 | Hardness | 151 to 300 mg\/L | Secondary | No guidelines | [USA](https:\/\/www.healthvermont.gov\/environment\/drinking-water\/hardness-drinking-water)\n | 2 | Solids | 1200 mg\/L | Secondary | Same as TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) | [WHO](https:\/\/www.who.int\/water_sanitation_health\/dwq\/chemicals\/ph_revised_2007_clean_version.pdf)\n | 3 | **Chloramines** | 4 ppm | **Primary** | Chlorine disinfection traces | [USA](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/healthywater\/drinking\/public\/water_disinfection.html)\n | 4 | Sulfate | 250 ppm | Secondary | Mostly from natural sources | [USA](https:\/\/www.water-research.net\/index.php\/sulfates)\n | 5 | Conductivity | 400 \u03bcS\/cm | Secondary | Derived value | [WHO](https:\/\/rdcu.be\/cubAf)\n | 6 | **Organic_carbon** | 10 ppm | **Primary** | Organic molecules cumulative value | [Canada](https:\/\/www2.gov.bc.ca\/assets\/gov\/environment\/air-land-water\/water\/waterquality\/water-quality-guidelines\/approved-wqgs\/organic-carbon-tech.pdf)\n | 7 | **Trihalomethanes** | 80 ppb | **Primary** | Chlorine disinfection traces also  | [USA](https:\/\/archive.epa.gov\/enviro\/html\/icr\/web\/html\/gloss_dbp.html)\n | 8 | **Turbidity** | 5 NTU | **Primary** | Measured by water scattered light | [WHO](https:\/\/www.who.int\/water_sanitation_health\/publications\/turbidity-information-200217.df)\n\n\nIn order to be as consistent as possible, I tried to gather water quality standards from the same region, preferably USA, Canada or WHO (World Health Organization).\nSo, 5 out 9 parameters in our given dataset turned out to be secondary and 4 (less than half) of them were primary.\n\nFrankly, not a really good set of parameters for making responsible predictions.\nBut anyway, let's figure out what fraction of a given dataset fits into the above mentioned standards.\n\n","c4bdbc19":"None of the samples passed secondary and all water quality standards filters.\n\nOnly 4 samples passed the primary filters. 2 ot them were marked as non-potable. Perhaps due to other primary parameters not listed in our dataset.\nI see no reason to make any valuable and applicable predictions after the dataset quality check.\n\nEager to apply modern advancements in data handling techniques it's never a bad idea to make a reality check for consistency or to see a meaning behind the dataset being worked on.\n\nIn my opinion, if it were somewhere close but the truth was not out there\u00a9 in the given water potability dataset."}}
