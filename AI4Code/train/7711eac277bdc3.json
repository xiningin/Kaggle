In this notebook we will explore the data on TV Shows and Movies available on Netflix worldwide. First we will do some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to know and describe the data in a better way through interactive graphs and visualizations. Then we will build a multilabel classifier using BERT and MLP to predict the Genre of a show using its description.\n\n\nPlease upvote the notebook if you like it and suggest improvements in the comments.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/haasentertainment.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ReflectingNeglectedBug-size_restricted.gif)","eef0acfa":"We can see that the model has preformed pretty well and was able to achieve an accuracy over 96% and the losses also reduced to similar values meaning there's no bias or variance issue.","db40735d":"## Let's begin by taking a look at the dataset","54846e53":"Seems like **Christmas, man, love, life, story, girl** are some of the most common words used in describing the shows.","883a5ad2":"#### The dataset has 7787 rows and 12 columns:\n* **show_id:** unique id of each show (not much of a use for us in this notebook)\n* **type:** The category of a show, can be either a Movie or a TV Show\n* **title:** Name of the show\n* **director:** Name of the director(s) of the show\n* **cast:** Name of actors and other cast of the show\n* **country:** Name of countries the show is available to watch on Netflix\n* **date_added:** Date when the show was added on Netflix\n* **release_year:** Release year of the show\n* **rating:** Show rating on netflix\n* **duration:** Time duration of the show\n* **listed_in:** Genre of the show\n* **description:** Some text describing the show","c7881d9c":"Most of the shows belong to International Movies category followed by comedy, Documentaries and TV Dramas.","a05f970c":"#### The number of shows have been rapidly increasing each year achieving a maximum in 2019 (2153 Shows!) followed by a dip 2020 (2009 Shows).","a6c3474e":"There are 13 movies that are less than 15 mins long, the shortest movie being **Silent** (3 mins) followed by **Sol Levante** (5 mins) and **Cops and Robbers** (8 mins).\n\nBelow are some more details on these 3 movies from the dataset.","873059a8":"Most of the TV Shows (1608 shows) have a single season whereas much lesser shows have more than 1 seasons on Netflix.","2e37bf22":"## Number of shows (Movies + TV Shows) added to Netflix every year","2c590f59":"#### The number of shows have been rapidly increasing each year achieving a maximum in 2018 (1121 Shows!) followed by a dip in 2019 (996 Shows) and 2020 (868 Shows).","c8216463":"### Top 20 shortest movies available on Netflix","1c3fe7c3":"Seems like **life, family, find take, new, world** are some of the most common words used in describing the shows.","718cd1f6":"### Obtaining the numerical embeddings of text from BERT","ccb99748":"## How about the number of shows available worldwide in each country?","609059d3":"### Below are some samples from the test dataset which has not been seen by our model till now.
