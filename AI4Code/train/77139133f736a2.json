Business Understanding\n\n## 1.1 Objective\nPredict survival on the Titanic\n\n## 1.2 Description\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n\n**Before going further, what do you think is the most important reasons passangers survived the Titanic sinking?**\n\n[Description from Kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic)","3bf55188":"### 2.4.3 Excersise 1: Investigating numeric variables\nIt's time to get your hands dirty and do some coding!

Evaluation\nNow we are going to evaluate model performance and the feature importance.\n\n## 5.1 Model performance\nWe can evaluate the accuracy of the model by using the validation set where we know the actual outcome. This data set have not been used for training the model, so it's completely new to the model. \n\nWe then compare this accuracy score with the accuracy when using the model on the training data. If the difference between these are significant this is an indication of overfitting.
