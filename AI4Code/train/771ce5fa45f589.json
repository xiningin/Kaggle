Here we use the same input as the currently top-scoring public notebook, but compute the median rather than the mean (and get a better score).\n\nIn a competition which is scored by mean absolute error (MAE), optimizing weights is a waste of time: The median is better and doesn't need any weights.\n\nSee https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/ventilator-pressure-prediction\/discussion\/280573 for a discussion of the topic.\n\n<font size=\"1\">There is one exception to the rule: If you have only two inputs, a weighted arithmetic mean give a better result than the median.<font>"}}
