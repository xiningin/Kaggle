As per Wikipedia definition, customer churn, also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers. Customer churn rate is a key business metric in any industry and company providing services to end customers, because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.\n\nIn a highly competitive business landscape, the ever increasing rate of customer churn or attrition is a big challenge in front of telecom service providers today. It takes subtantial effort and investment to lure in new customers, while the danger of losing existing customers to competitors is always lurking. Hence, the importance to analyze and understand the reasons of customer's churn had never been felt more. The more the CSPs are able to retain their existing customer base, the better they will perform in the long run.\n\nIn this notebook, we will try to analyze the factors which contribute to the possibility of customer's churn. This analysis is performed based on the publicly available dataset from IBM.\n\n![customer-churn.jpg](https:\/\/www.livechatinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/customer-churn.jpg)\nImage Credit: https:\/\/www.livechatinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/customer-churn.jpg","15ae9814":"### Monthly Charges","dea582f8":"#### SeniorCitizen\nFlag indicating is the customer is senior citizen or not.","4e4a9f9a":"#### Observations so far:\n1.

There are 21 features in the dataset - \"Churn\" is the target\/dependent variable (this is what we will try to predict), and rest 30 are independent variables which we need to explore further.\n3. Only 3 features are numeric - \"SeniorCitizen\" (categorical), and \"tenure\" and \"MonthlyCharges\" (continuous).\n4. Datatype of the rest of the features is object, looking at the sample data they look like to be of type string. Some of these features are categorical, which we will map into numerical values.\n5. There is absolutely NO missing data. This is amazing!","ab5eff18":"#### Observations:\n* Phone Service - Almost all (90%) customers have Phone Service. However, the churn rate is very low compared to the volume (~25%). On the other hand, churn rate is almost same (~25%) among non-phone service customers as well (though they form only 10% of the population). Thus, selling Phone Service is more beneficial for the CSP.\n* Multiple Lines - Among Phone Service users, 45% has Multiple Lines while the rest 45% have single line. Churn rate is slightly higher among users with multiple lines, but not that significant (~28%).\n* Internet Service - Approx 20% customers do not use internet. Among customers using internet, approx 45% use Fiber Optic and 35% use DSL. However, churn among Fiber Optic users is pretty high as well (> 40%), while it is 20% among DSL users. Hence, CSP needs to look into the quality of its internet service.\n* Online Security - ~50% customers do not use online security service, and churn rate among such users is highest as well (~40%).\n* Online Backup, Device Protection and Tech Support - Same as above, most of the customers do not use this service and they tend to churn as well.\n* Streaming TV and Streaming Movies - Among users with internet services (which is mandatory for availing these services), almost half use these streaming services. The rate of churn is more or less same as well (~35%) irrespective of usage of streaming services.","def7f5c1":"### customerID\nAlpha-numeric value representing the ID of each customer. Since this is unique for all 7043 records, we can ignore this feature.","8af2ea8d":"#### Observations:\n* ~55% customer are on month-to-month (or monthly) plans, while little more than 20% each are on 1 or 2 years contract.\n* <b>The churn rate is high among monthly customers and least among 2-year contracted customers. While this is expected because of the contract duration, this is an alarming signal for CSP since should try to retain contracted customers and bring the churn rate to near zero, in addition to spending effort on month-to-month customers.<\/b>","f543fab9":"#### Observations:\n* Almost 60% customers prefer paper-less billing.\n* Almost 35% of them left the CSP.\n* Now, apparently a direct relation between bill mode and churn cannot be established, it must be investigated if customers receiving soft copies of bills are getting clear and transparent information on all the charges, and proper service and care if they face any difficutly in interpreting the bills.","48f7e0ab":"#### Observations:\n* From the above graph, we can infer that TotalCharges is approximately equal to (MonthlyCharges * tenure).\n* Hence, we will fill up missing TotalCharges accordingly.","7638468f":"### Payment Method\nHow does the customer make payments?"}}
