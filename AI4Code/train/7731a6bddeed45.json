We could apply scaling (e.g. StandardScaler), but it depends on the classifier we will want to use.\n\n#### car variables\n- ps_car_12 and ps_car_15 have missing values\n- again, the range differs and we could apply scaling.\n\n#### calc variables\n- no missing values\n- this seems to be some kind of ratio as the maximum is 0.9\n- all three *_calc* variables have very similar distributions\n\n\n**Overall**, we can see that the range of the interval variables is rather small.

With Sklearn's SelectFromModel you can then specify how many variables you want to keep. You can set a threshold on the level of feature importance manually. But we'll simply select the top 50% best variables. \n\n> The code in the cell below is borrowed from the [GitHub repo of Sebastian Raschka](https:\/\/github.com\/rasbt\/python-machine-learning-book\/blob\/master\/code\/ch04\/ch04.ipynb).
