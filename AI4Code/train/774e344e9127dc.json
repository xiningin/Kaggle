It includes cleaning and formatting the data before feeding into a machine learning algorithm. For NLP, the preprocessing steps are comprised of the following tasks:\n\n1. **Tokenizing the string:** To tokenize means to split the strings into individual words without blanks or tabs.\n\n2. **Lowercasing:** In this step, we will also convert each word in the string to lower case.\n\n3. **Removing stop words and punctuation:**\n\nSince we have a Twitter dataset, we'd like to remove some substrings commonly used on the platform like the hashtag, retweet marks, and hyperlinks. We'll use the re library to perform regular expression operations on our tweet. We'll define our search pattern and use the sub() method to remove matches by substituting with an empty character (i.e. '').\n\n4. **Stemming:** Stemming is the process of converting a word to its most general form, or stem. This helps in reducing the size of our vocabulary.\n\nConsider the words: \n * **learn**\n * **learn**ing\n * **learn**ed\n * **learn**t\n \nAll these words are stemmed from its common root **learn**. However, in some cases, the stemming process produces words that are not correct spellings of the root word. For example, **happi** and **sunni**. That's because it chooses the most common stem for related words. For example, we can look at the set of words that comprises the different forms of happy:\n\n * **happ**y\n * **happi**ness\n * **happi**er\n \nWe can see that the prefix **happi** is more commonly used. We cannot choose **happ** because it is the stem of unrelated words like **happen**.\n \nNLTK has different modules for stemming but in this kernel i will be using the PorterStemmer.","30ef311e":"### Process tweet\nThe given function `process_tweet()` tokenizes the tweet into individual words, removes stop words and applies stemming.","e3b3bcd2":"## About Kernel:\n\nThis kernel is all about how one can perform Sentiment Analysis on twitter dataset using Logistic Regression model from scratch.
