Both either new to the 2016 squad or only play in the final games of the 2015 season when Leicester went on a run to avoid relegation. It seem a huge increase came from the addition of a better midfield that was better able to provide support to the striker Vardy.","2cac298e":"# Why did Leicester win the premier league in stats\n\nHows does the 2015-16 Leicester City F.C. season happen stats wise. \nCan we say more than they conceded less and scored more. I will look at Jamie Vardy and how he changed. Did there chnace creation change. And how did there defence change. They conceded less but did they clean up set pieces? Stop conceding early? concede less shots in deadily areas?","de2e4bf4":"Last minute goals and events just before half time are definitly a thing.

The home team picking up a slight edge is not unsurprising as any football fan will be aware of refs being unwilling to give penalties to the home side. I asuppose if you commit so many fouls it makes it hard to commit more due to time constraint and players actively avoiding potential challenges. More fouls mean more potential for boook and players on a yellow card play more cautiously.","5e51ea08":"With cleaner datasets we combine the two so information on specific games is easier to view. For now I create a dataframe of shots so see how these breakdown.","02f46d8e":"Obviously you can't score if you don't hit the target. Seems suprising a high shot is hardier to score.

Often credit is put on Kante who was signed in the summer and Vardy becoming a better player. How does this affect the stats?\n\nThe data breaks down as two datasets plus a dictionary of the terms.","5f7f127e":"This seems to be a similar story to the events in general found earilier.

It would be usefull to create a dataframe for a summary of the match events. Getting a shot at 0-0 is more impactful that if the side is 3-0 but such difference will have to be left for a much more in depth look. Similarly getting a red card at 0-0 then losing 3-0 ideally would look different in the data than losing 3-0 and then going down to ten men. \n","b6eda9d8":"Vardy got twice the number of shots ","fa56354a":"Most chances come from open play easily.","5ddc8e58":"Unsuprising a \"through ball\", a pass through the defence to an attacking player gives the best conversion rate.
