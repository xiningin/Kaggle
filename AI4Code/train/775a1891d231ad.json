Let's say that a classifier is trained over a training data and tested over the test data and it scores an accuracy of 90%.\n\nNow this seems to be very good accuracy for a classifier, but can we confirm that it will be 90% for all the new test sets that come over??. The answer is **No**, because we can't determine which all instances will the classifier will use to train itself. As the training and testing data changes, the accuracy will also change. It may increase or decrease. This is known as **model variance**.\n\nTo overcome this and get a generalized model,we use **Cross Validation**.\n\n\n# Cross Validation\n\nMany a times, the data is imbalanced, i.e there may be a high number of class1 instances but less number of other class instances. Thus we should train and test our algorithm on each and every instance of the dataset. Then we can take an average of all the noted accuracies over the dataset. \n\n1)The K-Fold Cross Validation works by first dividing the dataset into k-subsets.\n\n2)Let's say we divide the dataset into (k=5) parts. We reserve 1 part for testing and train the algorithm over the 4 parts.\n\n3)We continue the process by changing the testing part in each iteration and training the algorithm over the other parts. The accuracies and errors are then averaged to get a average accuracy of the algorithm.\n\nThis is called K-Fold Cross Validation.\n\n4)An algorithm may underfit over a dataset for some training data and sometimes also overfit the data for other training set.

They are also known as **Nominal Variables**.\n\n**Categorical Features in the dataset: Sex,Embarked.**\n\n### Ordinal Features:\nAn ordinal variable is similar to categorical values, but the difference between them is that we can have relative ordering or sorting between the values. For eg: If we have a feature like **Height** with values **Tall, Medium, Short**, then Height is a ordinal variable. Here we can have a relative sort in the variable.\n\n**Ordinal Features in the dataset: PClass**\n\n### Continous Feature:\nA feature is said to be continous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the features column.\n\n**Continous Features in the dataset: Age**","7a20135c":"## Age_band\n\n#### Problem With Age Feature:\nAs I have mentioned earlier that **Age is a continous feature**, there is a problem with Continous Variables in Machine Learning Models.\n\n**Eg:**If I say to group or arrange Sports Person by **Sex**, We can easily segregate them by Male and Female.\n\nNow if I say to group them by their **Age**, then how would you do it?

Before understanding the plot, let us see what exactly correlation is.\n\n**POSITIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to increase in feature B, then they are positively correlated**. A value **1 means perfect positive correlation**.\n\n**NEGATIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated**. A value **-1 means perfect negative correlation**.\n\nNow lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as **MultiColinearity** as both of them contains almost the same information.\n\nSo do you think we should use both of them as **one of them is redundant**. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n\nNow from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated.
