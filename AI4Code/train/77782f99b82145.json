Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems. Along with core model specification and fitting functionality, PyMC3 includes functionality for summarizing output and for model diagnostics. \n\n#Features\n\nPyMC3 strives to make Bayesian modeling as simple and painless as possible, allowing users to focus on their scientific problem, rather than on the methods used to solve it. Here is a partial list of its features:\n\nModern methods for fitting Bayesian models, including MCMC and VI.\n\nIncludes a large suite of well-documented statistical distributions.\n\nUses Theano as the computational backend, allowing for fast expression evaluation, automatic gradient calculation, and GPU computing.\n\nBuilt-in support for Gaussian process modeling.\n\nModel summarization and plotting.\n\nModel checking and convergence detection.\n\nExtensible: easily incorporates custom step methods and unusual probability distributions.\n\nBayesian models can be embedded in larger programs, and results can be analyzed with the full power of Python.https:\/\/docs.pymc.io\/history.html","4c2ae876":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTvHBuqvPabtkjFyfuUhBjZ-Za2ZyTmeWbvzw&usqp=CAU)\n\nmorioh.com"}}
