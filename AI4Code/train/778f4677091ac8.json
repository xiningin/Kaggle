Lets apply @ghostskipper's visualization (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ghostskipper\/visualising-results) to out solution.","a5fad76e":"Lets assume that Santa can ask different people from the same family to come at different days, and he will pay each person fair share of consolation gift he would pay if the entire family would come this day. With such payments, he will play standard preference cost would he split no family, but possibly can achive lower value of it.\n\nThis way the problem is standard min cost max flow with demands: each family is source node with supply equal to family size, and each day is sink node with lower demand equal to 125 and upper demand equal to 300.\n\nAs ortools doesn't support lower demands, we will reduce the problem to exact demands by creating two sink nodes: one for the mandatory 12500 visits, and the other for the rest 8503.\n\nTo reduce number of edges for each family from 100 to 11, we will connect each family only to day nodes corresponding to their prefered day instead of all days. We will also connect each family with sink nodes to represent possibility of having day not from their preference (as total size of families is much lower than total days capacity, we should probably be able to distribute this families to rest of days).","07b8a05b":"So with splitting families and not taking into account accounting penalty we can achieve score a bit less then 35839 (it's fractional beacuse after splitting families consolation gifts become fractional). Given that current top1 score is almost twice higher, it would be so much easier if people wouldn't insist on going together, and accountants would just take go to holiday vacation already..."}}
