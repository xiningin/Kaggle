Write a function\n  to return one of 3 possible results: \"No ticket\", \"Small ticket\", or \"Big Ticket\". \n  If your speed is 60 or less, the result is \"No Ticket\". If speed is between 61 \n  and 80 inclusive, the result is \"Small Ticket\". If speed is 81 or more, the result is \"Big    Ticket\".
