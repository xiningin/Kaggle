Count how many times does a word occur in each message (Known as term frequency)\n> 2. Weigh the counts, so that frequent tokens get lower weight (inverse document frequency)\n> 3. Normalize the vectors to unit length, to abstract from the original text length (L2 norm)\n\n> Let's begin the first step:\n\n> Each vector will have as many dimensions as there are unique words in the SMS corpus.  We will first use SciKit Learn's **CountVectorizer**. This model will convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.\n\n> We can imagine this as a 2-Dimensional matrix.

The simplest is the `bag-of-words` approach, where each unique word in a text will be represented by one number.\n\n\n> In this section we'll convert the raw messages (sequence of characters) into vectors (sequences of numbers).\n\n> As a first step, let's write a function that will split a message into its individual words and return a list. We'll also remove very common words, ('the', 'a', etc..). To do this we will take advantage of the `NLTK` library. It's pretty much the standard library in Python for processing text and has a lot of useful features.
