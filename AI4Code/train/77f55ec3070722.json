Today we're going to do two things:\n\n* Make our visualizations interactive\n* Tidy up our notebook to remove unnecessary clutter\n \nToday's timeline:\n\n* **5 minutes**: Read notebook\n* **10 minutes**: Make your visualizations interactive\n* **5 minutes**: Tidy up notebook\n\n# Interactive visualizations\n\nDashboards, unlike static charts, are designed to be viewed on a device, whether that\u2019s a computer, phone or tablet. That means that you have the option to make your dashboard interactive. This lets the people you\u2019re sharing the dashboard ask their own questions about the data. (And, perhaps more importantly, stops them from emailing you asking you to remake the chart with slightly different axes.)\n\n\n## What should you make interactive?\n\nPersonally I think you get to the point of diminishing returns on interactive charts pretty quickly. Sure, an animation that changes the mouse shape to the flag of the country you\u2019re hovering over on the map would be super cool\u2026 but coding up something like that probably isn\u2019t the best use of your time.\n\nInstead, the most important things to make interactive are:\n\n* *Let viewers adjust axes*. Viewers should able to zoom in or out and adjust the range themselves. In particular, it's helpful to be able to adjust the time range for timelines and the latitude and longitude for maps.\n* *Make values or labels visible on hover*. This lets viewers ask questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s this outlier here?\u201d or \u201cHow many units did we sell last Wednesday?\".\n\n## What library should you use for interactive visualizations? \n\nYou\u2019ve got a lot of options for libraries for making interactive visualizations. Some of these include:\n\n* [Altair](https:\/\/altair-viz.github.io\/)\n* [Bokeh](https:\/\/bokeh.pydata.org\/en\/latest\/)\n* [Folium](https:\/\/github.com\/python-visualization\/folium) for maps\n\nYou can use your favorite library (and feel free to give it a shoutout in the comments!), but I\u2019m going to be using Plotly here. Plotly is an open source JavaScript graphing library that has wrappers available in a number of languages, including Python and R. \n\n> **Why Plotly?** I like Plotly because it's interactive by default, so I don't have to spend a bunch of time futzing with it. The syntax is also fairly similar between Python and R, which makes it easier to switch between languages. Finally, it renders well in notebooks, which can sometimes be a problem with fancy JavaScript based visualizations.\n\nIn both graphs below, you should be able to zoom and see more information for a specific data point by hovering your mouse over it. You can also download plots by clicking on the little camera icon, which is pretty nifty.","ede2cfda":"# Tidying up your notebook\n\nIf you\u2019re using a script, you can ignore this bit. If you\u2019re using a notebook, however, there are some changes you\u2019re probably going to want to make before you share your dashboard. \n\n1. **Hide your code**. Since the focus in making a dashboard is to make information easy to quickly see, code is just a distraction. You can hide your code cells in a Kaggle notebook by clicking in the cell you want to hide and clicking \"input\" in the menu in the upper right hand corner. \n2. **Remove text**. I personally don\u2019t like a lot of text, like markdown cells, in dashboards. Instead, try using informative labels for your charts and axes so they can stand on their own.\n3. **Consider putting small charts or tables together in the same line.** This helps save screen space so viewers don\u2019t have to scroll as much. You can do this using [layout()](https:\/\/www.rdocumentation.org\/packages\/graphics\/versions\/3.5.1\/topics\/layout) in R. In Python you\u2019ll need package-specific functions to do this, like [plt.subplot](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html) for Matplotlib. \n\nIdeally, you want to be able to see the entire dashboard on you rscreen at the same time so that you can quickly glance at it and see the information you need. \n\n# Your turn!\n\nNow that I\u2019ve given you some tips and tricks on how to get your notebook looking good, it\u2019s time for you to apply them! Revisit your visualizations from yesterday and make them interactive. Then spend some time removing distracting elements (text and code) from your notebook.\n\nIf you like, you can make your kernel public and share a link to it in the comments on this dataset to share with other participants. (And you can take a peek at other people's work to see what they've chosen to look at!) I'll pick a couple that I especially like to highlight as examples. :)"}}
