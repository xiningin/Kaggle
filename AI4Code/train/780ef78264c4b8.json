Also, \"Python\" is relatively easy to learn and understand, that's may be another reason the experienced recommend it to us.","9a8a6a4c":"**\"Matplotlib**\" is the most frequently used visualization library, followed by Seaborn, Ggplot and Plotly, these libraries can help us draw most of the widely used graph, such as: heatmap(the graph I used here), bar chart, pie chart, scattered plot, etc.. Let's highlight some points below:\n* \"**Ggplot**\" is heavily relied by the \"Statistician\", this may because it has some nice function for Statistic usage. People who are planning to dive into statistic can take a look at this library.\n* We can also see there are quite a number of people from most jobs chose \"**None**\" here, this may imply that they do not have to work on the data visualization part. However, there are three groups of respondents which have a relatively low proportion in choosing \"None\", \"**Machine learning Engineer**\", \"**Research scientist**\" and \"**Data scientist**\", this somehow imply data visualization is somehow inevitable in these kinds of job, if you want to be any one of these jobs, you should master data visualization.","d7b99395":"Programming language is a critical part of learning data science, but there are so many choices out there, which one should we learn first? which one we have to master it? We will examine the programming language that the experienced use on a regular basis and which programming language they recommend for the beginner in this part.","6f302ee8":"In generel, \"**Linear or Logistic Regression**\" and \"**Decision Trees or Random Forests**\" are the most often used algorithms, followed by \"**Gradient Boosting Machines (xgboost, lightgbm, etc)**, \"**Bayesian Approaches**\" and \"**Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)**\", we can tell from the result that the mentioned algorithms are important in handling the job duties of most data science roles, we should probably invest more time on learning and practising these algorithms. Here are some highlights we can take a look at:\n\n*  Most of the algorithms are used by \"Data Scientist\", \"Research scientist\" and \"Machine Learning engineer\" on regular basis, this implies that we should not only focus on the widely used ones by the majority, but to gain deeper understanding of various algorithms so as to handle these jobs.\n* \"**Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)**\" are used quite often among most of the roles, however, we notice that the proportion of \"Data analyst\", \"Business analyst\", \"Statistician\" and \"DBA\/Database\" that often use \"**CNN**\" is significantly lower than the other roles. This may be because of \"**CNN**\" usually use on **computer vision** and **natural language processing** but not analyzing data for insights that influence products or business decisions, which takes up a large part of their job duties(referring to the job nature part). \n  \nWhen we are planning on study various algorithms, we should take this into consideration, it is always great to learn as many as we can, but if sometimes we are limited by time and other resources, we can then prioritize those are more critical according to our goals and purposes.","a35534b0":"We can see that the majority of most job titles is getting a \"**Master's degree**\", it may because of the roles require high level of data science knowledge and skills, as well as research experience, since postgraduate students are usually taking up research roles in school. We may have to obtain a \"Master's degree\" sooner or later if we are planning to develop in the data science field, but we can see some difference in the role of \"Research scientist\" and \"Software engineer\"\n* Most of the responsed \"Research scientist\" (**59%**) have finished their \"Doctoral degree\", which is relatively high proportion, it may imply that this kind of job needs to have a very in-depth knowledge and high level proficiency of data science. If we are planning to take up research-related duties, we may have to plan for a doctoral degree.\n* It is worth to mention that respondents who taking up \"Software engineer\" job have similar proportion in both \"**Bachelor's degree**\" and \"**Master's degree**\", \"**Bachelor's degree**\" is even a bit higher(**5%**). If we are planning to take up \"Software Engineer\" job, we try to apply it when we have obtained our \"Bachelor's degree\" and decide whether we have to obtain a higher degree later.","f5f851b3":"# Conclusion","44767e96":"When we start coding, we will use the IDE's frequently, that is where we write our code, a popular and nice IDE's will enhance our efficiency and save us a lot of time.

The result tells us that some of the jobs may not apply CV and NLP that often, it is good to learn and practise these knowledge and skills, but if we are planning on developing a career in roles that do not have to use CV and NLP methods on regular basis, we can focus more on other data science skills so as to enhance our competitiveness in those particular roles. Below are something worth to notice:  \n* It is worth to notice that \"**Data analyst**\", \"**Business analyst**\", \"**Statistician**\" and \"**DBA\/Database engineer**\" are less likely to use NLP and CV methods, as their jobs duties are mainly analyzing and interpret data and turn them into valuable insights for the sake of influencing products or business decisions(referring to the job nature part). In addition, NLP and CV are more advanced data science knowledge, requiring us to have deeper understanding of the usage of some complex algorithms, which  \"**Data Scientist**\", \"**Research scientist**\" and \"**Machine Learning engineer**\" are the ones who often deal with them, meaning these three kinds of jobs required relatively high proficiency of related skills and knowledge, that's may be one of the reasons that their general education levels are higher than other roles(referring to the basic education information part).","dd2051ed":"It is undoubtable that Python is the most frequently used programming language in the data science world nowadays, followed by SQL. This may because of Python is easy to use and understand, it is an intuitive programming language with high processing speed. SQL is also popular, it is essential while dealing with database, it is not surprising that SQL is widely used. There are some more points to note:  \n* We can see that \"**Java**\" and \"**Javascript**\" are also widely used by \"Software engineer\" on the regular basis, as these two languages are often used when buliding website and different software.\n* \"R\" is even more often used by \"Statistician\" than \"Python\", this may because \"R\" is widely used in statistic, therefore \"Statistician\" uses it on a regular basis. \n  \nPython seems to be the essential need if we need to take up data science related roles, however, if we are interested in being \"Statistician\" or \"Software engineer\", we should not forget about the importance of \"R\", \"Java\" and \"Javascript\".","db01960f":"NLP is important and useful, it applies on many thing around us, like our phone voice regconition, online translation, online grammar correction stuff, etc., we will examine which roles deal with NLP more frequently here.","fcf5026c":"Machine learning is widely used in the data science world while predicting, analyzing, etc., it can help us to build complex model, we can see some of the frequently used algorithms here, and there are some frameworks that can help us to do so.","d534ce55":"# Introduction\nIt is undeniable that the data science industry is booming in the decade, especially in 2020, the pandemic is accelerating the growth of digital transformation, which means there will be more job opportunities in the industry.

To master this kind of job, we should not only focus on enhancing our coding and data science skills, but also the ability to analyze and present the data to influence product or business decision.\n* We can also notice that \"**DBA\/Database engineer**\" and \"**Data engineer**\" focus more on \"Build and\/or run the data infrastructure that my business uses for storing, analyzing, and operationalizing data\" than the others, meaning their job duties are more related to data infrasture, if we are good at or interested in jobs related to data infrastruture, we may work towards this directon.\n","ac979a19":"**(6) Natural language processing (NLP)**","57b39275":"Through examinating the experienced Kaggler in the data science world, I hope all of us, the beginner, can get some insights and clues when formulating our own learning direction and plans, at least get to know some of the job nature and functions, programming language we can start from and the usage of various data science skills and knowledge of different data science related roles.
