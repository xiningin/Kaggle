Currently, the best way to get this information is through the use of satellite collars. The information collected via the satellite collars helps to broadly monitor the movements of the wide-ranging Beverly and Qamanirjuaq herds. Location data from collared caribou helps biologists keep tabs on the herd\u2019s migration patterns, and helps to show where calving grounds are situated.\n\nAlthough a satellite collaring project has been in place for the Qamanirjuaq caribou since 1993, 2006-2007 was the first year the Beverly herd had been tracked based on telemetry of collared cows.\n\nCurrently, the Government of Nunavut\u2019s Department of Environment (DOE) manages the Qamanirjuaq caribou satellite collaring project. Nunavut DOE staff map the co-ordinates and send updated maps to band offices, hunters and trappers organizations, government departments, and other groups. https:\/\/arctic-caribou.com\/the-herds\/tracking-the-caribou\/","9798d957":"![](http:\/\/media1.giphy.com\/media\/dCpsXSN2tJMfS\/giphy.webp?cid=ecf05e475164b29257d0bf3247eb2600711a04e9c1e5924f&rid=giphy.webp)","373e0a2e":"#Codes from Iv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez Cazorla https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ivanhercaz\/museums-in-tenerife-location-map","a4a7d5f9":"amazing.co.uk","5520982a":"#If Scientists are going to track Caribous, they should track Wolves.
