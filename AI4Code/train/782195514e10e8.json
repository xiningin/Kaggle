function shows that there are no strong correlations between missing values of different features. This is good; low correlations further indicate that the data are MAR.","665980fc":">Since the focus of the notebook is to detect and handle missing values, we'll jump directly into it. Let's now look at a step by step process to manage the missing values in a dataset.\n<hr>","78c48648":"# Algorithms which handle missing values\n\nSome algprithms like XGBoost and LightGBM can handle missing values without any preprocessing, by supplying relevant parameters.\n\n* [XGBoost](https:\/\/xgboost.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/python\/python_api.html#module-xgboost.sklearn)\n![](https:\/\/imgur.com\/GNlcWoJ.png)\n\n* [LightGBm](https:\/\/lightgbm.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/Advanced-Topics.html)\n![](https:\/\/imgur.com\/GVdcx7h.png)\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWell, there is no single best way to handle missing values. One needs to experiment with different methods and then decide which method is best for a particular problem.","505f85c5":"### Imputation using Linear Interpolation method\n\nTime series data has a lot of variations against time. Hence, imputing using backfill and forward fill isn't the ebst possible solution to address the missing value problem. A more apt alternative would be to use interpolation methods, where the values are filled with incrementing or decrementing values.\n\n[Linear interpolation](https:\/\/www.lexjansen.com\/nesug\/nesug01\/ps\/ps8026.pdf) is an imputation technique that assumes a linear relationship between data points and utilises non-missing values from adjacent data points to compute a value for a missing data point. \n\nRefer to the official documentation for a complete list of interpolation strategies [here](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html)","e7060d79":"This shows that the Embarked column has no nullity in the first 100 cases.","921a64dd":"# Detecting Missing values\n\n## Detecting missing values numerically \n\n>The first step is to detect the count\/percentage of missing values in every column of the dataset. This will give an idea about the distribution of missing values.","d70913d4":"\n### Dropping complete columns \n\nIf a column contains a lot of missing values, say more than 80%, and the feature is not significant, you might want to delete that feature. However, again, it is not a good methodology to delete data.\n","64f5bc62":"## Finding reason for missing data using Dendrogram \nA dendogram is a tree diagram of missingness. It groups the highly correlated variables together.","dc4d764f":"Above we see, there are 3 missing values in the Xylene column. \n\n### Imputing using ffill","6ed28782":"## Finding reason for missing data using matrix plot "}}
