They differ on the observations and specific values in the variables. If you fit the model on the training dataset, then you implicitly minimize error or find correct responses. The fitted model provides a good prediction on the training dataset. Then you test the model on the test dataset. If the model predicts good also on the test dataset, you have more confidence. You have more confidence since the test dataset is similar to the training dataset, but not the same nor seen by the model. It means the model transfers prediction or learning in real sense.So,by splitting dataset into training and testing subset, we can efficiently measure our trained model since it never sees testing data before.Thus it's possible to prevent overfitting.\n\nI am just splitting dataset into 20% of test data and remaining 80% will used for training the model.","ea62b15e":"**Random Forest**"}}
