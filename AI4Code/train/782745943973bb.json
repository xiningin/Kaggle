Passive immunization, in which antibodies against a particular infectious agent are given directly to the child or adult. These antibodies are taken from a donor and then processed so the final preparation contains high antibody concentrations. At that point, they are given in the vein or by shot to the patient. \n\nPassive immunization is often used in children and adults who have weakened immune systems or may not be good candidates for routine vaccinations for other reasons. It can be used with people who haven\u2019t been vaccinated against a disease to which they\u2019ve been exposed.https:\/\/www.healthychildren.org\/English\/safety-prevention\/immunizations\/Pages\/Immunizations%20Active-vs-Passive.aspx\n\n#Children Vaccination (0-9 years): \n\nBCG, HEPATITIS B, PENTAVALENTE ACELULAR (DPaT\/VIP+HiB), DPT, ROTAVIRUS, NEUMOCOCO CONJUGADA, INFLUENZA, SRP, SABIN, SR.","0860a4d9":"The Public Health Crisis in Venezuela Is Spreading to Its Neighbors\n\nDozens of families in Venezuela are making the risky trip to Colombia in order to get healthcare and other services. Among those services are vaccinations, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a hesitation when it comes to receiving them, certainly not the kind of hesitation.\n\nThat's what many families in Venezuela are doing, and they're not taking their children just to the safety of a neighboring country. They're also taking their children into the safety of immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nThe situation in Venezuela is very complex. Venezuela is a major oil producer. As such, most of the jobs tied themselves to the oil industry while not enough people worked in more sustainable industries like agriculture or manufacturing. \n\n Without healthcare, preventive care, a living wage, etc., millions of people have started to leave the country, most into neighboring Colombia or Brazil. That migration and lack of immunization coverage recently triggered a measles outbreak in Brazil. In order to prevent similar situations, Colombia has begun a campaign to immunize any and all Venezuelans seeking refuge, and the refugees seem more than happy to receive the immunizations.\nhttps:\/\/www.historyofvaccines.org\/content\/blog\/venezuela-colombia-immunization","41e37d1f":"#Codes from Paul Mooney: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/paultimothymooney\/poetry-generator-rnn-markov","b72d66e9":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata   @mpwolke","f455fb93":"youtube.com","371e973b":"Recently a number of publications looked at the association between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on one hand and countries' policies with respect to BCG vaccination on the other. This connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place. This study shows that population age is a very significant confounding factor that explains the rates of infections much better and has a solid biology mechanism which explains the correlation. It suggests that BCG vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors, such as population age, ethnicity, rates of certain chronic diseases, time from community spread start date, major public policy decisions and income levels.\n\nAuthors: Kirov, Stefan; Squibb, Bristol.
