Though as I already alluded most do not have any information with regards to Botswana Hence why I decided to create myself one. I will also on open source platforms contribute to adding information about Botswana upon being confirmed which I will later show on linkedIn.\n\nNB: Note on the 31st March the situational repot by WHO showed that Botswana had confirmed cases of about 3 people with no death, but today wikipedia had already updated their sources to 4 confirmed cases with one death as per contribution by cabinet ministers and officials from the Ministry of Health on the 03\/04\/2020 on national television 18:00hrs GMT time.\n\n Some of the prominent data sources in the web are but not limited to the following links:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.arcgis.com\/apps\/opsdashboard\/index.html#\/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 \nhttps:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/bitstream\/handle\/10665\/331655\/SITREP_COVID-19_WHOAFRO_20200401-eng.pdf \nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_by_country_and_territory \nhttps:\/\/data.humdata.org\/dataset\/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases ","f4731c38":"Next I import the datasets","971f0c49":" ##  Modelling the Data and Anaylsis of the Covid Virus and  Developing the dataset","a951204a":"  In all my analysis that will follow I will use the datset that I have directly imported into the  \n  data frames as shown above, the dataFrames are as follows \n\n- confirmed_df\n- deaths_df \n- recovered_df\n- cases_df","ed2a43ef":"Before any modelling can take place there have to be a dataset, but as mentioned ealier we don have any easily available in Botswana. In some cases you can get an abrupt answer as such information is classified when enquiring from relevant authorities such as in the Ministry of Health and Statistics Botswana.\n\nSo I will start by creating my own \u201cDATASET\u201d.   \n\nThe follwing are some of the pblicily available sources hat are available that I will use to come up with the dataset:","4ce4a6d1":"A quick look around the internet, one will pick up alot of dashboards as well as data around the Corona Virus ependicmic.

As a new  entrant to the field of Data Analysis am fascinated by all these different strategies used by different countries from social distancing , lockdown amongst others. It is clear these strategies most are based on decisions partly arrived at by Data Scientists.\n\nWhen going through all these hordes of information online I normally find myself trying to compare some of the data I go through with that from my country Botswana. So far I have been failing to get any except from the little numbers that I get over the radio or when ministers brief the nation on National Television \u2013 BTV. This frustrate me so much that I am now trying to create my own COVID-19 Dataset and even go a step further by modelling it before presenting the data visually using my foundational knowledge.\n\nI will try to explain the common beliefs about COVID-19 spread by using the dataset I will create and update on a daily basis based on information I gather.","bf833746":"To view columns in the confirmed_cases and an illustration we code as follows: ","d46c4e0f":"and our biggest neighbour South Africa..
