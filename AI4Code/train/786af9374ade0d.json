That is, make sure to wrap conditions with parentheses.\n\n**Note:** Both slicing and `loc` will achieve the same result, it is just that `loc` is typically faster in production. You are free to use whichever one you would like.","4b363047":"#### Selection using Integer location (using iloc)\n\nIn the lesson we discussed another pandas feature `iloc[]` which lets you slice the dataframe by row position and column position instead of by row index and column label (which is the case for `loc[]`). This is really the main difference between the two functions and it is **important** that you remember the difference and why you might want to use one over the other. In addition, with `iloc[]`, the end index is **not** included, like with normal Python slicing.\n\n**Note:** As a mnemonic, remember that the i in `iloc` means \"integer\". \n\nBelow, we have sorted the `baby_names` dataframe. Notice how the **position** of a row is not necessarily equal to the **index** of a row. For example, the first row is not necessarily the row associated with index 1. This distinction is important in understanding the different between `loc[]` and `iloc[]`.","dbe79b83":"**Note:** `.loc[]` can be used to re-order the columns within a dataframe.","a9bf3056":"## 4. Filtering Data\n\n### Filtering with boolean arrays\n\nFiltering is the process of removing unwanted material.  In your quest for cleaner data, you will undoubtedly filter your data at some point: whether it be for clearing up cases with missing values, for culling out fishy outliers, or for analyzing subgroups of your data set.  Note that compound expressions have to be grouped with parentheses. Example usage looks like `df[df['column name'] < 5]]`.\n\nFor your reference, some commonly used comparison operators are given below.\n\nSymbol   | Usage      | Meaning \n------   | ---------- | -------------------------------------\n$==$     | a == b     | Does a equal b?\n$\\lt =$  | a >= b     | Is a less than or equal to b?\n$\\gt =$  | a >= b     | Is a greater than or equal to b?\n$\\lt$    | a < b      | Is a less than \n$\\gt$    | a > b      | Is a greater than b?\n~        | ~p         | Returns negation of p\n&#124;   | p &#124; q | p OR q\n&        | p & q      | p AND q\n^        | p ^ q      | p XOR q (exclusive or)\n\nIn the following we construct the DataFrame containing only names registered in North Carolina.","48928891":"**Example 1.1.** For a DataFrame `d`, you can add a column with `d['new column name'] = ...` and assign a list or array of values to the column. Add a column of integers containing 1, 2, 3, and 4 called `rank1` to the `fruit_info` table which expresses your personal preference about the taste ordering for each fruit (1 is tastiest; 4 is least tasty). ","bbed1ab8":"## 3. Slicing Data Frames - Selecting rows and columns\n\n### Selection Using Label\/Index (using loc)\n\n#### Column Selection \n\nTo select a column of a `DataFrame` by column label, the safest and fastest way is to use the `.loc` [method](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html). General usage of `.loc` looks like `df.loc[rowname, colname]`. (Reminder that the colon `:` means \"everything.\")  For example, if we want the `color` column of the `ex` data frame, we would use: `ex.loc[:, 'color']`\n\n- You can also slice across columns. For example, `baby_names.loc[:, 'Name':]` would select the column `Name` and all columns after `Name`.\n\n- **Alternative:** While `.loc` is invaluable when writing production code, it may be a little too verbose for interactive use. One recommended alternative is the `[]` method, which takes on the form `df['colname']`.\n\n#### Row Selection\n\nSimilarly, if we want to select a row by its label, we can use the same `.loc` method. In this case, the \"label\" of each row refers to the index (i.e. primary key) of the dataframe.","5d970015":"**Example 3.6.** Selecting multiple columns is easy.  You just need to supply a list of column names.  Select the `Name` and `Year` **in that order** from the `baby_names` table.\n","74d488e4":"And that's it. I hope this Pandas overview was helpful :)","b491364b":"You can obtain the dimensions of a dataframe by using the shape attribute `dataframe.shape`.","56be9c26":"## 1. Creating DataFrames & Basic Manipulations\n\nA [dataframe](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/dsintro.html#dataframe) is a table in which each column has a type; there is an index over the columns (typically string labels) and an index over the rows (typically ordinal numbers).\n\nThe [documentation](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.html) for the pandas `DataFrame` class  provide at least two syntaxes to create a data frame.\n\n**Syntax 1:** You can create a data frame by specifying the columns and values using a dictionary as shown below. \n\nThe keys of the dictionary are the column names, and the values of the dictionary are lists containing the row entries.","7e2d8c8d":"**Example 3.5.** However, if we still want to access rows by location we will need to use the integer location (`iloc`) accessor.\n\n**Note:** We can't do this `df.loc[2:5, 'Year'] `","a5dbfbf1":"**Example: 3.1.**","ab83f6fe":"Notice that using `loc[]` with 1:4 gives different results, since it selects using the **index**.","601b8742":"**Syntax 2:** You can also define a dataframe by specifying the rows like below. \n\nEach row corresponds to a distinct tuple, and the columns are specified separately.","25c0db2a":"**Note:** `.loc` actually uses the Pandas row index rather than row id\/position of rows in the dataframe to perform the selection. Also, notice that if you write `2:5` with `loc[]`, contrary to normal Python slicing functionality, the end index is included, so you get the row with index 5.","578ab91f":"**Example 4.2.** Count the number of different names for each gender in NC (North Carolina).\n\n**Note:** An implementation with `groupby` and `.size()` is also possible.","aeb55fce":"You can also convert the entire dataframe into a two-dimensional numpy array.","c8308f6d":"<h3> Imports <\/h3>","86e5d11c":"# Pandas Overview\n\n[Pandas](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/) is one of the most widely used Python libraries in data science.

As discussed in the lesson, the first parameter is for the rows and second is for columns. The `:` means change all rows and the `new column name` indicates the column you are modifying (or in this case, adding). \n\nAdd a column called `rank2` to the `fruit_info` table which contains the same values in the same order as the `rank1` column.","0a5848a0":"**Example 4.4.** Some names gain\/lose popularity because of cultural phenomena such as a political figure coming to power or a successful athlete or entertainer in the during the prime years of his\/her career. \n\nBelow, we plot the popularity of the name Jordan in North Carolina over time.
