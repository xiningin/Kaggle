Let us see how the placement status changes with the percentage range.","e446d370":"The placement ratio for each of the boards is similar. Hence, we could say that 10th board of examination doesn't hold much value towards placement.","d4851199":"The graph is quite similar to what was seen for 10th board exams. Almost entire students with 80-100 % got placed. Most students in 60-80 % range also got placed. Just like in the case of 10th boards, most students could not get placed in the 0-60 % range.","e64b290d":"## Conclusion\n\nFrom the above exercise, it is clear that with the given amount of limited available to us, we can at the most predict about 77% cases (50 correct predictions) even with the more complex algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost. Hence, it order to improve the test score, more amount of data is necessary. A balanced dataset would also massively help us predict the cases more accurately","6c1908ef":"## Splitting the data into train and test data","9062dd78":"## Support Vector Classifier\n\nLet us check how the SVC performs on the given dataset.","16d1eddd":"## degree_t\n\nLet us check the various types of Undergrad degrees available in the data.","00d61750":"As we can see, K=8 is performing quite well on the training data. Increasing the K value to be too high generally leads to underfitted model. ","22c37da8":"# 1.  Importing the relevant libraries and data \n\nLet us first start with the usual importing of relevant libraries which will be required for our analysis. We shall import the data into the dataframe name df","ae7d6983":"## Gender\n\nGender column is straightforward with either Male (M) or Female (F) indices.\nSince we cannot leave the data in object form, let us replace \n\n**M with 0** and **F with 1** .","859413c9":"As it can be seen, high percentage of male candidates got placed. On the other hand, comparitively lower number of female candidates got placed. This is expected as male candidates are generally higher in most brances. Hence, their chances of getting placed is normally higher as well. Let us check the male to female ratio of this branch.","7238e05c":"## workex\n\nThis column tells us if a student has any work experience prior to joining the MBA programme.\n\nWe shall map the entries as\n\n**Yes:1\nNo:0**","4d7ba228":"The AUC score is 0.87 which is decent. Moreover, from the red curve of ROC, it is seen that major regions of the area have been covered which is ideal. Hence, Logistic Regression has done equally well. \n\nLet us now check the optimum tradeoff between precision and recall values.","48e6b0ae":"## XGBoost classifier\n\nLet us try an even more powerful algorithm called the XGBoost classifier which takes gradient boosting to extreme levels.","d565af5c":"As we can see, maximum students enrolled in the program were either from commerce or science background. Very few students were from Arts background.\n\nIn terms of placements, it can be seen that most students who got placed were from commerce background followed by science and then arts. This could be because both commerce and arts have great usage of mathematica and analytical skills which are quite important in finance operations. Since commerce students have economics and finance as a part of their school and UG studies, hence they are of high demand by the companies. Arts students will be a bigger asset for Human Resources department of companies as their skillsets are ideal for HR related work. Hence, students getting placed with arts background are demanded mostly for HR related roles.","bcea356b":"## Logistic Regression\n\nLet us utilise the simple linear classification algorithm of logistic regression.","979ef2f6":"From the MBA specialisation data, it can be seen most students who were placed were in Marketing & Finance division. In Marketing & HR section, students couldn't convert as many placement opprotunities. Number of placed and unplaced students are about the same in this case.","24756fc3":"The M\/F ratio is approximately 2. This can be interpreted as for every 1 female candiate, there are 2 male candiates sitting for placements.\n\n\nLet us check the placement percentage for each batch to understand if gender does imply better placement conversion.","d16aec12":"## Random Forest Classifier\n\nLet us now explore the tree based algorithms which are generally known to perform well. However, care needs to be taken to prevent overfitting since tree based models are inherently overfitted. We shall apply grid search CV technique that will allow us tune the depth hyperparameter.","d913a711":"## Scores Vs Placed\n\nLet us see what is the correlation between 10th percentage of each category and placement status","69d43861":"Let us check for the optimum value of K neighbots required for prediction","8af3b814":"On studying the MBA percentage data, we can see that no students crossed the 80% threshold. Hence, the data for class 1 is not available for MBA percentage. \n\nUpon studying the MBA percentage data, we can see that more students from percentage class 2 got placed as opposed to class 3. However, the difference is not as high as for board and UG percentages. Hence, we can say that MBA percentage is not as big as a factor. This could be because MBA is a branch that places much more importance on speaking skills, internships, case studies, etc rather than academic scores. Hence, the play is much more level fielded in this case. ","0fdafc98":"As we can see, most students had their undergraduate degrees in commerce and management followed by science and then others. Just as we did for higher secondary subjects, we shall one hot encode the results of undergrad degrees aswell.","d4d8b5a1":"## ssc_p , hsc_p,degree_p, mba_p, etest_p\nIn order to align the percentage values better,we will be sectioning the percentages into 3 main categories based upon percentage ranges. These ranges are as follows:\n\n0-60 % : 3\n\n61-80 % : 2\n\n81-100 % :1","f4b5e250":"Very few students are in the 80-100 % bracket in 12th board exams. Like 10th grade, most students were in the 60-80 % range, followed by 0-60 % range.","b212c633":"As we can observe, the unique entries are either Central or others. By Central, the indication must be that the board is CBSE. While others could mean variety of boards such as state board, international board or ICSC board. The candidates with central board is slightly higher as compared to other boards. \n\nWe shall perform the exact same treatment as we did for gender.\n\n**Central : 1\nOthers : 0**","aa583a7f":"# 3. Data Visualisation\n\nIn this section, we shall be visualising the various features to understand if they'll have some correlation with the target feature.\n\n## Gender Vs Placed","8bbed827":"As expected, most of the commerce students were successful in getting placed followed by science and others.","634a065c":"Now, we can consider the data to be cleaned completely off any issues and can be safely used for visualisation and machine learning purposes. Let us take a peek at how the final dataframe looks like.","a1b327f5":"From the heatmap, it is not entirely certain which of the values are highly correlated. However, there are some bad correlations that we may omit out. But the bigger issue is that there is no clear value that can tell us which are the non important features. Hence, we will leave out these features. However, we can definitely remove some features such as examination boards since they don't seem to give us any extra information.\n\nLet us proceed with dropping the unnecessary features.","e69f0c62":"The data give to us has a total of 215 entries. This is roughly the size of a MBA batch for a particular year of a college. Hence, the data provided could be that for the batch of a particular year.\n\nLet us check the various data types available to us and see if there are any missing values.","38072ccf":"## KNN ","1a1d4afd":"As can be seen, all students scoring 80-100% in 10th grade got placed. Most students in 60-80% range did get placed while maximum students below 60% in 10th standard couldn't get placed. It shows that generally, a student who has done well in 10th grade is more likely to get placed.\n\nLet us study the same for the remaining score percentages such as 12th, UG score, MBA score and E-test score.","d3db3067":"Here it can be seen from the placement ratios of the two genders that **males outperformed the female candidates in the batch**.","4cebb9b6":"# 2. Data wrangling","52c66193":"Unlike the case for 10th board, more students opted for state boards in their 12th examinations. The performance of state board students was better as more students from state board of 12th were placed. However, the placed\/unplaced ratio for both is nearly identical once again. Hence, 12th board is not playing a significant role once again.","c2a17fa8":"## status\n\nThis column tells us whether the student got placed in the placement program. This is our target variable which is important for training and testing purpose in the ML phase.\n\nLet us map the terms placed and unplaced as \n\n**Placed : 1\nNot Placed : 0**","f6fe9697":"The green line shows the median salary of the candidates while the red line shows the mean salary.","92b23e91":"## SSC and HSC board\n\nLet us visualise the data for the boards of candidates who managed to get placed. This will give us an indication if board of examination has any role to play for placements.","144838ce":"As can be seen, students with commerce specialisation was highest followed by science and arts.\n\nWe shall use one-hot-encoding for this particular feature. This can be done using the pd.get_dummies function.","a6920737":"Since the raw data could have lots of missing values or other issues, we will be taking care to align the data into simpler more understandable and clear data which will be further helpful to be used in our ML models. Since the columns have not been clearly mentioned as to what they exactly mean, I have made the following assumptions to understand the data better:\n\n* 'ssc_p': 10th Grade percentage\n* 'ssc_b':10th Grade board \n* 'hsc_p': 12th Grade percentage \n* 'hsc_b': 12th Grade board \n* 'hsc_s': Higher secondary stream\n* 'degree_p': Undergraduate percentage \n* 'degree_t': Undergraduate degree type  \n* 'workex': Work experience  \n* 'etest_p':Placement test percentage \n* 'specialisation': MBA specialisation \n* 'mba_p': MBA percentage\n* 'status': Hiring status ","9043a029":"Since we have very limited data for usage, let us split the data into train\/test with a ratio of 0.2","49efe9cf":"## specialisation\n\nThis column tells us about the type of MBA program the student is currently enrolled in. The value counts for each specialisation are as follows.","26eabf84":"AUC score is comparitively lower than Logistic Regression. However, the score is quite decent with 0.83 and covers a good amount of area through the red ROC curve.\n\nLet us now check the tradeoff between Precision and Recall.","b83264ab":"## Check for feature correlations\n\nIn order to understand how strong are the features correlated to each other, let us create a heatmap of the corrplot that will let us know where the correlations are strong. From the heatmap, we can make strong arguments to remove some of the unimportant features that can be removed for our ML training and testing.","0a1b846f":"## hsc_s\n\nThis column deals with the specialisation subjects taken by students when they enter 11th grade. Let us see the various entries alongwith their counts.","0c003e9e":"Now, the dataframe has been wrangled and can be used for the purpose of ML and data visualisation aswell. Let us look at how the dataframe looks like.","e18247b5":"Hence, majority of the students were in Marketing and Finance while the remaining in Marketing and HR.\n\nWe should encode the data as \n\n**Mkt&Fin : 1\nMkt&HR : 0**","c9bc2bc4":"Optimum  tradeoff is : Precision: 0.8   Recall: 0.9","e4bccdaa":"## Salary\n\nAs we can clearly see, the only missing values present are in the salary column. This is because the missing values are corresponding to students to did not get placed in the placement program. \n\nWe will make the assumption that the missing values are filled with 0.","33b6b9cd":"So, we have replaced all the missing values with the median value of Rs. 2,65,000","a8592b38":"As we can see, the salary curve is right skewed. This is because there will always be some dream jobs which will offer high packages. However, these packages are very few in number. Majority of the packages will be in the region of 2-4 LPA.\n\nLet us mark the mean and median salaries on the distribution curve to understand what the maximum students are earning.","4c0b6cb9":"The above graphs tell us about how the students have performed in the E-tests and what value of those have converted their offers.\n\nMost students in the class 1 category have successfully received offers from the company. It is also encouraging to see that more students in class 3 categories have also successfully converted offers.\n\nThe reason could be because E-tests are just preliminary screening tests. These tests usually don't hold much value once the student passes the test and moves ahead with further screening process that could include group discussions and interviews.\n\n\n## High school stream and degree specialisations\n\nWe are now interested to check if high school stream, UG degree specialisation or MBA degree specialisation has any particular importance with respect to placement status.","e4184b88":"Hence, using KNN algorithm with K=8, we could successfully predict 77% of the test cases correctly. As the data is quite unbalanced with low unplaced numbers, hence, the training wasn't upto the mark to be able to predict majority of the unplaced test cases correctly.","0ba473a8":"## ssc_b and hsc_b\n\nHere, we are presented with the data of the 10th board. Let us check the unique entries and their counts we are presented with.","61a27ab8":"# 4. Machine Learning\n\nNow, as we have done all the required visualisations and data wrangling\/cleaning operations, we shall focus on applying numerous ML algorithms to see if we can predict the placement status of a student accurately.","927ab024":"## Salary distribution\n\nLet us check how the companies are paying their freshers. We shall find the required median and mean salary of the college placements."}}
