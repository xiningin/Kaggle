Brain+Machine Adding AI Revolution\n\nGML is an automatic machine learning and feature engineering library in python built on top of Multiple Machine Learning packages. with this library,you can find and fill the missing values in your data, encode them, generate new features from them, select the best features and train your data on multiple machine learning algorithms and a neural network! not only training but scaling the data for normal distribution and after scaling and training, testing the data on validation data. in AUTO Machine Learning, there would be two rounds, in first round all the models will compete for top 5 and after that in second round those top 5 will compete for number one spot. the first ranked model will be returned (untrained, so you can train it yourself and check results).\n\nSource: https:\/\/github.com\/Muhammad4hmed\/Ghalat-Machine-Learning","28002905":"# Final","9298230e":"# Lets import our own model to make it compete with rest","73755af0":"#  Working in progress"}}
