In particular, we will use Bayesian Optimization and the Hyperopt library to tune the hyperparameters of a gradient boosting machine. \n\n__Additional Notebooks__ \n\nIf you haven't checked out my other work on this problem, here is a complete list of the notebooks I have completed so far:\n\n* [A Gentle Introduction](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/start-here-a-gentle-introduction)\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part One](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering)\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part Two](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering-p2)\n* [Introduction to Automated Feature Engineering](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/automated-feature-engineering-basics)\n* [Advanced Automated Feature Engineering](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/tuning-automated-feature-engineering-exploratory)\n* [Feature Selection](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/introduction-to-feature-selection)\n* [Intro to Model Tuning: Grid and Random Search](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/intro-to-model-tuning-grid-and-random-search)\n* [Automated Model Tuning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/automated-model-tuning)\n\nThere are four approaches to tuning the hyperparameters of a machine learning model\n\n1. __Manual__: select hyperparameters based on intuition\/experience\/guessing, train the model with the hyperparameters, and score on the validation data. Repeat process until you run out of patience or are satisfied with the results.\n2. __Grid Search__: set up a grid of hyperparameter values and for each combination, train a model and score on the validation data. In this approach, every single combination of hyperparameters values is tried which can be very inefficient!\n3. __Random search__: set up a grid of hyperparameter values and select random combinations to train the model and score. The number of search iterations is set based on time\/resources.\n4. __Automated Hyperparameter Tuning__: use methods such as gradient descent, Bayesian Optimization, or evolutionary algorithms to conduct a guided search for the best hyperparameters.\n\nThese are listed in general order of least to most efficient. While we already conquered 2 and 3 [in this notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/intro-to-model-tuning-grid-and-random-search) (we didn't even try method 1), we have yet to take on automated hyperparameter tuning. There are a number of methods to do this including genetic programming, Bayesian optimization, and gradient based methods. Here we will focus only on Bayesian optimization, using the Tree Parzen Esimator (don't worry, you don't need to understand this in detail) in the [Hyperopt open-source Python library](https:\/\/hyperopt.github.io\/hyperopt\/).\n\nFor a little more background (we'll cover everything you need below), [here is an introductory article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/an-introductory-example-of-bayesian-optimization-in-python-with-hyperopt-aae40fff4ff0) on Bayesian optimization, and [here is an article on automated hyperparameter tuning](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/automated-machine-learning-hyperparameter-tuning-in-python-dfda59b72f8a) using Bayesian optimization. Here we'll get right into automated hyperparameter tuning, so for the necessary background on model tuning, refer to [this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/intro-to-model-tuning-grid-and-random-search)\n\n## Bayesian Optimization Primer\n\nThe problem with grid and random search is that these are __uninformed methods__ because they do not use the past results from different values of hyperparameters in the objective function (remember the objective function takes in the hyperparameters and returns the model cross validation score). We record the results of the objective function for each set of hyperparameters, but the algorithms do not select the next hyperparameter values from this information. Intuitively, if we have the past results, we should  use them to reason about what hyperparameter values work the best and choose the next values wisely to try and spend more iterations evaluating promising values. Evaluating hyperparameters in the objective function is very time-consuming, and the __concept of Bayesian optimization is to limit calls to the evaluation function by choosing the next hyperparameter values based on the previous results.__ This allows the algorithm to spend __more time evaluating promising hyperparameter values and less time in low-scoring regions of the hyperparameter space__. For example, consider the image below:\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/WillKoehrsen\/hyperparameter-optimization\/master\/images\/random_forest_hypothetical.png)\n\nIf you were choosing the next number of trees to try for the random forest, where would you concentrate your search? Probably around 100 trees because that is where the lowest errors have tended to occur (imagine this is a problem where we want to minimize the error). In effect, you have just done Bayesian hyperparameter optimization in your head! You formed a probability model of the error as a function of the hyperparameters and then selected the next hyperparameter values by maximizing the probability of a low error. Bayesian optimization works by building a surrogate function (in the form of a probability model) of the objective function $P(\\text{score} | \\text{hyperparameters}$. The surrogate function is much cheaper to evaluate than the objective, so the algorithm chooses the next values to try in the objective based on maximizing a criterion on the surrogate (usually expected improvement), exactly what you would have done with respect to the image above. \n\nThe surrogate function is based on past evaluation results - pairs of (score, hyperparameter) records - and is continually updated with each objective function evaluation. Bayesian optimization therefore uses Bayesian reasoning: form an initial model (called a prior) and then update it with more evidence. The idea is that as the data accumulates, the surrogate function gets closer and closer to the objective function, and the hyperparameter values that are the best in the surrogate function will also do the best in the objective function. Bayesian optimization methods differ in the algorithm used to build the surrogate function and choose the next hyperparameter values to try. Some of the common choices are Gaussian Process (implemented in Spearmint), Random Forest Regression (in SMAC), and the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) in Hyperopt (technical details can be found in this article, although they won't be necessary to use the methods).\n\n### Four Part of Bayesian Optimization\n\nBayesian hyperparameter optimization requires the same four parts as we implemented in grid and random search:\n\n1. __Objective Function__: takes in an input (hyperparameters) and returns a score to minimize or maximize (the cross validation score)\n2. __Domain space__: the range of input values (hyperparameters) to evaluate\n3. __Optimization Algorithm__: the method used to construct the surrogate function and choose the next values to evaluate\n4. __Results__: score, value pairs that the algorithm uses to build the surrogate function\n\nThe only differences are that now our objective function will return a score to minimize (this is just convention in the field of optimization), our domain space will be probability distributions rather than a hyperparameter grid, and the optimization algorithm will be an __informed method__ that uses past results to choose the next hyperparameter values to evaluate. \n\n## Hyperopt\n\nHyperopt is an open-source Python library the implements Bayesian Optimization using the Tree Parzen Estimator algorithm to construct the surrogate function and select the next hyperparameter values to evaluate in the objective function. There are a number of other libraries such as Spearmint (Guassian process surrogate function) and SMAC (random forest regression surrogate function) sharing the same problem structure. The four parts of an optimization problem that we develop here will apply to all the libraries with only a change in syntax. Morevoer, the optimization methods as applied to the Gradient Boosting Machine will translate to other machine learning models or any problem where we have to minimize a function.\n\n### Gradient Boosting Machine\n\nWe will use the gradient booosting machine (GBM) as our model to tune in the LightGBM library. The GBM is our choice of model because it performs extremely well for these types of problems (as shown on the leaderboard) and because the performance is heavily dependent on the choice of hyperparameter values. \n\nFor more details of the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), check out this high-level blog post, or this in depth technical article.\n\n### Cross Validation with Early Stopping\n\nAs with random and grid search, we will evaluate each set of hyperparameters using 5 fold cross validation on the training data. The GBM model will be trained with early stopping, where estimators are added to the ensemble until the validation score has not decrease for 100 iterations (estimators added). \n\nCross validation and early stopping will be implemented using the LightGBM `cv` function. We will use 5 folds and 100 early stopping rounds. \n\n#### Dataset and Approach\n\nAs before, we will work with a limited section of the data - 10000 observations for training and 6000 observations for testing. This will allow the optimization within the notebook to finish in a reasonable amount of time. Later in the notebook, I'll present results from 1000 iterations of Bayesian hyperparameter optimization on the reduced dataset and we then will see if these results translate to a full dataset (from [this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jsaguiar\/updated-0-792-lb-lightgbm-with-simple-features)). The functions developed here can be taken and run on any dataset, or used with any machine learning model (just with minor changes in the details) and working with a smaller dataset will allow us to learn all of the concepts. I am currently running 500 iterations of Bayesian hyperparameter optimization on a complete dataset and will make the results available when the search is completed. ","36d713ee":"We can also find the best scores for plotting the best hyperparameter values.","755430bb":"## Evolution of Search\n\nAn interesting series of plots to make is the evolution of the hyperparameters over the search. This can show us what values the Bayesian optimization tended to focus on. The average cross validation score continued to improve throughout Bayesian optimization, indicating that \"more promising\" values of the hyperparameters were being evaluated and maybe a longer search would prove useful (or there could be a plateau in the validation scores with a longer search).","b8bb40d1":"# Conclusions\n\nBayesian optimization is one method for automated hyperparameter tuning. Automated hyperparameter tuning aims to find the best hyperparameter values for a machine learning model on a given dataset with no input from the data scientist beyond initial set-up required. Bayesian optimization uses Bayesian reasoning to build a probability model of the objecitve function $P(\\text{score} | \\text{hyperparameters})$ which is then used to select the next hyperparameter values to evaluate. The concept is to use more search iterations evaluating promising hyperparameter values by reasoning from the past results. This is an intuitive method of hyperparamter optimization that works in much the same way a human does to get better at any situation: learn from past experiences! If everything works as expected, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization can result in:\n\n* Better generalization performance on the test set\n* Fewer iterations than random or grid search require\n\nEven if Bayesian optimization (or other automated hyperparameter tuning methods) does not deliver on the above points in all situations, it is a useful skill to master as a data scientist. In the future, data scientists are not going to spend valuable time tweaking model hyperparameters, and knowing methods for accomplishing this automatically will go a long way in your career or studies! Feel free to take this code and apply it to any dataset or to a different machine learning model. I am currently running these methods on a full dataset and will share the results when they are completed.

For example, with a log-uniform distribution, there will be an equal chance of drawing a value from 0.005 to 0.05 and from 0.05 to 0.5 (in linear space far more values would be drawn from the later since the linear distance is much larger.
