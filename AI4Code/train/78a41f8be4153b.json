Most of them are not in a romantic relationship(so sad)","7ba30a11":"The RandomForestRegressor() has performed far better than all the other models. Hence, we will go on with this model only.","fb947c93":"Although this doesn't conclude that students who engage in extra-curricular activities and drink less are athletes, but they necessarily drink a lot less than those who don't. Hence, extra-curricular activities are an indicator for a student drinking less.","c95fd226":"6. We saw how the dummy column had some impact on the metrics. Let's see what happens when we remove the workday and weekend columns and just keep the dummy column.","5ef11953":"2. Similar to family support, school support too had the same low significance to grades. Let's remove it and train the data.","c9494c4c":"There is no significant change in metrics even after remove the dummy column. In fact, the subtle change that has happened is worse than the previous model.","4a690076":"The test metrics have worsened a bit but the training metrics have improved. Hence the model performs a bit better with the weekend and workday numbers.","99915e9f":"A lot of students who do not give much time for study and yet bring good grades are enrolled in paid extra classes and vice versa. Students who get very poor grades are likely to join paid extra classes.","6b225b46":"#### Cross Validation Scores\nLet's see how the model performs on cross validation for different metrics.","0c6fa5e1":"This plot show that in all periods, students in the age range of 15-18 scored higher than others.","a478d8c4":"Students in romantic relationships tend to have high alcohol consumption. Also, students with above average grades have low to moderate alcohol consumption and don't have romantic relationships. This can be a significant indicator of higher grades.","3aa7e098":"Our dataset has no null values, so that is one relief. Also, it has a lot of categorical features.","10d8918c":"Most of the students who have good family relations have moderate drinking habits and average grades. Students with poorer family relations tend to have poorer grades and moderate to low alcohol consumption.","52eb17fc":"# 1. Problem\nIn this project, we have to predict the grades of students using the data availabe regarding their alcohol consumption and some other features. The grades are in the form of numbers, hence this is a regression problem.","a9126fd1":"We have a lot data which is not in numerical form, lets first encode them before modelling","5eaa5764":"### Selecting and training model\nSince it is a regression problems, we must train and see how it performs in different models","e64524a0":" 1.

Students with very high alcohol consumption have less number of failures.","01a63baa":"A lot of students are in the age group 15-19 and the mean age is 16.7 years, along with most students in the data set aged 16 amd 17.","12876c38":"5.

There is no specific trend in student's going out frequency and final grades.\n    3. Students who score good grades have more freetime.\n    4. Students generally do some specific amount of absents despite alcohol consumption and grades.","16596a7a":"In all three plots, we can see that a large number of males have high weekly alcohol consumption and those men don't score very high grades. Meanwhile, a lot of females have low to moderate consumption and score higher grades.","aed2d60f":"Now we have all the column names which have 'object' data. Using them we can draw bar plots for all such features in one go","a1219d42":"Here also we can see some improvement in the model's performance with only minor decreses in some metrics.","03154244":"Let's make some visualizations on the dataset","8b4d4ec4":"# Student Alcohol Consumption and Marks in Mathematics\n\nIn this notebook, we are going to analyse the alcohol consumption of some students and their marks in mathematics. This is a very interesting dataset and problem, as we know how college students' drinking habits are and finding some predictions of their grades on the basis of their drinking habits is very fascinating. Let's see what kind of results we are able to get at the end of this project.","1a86d469":"# 5. Modelling","61b2c8c9":"### From all these plots, let's note down what are the important points we learnt about the data:\n\n    1. Most students in the schools are in the age range of 15-18\n    2. In all three periods, we can see that students in the age range of 15-18 score better grades as compared to other age groups\n    3. Students who go out more and drink more score less, so do students who do not go out often and drink moderately. However, there are some outliers.\n    4. Students with poor health and high alcohol consumption score better grades and vice versa. Students who have good health and high alcohol consumption score more.\n    5. Engagement in extra curricular activities is an indicator of good health and low alcohol consumption.\n    6. Failures are common in students who do not engage in exta curricular activities and have moderate alcohol consumption. Students with high alcohol consumption have less failures.\n    7. Students who want to pursue higher studies have better grades.\n    8. Students in romantic relationships have higher alcohol consumption. Students with low to moderate alcohol consumption having no romantic relationships have better grades.\n    9. Students who do not spend time in self study but attend extra paid classes score better. Also, students score very low also take extra paid classes.\n    10. Family and school education support doesn't really matter for a student's grades.\n    11. Students with poorer family relations do not drink much and have better grades and vice versa.\n    12. Students who live in urban areas and with low alcohol consumption score significantly higher than others.\n    13. The median scores of males is slightly better than females. Also, female students have shown low alcohol consumption and better grades in all three periods.\n    14. The drinking habits for males and females in weekends is pretty much same, along with going out frequency. However, during workday, females have less free time and tend to drink less than their counterparts.\n    15. Most of students whose parents are working government jobs and are teachers score significantly higher than others.\n    16. Also, the students who score a lot have mothers who are teachers.\n    17. Students go out often in general but those who go out still have less absents.\n    18. Some students who score a lot have moderate free time.\n    19. Students who consume less alcohol and score more have very less absents.\n    20. A lot of students have internet and those who have score better than those who don't.\n    21. Parents' cohabitation status doesn't matter much to the score.","6a11a65a":"Most students who have higher grades have low alchol cosumption and live in urban areas. This is a serious indicator for higher grades.","acc19447":"As, we can see, the model's performance after removing that column has improved(except for training R^2 score).

G1 and G2 are also contributing factor, with G2 behind way more important than G1.\n    5. Family relation, reason and absences (trivial features) are also contribute a lot.\n    6. Age is a detrimental factor.\n    \nOther than point no. 3, all other features were analysed to be of higher importance. This means the data analysis was done correctly.
