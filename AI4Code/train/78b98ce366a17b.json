EDA is fun. It is actually fun with **Pandas Profiling**.\n\n\nBut wait, what is **Pandas Profiling** ?\n\n\nIn this kernel, I will introduce you to **Pandas Profiling** which is a nice tool for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).","9aa58eed":"## 1.

This is called exploratory data analysis or EDA in short. We use Pandas for EDA purposes.\n\n\nPandas is the most widely used Python library which is used to get insights about the data. It is used for loading and processing data in Python. It has great set of tools to perform various statistical operations on the data. I have listed below some basic and common commands along with their description which are used to get insights about the data.\n\n- **head() method** - view the top 5 rows of the dataset.\n\n- **tail() method** - view the bottom 5 rows of the dataset.\n\n- **info() method** - view concise summary of dataset.\n\n- **describe() method** - view statistical properties of dataset.\n\n\nThere are some basic dataframe attributes which are as follows -\n\n\n- **df.shape** - gives the dimensions of the dataset.\n\n- **df.dtypes** - gives the data types of the columns.\n\n- **df.columns** - view the column names of the dataset.\n\n\nBut these methods and attributes are very basic for EDA purposes.\n\n\nThere is an alternative, called **Pandas profiling**. This library generates a complete report for your dataset, which includes:\n\n- Basic data type information (which columns contain what).\n\n- Descriptive statistics (mean, average, etc.)\n\n- Quantile statistics (tells you about how your data is distributed)\n\n- Histograms for your data (again, for visualizing distributions)\n\n- Correlations (Let's you see what's related)\n\n\nThis tool outputs a bunch of HTML file, containing all the information mentioned above. Instead of just giving us a single output, pandas-profiling tool provides a broadly structured HTML file containing all the relevant information that a typical EDA of all the basic commands and attributes provide. So, it saves a lot of time. Now we can perform EDA with just one line of code (as explained below).\n\n\nThis Pandas Profiling tool can be download here: -\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/pandas-profiling\/pandas-profiling\n\n\nWe will apply pandas-profiling to the Titanic data set because it has variety of data types and it contains missing values. This tool is particularly useful when the dataset is not cleaned and it requires individual exploration of the variables.
