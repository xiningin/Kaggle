Only 72% of them loged their sleep and only few times. Probably it is not comfortable to sleep with tracker on the hand. And only 24% of total users logged their weight.\n* For marketing strategy the data shows how affectivly to loose the calories only taking steps. With automatically gathering the steps, user will be more motivated to achieve his\/her goal in burned calories.\n* Reminders on the phone,goal-setting could help increase the user's engagement.\n* Motivate people to wear the tracker during sleep and also for appropriate predictions of burned calories, users have to share with us their weight, sex, and height. Only with this data Bellabit can make more predictable analysis of health for women. ","954c22f7":"* Fat coloumt include only 2 values.

Here we were tasked to improve the marketing strategy for the smart devices products of health-focused manufacturer for women, Bellabeat.\n\nThe main goals are:\n* What are the trends in smart device usage?\n* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n* What features should Bellabeat products consider adding to entice more customers?\n\nFor this case I will use Python despite it wasn't the language of the Data Analytics Course by Google. \nSo if you find some pieces of code thad you would like to improve, write the comment. \n\n### Uploading Data\nWe will use public data that explores smart device users' daily habits [www.kaggle.com\/arashnic\/fitbit](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arashnic\/fitbit)\n\nThis data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users.\n\nThere are a number of different csv files that range from Daily activity, calories, steps; hourly calories, intensities, and steps, and heart rate, sleep data and weight logs.\n\n\n### Data preparation\nWe\u2019ll create our data frames. The data frames I\u2019ll be working with will be creating objects for:\n* daily_activity\n* daily calories\n* daily sleep\n* weight log info\n* daily intensities\n\nWe\u2019ll follow typical naming conventions based on the csv file names. \nLet's load the libraries and csv files to have a first look at it.","75c03a3b":"What\u2019s the relationship between steps taken in a day and sedentary minutes?
