Many cases of COVID-19 are nosocomial, but to the best of our knowledge, no nosocomial outbreaks on psychiatric departments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in Europe.\n\nThe different nature of psychiatry makes outbreak management more difficult. This study determines which psychiatry specific factors contributed to a nosocomial outbreak taking place in a psychiatric department. This will provide possible interventions in future outbreak management.\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Nosocomial outbreak caused by healthcare worker (HCW)-to-HCW transmissions, as well as patient-to-HCW-to-patient transmission<\/font>\n\nThe nosocomial outbreak in which 43% of staff of the psychiatric department and 19% of admitted patients were involved, was caused by healthcare worker (HCW)-to-HCW transmissions, as well as patient-to-HCW-to-patient transmission. The authors identified four aspects associated with the mental health care system which might have made our department more susceptible to an outbreak.\n\nInfection control measures designed for hospitals are not directly applicable to psychiatric departments. Psychiatric patients should be considered a high-risk group for infectious diseases and customized measures should be designed and implemented.\n\nExtra attention for psychiatric departments is necessary during a pandemic as psychiatric HCWs are less familiar with outbreak management. Clear communication and governance is crucial in correctly implementing these measures.\nhttps:\/\/aricjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13756-020-00853-z","9ccf600f":"### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">   Tuberculosis in hospitalized patients   <\/font><\/mark><\/b>\n\nTuberculosis in hospitalized patients: clinical characteristics of patients receiving treatment within the first 24 h after admission\n\nAuthors: Denise Rossato Silva, Larissa Pozzebon da Silva, Paulo de Tarso Roth Dalcin\n\nJornal Brasileiro de Pneumologia -On-line version ISSN 1806-3756 -J. bras. pneumol. vol.40 no.3 S\u00e3o Paulo May\/June 2014\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.1590\/S1806-37132014000300011 \n\nEvaluate clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients hospitalized for tuberculosis, comparing those in whom tuberculosis treatment was started within the first 24 h after admission with those who did not.\n\nThe authors included 305 hospitalized patients, of whom 67 (22.0%) received tuberculosis treatment within the first 24 h after admission ( \u226424h group) and 238 (88.0%) did not (>24h group).\n\nInitiation of tuberculosis treatment within the first 24 h after admission was associated with being female (OR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.06-3.74; p = 0.032) and with an AFB-positive spontaneous sputum smear (OR = 4.19; 95% CI: 1.94-9.00; p < 0.001).\n\nIn the \u226424h and >24h groups, respectively, the ICU admission rate was 22.4% and 15.5% (p = 0.258); mechanical ventilation was used in 22.4% and 13.9% (p = 0.133); in-hospital mortality was 22.4% and 14.7% (p = 0.189); and a cure was achieved in 44.8% and 52.5% (p = 0.326).\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Rates of TB patients in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation use remained high. <\/font>\n\nAlthough tuberculosis treatment was initiated promptly in a considerable proportion of the inpatients evaluated, the rates of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation use remained high. \n\nStrategies for the control of tuberculosis in primary care should consider that patients who seek medical attention at hospitals arrive too late and with advanced disease.

The measures include the establishment of an emergency management system, development of a practical prevention and control system, and assessment of predicted risks based on data monitoring.\n\nGiven that vaccines for COVID-19 are still in development, governments must protect their susceptible population.

Psychiatrists often consider it their primary task to exclusively treat psychiatric illnesses,thereby possibly overlooking signs of physical disease .\nFurthermore, patients with severe mental illness are often unaware of their physical symptoms due to cognitive deficits or reduced pain sensitivity, and frequently have trouble communicating.For instance, our second patient\u2019s presentation of symptoms was severely impaired due to her catatonic state.\n\nThirdly, mental illnesses and psychiatric medications tend to negatively influence patients\u2019 capabilities of comprehending and following instructions, which is crucial for adequate reporting of symptoms and adhering to preventive measures.\n\nLastly, contrary to patients admitted to general hospital departments, admitted psychiatric patients are often ambulatory, eat meals together, undergo group therapy and interact with one another in close proximity, consequently facilitating the rapid spread of infection.\n\n#<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Psychiatric  Patients Risks: Unaware of their physical symptoms, Close proximity, Medications,Trouble Communicating <\/font>\n\nThe aforementioned aspects cause psychiatric departments to be at a higher risk for nosocomial outbreaks, thereby reinforcing the notion that the psychiatric population should be considered a high risk group.\n\nNonconventional methods of infection prevention such as having patients use personal protective equipment (PPE) instead of isolation, which were successfully implemented in a French psychiatric hospital during previous influenza outbreaks, should be considered during outbreak management on psychiatric departments in the future.\n\nAdditionally, more proactive testing, especially when in doubt or when patients are not able to adequately communicate symptoms, broadening disease assessment tools and choosing to isolate patients sooner, should also be considered.\nhttps:\/\/aricjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13756-020-00853-z","838ae3d3":"<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Unique problems faced by hospitals in LMICs under the COVID-19 pandemic<\/font>\n\nThe laws and regulations have been gradually amended and improved in LMICs after the outbreaks of SARS, influenza, and Ebola.\n\nHospitals are required to make detailed action plans for emergencies, follow a detailed national  prevention of hospital-acquired infection, reporting of confirmed cases, diagnosis and treatment experiences, as well as research and international exchange.\n\nHowever, the problems arising from outbreaks, which are generally characterized by a wide range of effects and high pathogenicity, are much different compared with ordinary epidemics of infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza.\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Challenges in the Context of this Novel COVID-19<\/font>\n\nHospitals in LMICs face a number of challenges in the context of this novel COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPoor handling of this balance may result in a hospital with either a cluster of infection events or the increased burden of chronic diseases owing to delayed health care.\n\nThis dilemma affects hospitals in all countries regardless of income level, but in LMICs, where the emergency response capacity is far from sufficient, the impact is typically much greater.\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Epidemics may degrade ICUs Capabilities and Staff Members fall ill<\/font>\n\nEpidemics may further degrade ICUs capabilities when staff members fall ill.
