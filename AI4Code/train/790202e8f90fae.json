There is a file called **heart_test.csv**. You will notice that this file does not have a HeartDisease column. You will have to use your model to make predicitions on the test data. You will then create a file called submission.csv which you will upload to kaggle to see your results.","b09d5da5":"Extract your labels in a variable called y (HeartDisease column).
