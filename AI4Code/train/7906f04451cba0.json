Conclusion\n\nThe answer is YES, we can predict the gender of a student based on their test scores. With an accuracy of 89.3% using SVC, the model actually performed better than I was expecting. Generally, it seems that males are better at maths whereas females are better at reading and writing.","0e147038":"# <h1 style=\"font-family:Garamond; color: purple; font-size:30px\"><center> Can we predict a student's gender based on their maths, reading and writing scores? <\/center><\/h1>","147f6b96":"# 7.

Checking gender frequencies\n\nIn classification problems it is important to ensure that the target data isn't significantly unbalanced.

Visualising gender scores","6008782e":"Throughout my entire school experience, there was always a stereotype that girls are better at subjects that are more creative with an emphasis on reading and writing, whereas boys are better at the more logical subjects. Personally, I never fit this stereotype, but is it generally true?\n\nIn this notebook I will be using students' test scores in maths, reading and writing to determine if their genders can be correctly identified without knowing any other characteristics.","3525a974":"# 2.
