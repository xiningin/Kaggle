Basic building blocks of CNN <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4\"><\/a>\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN transforms one volume of activations to another through a differentiable function. \n\n- We use three main types of layers to build CNN architectures - **Convolutional Layer**, **Pooling Layer**, and **Fully-Connected Layer**. We will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.\n\n- There are two other layers - **ReLU Layer** and **Loss Layer** that are also used to build a CNN. These layers are described below:\n","4ae0f4b0":"## 4.2 Pooling layer <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4.2\"><\/a>\n\n- Another important concept of CNNs is pooling, which is a form of non-linear down-sampling. There are several non-linear functions to implement pooling among which `max pooling` is the most common. It partitions the input image into a set of non-overlapping rectangles and for each such sub-region, outputs the maximum.\n\n- Intuitively, the exact location of a feature is less important than its rough location relative to other features. This is the idea behind the use of pooling in convolutional neural networks. \n\n- The pooling layer serves to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation, to reduce the number of parameters, memory footprint and amount of computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting. It is common to periodically insert a pooling layer between successive convolutional layers in a CNN architecture.\n\n- The pooling layer operates independently on every depth slice of the input and resizes it spatially. The most common form is a pooling layer with filters of size 2\u00d72 applied with a stride of 2 downsamples at every depth slice in the input by 2 along both width and height, discarding 75% of the activations. In this case, every max operation is over 4 numbers. The depth dimension remains unchanged.\n\n- In addition to max pooling, pooling units can use other functions, such as average pooling or \u21132-norm pooling.","6c5d235b":"## 4.4 Fully connected layer <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4.4\"><\/a>\n\n\n- Finally, after several convolutional and max pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connected layers. \n\n- Neurons in a fully connected layer have connections to all activations in the previous layer, as seen in regular (non-convolutional) artificial neural networks. \n\n- Their activations can thus be computed as an affine transformation, with matrix multiplication followed by a bias offset (vector addition of a learned or fixed bias term).","1582661b":"## 2.3 Pooling <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.3\"><\/a>\n\n- Convolutional networks may include local or global pooling layers to streamline the underlying computation. \n\n- Pooling layers reduce the dimensions of the data by combining the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer. \n\n- Local pooling combines small clusters, typically 2 x 2. Global pooling acts on all the neurons of the convolutional layer. \n\n- In addition, pooling may compute a max or an average. Max pooling uses the maximum value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer. Average pooling uses the average value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer.","81f4b609":"# 1. Introduction to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"><\/a>\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- In deep learning, a **convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet)** is a class of deep neural networks.\n\n- CNNs, like neural networks, are made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives several inputs, takes a weighted sum over them, pass it through an activation function and responds with an output. \n\n- The whole network has a loss function and all the basics for neural networks will apply on CNNs as well.\n\n- A convolutional neural network (CNN) consists of an input and an output layer, as well as multiple hidden layers.\n\n- The hidden layers of a CNN typically consist of a series of convolutional layers that convolve with a multiplication or other dot product. \n\n- The activation function is commonly a RELU layer, and is subsequently followed by additional convolutions such as pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers, referred to as hidden layers because their inputs and outputs are masked by the activation function and final convolution. \n\n- The final convolution, in turn, often involves backpropagation in order to more accurately weight the end product.\n\n- CNNs have wide variety of applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems and natural language processing. \n\n- For detailed discussion on CNN, please visit:\n\n[Convolutional Neural Network](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convolutional_neural_network)\n\n\n[CNN-Overview](http:\/\/cs231n.github.io\/convolutional-networks\/#overview)","0828ec0e":"## 4.5 Loss layer <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4.5\"><\/a>\n\n- The **loss layer** specifies how training penalizes the deviation between the predicted (output) and true labels and is normally the final layer of a neural network. Various loss functions are appropriate for different tasks may be used.\n\n- **Softmax loss** is used for predicting a single class of K mutually exclusive classes. \n\n- **Sigmoid cross-entropy loss** is used for predicting K independent probability values in [0,1]. \n\n- **Euclidean loss** is used for regressing to real-valued labels (-\u221e,\u221e).","52c6e20f":"## 2.5 Receptive field <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.5\"><\/a>\n\n- In neural networks, each neuron receives input from some number of locations in the previous layer. In a fully connected layer, each neuron receives input from every element of the previous layer. \n\n- In a convolutional layer, neurons receive input from only a restricted subarea of the previous layer. Typically the subarea is of a square shape (e.g., size 5 by 5). The input area of a neuron is called its **receptive field**. \n\n- So, in a fully connected layer, the receptive field is the entire previous layer. In a convolutional layer, the receptive area is smaller than the entire previous layer.","c8977abe":"- The next step, now that we have 64 4x4 filters, is to add a densely connected layer, which will serve to feed a final layer of softmax activation function with the following code snippet:\n\n`model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))`","4c8803c6":"## 2.6 Weights <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.6\"><\/a>\n\n- Each neuron in a neural network computes an output value by applying a specific function to the input values coming from the receptive field in the previous layer. \n\n- The function that is applied to the input values is determined by a vector of weights and a bias (typically real numbers). Learning, in a neural network, progresses by making iterative adjustments to these biases and weights.\n\n- The vector of weights and the bias are called filters and represent particular features of the input (e.g., a particular shape). \n\n- A distinguishing feature of CNNs is that many neurons can share the same filter. This reduces memory footprint because a single bias and a single vector of weights are used across all receptive fields sharing that filter, as opposed to each receptive field having its own bias and vector weighting.","93fef6bd":"[Go to Top](#0)","81328022":"## 2.4 Fully connected <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.4\"><\/a>\n\n- Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another layer. \n\n- It is in principle the same as the traditional multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP). \n\n- The flattened matrix goes through a fully connected layer to classify the images.","128daf0d":"## 2.2 Convolutional <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.2\"><\/a>\n\n- When programming a CNN, each convolutional layer within a neural network should have the following attributes:\n\n  - Input is a tensor with shape (number of images) x (image width) x (image height) x (image depth).\n  \n  - Convolutional kernels whose width and height are hyper-parameters, and whose depth must be equal to that of the image. \n\n- Convolutional layers convolve the input and pass its result to the next layer.","e699f30e":"## Size and number of filters\n\n\n- The size of the window `(window_height \u00d7 window_width)` that holds information from spatially close pixels is usually 3\u00d73 or 5\u00d75.

In mathematics, convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions (f and g) that produces a third function expressing how the shape of one is modified by the other. \n\n- The term **convolution** refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it.
