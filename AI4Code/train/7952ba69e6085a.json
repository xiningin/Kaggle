Therefore, significant attention has to be paid to comparison of the results from different cells (sequencing libraries). The main sources of discrepancy between the libraries are:\n\n- Amplification (up to 1 million fold)\n- Gene 'dropouts' in which a gene is observed at a moderate expression level in one cell but is not detected in another cell (Kharchenko, 2014).\n\nIn both cases the discrepancies are introduced due to low starting amounts of transcripts since the RNA comes from one cell only. Improving the transcript capture efficiency and reducing the amplification bias are currently active areas of research.
