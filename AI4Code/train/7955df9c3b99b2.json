It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.\n\nPython is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.\n\n---\n## Reason for increasing popularity\n1. Emphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing\n2. Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages such as C++ or Java.\n1. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.\n2. There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.\n1. Philosophy is \u201cSimplicity is the best\u201d.\n\n----\n## Python in Data Science\nThe programming requirements of data science demands a very versatile yet flexible language which is simple to write the code but can handle highly complex mathematical processing. Python is most suited for such requirements as it has already established itself both as a language for general computing as well as scientific computing. More over it is being continuously upgraded in form of new addition to its plethora of libraries aimed at different programming requirements. Below we will discuss such features of python which makes it the preferred language for data science.\n\n1. A simple and easy to learn language which achieves result in fewer lines of code than other similar languages like __R__. Its simplicity also makes it robust to handle complex scenarios with minimal code and much less confusion on the general flow of the program.\n2. It is cross platform, so the _same code works in multiple environments_ without needing any change. That makes it perfect to be used in a multi-environment setup easily.\n1. It _executes faster_ than other similar languages used for data analysis like __R__ and __MATLAB__.\n2. Its _excellent memory management_ capability, especially garbage collection makes it versatile in gracefully managing very large volume of data transformation, slicing, dicing and visualization.\n1. Most importantly Python has got a _very large collection of libraries_ which serve as special purpose analysis tools. For example \u2013 the __NumPy__ package deals with scientific computing and its array needs much less memory than the conventional python list for managing numeric data. And the number of such packages is continuously growing.\n2. Python has packages which can directly use the code from other languages like __Java__ or __C__. This helps in optimizing the code performance by using existing code of other languages, whenever it gives a better result.\n\n\n**Now, Let's code!! :)**\n\n---","f0b9f20e":"## Arithmetic Operators","f64e02ab":"Python comes loaded with pre-built functions","25344a94":"| Symbol | Task Performed |\n|----|---|\n| +  | Addition |\n| -  | Subtraction |\n| \/  | division |\n| %  | mod |\n| *  | multiplication |\n| \/\/  | floor division |\n| **  | to the power of |","5143f9ef":"Floor division is nothing but converting the result so obtained to the nearest integer.","25f530e9":"**round( )** function rounds the input value to a specified number of places or to the nearest integer.
