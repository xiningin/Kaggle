The field has seen significant progress in recent years, resulting in several antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)\u2013based therapies in development. Most mutations cause disease through a gain-of-function (GOF) mechanism, although some less common variants also involve loss of function (LOF). ALS-causing mutations can also be located in non-coding portions of the genome. More common variants including SOD1, C9ORF72, and TDP-43, as well as less common forms, are discussed. The authors emphasize the need to consider both GOF and LOF mechanisms.\nhttps:\/\/www.practiceupdate.com\/content\/implications-for-future-therapies-in-als\/110822\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S089662732030653X","c8b5e645":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Adult-Onset ALS Genes Transmitted as Mendelian Traits<\/span>**\n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Genes Implicated in Disturbances of Protein Homeostasis<\/span>**\n\nSuperoxide Dismutase\n\n\"The first ALS gene, cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), was identified in 1993. In most families harboring SOD1 gene mutations, disease penetrance is >90% by age 70. More than 170 mutations have now been detected in the SOD1 gene in fALS; together these account for \u223c20% of fALS cases. Almost all of these mutations are missense changes, scattered across the coding sequence without focal mutation hotspots. A few mutations truncate the terminal segment of the SOD1 protein; none of the ALS-related mutations in SOD1 are predicted to eliminate production of the protein. This strongly suggests that the mutant protein must be present to initiate motor neuron death.\"\n\n\"Protein homeostasis is disturbed in ALS. Many ALS genes highlight loss of protein quality control as a central feature of the disease. Misfolding of proteins may reflect many factors including aberrant folding and quality control at the ER (disturbed ER-associated degradation or ERAD), inherent instability due to mutations, aggregation during residence in stress granules, or imperfect clearance via proteasomes or autophagy. Self-assembly of misfolded proteins may lead to propagated instability and prion-like spreading of pathology.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5932579\/","922f8813":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Genotyping of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Samples<\/h1>","0d0c9767":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">C9orf72 and the Care of the Patient With ALS or FTD<\/h1>\n\nCitation: C9orf72 and the Care of the Patient With ALS or FTD - Progress and Recommendations After 10 Years\nJennifer Roggenbuck\nNeurol Genet Feb 2021, 7 (1) e542; DOI: 10.1212\/NXG.0000000000000542\n\n\"Most patients with the C9orf72 HRE (hexanucleotide repeat expansion) present clinically with ALS or behavioral variant FTD, or a combination of both. The spectrum of phenotypes includes rapidly and slowly progressive disease, and clinical presentations may differ from classic ALS or FTD. In families, the C9orf72 HRE is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, with age-dependent and incomplete penetrance. Age at onset and presenting symptomotology is variable, even among members of the same family. Notably, some individuals with a HRE in the clearly pathogenic range remain symptom free, even in old age. The C9orf72 HRE is by far the most common known genetic cause of ALS and FTD, far exceeding the prevalence of pathogenic variants in any other gene, although frequencies vary greatly by geoancestry. The highest HRE frequencies are observed in Europe, reported in 40% of familial and 6% of sporadic cases of ALS and in 18% of familial and 6% of sporadic cases of FTD in European patient cohorts. The HRE is rarely found in Asia.\"\n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Unanswered Questions Regarding Disease Expression<\/span>**\n\n\"When patients with C9orf72 HRE (hexanucleotide repeat expansion) present with symptoms of motor neuron disease, the phenotype is often indistinguishable from classic ALS. Although the most common cognitive phenotype is behavioral variant FTD, a range of cognitive-behavioral presentations are observed, including psychotic features such as delusions and hallucinations. Patients presenting with neuropsychiatric changes may not be recognized and diagnosed with C9orf72-related disease. Repeat number has not been robustly shown to correlate with age at onset, disease duration, or clinical presentation (ALS and\/or FTD), although this remains an active area of investigation.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/ng.neurology.org\/content\/7\/1\/e542","9e34ec70":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Conclusion<\/span>**\n\n\"The rate of discovery of genetic variables that play a role in ALS pathogenesis will only increase. Full exome sequencing is now the standard in most gene searches. This permits several predictions. First, the remaining, rare causes of Mendelian ALS will likely all be defined. It will be feasible to study the role in ALS of epistasis the interactions between multiple genes that each heighten disease susceptibility but cannot initiate pathogenesis alone.\" \n\n\"There are already several reports of oligogenic ALS cases, in which more than one ALS-related gene variant has been detected in the same individual. As a corollary, it seems likely that an increasing fraction of apparently sALS cases will prove to be a consequence of multiple gene variants that are not individually penetrant. It is already apparent that first-degree relatives of ALS patients have an increased incidence compared with unrelated ones. Finally, improved knowledge of genetic variants and their related pathways to neurodegeneration will improve our capacity to define interactions between genetic topology and the environment (e.g., environmental toxins or elements within the microbiome).\n\n\"Perhaps most important, as the understanding of ALS genetics is refined, opportunities for developing meaningful therapies will improve. In part, this may be a direct consequence of improved methods to attenuate expression and toxicity of mutant ALS genes.\"\n\n\"Indirectly, one anticipates that it will be increasingly possible to stratify and personalize therapeutic approaches and trials based on molecular distinctions between subsets of ALS cases.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5932579\/","130430a3":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Phenotypic Spectrum of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genetics<\/span>**\n\n\"The phenotypic spectrum of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) genetics.

TDP-43, a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein or hnRNP, is predominantly nuclear, but shuttles into the cytoplasm and axons during cellular stress. Mutations in the TDP-43 gene account for \u223c5% of fALS cases. In both ALS and FTD, TDP-43 accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it is cleaved and hyperphosphorylated; C-terminal fragments accumulate in insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates. These aggregates are present in both sALS and fALS.

Childhood ALS caused by FUS mutations is associated with basophilic inclusions in the spinal cord.\"\n\nhnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1\n\n\"The mutations in these genes augment the propensity for the low complexity domains to interact with other proteins and thus for the mutant proteins to induce propagated, prion-like misfolding.

The evolving understanding of the genetic architecture of ALS has illuminated broad themes in the molecular pathophysiology of both familial and sporadic ALS and FTD.\"\n\n\"These central themes encompass disturbances of protein homeostasis, alterations in the biology of RNA binding proteins, and defects in cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as numerous downstream pathophysiological events. Together, these findings from ALS genetics provide new insight into therapies that target genetically distinct subsets of ALS and FTD.\"\n\n\"At autopsy, degeneration of corticospinal (\u201cupper\u201d) and spinal and bulbar (\u201clower\u201d) motor neurons is often associated with activation of neuroimmune cells within the central nervous system (CNS) (microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendroglia)\"\n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Sporadic ALS (sALS) and familial ALS (fALS)<\/span>**\n\n\"Although most cases of ALS are sporadic (sALS), \u223c10% are familial (fALS), with autosomal dominant transmission.

Multiple genetic variants may interact simultaneously to increase ALS susceptibility; such oligogenic cases of ALS may not appear to be familial in a conventional Mendelian manner yet may underlie the apparently sporadic form of the disease.Analysis of pathways implicated by mutant ALS genes has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of both fALS and sALS, although, regrettably, this has not yet yielded definitive treatments.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5932579\/"}}
