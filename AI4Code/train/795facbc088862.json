In this tuning technique, we simply build a model for every combination of various hyperparameters and evaluate each model. The model which gives the highest accuracy wins. The pattern followed here is similar to the grid, where all the values are placed in the form of a matrix. Each set of parameters is taken into consideration and the accuracy is noted. Once all the combinations are evaluated, the model with the set of parameters which give the top accuracy is considered to be the best. \n\nRandom search is a technique where random combinations of the hyperparameters are used to find the best solution for the built model. The drawback of random search is that it yields high variance during computing. Since the selection of parameters is completely random; and since no intelligence is used to sample these combinations, luck plays its part.\n\nIf the n_jobs parameter is given -1, the computer will spend all its power on the process and the time will be shortened.","0dc729a8":"I think the make_pipeline method has a much easier syntax than the pipeline method.
