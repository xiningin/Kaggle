It works in a similar fashion as convolution. It just extracts windows from the input feature and outputs the maximum value of the elements under that window. You will see how it reduces the feature maps which in turn reduces the number of parameters.\n\n- Flattening: After we apply pooling, we are going to flatten the 3-dimensional pooled feature map to a 1D array. The reason for this is we want to input it to an artificial neural network\/ dense layer for further processing.\n\n\n- Dropout layer: Dropout layer let the model randomly drop a fraction of the units during forward or backward pass. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. Although I've already added dropouts, but the percentage of units we drop after each layer can be changed to see what works best.\n     - Things to keep in mind is, dropping out too many units will take higher number of epochs for the model to learn.\n     - However, the time taken for each epoch will decrease as there are less units to process.\n","dc58836c":"#### Fit our model to training features and corresponding labels","86260ca0":"#### What is Convolution?\n\nA convolution is an operation that basically represents how the shape of one function is modified by the other. In CNN, we use kernels or feature detectors which act as a filter to our initial input. These filters are usually of 3x3 or 5x5 sizes and slide over our 3D input, stopping at every possible location and extracting features to produce the feature map. \n\n\n\n$$(f*g)(t)\\;\\triangleq\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau)\\;g(t-\\tau) \\;d\\tau$$ \n\n\nThe convolution works by element wise multiplication of the kernel and the 3D input as it passes over it and sums it all to give 1 value of the output feature map, thus reducing the size of input matrix.\n\nWe pass a number of feature detectors to the convolution layer, each of them producing a different output by retaining information from different parts of the image. This is called the depth of the output feature map. \n\nUnlike the densely connected layer a convolution layer can learn feature irrespective of its position in the image. For instance, after learning a certain pattern at the lower right corner of the image, a covnet can recognise it anywhere. Where as a densely connected layer has to learn the same pattern at the new location in order to recognise it. \n\nThe reason covnets are so popular for computer vision is because they preserve the spatial hierarchies of patterns. The layers start learning from small patterns like edges, and then the next layer will learn something bigger based on the output of first layer.\n\nConvolution work on 3D tensor, width, height and depth of the image. A tensor is simple a multi dimensional array. A matrix can be classified as a order 2 tensor. Since we are using grayscale images hence the depth will be 1. In case of colour image, the depth will be 3 because of the rbg scale. In case you ever need to work with Videos, an additional dimension, frame rate would make it a 4D tensor.\n\nLet's see how a convolution filter works.","6f6d56ab":"Since the training accuracy was not too high on my local, I didn't mind running it 25 epochs and got an accuracy of 99.72%. However let's visualise how our accuracies and losses varry with number of epochs.","1178a549":"Now since we are doing multi-class classification, we have to `one hot encode` our labels to be able to pass it through our model.\nAlso, we are going to `normalise` the training data between 0 and 1. Since each pixel is represented by an 8-bit value that ranges from `0` to `255`, simply dividing the feature maps by 255 will get the job done. This is because NN prefer to deal with small input values and would converge faster.","b8473d7f":"I am going to compile my model with `adam` optimizer as i think it is working better than `RMSprop` for me."}}
