Create a `Series` whose index is a `MultiIndex`of `{country, variety}` pairs. For example, a pinot noir produced in the US should map to `{\"US\", \"Pinot Noir\"}`. Sort the values in the `Series` in descending order based on wine count.","bcafe1eb":"# Introduction\nMaps allow us to transform data in a `DataFrame` or `Series` one value at a time for an entire column. However, often we want to group our data, and then do something specific to the group the data is in. We do this with the `groupby` operation.\n\nIn these exercises we'll apply groupwise analysis to our dataset.\n\n# Relevant Resources\n- [**Grouping Reference and Examples**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/grouping-and-sorting-reference).  \n- [Pandas cheat sheet](https:\/\/github.com\/pandas-dev\/pandas\/blob\/master\/doc\/cheatsheet\/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)","e5a14569":"**Exercise 4**: What are the most expensive wine varieties? Create a variable `sorted_varieties` containing a copy of the dataframe from the previous question where varieties are sorted in descending order based on minimum price, then on maximum price (to break ties).","8c4a6f28":"**Exercise 2**: What is the best wine I can buy for a given amount of money? Create a `Series` whose index is wine prices and whose values is the maximum number of points a wine costing that much was given in a review. Sort the values by price, ascending (so that `4.0` dollars is at the top and `3300.0` dollars is at the bottom)."}}
