The number of neighbors is the core deciding factor. K is generally an odd number if the number of classes is 2. When K=1, then the algorithm is known as the nearest neighbor algorithm. This is the simplest case. Suppose P1 is the point, for which label needs to predict. First, you find the one closest point to P1 and then the label of the nearest point assigned to P1.\n![](http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dyd911kmh\/image\/upload\/f_auto,q_auto:best\/v1531424125\/Knn_k1_z96jba.png)\n\nSuppose P1 is the point, for which label needs to predict. First, you find the k closest point to P1 and then classify points by majority vote of its k neighbors. Each object votes for their class and the class with the most votes is taken as the prediction. For finding closest similar points, you find the distance between points using distance measures such as Euclidean distance, Hamming distance, Manhattan distance and Minkowski distance.

An underlying C++ codebase combined with a Python interface sitting on top makes for an extremely powerful yet easy to implement package.\nThe performance of XGBoost is no joke \u2014 it\u2019s become the go-to library for winning many Kaggle competitions. Its gradient boosting implementation is second to none and there\u2019s only more to come as the library continues to garner praise.\nIn this post we\u2019re going to go through the basics of the XGBoost library. We\u2019ll start with a practical explanation of how gradient boosting actually works and then go through a Python example of how XGBoost makes it oh-so quick and easy to do it.\n# 1-Boosting Trees\nWith a regular machine learning model, like a decision tree, we\u2019d simply train a single model on our dataset and use that for prediction. We might play around with the parameters for a bit or augment the data, but in the end we are still using a single model. Even if we build an ensemble, all of the models are trained and applied to our data separately.\n**Boosting, on the other hand**, takes a more iterative approach. It\u2019s still technically an ensemble technique in that many models are combined together to perform the final one, but takes a more clever approach.\nRather than training all of the models in isolation of one another, boosting trains models in succession, with each new model being trained to correct the errors made by the previous ones. Models are added sequentially until no further improvements can be made.\nThe advantage of this iterative approach is that the new models being added are focused on correcting the mistakes which were caused by other models. In a standard ensemble method where models are trained in isolation, all of the models might simply end up making the same mistakes!\n**Gradient Boosting** specifically is an approach where new models are trained to predict the residuals (i.e errors) of prior models. I\u2019ve outlined the approach in the diagram below.\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/519\/1*A9myadIB_CqJv-EJA-G_bA.png)\n","b5bea332":"We have 11 Columns;\n* Age: Person's Age\n* Sex: The person's Sex (1= Male 0= Female)\n* cp: Chest pain degrees(1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain,  4: asymptomatic)\n* testbps: Resting Blood pressure(mmHg)\n* Chol:  person's cholesterol in mg\/dl\n* fbs:  person's  blood sugar (> 120 mg\/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)\n* restecg: Resting electrocardiographic (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)\n* thalach: person's maximum heart rate \n* exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n* oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot.

This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one.\n\nLogistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression[1] (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression). Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass\/fail which is represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled \"0\" and \"1\". In the logistic model, the log-odds (the logarithm of the odds) for the value labeled \"1\" is a linear combination of one or more independent variables (\"predictors\"); the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value). The corresponding probability of the value labeled \"1\" can vary between 0 (certainly the value \"0\") and 1 (certainly the value \"1\"), hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name. The unit of measurement for the log-odds scale is called a logit, from logistic unit, hence the alternative names. Analogous models with a different sigmoid function instead of the logistic function can also be used, such as the probit model; the defining characteristic of the logistic model is that increasing one of the independent variables multiplicatively scales the odds of the given outcome at a constant rate, with each independent variable having its own parameter; for a binary dependent variable this generalizes the odds ratio.\n\nIn a binary logistic regression model, the dependent variable has two levels (categorical). Outputs with more than two values are modeled by multinomial logistic regression and, if the multiple categories are ordered, by ordinal logistic regression (for example the proportional odds ordinal logistic model[2]). The logistic regression model itself simply models probability of output in terms of input and does not perform statistical classification (it is not a classifier), though it can be used to make a classifier, for instance by choosing a cutoff value and classifying inputs with probability greater than the cutoff as one class, below the cutoff as the other; this is a common way to make a binary classifier. The coefficients are generally not computed by a closed-form expression, unlike linear least squares; see \u00a7 Model fitting.[](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Logistic_regression#:~:text=Logistic%20regression%20is%20a%20statistical,a%20form%20of%20binary%20regression).)\n\nIn Data Science we can also create a model 2 methods; first is manual,second is Sckit learn\nSckit learn is the easiest way to get accuracy (\"less code, more efficient work\")\nlet's use both methods","3cb2cc50":"Let's Check a head","6b53e2b1":"Using model with sckitlearn\n","531ab644":"<a id = \"1\"><\/a>\n# Introduction\nAccording to the columns, we have a data set that shows whether individuals have heart disease.

So when growing on the same leaf in Light GBM, the leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than the level-wise algorithm and hence results in much better accuracy which can rarely be achieved by any of the existing boosting algorithms. Also, it is surprisingly very fast, hence the word \u2018Light\u2019.\n\nBefore is a diagrammatic representation by the makers of the Light GBM to explain the difference clearly.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/11194110\/leaf.png)\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/11194227\/depth.png)\n\nLeaf wise tree growth in Light GBM.\n\nLeaf wise splits lead to increase in complexity and may lead to overfitting and it can be overcome by specifying another parameter max-depth which specifies the depth to which splitting will occur.\n\nBelow, we will see the steps to install Light GBM and run a model using it. We will be comparing the results with XGBOOST results to prove that you should take Light GBM in a \u2018LIGHT MANNER\u2019.\n\nLet us look at some of the advantages of Light GBM.\n"}}
