There are quite weak but positive correlations between units_sold and other merchant variables. \n2. Looking at the first lineplot, interestingly, in the range of the number of units sold between about 35k and 65k, the products without a merchant profile have a higher mean of merchant rating than the products with a merchant profile. Except for this range, it can conclude that customers prefer a product with a merchant profile on, as it assumably provides them with some credibility of the merchant.\n3. In the last lineplot, it is observable that there is positive correlation between units_sold and merchant_rating_count, meaning the more merchant ratings a product has, the better the product sells. In addition, a product with a good rating, more than 4 stars, tends to have much more merchant ratings as its sales go up.","ff9916a5":"### 1.

So, it is necessary to replace these values in rating_count column with 0.","0589d468":"Observations\n\n1. Looking at the barchart, there exists correlation between product sales and each rating level. As the range of the number of units sold goes up, the proportion of each rating level increases as well, meaning a product that has a good rating, more than rating 4, sells well. \n2. Noticeably, as a product sells well, a poor rating, less than rating 2, also increases accordingly even if its increase is smaller than that of other rating levels, such as rating 4 or 5.\n3. It is assumable that the reason why the range of more than 50k in units sold has much fewer values compared to other range categories is that there might have not been rating evaluation given from customers. However, since the rating 4 and 5 take more than half of the chart, it can conclude that the higher the rating is, the better the product sells.\n4. In the scatterplot, the tendency of the positive association can be observed, which means as a product that has a good rating, defined as more than rating 4, sells well and has a much larger total number of ratings.","885601b2":"Looking at the missing value matrix, there seems to be correlation among rating_#_count and between has_urgency_banner and urgency_text.

The variable price is normally distributed and the majority of values range between 0 and 20.\n2. The variable retail_price is severely right skewed and the majority of values range between 0 and 25, having  much larger variance compared to price.\n3. From the KDE plot and ECDF, it is clear that about 30% of retail_price values widely range bewteen about 25 and 250 compared to 30% of price values ranging between about 12.5 and 25.\n4. In the violinplot, the majority of values of shipping_option_price range between 1 and 3, which indicates potential correlation with product sales.\n5. Surprisingly, none of price variables show strong correlation with units_sold. Rather, there is strong positive correlation between price and shipping price, 0.87, and weak positive correlation between price and retail price, 0.31.\n\nInspiration\n1. Since the price is the actual price for customers to pay and the retail price is the reference price from other stores or websites, a product sells more as the difference between those two price gets bigger?\n2. How do these prices relate to the number of unit sold?","e4966fcf":"#### 2) Variable selection","ca2b137f":"The main goal here is to carry out a graphical univariate or multivariate analysis between major predictor variables and bewteen response variable; units_sold and other predictor variables.","6d67ecf6":"Observations\n\n1. In the pointplot, a point in each line indicates the mean of unit sold in each category. For example, the mean of product sold that has no urgency banner is about 4600. \n\n2. The line that connects two points in each line allows interaction to be judged by its slope. There is an interaction between two levels. This interaction, however, just reveal an urgency banner has no effect on product sales. Because the product that has the urgency banner shows lower sales. \n\n3. Looking at the almost identical distribution of values at each level, it is confirmed again the urgency banner has no impact on product sales.","647b3fcc":"Observations\n\n1. Looking at the KDE plot, both lines almost overlap, meaning using ad boosts on a product does not significantly affect its sale. Whether a seller uses an ad boost or not, it does not lead to successful product sales.","ff3a439f":"Observations\n\n1. Unexpectedly, no correlation is found between product sales and all types of badges from the heatmap. The correlations found between badges_count and badge_local_product and between badges_count and badge_fast_shipping are not considered significant as badges_count is simply the sum of any badges a product has. \n\n2. This non-correlation can be found in the boxplots as well. The number of any badges a product has does not significantly affect the sale of product.","785cd1d0":"In the heatmap, a value near 1 means if one variable appears then the other variable is very likely to be present, meaning that if one variable appears in one of the rating_#_count columns, the other variable is highly likely to be present in the other rating_#_count.\n\nThe same interpretation applies to those two columns, has_urgency_banner and urgency_text.","35a756b3":"It seems that the value of 1 in has_urgency_banner means a product has an urgent text on it, which is either 'Limited Quantity!' or 'Discount on wholesale purchases'. Since both columns are higly related and convey the same information, it is desirable to delete the column, urgency_text.","22d7bce5":"### 2.
