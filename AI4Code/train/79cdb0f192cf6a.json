Don't forget that you can receive a hint!\n\nLuigi is trying to perform an analysis to determine the best items for winning races on the Mario Kart circuit. He has some data in the form of lists of dictionaries that look like...\n\n    [\n        {'name': 'Peach', 'items': ['green shell', 'banana', 'green shell',], 'finish': 3},\n        {'name': 'Bowser', 'items': ['green shell',], 'finish': 1},\n        # Sometimes the racer's name wasn't recorded\n        {'name': None, 'items': ['mushroom',], 'finish': 2},\n        {'name': 'Toad', 'items': ['green shell', 'mushroom'], 'finish': 1},\n    ]\n\n`'items'` is a list of all the power-up items the racer picked up in that race, and `'finish'` was their placement in the race (1 for first place, 3 for third, etc.).\n\nHe wrote the function below to take a list like this and return a dictionary mapping each item to how many times it was picked up by first-place finishers.","2ccf9a77":"However, when he tried running it on his full dataset, the program crashed with a `TypeError`.\n\nCan you guess why? Try running the code cell below to see the error message Luigi is getting. Once you've identified the bug, fix it in the cell below (so that it runs without any errors).\n\nHint: Luigi's bug is similar to one we encountered in the [tutorial](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/colinmorris\/working-with-external-libraries) when we talked about star imports.","f252cf5f":"As you can see, he's hit a bit of bad luck recently.

One thing we might want to do with this type is overload the comparison operators like `>` and `<=` so that we could use them to check whether one hand beats another. e.g. it'd be cool if we could do this:\n\n```python\n>>> hand1 = BlackjackHand(['K', 'A'])\n>>> hand2 = BlackjackHand(['7', '10', 'A'])\n>>> hand1 > hand2\nTrue\n```\n\nWell, we're not going to do all that in this question (defining custom classes is a bit beyond the scope of these lessons), but the code we're asking you to write in the function below is very similar to what we'd have to write if we were defining our own `BlackjackHand` class. (We'd put it in the `__gt__` magic method to define our custom behaviour for `>`.)\n\nFill in the body of the `blackjack_hand_greater_than` function according to the docstring.","cc209e55":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
