I didn't expect that. We already knew Friday was a low count day.\n\nOn Thursday barely anyone has dinner. Which makes sense I guess. Possibly only office goers going for lunch.\n\nBut on weekends, no is having lunch at all. What?\n\nWell as restaurent owner it definitely makes sense to get part-timers rather than full-timers to account for the customer rush at different times in different days.\n\nLets review the impact of gender paying the bill on the tips.\n\n**First of all how many counts of male and female payers are there?**","751e2e54":"Oh wow. Looks like there is indeed some difference.","ad8b29bb":"As expected, weekends are really popular time to visit a restaurent.\n\n\nWhy is there so few customers on Fridays though? I would have expected more customers as people may like to chill out in restaurents before weekend starts.\n\n**How does the bills and tips compare between different days?**","52a5a711":"So the weekend and the days running up to it. Well thats usually when the restaurents are populated.\n\n**How about an overview of the dataset?**","ae7682b4":"The \"tips\" dataset comes with the seaborn module.","5f2273ec":"No effect. Both male and female are ~~as stingy as other~~ paying similar amount w.r.t. total bill.\n\n**What about smokers?**","4e2789fd":"## First thoughts\n\nLooks like the data shows the total bill payed by a group going for lunch or dinner.\n\nAlso shows the tip payed. Is the tip also included in the total bill? It isn't! This is US data. Capitalism is king.\n\nThe sex is given. But does it represent who paid the bill or who recived it? Checked. The one who is paying.\n\nThe group size is also given, also if its a smoker group.\n\nDay is mentioned too. Wonder if all the days of the week is mentioned?","f0fdcf88":"So a lot more people went for dinner and also paid more for it than lunch.\n\n**What is the relationship between total bill and the respective tip given?**","7f7d1145":"Larger groups pays more and also tips more.\n\n**Lets explore relationship of date with respective to tips given.**\n\n**How many payments are there for each day?**","228d8464":"**How many days of the week is in the dataset?**","4c17ee6b":"# Explore Tips Dataset\n\nIn this notebook, we will be exploring the \"Tips\" dataset using the data visualization library \"Seaborn\".\n\nLet's start by importing the seaborn library","a4d5ef75":"There does not seem to be major difference in the tip given based on time. For average bill amount, the tip given for dinner is slightly higher than that in lunch.\n\nSo servers in certain time slot are not actually missing out.\n\n**I wonder how the group size affects the situation.**","86e81899":"Looks like the most of the bill between 10 - 25 dollars.\n\nWonder how the distribution differs between time.\n\n**Actually how many time values are there?**","d29f13a8":"Looks like non-smoker group, gives a better tip.\n\n**Hmm. Does smokers like to come in a group or alone? Also which days do they prefer?**","853e54c1":"Well. Interesting is that on Thursday and Friday, the count of male and female bill payers are the same. Quite different from weekends. My hypothesis is that these are mostly office people on weekdays, paying their own bills and collegues.\n\n**Does gender have any effect on tips?**","a51db9ea":"So we are dealing with 244 entries. Pretty small dataset, great for exersize.\n\nAlso no null values, that's great news!\n\n**Lets see the distribution of total bills**","12b4ee9c":"The tip amount rises as the total bill amount rises. Makes sense.\n\nWonder how tips compare with time?\n\n**Compare tip vs total bill between lunch and dinner time**","a764b773":"Check the head of the dataset to have an overview of snapshot of dataset loaded.","f22274bd":"Looks like weekends are a nice time for larger groups e.g. family especially on Sunday.\n\nNice day to get some large tips...","116eba76":"Nothing to see here, smokers come with all size groups and days.","cd1e36ce":"Looks like there are lot more male bill payers.\n\n**How is sex distribution across days?**","b20e5814":"## Conclusion\n\nFor restaurent servers, weekends are the best days to get nice tips. Serving larger groups nicely may bring great benefits.\n\nFor restaurent owners, really need to be flexible with employee time as certain days and timeslots may be busier than others. Part-timer employees will be more preferable to allow for the flexibility.","33bf54fd":"Looks like the weekends are a safe bet to recive larger tips as people frequent often to restaurent and spend large amount.\n\n**Wonder how group sizes differ between days?**","7f1412dc":"**Lets see how the distribution varies between lunch and dinner:**"}}
