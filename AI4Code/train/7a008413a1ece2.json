The conservation reported that 71% of the nation's population had at least one dose of a vaccine while 62% have been fully vaccinated. However, there has been a recent spike in cases starting in the beginning of second week of May 2021, with 37% of new cases and 20% of hospitalised cases are those being fully vaccinated. Altough to date, total number of cases in Seychelles is only 9762 (rank 155th out of 220 countroes), relative to its population - 97,625, the rate of total COVID cases is almost 10% of the entire population. \n\nOn this article, C. Raina MacIntyre, a professor of Global Biosecurity at UNSW argued some possible reasons behind this recent surge:\n1. The herd immunity has not been reached; which is possibly due to inadequate efficacy of two vaccines being used (Sinopharm and AstraZeneca).\n2. New COVID variants such as B1617 Indian varian have emerged and spread in Seychelles.\n3. Failures in logistics i.e. failures to keep temperature at proper level during transport and storage of the vaccines, which may have rendered vaccine efficacy.\n\nIn response to this recent outbreak, the government has had to reimpose curbs similar to those imposed the last time at the end of 2020 before vaccination started in the beginning of 2021. The country has closed schools and cancelled sporting activities. The measures also include early closure of bars and bans on the minging of households. At the global level, researchers and scientists have tried to investigate what set Seychelles apart from the rest of countries with high vaccination rates, such as the UK where cases are down 96% with AstraZeneca vaccines and Israel where new cases declined by 99%.\n\nSource:\n1. https:\/\/theconversation.com\/covid-is-surging-in-the-worlds-most-vaccinated-country-why-160869\n2. https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-05-04\/world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-reintroduces-curbs-as-cases-surge","a48d9d06":"# Analyses","56be67fa":"# Improved Visualisation\nUsing iplot and plotly"}}
