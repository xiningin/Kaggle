However, the input dataset is too tiny to train even a low capacity model like ResNet34 from scratch. Therefore, I replace the first convolution layer from 7x7 3->64 to 7x7 **4->64** while keeping weights from 3->64. As suggested by @[Skylum] OleksandrSavsunenko in comments, the weights for the last channel can be initialized with values from other channels (the model requires substantial retraining in any case). Also, as @Artyom Palvelev pinted out, the weights should not be set to zero.","e6ac5468":"### Model","5c758632":"### Overview\nThe goal of this competition is classification of mixed protein patterns. However, unlike most image labeling tasks, where binary or multiclass labeling is considered, in this competition each image can have multiple labels. Multiclass multilabel task has its own specific affecting the design of the model and the loss function. Moreover, the classified images are quite different from ImageNet; therefore, despite usage of a pretrained model is quite helpful, a substantial retraining of entire model is needed. An additional challenge is 4-chanel input to the model (RGBY), which is different from ones used in most of pretrained models (RGB input).\n\nIn this kernel I will show how to handle the above challenges and get started with this competition. I will begin with using a light ResNet34 model and low-resolution images to have a baseline that can be used later to select higher end models and explore the effect of image resolution on the prediction accuracy. **The validation F1 score of the model is ~0.65-0.7**, and I was able to get 0.460 public LB score in V11 of the kernel (0.453 after reset of the LB). Though reuslts are slightly different from one run to another because F1 macro metric is unstable, and sevral items of rear classes contribute in the same way as as thousands items of common classes, 1\/28.\n\nThe problem of low public LB score of the model, which mentioned in the first versions of the kernel, is resulted by a bug in the evaluation metric (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/human-protein-atlas-image-classification\/discussion\/69366#409041) that relies on the order of records in the submission file rather than IDs.","8c13e070":"**It is very important to keep the same order of ids as in the sample submission** https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/human-protein-atlas-image-classification\/discussion\/69366#409041 since the competition metric relies only on the order of recods ignoring IDs.","f9707aee":"Computing image statistics in the train set.

First, the SOFTMAX MUST NOT BE USED as an output layer because it encourages a single label prediction. The common output function for multilabel tasks is sigmoid. However, combining the sigmoid with the loss function (like in BCE with logits loss or in Focal loss used in this kernel) allows log(sigmoid) optimization of the numerical stability of the loss function. Therefore, sigmoid is also removed.","2c17123e":"### Loss function and metrics","598ccc30":"I begin with finding the optimal learning rate. The following function runs training with different lr and records the loss. Increase of the loss indicates onset of divergence of training. The optimal lr lies in the vicinity of the minimum of the curve but before the onset of divergence. Based on the following plot, for the current setup the divergence starts at ~0.05, and the recommended learning rate is ~0.005.","e4a5e0e2":"Next, I unfreeze all weights and allow training of entire model. One trick that I use is differential learning rate: the lr of the head part is still lr, while the middle layers of the model are trained with lr\/3, and the base is trained with even smaller lr\/10. Despite the low-level detectors do not vary much from one image data set to another much, the yellow channel should be trained, and also the images are quite different from ImageNet; therefore, the I decrease the learning rate for first layers only by 10 times. If there was no necessity to train an additional channel and the images were more similar to ImageNet, the learning rates could be [lr\/100,lr\/10,lr]. Another trick is learning rate annealing. Periodic lr increase followed by slow decrease drives the system out of steep minima (when lr is high) towards broader ones (which are explored when lr decreases) that enhances the ability of the model to generalize and reduces overfitting. The length of the cycles gradually increases during training. ","2fd577ec":"First, I train only the head of the model while keeping the rest frozen. It allows to avoid corruption of the pretrained weights at the initial stage of training due to random initialization of the head layers. So the power of transfer learning is fully utilized when the training is continued. **When you check F1 macro metric, look at \"F1 macro: XXX\"** before the epoch number, which shows the result calculated for entire val dataset.","6d72705f":"### Data","6bc61ebd":"### Training","d3863ab3":"One of the challenges of this competition is strong data imbalance. Some classes, like \"Nucleoplasm\", are very common, while there is a number of rare classes, like \"Endosomes\", \"Lysosomes\", and \"Rods & rings\". In addition, in tasks of multiclass, and especially in multilabel, classification there is always an issue with data imbalance: if you predict 1 class out of 10, given the same number of examples per each class, you have 1 positive vs. 9 negative examples. So, it is crucial to use a loss function that accounts for it. Recently proposed focal loss (https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1708.02002.pdf) has revolutionized one stage object localization method in 2017. It is design to address the issue of strong data imbalance, demonstrating amazing results on datasets with imbalance level 1:10-1000. In particular, it works quite well for image segmentation task in \"Airbus Ship Detection Challenge\": https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iafoss\/unet34-dice-0-87 .
