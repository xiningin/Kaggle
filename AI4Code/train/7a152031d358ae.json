Average podium numbers may seem low here because Vettel's teammate Mark Webber has not been able to show the same high performance. We know that with the rise of Red Bull's graphic and the fall of the team, they started to rise again in 2019 - 2020 and they are the only team that can challenge Mercedes. In Ferrari, the situation is no different. Between 2000 and 2006, we see a Ferrari dominance with the legendary pilot Schumacher, but after that, the situation is not very pleasant. After Schumacher, the team, which only won the championship with Raikonen in 2007, completely broke away from the leadership race. In 2020, they are having a bad season with their disappointing car, the SF1000.
