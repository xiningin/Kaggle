Non-Linear Models**\n\nIf we are looking to obtain a score better than 0.97, we ought to try out non-linear models. We could have used polynomial regression with regularization but because there are so many parameters to start with, it is not quite sensible. Let us try nearest neigbors and neural networks. \n","7479a3c0":"From the above output, it is clear that the generalization for the linear model is \nhorrible, despite managing quite a good training score. It is a bit surprising that a **linear** model has overfit so dramatically -- must be a high-dimension quirk. Let us try using regularization on the linear model. **One obvious thing is that the regularized model will not result in an R^2 better than 0.97 (in and out of sample) as, by definition, the regularized model has more bias than the linear one. **","d7d58114":"**1. Preparing Data**","16b93cc9":"**4. Final Model**\n\nBest model seems be the nearest neighbors model with n_neighbors = 3, followed closely by the neural network model. We can thus train this model on the full training data i.e., without the validation split, and have it ready for future use.","688000c1":"**2. Linear Models**","ee3a0035":"In this notebook, we try to solve the regression problem of atomic ground state energies using linear and non-linear methods.  These methods are trained without implementing any feature selection, as the problem of minimizing R^2 seems to be more important than interpretability. \n\nContents: 1. Data Preparation 2.
