Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car How well those variables describe the price of a car Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the Americal market.\n\n> ### <font color=blue>Business Goal\n\nYou are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.\n\n> ### <font color=blue>Data Preparation\n\nThere is a variable named CarName which is comprised of two parts - the first word is the name of 'car company' and the second is the 'car model'. For example, chevrolet impala has 'chevrolet' as the car company name and 'impala' as the car model name. You need to consider only company name as the independent variable for model building.\n\n> ### <font color=blue>Model Evaluation:\n\nWhen you're done with model building and residual analysis, and have made predictions on the test set, just make sure you use the following two lines of code to calculate the R-squared score on the test set.\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score r2_score(y_test, y_pred) where y_test is the test data set for the target variable, and y_pred is the variable containing the predicted values of the target variable on the test set.\n\nPlease don't forget to perform this step as the R-squared score on the test set holds some marks. The variable names inside the 'r2_score' function can be different based on the variable names you have chosen.","321b4b0a":"> ### <font color=red>Drop the boreratio as high p value","33cdb36e":"> ### <font color=red>No high pvalues so checking VIF value","b7dbc4ca":"# Model Evaluation","ce398182":"> ### <font color=red>As the R_squared value on test set is 80%, it is a pretty good LinearRegression model and we can use this to predict the car price for Geely motors.\n\n> ### <font color=red>Therefore our model is \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52= -0.1286 + 1.4493enginesize - 0.1181enginetype_ohcv - 0.3495#ofCylinder_twelve + 0.2840#ofCylinder_two","03c7b440":"> ### <font color=red>All features are acceptable for p-value, so calculate VIF","691e4f7e":"# Splitting data into train and test data set","fd0a2d53":"> ### <font color=red>Drop the cylindernumber_three as high p value","3fbb0d24":"> ### <font color=red>As no values are high p-values, so checeking VIF","6c493e05":"> ### <font color=red>High VIF so remove \"enginetype_rotor\"","003730a7":"> ### <font color=red>company names  spellings are  wrong","f5f86c29":"> ### <font color=red>Drop the engine location from train data set as it has high p value"}}
