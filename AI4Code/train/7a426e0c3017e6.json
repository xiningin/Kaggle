There can be many reasons. From one account, students can access Meet, Docs, Forms, Sites, and Classroom. Google products help to achieve both accessibility and compatibility. Except that, the data prove migration from text-based learning through online resources to interactive learning through video conferencing as well as online text and video resources. \n\nWhat will be a trend for the future? We are getting used to reading from devices and talking through devices, and do not want to waste time in a car. Schools are open now and back to face-to-face learning, but some people may say that they prefer online learning since it is convenient and timesaving. \n","24a7742d":"## *Which online learning platforms become more popular?*\n\nOnline learning has been increased before and after the school closing. Then, has the pandemic changed the way students learn? Does it make any changes on online platform products used for learning? Below shows which products were popular in each month.","2a6457a5":"The monthly *engagement_index* shown in the figure explains how many pages were accessed per one thousand students for every month regardless of products. Monthly *engagement_index* in one district may be far from each other, but the state averaged index for each state may not be very far from the national average. In Jan. & Feb. 2020 before the school closing, the *engagement_index* had already an increasing trend. In the middle of the school year, schools had to close their campuses, but they couldn't totally convert classes to an online interactive learning environment. They might try to maximize the usage of online materials rather than adopting new platforms since they didn't have enough time to completely switch to new platforms. \n\nAfter the summer break (Jun., Jul., Aug.), the *engagement_index* have definitely increased. The schools and districts had adopted new platforms and created new curriculums for online learning in the new school year. But in Nov. and Dec., the *engagement_index* has been decreased. It may be caused by Thanksgiving and Holidays breaks, or some schools like District 2 (Wisconsin) gave up using online learning platforms. \n\nThe districts in the figure do not follow the increasing trend. The gap between the two districts from one state (Wisconsin) is not negligible. Furthermore, due to the lack of information about districts and insufficient number of districts for each state, it is hard to conclude at state-level or district-level. Then, can we find some trends by products?\n","dae65c55":"The *pct_access*, the percentage of students who accessed to a certain product in a day, shows that **Google Docs** and **Google Classroom** are the most popular platforms except during the summer break. But even though they have high usages, they still reach only 20% students daily usage. Weekends and no school days definitely affect the percentage, but still 20% is much lower than expected. \n\nAs mentioned before, **YouTube** came up in the new school year, and **Zoom** and **Meet** have become much more popular. It seems that schools have utilized video resources and interactive video conferencing systems as an effort to imitate face-to-face teaching rather than text-based self-learning. \n\nBelow are the averaged *pct_access* and *engagement_index* of each platform except Google products.\n","e6c2e03f":"Before the school closing (Jan. & Feb.), the most popular learning systems were **Google products**. After the closing, still Google products are placed in high ranks, but **Zoom** became obviously more popular. During the summer break, **YouTube** became popular, but then even after the new school started, YouTube took a high rank. Schools might start to use various useful and fun video resources for education purposes, or students started to utilize the devices for their own fun. Students have a lot of freedom from teachers' observance during online learning, and some of them easily lose their self-control and could not resist from watching fun videos on their devices. **Schoology** might be adapted as one of the main learning platforms in the new year. **Epic!** definitely is a good source for kids to spend their time since libraries had limited hours or were closed. **Seesaw** became to be used for homework assignments.  \n\n","c211d3e3":"## *Online learning during pandemic*\n\nDuring the pandemic, most schools are closed. Some schools have been open, but adapted online learning even on campus to reduce contacts among students and between students and teachers. It is obvious that online learning engagement would be increased in 2020. But even before the school closed, many students had already used online learning. Probably online learning among students has increased as more students have their own devices and wireless connectivity has been improved. Luckily, they were very close to being ready to convert from in-person learning to online learning due to technology development. Then how much impact has pandemic caused on online learning?  \n","9fb292e5":"In terms of the number of pages opened daily per district, *engagement_index*, **Kahoot!**, **Flipgrid** and **Quizlet** are slightly less popular in the new year. That might be because more platforms were created and prepared to be used."}}
