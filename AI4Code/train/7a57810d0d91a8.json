Before we begin lets take a look at what a basic feedforward network looks like:\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/la4Rwn6.jpg)\nEach input from the input layer is fed up to each node in the hidden layer, and from there to each node on the output layer. We should note that there can be any number of nodes per layer and there are usually multiple hidden layers to pass through before ultimately reaching the output layer. Choosing the right number of nodes and layers is important later on when optimising the neural network to work well a given problem. As you can probably tell from the diagram, it's called a feedforward network because of how the signals are passed through the layers of the neural network in a single direction.

The perceptron weights can either amplify or deamplify the original input signal. For example, if the input is 1 and the input's weight is 0.2 the input will be decreased to 0.2. These weighted signals are then added together and passed into the activation function. The activation function is used to convert the input into a more useful output. There are many different types of activation function but one of the simplest would be step function. A step function will typically output a 1 if the input is higher than a certain threshold, otherwise it's output will be 0.","ba6f53a8":"## Feature Scaling","827d8235":"As we can see, there are 178 EEG features and 5 possible classes.

It is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Suppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a  p -dimensional vector (a list of  p  numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a  (p\u22121) -dimensional hyperplane.\n\nWhen data are not labeled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The clustering algorithm which provides an improvement to the support vector machines is called support vector clustering and is often used in industrial applications either when data are not labeled or when only some data are labeled as a preprocessing for a classification pass.\n\nIn the below code, SVC stands for Support Vector Classification.","285da0e3":"# 5.

Gaussian Naive Bayes\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HyPUqwF.png)\nNaive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.\n\nBayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes' theorem, a person's age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age.\n\nNaive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. It is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10 cm in diameter. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features.","4a30bc86":"# Linear SVM","ef0b4d2a":"# Discrete Wavelet Transform\nWavelet transform is more advantageous spectral analyze method than other  spectral analyze methods on non-stationary signals.
