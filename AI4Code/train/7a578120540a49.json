velocity (km\/s)\n* H0 = Hubble\u2019s Constant\n* d = Distance\n\n#### WHAT IS RADIAL VELOCITY\n\n* The radial velocity of an object with respect to a given point is the rate of change of the distance between the object and the point. That is, the radial velocity is the component of the object's velocity that points in the direction of the radius connecting the point and the object. In astronomy, the point is usually taken to be the observer on Earth, so the radial velocity then denotes the speed with which the object moves away from the Earth (or approaches it, for a negative radial velocity).\n\n#### WHAT IS REDSHIFT\n\n* In physics, a redshift is an increase in the wavelength, and corresponding decrease in the frequency and photon energy, of electromagnetic radiation (such as light). The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and simultaneous increase in frequency and energy, is known as a negative redshift, or blueshift. The terms derive from the colours red and blue which form the extremes of the visible light spectrum.\n\nIn astronomy and cosmology, the three main causes of electromagnetic redshift are\n\n* The radiation travels between objects which are moving apart (\"relativistic\" redshift, an example of the relativistic Doppler effect)\n* The radiation travels towards an object in a weaker gravitational potential, i.e. towards an object in less strongly curved (flatter) spacetime (gravitational redshift)\n* The radiation travels through expanding space (cosmological redshift). The observation that all sufficiently distant light sources show redshift corresponding to their distance from Earth is known as Hubble's law.\n\n* Recessional Velocity is the rate at which an extragalactic astronomical object recedes (becomes more distant) from an observer as a result of the expansion of the universe. It can be measured by observing the wavelength shifts of spectral lines emitted by the object, known as the object's cosmological redshift.\n\n* Peculiar Motion or Peculiar Velocity refers to the velocity of an object relative to a rest frame \u2014 usually a frame in which the average velocity of some objects is zero\n\nhttps:\/\/wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de\/~gamk\/TUM_Lectures\/Lecture3.pdf\n\n* 6 REDSHIFT: 1 BILLION YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n* 8 REDSHIFT: 700 MILLION YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n* 10 REDSHIFT: 500 MILLION YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n#### WHAT IS LUMINOSITY DISTANCE\n\n* Luminosity distance DL is defined in terms of the relationship between the absolute magnitude M and apparent magnitude m of an astronomical object.\n\n* Where DL is measured in parsecs. For nearby objects (say, in the Milky Way) the luminosity distance gives a good approximation to the natural notion of distance in Euclidean space.\n\n* The relation is less clear for distant objects like quasars far beyond the Milky Way since the apparent magnitude is affected by spacetime curvature, redshift, and time dilation. Calculating the relation between the apparent and actual luminosity of an object requires taking all of these factors into account. The object's actual luminosity is determined using the inverse-square law and the proportions of the object's apparent distance and luminosity distance.\n\n* Another way to express the luminosity distance is through the flux-luminosity relationship.\n\n#### Luminosity of a star:\n\n* Total energy output\n* independent of distance\n\n#### Apparent Brightness of a star depends upon:\n\n* distance\n* luminosity\n\n#### Intrinsic Luminosity:\n\n* Measures the Total Energy Output by the star in Watts\n* Distance Independent (it is a physical property of the star itself)\n\n#### Apparent Brightness:\n\n* Measures how bright the star appears to be as seen from a distance.\n* Depends on the distance to the star\n* The Apparent Brightness of a source is a consequence of geometry.

Closer = Brighter\n\nMove 2x closer to a light source, It will appear 22=4 times brighter.\n\n* Farther = Fainter\n\nMove 2x further away from a light source, It will appear 22=4 times fainter\n\n* The process of measuring the apparent brightnesses of objects is called Photometry.\n\n#### Two ways to express apparent brightness:\n\n* Stellar Magnitudes\n* Absolute Fluxes (energy per second per area)\n* Both are used interchangeably by astronomers\n\n#### The modern system of magnitudes defines them as follows:\n\n* 5 steps of magnitude = factor of 100 in brightness\n* Bigger magnitude = fainter star\n* The standard of brightness is the star Vega (0th magnitude)\n* Unlike the qualitative system of Hipparchus, the modern magnitude system defines the standard of brightness as the bright star Vega (brightest star in the summer constellation of Lyra), and precisely defines the interval of magnitude. This quantification was done in the 19th century and refined throughout the 20th century.\n\nExamples:\n\n* 10th mag star is 100x fainter than a 5th mag star.\n* 20th mag star is 10,000x fainter than a 10th mag star.\n* Faintest stars measured this far are ~30th magnitude.\n\n#### Count the photons received from a star using a light-sensitive detector:\n\n* Photographic Plates (old-school: 1880s to 1960s)\n* Photoelectric Photometer (photomultiplier tube: 1930s to 1990s)\n* Solid State Detector (e.g., photodiodes or CCDs)\n\n#### Measuring Luminosity\n\nTo measure the Luminosity of a star you need 2 measurements:\n\n* The Apparent Brightness (flux) measured via photometry, and the Distance to the star measured in some way together with the inverse square law of brightness, you can compute the Luminosity\n\nL = 4 \u03c0 d2 B\n\n* The biggest source of difficulty, as usual in Astronomy, is measuring the distance accurately\n* In practice, we can use sensitive electronic instruments and photometry to measure the apparent brightnesses of many hundreds of millions of stars. But, we have good distances (parallaxes) for only about 100,000 stars. Only that number of stars have direct estimates of their Luminosities. Since Luminosity depends on distance squared, small errors in distance are effectively doubled (a 10% distance gives a 20% luminosity).\n\n#### TOTAL MASS BIASES IN X-RAY GALAXY CLUSTERS\n\n* The exploitation of clusters of galaxies as cosmological probes relies on accurate measurements of their total gravitating mass. X-ray observations provide a powerful means of probing the total mass distribution in galaxy clusters, but might be affected by observational biases and rely on simplistic assumptions originating from our limited understanding of the intracluster medium physics.\n\n* Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structure known in the universe. According to the hierarchical clustering model of structure formation, they form by the gravitational collapse of the rare peaks of the primeval density field, on scales of the order of $\\sim$10 Mpc. Within this scenario their formation and evolution is a sensitive function of the cosmological matter density parameter $\\Omega_{{\\rm m}}$ and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\\sigma_{\\rm 8}$, where $\\sigma_{\\rm 8}$ is the rms linear fluctuation on scales $8 ~ h^{{\\rm -1}}$ Mpc.\n\n* Measurements of their evolution rate can be used to asses the growth in mass of such structures, thereby providing a powerful method to constrain the geometry and matter content of the universe (see Voit 2005, and references therein). Moreover, because of the spatial extent of the collapse scale, the cluster baryonic fraction $f_{{\\rm b}}$ is expected to be close to the cosmic value $\\Omega_{{\\rm b}}\/ \\Omega_{{\\rm m}}$. Measurements of $f_{{\\rm b}}$ at high redshifts can be used to derive constraints on the equation of state of the dark energy","750225bc":"#### PIVOT WAVELENGTH AND RMS BANDWIDTH OF THE PHOTMODE","bc10cd72":"### FULL HEADER READING","291806b7":"#### SUN AND MOON ANGLE","80e5b869":"### OBSERVATION IMAGE DETAIL","42780c66":"#### APERTURE REFERENCE","be975d15":"#### GALACTIC LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE (REFERENCE)","21b01032":"### FITS KEYWORDS","d97b7f46":"* Photometry involves measuring the brightness or flux of electromagnetic radiation from stars and other celestial objects.

All other things being equal, a telescope of larger primary mirror or lens is more sensitive than one with a smaller primary.\n\nThe more sensitive a telescope, the more light it can gather from faint objects. The more light gathered, the fainter the object (or the more distant for a given class of object) that can be studied photometrically or imaged.\n\nThe size of a primary mirror or lens is normally expressed in terms of its diameter. A simple phrase often used by astronomers is that of the light bucket. The bigger the bucket, the more light can be poured into it.\n\n* Zero Point\n\nIn astronomy, the Zero Point in a photometric system is defined as the magnitude of an object that produces 1 count per second on the detector. The zero point is used to calibrate a system to the standard magnitude system, as the flux detected from stars will vary from detector to detector\n\n* Pivot Wavelenght\n\nIf the wavelength unit is \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms, This can then be plugged into the equations above.

The galaxy is about 110,000 light-years across (about the size of the Milky Way at 100,000). It is a member of the Eridanus Cluster, a cluster of 200 galaxies. It was discovered by John Herschel in 1835\n\n![](https:\/\/stsci-opo.org\/STScI-01EVT8DJEDWP6XH4S8WZZB8FVB.png)\n\n* One of the largest Hubble Space Telescope images ever made of a complete galaxy is being unveiled today at the American Astronomical Society meeting in San Diego, Calif.\n\n* The Hubble telescope captured a display of starlight, glowing gas, and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust in this 4-foot-by-8-foot image of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1300. NGC 1300 is considered to be prototypical of barred spiral galaxies. Barred spirals differ from normal spiral galaxies in that the arms of the galaxy do not spiral all the way into the center, but are connected to the two ends of a straight bar of stars containing the nucleus at its center.\n\n* In the core of the larger spiral structure of NGC 1300, the nucleus shows its own extraordinary and distinct \"grand-design\" spiral structure that is about 3,300 light-years (1 kiloparsec) long. Only galaxies with large-scale bars appear to have these grand-design inner disks - a spiral within a spiral. Models suggest that the gas in a bar can be funneled inwards, and then spiral into the center through the grand-design disk, where it can potentially fuel a central black hole. NGC 1300 is not known to have an active nucleus, however, indicating either that there is no black hole, or that it is not accreting matter","27ace37d":"# PACKAGES AND LIBRARIES","32559016":"# FITS READING\n\n#### WHAT IS FITS FILES?\n\n* Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) is an open standard defining a digital file format useful for storage, transmission and processing of data: formatted as multi-dimensional arrays (for example a 2D image), or tables FITS is the most commonly used digital file format in astronomy. The FITS standard was designed specifically for astronomical data, and includes provisions such as describing photometric and spatial calibration information, together with image\n\n#### FITS IMAGES\n\n* The earliest and still most commonly used type of FITS data is an image header\/data block. The term 'image' is somewhat loosely applied, as the format supports data arrays of arbitrary dimension\u2014normal image data are usually 2-D or 3-D, with the third dimension representing for example time or the color plane. The data themselves may be in one of several integer and floating-point formats, specified in the header.\n\n* FITS image headers can contain information about one or more scientific coordinate systems that are overlaid on the image itself. Images contain an implicit Cartesian coordinate system that describes the location of each pixel in the image, but scientific uses usually require working in 'world' coordinates, for example the celestial coordinate system. As FITS has been generalized from its original form, the world coordinate system (WCS) specifications have become more and more sophisticated: early FITS images allowed a simple scaling factor to represent the size of the pixels; but recent versions of the standard permit multiple nonlinear coordinate systems, representing arbitrary distortions of the image. The WCS standard includes many different spherical projections, including, for example, the HEALPix spherical projection widely used in observing the cosmic microwave background radiation.","2a6f33af":"#### POSITION ANGLE OF IMAGE Y AXIS","9fe5805b":"#### RIGHT ASCENSION AND DECLINATION","c0700be2":"# COORDINATES\n\n#### WHAT IS RIGHT ASCENSION (RA_TARG) AND DECLINATION (DEC_TARG)\n\n* RA (right ascension) and Dec (declination) are the coordinates on the sky that correspond to longitude and latitude on Earth. RA measures east and west on the celestial sphere and is like longitude on the Earth. Dec measures north and south on the celestial sphere and is like latitude on the Earth.\n\n* RA is measured in hours minutes and seconds of time. The reason for this is the sky turns once a day to the west as the earth rotates to the east. The celestial sphere moves one hour of RA west per hour of time and 24 hours of RA during the course of the whole day. Since this is a 360 degree rotation, one hour of RA is equal to 15 degrees of turning (360\/24 = 15). Just like lines of longitude, RA lines are also great circles converging on the north and south celestial poles.\n\n* Longitude has the Greenwich meridian as the zero line dividing east and west. On the sky, the zero meridian in RA is labeled 00h 00m 00s. It intersects the celestial equator at a point called the vernal equinox (where the Sun crosses the celestial equator in late March of each year).\n\n* Measurements north and south on the sky are called declinations (commonly abbreviated as Dec, DEC or dec). Just like latitude, declination is measured in degrees, minutes and seconds north (positive) and south (negative), with 60 minutes in each degree and 60 seconds in each minute of declination.\n\n#### WHAT IS GALACTIC LATITUDE AND GALACTIC LONGITUDE\n\n* The galactic coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system in spherical coordinates, with the Sun as its center, the primary direction aligned with the approximate center of the Milky Way Galaxy, and the fundamental plane parallel to an approximation of the galactic plane but offset to its north. It uses the right-handed convention, meaning that coordinates are positive toward the north and toward the east in the fundamental plane\n\n**Galactic Latitude**\n\n* Latitude measures the angle of an object northward of the galactic equator (or midplane) as viewed from Earth. Analogous to terrestrial latitude, galactic latitude is usually measured in degrees (\u00b0)\n\n**Galactic Longitude**\n\n* The galactic coordinates use the Sun as the origin. Galactic longitude (l) is measured with primary direction from the Sun to the center of the galaxy in the galactic plane, while the galactic latitude (b) measures the angle of the object above the galactic plane. Longitude measures the angular distance of an object eastward along the galactic equator from the galactic center. Analogous to terrestrial longitude, galactic longitude is usually measured in degrees (\u00b0).\n\n#### WHAT IS ECLIPTIC LATITUDE AND ECLIPTIC LONGITUDE\n\n* The equatorial coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system widely used to specify the positions of celestial objects. It may be implemented in spherical or rectangular coordinates, both defined by an origin at the centre of Earth, a fundamental plane consisting of the projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere (forming the celestial equator), a primary direction towards the vernal equinox, and a right-handed convention\n\n* A star's spherical coordinates are often expressed as a pair, right ascension and declination, without a distance coordinate. The direction of sufficiently distant objects is the same for all observers, and it is convenient to specify this direction with the same coordinates for all. In contrast, in the horizontal coordinate system, a star's position differs from observer to observer based on their positions on the Earth's surface, and is continuously changing with the Earth's rotation.\n\n* Telescopes equipped with equatorial mounts and setting circles employ the equatorial coordinate system to find objects. Setting circles in conjunction with a star chart or ephemeris allow the telescope to be easily pointed at known objects on the celestial sphere.\n\n#### WHAT IS ECLIPTIC LATITUDE AND ECLIPTIC LONGITUDE\n\n* The equatorial coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system widely used to specify the positions of celestial objects.

Because it's an angle, you measure solar altitude in degrees. The value of the solar altitude varies based on the time of day, the time of year and the latitude on Earth. Regions close to the equator have a higher solar altitude than regions near the Earth's poles.\n\n* The solar altitude varies significantly by your latitudinal position on Earth. If you are at or near the equator, the sun will be high in the sky in the middle of the day. Therefore, the solar altitude will be fairly great. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees with respect to the plane of the solar system. Hence, the sun is not always directly overhead at the equator. When the sun is directly overhead, the solar altitude is 90 degrees. This occurs at the equator during the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. At the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, the sun will have an altitude of 90 degrees during their respective summer solstices.\n\n* The Earth progresses through its seasons because its north-south axis has a 23.5-degree tilt. During the summer, the solar altitude will be at its maximum. During the winter, the solar altitude will be at its minimum. The change in solar altitude throughout the seasons results in hotter temperatures in the summer and cooler temperatures in the winter. Furthermore, because of the tilt of the Earth, the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter and summer at the opposite times of the year than the Northern Hemisphere.","697eb2ae":"* The average angle is 0.52 degrees for the Moon and 0.53 degrees for the Sun. Depending on the particular location in its elliptic orbit, the Moon's angle ranges between 0.49 degrees and 0.55 degrees, whereas that of the Sun ranges between 0.52 degrees and 0.54 degrees.\n\n* The angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 31 arcmin or 1\/2\u00b0, so astronomers would say the Moon's angular diameter is 31 arcmin, or the Moon subtends an angle of 31 arcmin.\n\n* One of the most familiar things about the Moon is that it goes through phases from new (all shadow) to first quarter (1\/2 appears to be in shadow) to full (all lit up) to third quarter (opposite to the first quarter) and back to new. This cycle takes about 29.53 days. This time period is known as the Moon's synodic period. Because the Moon moves through its phases in about four weeks, the phases of new moon, first quarter, full moon, third quarter occur nearly one week apart from each other.","0558190d":"#### INVERSE SENSITIVITY","ab8d124d":"# SPECTRAL TYPE ANALYSIS AND OBSERVING IMAGE","2ecd064c":"### PATH DIRECTORY","2cc681b5":"#### ECLIPTIC LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE"}}
