This test may help distinguish obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, from restrictive lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis.\n\nFVC can also help doctors assess the progression of lung disease and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. An abnormal FVC value may be chronic, but sometimes the problem is reversible and the FVC can be corrected.\n\n### Interpreting Results\n\nYour total FVC volume can be compared with the standard FVC for your age, sex, height, and weight. Your FVC can also be compared with your own previous FVC values, if applicable, to determine whether your pulmonary condition is progressing or if your lung function is improving under treatment. **FVC also may be expressed as a percentage of the predicted FVC.** This is expressed as percent in our dataset. \n\n\nForced vital capacity will be reported in two ways:\n\n1. As an absolute value, reported as a number in liters (L)\n2. On a linear graph to chart the dynamics of your exhalation\n\n\nThe normal FVC range for an adult is between 3.0 and 5.0 L. This depends on a lot of factors like genetics, height, body weight and other factors. It has nowhere been explicitly mentioned, but I am assuming that FVC is given in ml.

I will try to be as elaborate as possible.  \n\nLet's get started! \n\nThe first step towards approaching any problem is to understand the problem statement properly. \n\n# Problem statement \n\n**In this competition, you\u2019ll predict a patient\u2019s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. You\u2019ll determine lung function based on output from a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. The challenge is to use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.**\n\n# Dig deeper into Pulmonary Fibrosis\n\n![](https:\/\/www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org\/images\/default-source\/default-album\/normal-and-impaired-gas-exchange.png?sfvrsn=c3b0918d_0)\n\nThe word **\u201cPulmonary\u201d** means lung and the word **\u201cfibrosis\u201d** means scar tissue\u2014 similar to scars that you may have on your skin from an old injury or surgery. So, in its simplest sense, **pulmonary fibrosis (PF) means scarring in the lungs**. \n\nOver time, the scar tissue can destroy the normal lung and make it hard for oxygen to get into your blood. Low oxygen levels (and the stiff scar tissue itself) can cause you to feel short of breath, particularly when walking and exercising. **Pulmonary fibrosis** isn\u2019t just one disease. It is a family of more than 200 different lung diseases that all look very much alike. The PF family of lung diseases falls into an even larger group of diseases called the interstitial lung diseases (also known as ILD), which includes all of the diseases that have inflammation and\/or scarring in the lung. Some interstitial lung diseases don\u2019t include scar tissue. When an interstitial lung disease does include scar tissue in the lung, we call it pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n## Symptoms \n\nSigns and symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may include:\n\n1. Shortness of breath (dyspnea)\n2. A dry cough\n3. Fatigue\n4. Unexplained weight loss\n5. Aching muscles and joints\n6. Widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes (clubbing)\n\nThe course of pulmonary fibrosis \u2014 and the severity of symptoms \u2014 can vary considerably from person to person. Some people become ill very quickly with severe disease. Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly, over months or years.\n\n## Causes \n\nPulmonary fibrosis scars and thickens the tissue around and between the air sacs (alveoli) in your lungs. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into your bloodstream. The damage can be caused by many different factors \u2014 including long-term exposure to certain toxins, certain medical conditions, radiation therapy and some medications.\n\n## Risk factors\n\n**Age**. Although pulmonary fibrosis has been diagnosed in children and infants, the disorder is much more likely to affect middle-aged and older adults.\n\n**Sex**. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is more likely to affect men than women.\n\n**Smoking**. Far more smokers and former smokers develop pulmonary fibrosis than do people who have never smoked. Pulmonary fibrosis can occur in patients with emphysema.\n\n**Certain occupations**. You have an increased risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis if you work in mining, farming or construction or if you're exposed to pollutants known to damage your lungs.\n\n**Cancer treatments**. Having radiation treatments to your chest or using certain chemotherapy drugs can increase your risk of pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n**Genetic factors**. Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, and genetic factors may be a component.\n\n## Why is this competition important?\n\nCurrent methods make fibrotic lung diseases difficult to treat, even with access to a chest CT scan. In addition, the wide range of varied prognoses create issues organizing clinical trials. Finally, patients suffer extreme anxiety\u2014in addition to fibrosis-related symptoms\u2014from the disease\u2019s opaque path of progression.\n\nIf successful, patients and their families would better understand their prognosis when they are first diagnosed with this incurable lung disease. Improved severity detection would also positively impact treatment trial design and accelerate the clinical development of novel treatments.\n\n# Data description \n\nWe have seen the details of the disease and what competition expects us to do, let's see the description of the data and what we need to do about it. \n\nAs we understand from the problem statement of the competition, our job is to make prognosis easier for the patients. We are provided with a baseline chest CT scan and associated clinical information for a set of patients. A patient has an image acquired at time Week = 0 and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their FVC is measured. \n\nLung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.\n\n**Train:** We are provided with an anonymized, baseline CT scan and the entire history of FVC measurements.\n\n**Test:** We are provided with a baseline CT scan and only the initial FVC measurement. You are asked to predict the final three FVC measurements for each patient, as well as a confidence value in your prediction.\n\nLet's get started!","04870d99":"The distribution shows that most of the people have had their measurements done in 0-10 weeks. This indicates two things:\n\n1. Either patients are reluctant to visit hospitals to get their FVC mesured.\n2. Or, the health of patients deteriorated over the course of weeks and gradually death would have occured.\n\n## FVC vs percent \n\n\nLet us see what is the relationship between FVC and Percent:","a729e495":"So, most of the people have had smoking history before they developed symptoms. They could have dropped smoking after the symptoms perhaps, but it is very much evident that people with a smoking history have greater chances of contracting pulmonary fibriosis.
