With few USDones to spare, cost is at high priority to ensure that he can finace his time at the university. Additionally, Simba is easily irratated by uncomfortable thermal conditions. Wanting to maintain a beloved and loving reputation amongst his subjects and peers, thermal comfort is key to ensuring he maintains his composure at all times.\n\nAfter much discussion with his Future (Maybe) Majesty, we have created a scoring system with weightages as seen above. And with that, with the mighty roar of his Future (Maybe) Majesty, we begin our work of finding the best lodging accommodation to suit the needs and wants of his Future (Maybe) Majesty.  \n","273425f9":"**Lodging_all_elec Dataset**\n\nAs seen in the graph plotted, the lodging data set contains information from various different schools.

This section consists of scatter plots that illustrates a bigger picture, showing the general trend between temperature and energy consumption in each individual Top 12 lodging (eg. generally lower daily energy consumption when the air temperature increases). The purpose of this is to identify general trends between outdoor temperature and energy consumption.\n\n- [Peacock](#B1)\n- [Cockatoo](#B2)\n\n**Summary of this section**:\n\nBased on the graphs in the following subsections, we can conclude that there is a general trend between temperature and energy consumption. As the temperature increases, the daily energy consumption generally decreases, which means that a warmer temperature is likely to correspond with lower daily electrical usage. This conclusion is drawn from almost all the lodging buildings in Peacock and Cockatoo, with the exception of Peacock's Sergio. It is the only lodging block that shows a generally constant trend line across the various temperatures.\n\n<a id=\"B1\"><\/a>\n### **Peacock**\n","cae6451c":"![1.jpg](attachment:50bf7137-d358-4864-afdc-be3304d134bb.jpg)\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n<a id=\"1\"><\/a>\n# 1.

This system aims to promote sustainability by encouraging students to save energy whenever possible.

In this notebook, we have chosen criterias that will be critical for students to consider when contemplating on whether to stay at Universities' lodging and the different factors that will affect their choice in Universities and lodging.

Conclusion\n### Scalability of solution \/ notebook \/ data\n\nThe data used in this notebook can be found easily outside the dataset used as they are generally recorded readings from Building Management Systems or other monitoring systems. As long as there are data recordings available, the applications\/inferences\/visualisations made in this notebook can be done. The use case of this notebook also varies with the perspective, interest and questions of the party seeking answers.\n\n\n### Extension of scenario to real-life applications\n\nVarious Criterias that Simba has listed out within this notebook can be applied in real life applications. \nSome of these are as follows.\n\n**Criteria 1** \n\nSelf-explanatory for students looking for \u2018better\u2019 universities to attend or how to narrow down search on universities based on their own criteria. \n\nHowever, the team would like to emphasize that there are no \u2018better\u2019 universities and we believe all university students should be treated equally and judged based on their personal abilities. The perception of better universities shall be left to talent acquisition professionals to determine its relevance. \n\n**Criteria 2** \n\nA wide applicable scope and use case as it largely deals with finances or operational spending on electricity. \n\nThis is mainly relevant to clients with real estate assets that consume large amounts of electricity. These assets can extend to factories, data centres, malls, offices, healthcare facilities, etc., that span across a country to regions. It simply helps to understand the operational cost of upkeep pertaining to electricity and can be a key factor in determining expansion of real estate portfolios. To put matters into perspective, if one wants to build a semiconductor plant or a data centre, one would look for countries with lower cost of electricity as that may be one of the large portion of operational spendings amongst others. \n\n**Criteria 3** \n\nSeeks relevance on weather and electricity consumption. \n\nWeather is a factor that impacts the largest generators of electricity consumption - heating and cooling. By understanding these relationships, it can help a client determine interventions or strategies to reduce electricity consumption as part of the move to go green. For example, if we see that weather increases electricity consumption especially during summer or warm seasons, an intervention that a client could do is to apply solar film on windows, or even completely replace the windows to a double glazed one. This may help to reduce heat transfer into the building. The study of seasons can help the client determine innovative solutions that are dependent on the weather to regulate a building which can be achieved mainly through permanent or temporal facade interventions to internal building optimization. \n\n**Criteria 4** \n\nTries to study the direct impact of interlinked factors between weather, heating and cooling on electricity consumption. \n\nThis data can not only be used to optimize the building and lower energy consumption, but with employee feedback\/thermal comfort data (that differs amongst buildings), it will help to determine what temperatures should be heating or cooling be set at. For example, a centralized air-conditioning or heating system would always be preset at a determined temperature without embodying the occupant's comfort. If thermal comfort data is collected, pre-set temperatures can be adjusted or adaptive\/automated considering the trade-off between comfort and electricity consumption based on weather. For example, pre-set temperatures change automatically according to weather but stays within the range of employee thermal comfort. This example may be far-fetched but could be an extended study in future. \n\n.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\n**Final Words** \n\n![Simba Head.JPG](attachment:5d238249-f054-45d4-b34c-0f6932c13d05.JPG)\n\nSimba says Congrats! You have made it to the end of the notebook. \n\nA make-believe scenario was created in this notebook to simulate real-life client objectives or work scenarios where various pre-established criterias and objectives (problem and scope definition) with concepts of KDD, SEMMA or CRISP-DM (Somehow the various stages are generally present) to guide the 'research', data mining process or equivalent processes. \n\nGenerally, the reasons and findings can always be adapted into actionable items depending on the use case which shown in some of the real-applications above. This notebook also hopes to allow students living in tropical climates understand that seasonal changes and heating systems are also key points to study when it comes to temperate climates. \n\nFrom here, we wish our Majesty, Simba, a successful completion of his studies and eventually claim his rightful position as King of the Jungle. All the best to his Majesty's future endeavours and our marks provided for this notebook. \n\n.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\n![End.jpg](attachment:e82c2e81-5a98-494d-82a4-07d0576d55ef.jpg)\n","5693cfb6":"<a id=\"Annex\"><\/a>\n# Annex\nThis Annex contains further data visualisations to help determine if weather, in particular air temperature, has a significant impact on the daily energy consumption at each of the Top 12 lodging buildings. Examples of graphs include the individual lodging plots of the daily mean temperature vs energy consumption (section [3.3.3](#3.3.3), [3.3.4](#3.3.4)). \n\n**Is there an impact on the individual blocks' consumption by weather temperature?**\n\nThis Annex looks into daily mean temperature vs electricity use per day for each individual Top 12 block. \n- Patterns of use of daily energy vs temperature\n- Trends of temperature against daily energy consumption\n\n## Patterns of use of daily energy vs temperature\n**Can we identify any correlation or patterns between daily mean temperature and daily energy consumption in each lodging block?**\n\nThis section contains lots of the individual lodging blocks' daily energy consumption against daily mean air temperature. It aims to identify any patterns between daily energy use and daily mean temperature (eg. high temperature results in lower energy use or vice versa).\n\n- [Individual plots for Peacock Lodgings against Air Temp](#A1)\n- [Individual plots for Cockatoo Lodgings against Air Temp](#A2)\n\n**Summary of this section**:\n\nThis portion of the Annex is targeted at finding patterns between temperature and day-to-day electricity usage. Studying the graphs below, no fixed conclusion can be drawn about the patterns between daily mean temperature and daily energy consumption. There are some cases where an increase in daily consumption corresponds with lower temperature, but it is not consistent throughout both semesters as there are also instances where daily consumption increases with increasing temperatures. Some possible reasons for this could be that other factors play a more significant role in affecting daily energy consumption, such as number of students present in the lodging each day. Hence, no definite relationship can be drawn. \n\n\n<a id=\"A1\"><\/a>\n### **Individual plots for Peacock Lodgings against Air Temp**","e82917b1":"<a id=\"3.3.3\"><\/a>\n### **3.3.3 Plotting daily mean temperature against daily energy consumption - Peacock**","189c80db":"<a id=\"3.3.2\"><\/a>\n### **3.3.2 Resampling electrical consumption to daily use - without normalization**\nTo have a better understanding of the impact of daily temperature on daily energy consumption of the building, we can gain a better overall idea of how the temperature affects the total energy use per day, which will also impact Simba's bills.","7ec41fa0":"**Summary of Findings**\n\nCriteria 3 was tasked to us to understand the impact of the weather at different lodging in order to determine if there will be a need for additional electrical usage. However, from the graph that illustrates the comparison of the air temperature and the daily energy consumption in the lodgings, we observe that there is no significant\/distinct impact of the temperature on the energy usage. This could be interpreted as: \n\n1. The difference in the weather condition throughout the year in different lodgings does not have a significant impact on the consumption of energy.\n\n2. The electricity consumption from the need of using heating\/cooling (affected by the temperature) only takes up a small percentage of the overall energy consumption of the lodging, hence it is not possible to see any significant change due to the effects of the weather condition.\n\nDespite the non-conclusive analysis of weather impact on electricity consumption, we will not dismiss the scoring for criteria 3 as it is clearly stated in the requirements by Simba that it is an important criteria to him, weighing 10% of his decision-making process. Hence, we will be awarding the full 10% for all the lodgings under criteria 3.","6f0db9d7":"**Normalize the building consumption -- using `sqm` of the building**","67fe6d26":"![3.jpg](attachment:d441c177-6444-4eab-b881-c3fafd203caa.jpg)\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n<a id=\"5\"><\/a>\n# 5. Recommendations for Simba\nBased on the above results, Princeton (Peacock) Nova student accommodation has the highest score based on the scoring matrix established by the team and Simba. It is recommended that Simba attend Princeton University as the alternative and live in Nova accommodation. However, there some points that Simba still needs to note as there are many factors that may affect energy consumption not covered by this dataset\/notebook. Some could include uncertainty and unpredictable events, age of the building, facilities and amenities, orientation of the building, area and type facade material (high vs low albedo), passive shading from trees or as the case may be. Regardless, on a high level view and avalibility of information, our choice of student accommodation remains the same. However, further research may need to be conducted by Simba in the future years.
