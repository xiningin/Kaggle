Specifically, the relationships between rating and rating count, rating and install count, rating and maintenance were explored. \n\nFor better insight, apps with no ratings and installs were exlcuded.

But they are collapsed into categories which makes it impossible to see their distribution as a numeric feature. We got no other choice but to plot them in the same way as above:","4f8ec4b5":"It looks like, there are much more apps with no rating. We might get a better visual if omit them:","4e72fba4":"Out of the initial 1 million apps, only 76 have over 1 million ratings. Let's see which categories have the most number of apps:","519c45f6":"### Issues List For the Dataset\n- Missing values in several cols: Rating, rating count, Installs, minimum and maximum installs, currency and more\n- Convert all columns to snake_case\n- Drop these columns: App ID, minimum and maximum installs, minimum android version, developer ID, website and email, privacy policy link.\n- Incorrect data types for release data and size\n- Music and education is represented by different labels\n- Drop unnecessary categories","d4ab9bc8":"The above plot shows a clear trend. Surprisingly, paid apps are much less maintained than free apps except for Food & Drink category. ","0b291f2b":"# 1. Introduction to the Dataset And The Aim of the EDA","91795c02":"Looks like all numerical columns are within the sensible range, like rating should be between 0 and 5. But the maximum value for price is 400$ which is a bit suspicious. We will dig into that later.\n\nBefore we further explore, let's deal with the issues we highlighted. Here is the final list:","3b47bed8":"What would be interesting is to compare prices of the apps across categories. I am guessing that apps for business will be the most expensive but let's make sure with a proper visual:","9240de2e":"Histogram shows that majority of the apps are rated between ~3.8 and 4.8. It is also surprising to see so many 5-star ratings.","66f55985":"Now, let's explore the numerical features of the dataset and see if they contain any issues:","76b7eb85":"The correlation matrix of missingness shows that most nulls in `size` are associated with nulls in `rating` and `rating_count`. This scenario falls into the Missing At Random class of missingness. This means that even though null values are random their misssingness is related to other observed values. \n\nIn most cases, you can impute them with ML techniques. But our case is specific because we don't have enough features that help predict the size or rating of an app. We have no choice but to drop them. (I am not even mentioning nulls in other columns because their proportion is marginal)","0facc00c":"Honestly, at this point, I am little disappointed because the dataset did not turn out to be that interesting. To create more angles to explore, we will use the minimum and maximum installs columns. Looking at the dataset documentation, they show estimated minimum and maximum installs.\n\nWe will take the mean of the two columns which would be a better estimate for the true install count:"}}
