Accuracy is the portion of correct guesses.**","79f97f65":"# Data Preprocessing\n**Let's set up data generators that will read pictures in our source folders, convert them to float32 tensors, and feed them (with their labels) to our network. We'll have one generator for the training images and one for the validation images. Our generators will yield batches of images of size 300x300 and their labels (binary).\nAs you may already know, data that goes into neural networks should usually be normalized in some way to make it more amenable to processing by the network. (It is uncommon to feed raw pixels into a convnet.) In our case, we will preprocess our images by normalizing the pixel values to be in the [0, 1] range (originally all values are in the [0, 255] range).\nIn Keras this can be done via the keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator class using the rescale parameter. This ImageDataGenerator class allows you to instantiate generators of augmented image batches (and their labels) via .flow(data, labels) or .flow_from_directory(directory). These generators can then be used with the Keras model methods that accept data generators as inputs: fit, evaluate_generator, and predict_generator.**","b457d332":"**We then add convolutional layers as in the previous example, and flatten the final result to feed into the densely connected layers.**\n**Note that because we are facing a two-class classification problem, i.e. a binary classification problem, we will end our network with a sigmoid activation, so that the output of our network will be a single scalar between 0 and 1, encoding the probability that the current image is class 1 (as opposed to class 0).**","55329e0b":"**Now, display a batch of 50 hammer and 50 screwdriver pictures.

We will train our model with the binary_crossentropy loss, because it's a binary classification problem and our final activation is a sigmoid. We will use the rmsprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. During training, we will want to monitor classification accuracy.\nNOTE: In this case, using the RMSprop optimization algorithm is preferable to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), because RMSprop automates learning-rate tuning for us. (Other optimizers, such as Adam and Adagrad, also automatically adapt the learning rate during training, and would work equally well here.)**"}}
