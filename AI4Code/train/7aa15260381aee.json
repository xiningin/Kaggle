We'll be talking about this parameter a lot during the course. Leave it at `224` for now.\n\n`TMP_PATH` and `MODEL_PATH` are required because otherwise the learn object would try to write on the read-only data directory.","227cccd4":"It seems that the model is not ovefitting yet.

Although not strictly necessary, it will improve training performance significantly, and is included by default in all supported fastai configurations. Therefore, if the following does not return `True`, you may want to look into why.","e0da56f3":"## Code from fastai 2018 DL1 Lesson 1","04ebe759":"Let's create a new `data` object that includes this augmentation in the transforms.","115e5a83":"Note that the other layers have *already* been trained to recognize imagenet photos (whereas our final layers where randomly initialized), so we want to be careful of not destroying the carefully tuned weights that are already there.\n\nGenerally speaking, the earlier layers (as we've seen) have more general-purpose features. Therefore we would expect them to need less fine-tuning for new datasets. For this reason we will use different learning rates for different layers: the first few layers will be at 1e-4, the middle layers at 1e-3, and our FC layers we'll leave at 2e-1. We refer to this as *differential learning rates*, although there's no standard name for this techique in the literature that we're aware of.","8ec1e6ab":"Our `learn` object contains an attribute `sched` that contains our learning rate scheduler, and has some convenient plotting functionality including this one:","e56064ff":"We're going to use a <b>pre-trained<\/b> model, that is, a model created by some one else to solve a different problem. Instead of building a model from scratch to solve a similar problem, we'll use a model trained on ImageNet (1.2 million images and 1000 classes) as a starting point. The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of Neural Network that builds state-of-the-art models for computer vision. We'll be learning all about CNNs during this course.\n\nWe will be using the <b>resnet34<\/b> model. resnet34 is a version of the model that won the 2015 ImageNet competition. Here is more info on [resnet models](https:\/\/github.com\/KaimingHe\/deep-residual-networks). We'll be studying them in depth later, but for now we'll focus on using them effectively.\n","adb1dd5e":"There is something else we can do with data augmentation: use it at *inference* time (also known as *test* time). Not surprisingly, this is known as *test time augmentation*, or just *TTA*.\n\nTTA simply makes predictions not just on the images in your validation set, but also makes predictions on a number of randomly augmented versions of them too (by default, it uses the original image along with 4 randomly augmented versions). It then takes the average prediction from these images, and uses that. To use TTA on the validation set, we can use the learner's `TTA()` method.","d95591bf":"Testing that the data can be read.","34b12899":"The *learning rate* determines how quickly or how slowly you want to update the *weights* (or *parameters*). Learning rate is one of the most difficult parameters to set, because it significantly affects model performance.\n\nThe method `learn.lr_find()` helps you find an optimal learning rate. It uses the technique developed in the 2015 paper [Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks](http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1506.01186), where we simply keep increasing the learning rate from a very small value, until the loss stops decreasing. We can plot the learning rate across batches to see what this looks like.\n\nWe first create a new learner, since we want to know how to set the learning rate for a new (untrained) model.","f479c106":"If you try training for more epochs, you'll notice that we start to *overfit*, which means that our model is learning to recognize the specific images in the training set, rather than generalizing such that we also get good results on the validation set. One way to fix this is to effectively create more data, through *data augmentation*. This refers to randomly changing the images in ways that shouldn't impact their interpretation, such as horizontal flipping, zooming, and rotating.\n\nWe can do this by passing `aug_tfms` (*augmentation transforms*) to `tfms_from_model`, with a list of functions to apply that randomly change the image however we wish. The Lego images are rendered from different orientations. We can use the `transforms_top_down` augmentation because having the Legos upside down is fine. We can also specify random zooming of images up to specified scale by adding the `max_zoom` parameter.","f9a98ae0":"Now that we have a good final layer trained, we can try fine-tuning the other layers. To tell the learner that we want to unfreeze the remaining layers, just call (surprise surprise!) `unfreeze()`.","03089a3b":"I just replaced the dataset and changed the learning rate and augmentation.","3ad6c2a5":"The loss is still clearly improving at lr=1e-1 (0.1), so that's what we use.
