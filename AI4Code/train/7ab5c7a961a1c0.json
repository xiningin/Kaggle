No-polyuria and diabetes are strong negative correlation. It means that if we have no polyuria symptom, it may not be diabetes.\n\n* Polydipsia is the term given to excessive thirst and is one of the initial symptoms of diabetes. If we feel thirsty all the time or your thirst is stronger than usual and continues even after you drink, it can be a sign that not all is well inside your body."}}
