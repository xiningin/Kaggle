I personally loved the first season, but I can understand it would require some getting used to realize that The Office is not - 'OMG Hahaha', but rather - 'Ummm...that is hilarious but I'm not sure if I should laugh'\n    - Also, season 1 only had 6 episodes, thus serves as a way for the writers to just see how the audience react and based on those responses, they could adapt and modify characters in the subsequent seasons. Also, season 1 could also be served as the gateway to all the seasons, new viewers would try The Office based on some recommendation and then might end up finding things not what they expected, while not realizing the other seasons are much much more enjoyable. \n- The show was at its peak rating at Season 3 and after that there is a steady decline up until Season 5, Season 6 was a sharp dip, which was recovered in Season 7. As an Office fan, I tend to ignore the existence of Season 8. Season 9 was pretty good for most parts. \n- The Average Duration of episodes has also changed across seasons. Season 3 which has the highest Rating has an average episode duration of 25 mins, while Season 4 has the highest average episode duration of 32.5 mins.  ","435bec0d":"It is no surprise that Michael had a lot of Dialogues to say, but the fact that he has such a high lead over the other characters is Amazing.

This clear segregation of these episodes makes it easier for us to find episodes which are similar to the ones we like. \n\nWe can clearly show how the festival themed episodes are clubbed together on the right side of the graph and are quite different from the other episodes. \n\nWe can also see S05E25 - Broke is much different from all the other episodes. \n\nWe can use this graph to find episodes that do not fall in the central grouping and thus are somewhat different.

Thus, it shows that Season 4 has pretty long episode durations","1da12779":"We see a high average number of Guests per Episode in the 7th Season. \n\nPossible Explanation - After seeing their then all time low rating in Season 6, the creators may have thought to add more episodes of Guests in order to help gain some popularity back.
