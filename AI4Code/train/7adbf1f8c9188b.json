Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom.","908f473c":"Now, evaluate this model and find the accuracy.","b25289a9":"## Preprocessing\n\nBefore the data is suitable for machine learning. The first step in preprocessing the dataset is to convert the categorical labels into integers.","fd51ce4c":"The last step is to create a set for training data and a set to evaluate the model.","a7dda390":"## Reproducibility\n\nTo ensure reproducibility of this notebook, it uses a random state to ensure that all runs generate equally.","675a5f0f":"## Modeling\n\nTo create an accurate model for this dataset is rather easy. Because there are specific features that always occur together or individually for the mushroom to be classified as poisonous, a simple tree can be used to classify. Because of this, RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-Learn is used as the framework of choice.","bffea704":"# Poisonous mushroom detection\n\nThis project is based on data from UCI Machine Learning. It is a very simple project, trying to classify poisonous from non-poisonous mushroom by phenotype and other characteristics."}}
