Import Necessary Libraries","235290a8":"### Errors in Calculation (Averaged over positions)","d0ec4661":"### What is RNA?\n\n**Ribonucleic acid**, or RNA is one of the three major biological macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life (along with DNA and proteins). A central tenet of molecular biology states that the flow of genetic information in a cell is from DNA through RNA to proteins: **\u201cDNA makes RNA makes protein\u201d**.\n\n---\n\n### What is mRNA?\n\n**Messenger RNAs**, also known as mRNA, are one of the types of RNA that are found in the cell. This particular one, like most RNAs, are made in the nucleus and then exported to the cytoplasm where the translation machinery, the machinery that actually makes proteins, binds to these mRNA molecules and reads the code on the mRNA to make a specific protein. So in general, one gene, the DNA for one gene, can be transcribed into an mRNA molecule that will end up making one specific protein.\n\n---\n\n### Why are we here?\n\nmRNA vaccines have taken the lead as the fastest vaccine candidates for COVID-19, but currently, they face key potential limitations. One of the biggest challenges right now is how to design super stable messenger RNA molecules (mRNA). Conventional vaccines (like your seasonal flu shots) are packaged in disposable syringes and shipped under refrigeration around the world, but that is not currently possible for mRNA vaccines.\n\nResearchers have observed that RNA molecules have a tendency to spontaneously degrade. This is a serious limitation--a single cut can render the mRNA vaccine useless. Currently, little is known on the details of where in the backbone of a given RNA is most prone to being affected. Without this knowledge, current mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 must be prepared and shipped under intense refrigeration, and are unlikely to reach more than a tiny fraction of human beings on the planet unless they can be stabilized.\n\n---\n\n### Our Goal: Predict the degradation rates at various locations along RNA sequence\n\n---\n\n### What do we have?\n\nWe have a subset of an **Eterna dataset** comprising over **3000 RNA molecules** (which span a panoply of sequences and structures) and their **degradation rates** at each position.\n\nThere are multiple ground truth values provided in the training data. While the submission format requires all 5 to be predicted, only the following are scored: reactivity, deg_Mg_pH10, and deg_Mg_50C.\n\n#### Files\n* train.json - the training data\n* test.json - the test set, without any columns associated with the ground truth.\n* sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\n\n#### Columns\n\n* id - An arbitrary identifier for each sample.\n\n* seq_scored - (68 in Train and Public Test, 91 in Private Test) Integer value denoting the number of positions used in scoring with predicted values. This should match the length of reactivity, deg_* and *_error_* columns. Note that molecules used for the Private Test will be longer than those in the Train and Public Test data, so the size of this vector will be different.\n\n* seq_length - (107 in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) Integer values, denotes the length of sequence. Note that molecules used for the Private Test will be longer than those in the Train and Public Test data, so the size of this vector will be different.\n\n* sequence - (1x107 string in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) Describes the RNA sequence, a combination of A, G, U, and C for each sample. Should be 107 characters long, and the first 68 bases should correspond to the 68 positions specified in seq_scored (note: indexed starting at 0).\n\n* structure - (1x107 string in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) An array of (, ), and . characters that describe whether a base is estimated to be paired or unpaired. Paired bases are denoted by opening and closing parentheses e.g. (....) means that base 0 is paired to base 5, and bases 1-4 are unpaired.\n\n* reactivity - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are * reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likely secondary structure of the RNA sample.\n\n* deg_pH10 - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base\/linkage after incubating without magnesium at high pH (pH 10).\n\n* deg_Mg_pH10 - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base\/linkage after incubating with magnesium in high pH (pH 10).\n\n* deg_50C - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base\/linkage after incubating without magnesium at high temperature (50 degrees Celsius).\n\n* deg_Mg_50C - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base\/linkage after incubating with magnesium at high temperature (50 degrees Celsius).\n\n* *_error_* - An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as the corresponding reactivity or deg_* columns, calculated errors in experimental values obtained in reactivity and deg_* columns.\n\n* predicted_loop_type - (1x107 string) Describes the structural context (also referred to as 'loop type')of each character in sequence. Loop types assigned by bpRNA from Vienna RNAfold 2 structure. From the bpRNA_documentation: S: paired \"Stem\" M: Multiloop I: Internal loop B: Bulge H: Hairpin loop E: dangling End X: eXternal loop\n\n___\n\n[*Competition Page*](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/stanford-covid-vaccine\/overview)","72d4f994":"* Very high values of Errors in **deg_error_pH10 & deg_error_50C** but maybe we should not worry about these targets because evaluation is not based on these targets\n* Maybe this could be a reason why our models will not be scored on these two targets","c302c720":"* Samples with **SN_filter = 1** are having low values of errors\n* We can use this **filter** to train our model only on these samples but as the **private test** data is **not filtered**, it might only give good results on **Public LB** but not on **Private LB**"}}
