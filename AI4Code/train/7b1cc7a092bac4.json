Dying Of COVID-19 In The US Than We Know.\n\nMedical professionals around the US told BuzzFeed News that the official numbers of people who have died of COVID-19 are not consistent with the number of deaths they\u2019re seeing on the front lines.\n\nIn some cases, it\u2019s a lag in reporting, caused by delays and possible breakdowns in logging positive tests and making them public. In other, more troubling, cases, medical experts told BuzzFeed News they think it\u2019s because people are not being tested before or after they die.\n\nIn the US, state and county authorities are responsible for collecting data on cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and deaths. The data is then reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn California, one ER doctor who works at multiple hospitals in a hard-hit county told BuzzFeed News, \u201cthose medical records aren't being audited by anyone at the state and local level currently and some people aren\u2019t even testing those people who are dead.\u201d\n\nThey did not immediately address the question of whether they\u2019re confident their death count is accurate given the shortage of testing for COVID-19.https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/nidhiprakash\/coronavirus-update-dead-covid19-doctors-hospitals","90fae350":"#It\u2019s frightening': Across Canada, frontline doctors are bracing for the COVID-19 onslaught\n\nAcross Canada, emergency physicians and other frontline health-care workers are preparing for an onslaught unlike anything almost any of them have ever faced. At home, they are making decisions about who will care for their kids if they get sick. At work, they are thinking through how to ration care if their wards get overrun. And they are doing all that unsure, in many cases, if they have enough of the right equipment to keep themselves safe.\n\nOn Monday, the Post spoke to three Canadian doctors about the situation right now, where they are. Each reflected a mix of anxiety, determination, and frustration about poor communication and equipment shortages.\n\n#One more time: Equipment and supplies.\n\nThey believe that what they\u2019re doing is right, but they just want to make sure that they have the supplies to do it. \"I need to make sure that I have the equipment to keep myself and my family safe and my patients safe. I don\u2019t really care who\u2019s in power. It just has to be more than promises that we have equipment. I need to know that I don\u2019t have to ration equipment. We see in the United States, on social media, is people using garbage bags as masks. We\u2019re afraid that could happen to us provincially, that we won\u2019t have supplies.\" That\u2019s they big fear.https:\/\/nationalpost.com\/news\/canada\/its-frightening-across-canada-frontline-doctors-are-bracing-for-the-covid-19-onslaugh","a09e527d":"Health professionals\n\nHealth professionals maintain health in humans through the application of the principles and procedures of evidence-based medicine and caring.

News on the condition of not being named out of fear of repercussions, said that the official counts of COVID-19 related deaths are not comprehensive for three main reasons: a lack of tests and protective equipment means not everyone who contracted or dies of COVID-19 is diagnosed; overwhelmed hospitals may be running behind on reporting the numbers to state and county authorities; and some hospitals reporting their totals on a daily basis say they\u2019re not being reflected promptly in county and state reports.\n\nStates across the US have implemented stay-at-home orders in part because there are an unknown number of people who have COVID-19, including some who may never even have symptoms or get mildly sick and recover but are still capable of spreading the virus. https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/nidhiprakash\/coronavirus-update-dead-covid19-doctors-hospitals","e9d0bcc5":"#GP General Practitioners\n\nFour were general practitioners (GPs) in Bergamo, the epicenter of the pandemic, in the Lombardy region, and another four GPs were in Lodi, a nearby town also in the Lombardy region. Overall, 23 (38%) of the 61 doctors who have died were GPs, the family doctors who would be the first line of defense for anyone who is feeling unwell.\n\n#Specialists\n\nThen there are specialists, who presumably would have been seeing the more severely affected patients treated in hospitals. The list includes several pulmonologists, an anesthesiologist, an epidemiologist, and a medical examiner, as well as two doctors who were working in nursing homes.\n\n#Other Healthcare Professionals\n\nOther healthcare professionals have also died from COVID-19. The list includes several dentists as well as an ophthalmologist.Two of the dentists were 49 and 55 years old, notable because most of the other clinicians who died were in their 60s and 70s (and one was 90). \n\nThe FNOMCeO list does not specify whether these doctors were still working as physicians or whether they had retired. In Italy, the state pension starts at age 68, but doctors can choose when to retire, so many doctors are often still working at age 70 or older.\n\nIn addition, the majority of the deceased doctors are male, which reflects what has been reported for the overall COVID-19-related deaths in Italy (one analysis found that 70% of COVID-19 deaths were male, and mean age was 80). \nhttps:\/\/www.medscape.com\/viewarticle\/927753","49e804ac":"Meanwhile, messages of support were pouring in for Jean-Marie Boegle, a gynocologist who worked in Mulhouse, and who died on Sunday 22 March from coronavirus.\n\nTired, and suffering from other health issues, he decided to get tested for coronavirus.
