series produced by P.A.Works and Aniplex and directed by Seiji Kishi. The story was originally conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed the music with the group Anant-Garde Eyes, with original character design by Na-Ga; both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, who produced such titles as Kanon, Air, and Clannad. The anime aired in Japan between April 3 and June 26, 2010 on CBC. An original video animation (OVA) episode was released in December 2010, and a second OVA was released in June 2015. The story takes place in the afterlife and focuses on Otonashi, a boy who lost his memories of his life after dying. He is enrolled into the afterlife school and meets a girl named Yuri who invites him to join the Afterlife Battlefront, an organization she leads which fights against the student council president Kanade Tachibana, a girl also known as Angel with supernatural powers.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key worked in collaboration with ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine to produce the project into a media franchise. Four manga series are serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine and Dengeki G's Comic: two illustrated by Haruka Komowata and two drawn by Yuriko Asami. A series of illustrated short stories written by Maeda and illustrated by GotoP were also serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine between the November 2009 and May 2010 issues. Two Internet radio shows were produced to promote Angel Beats!. The first volume in a six-part episodic visual novel adaptation produced by Key was released for Windows on June 26, 2015.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel Beats! received generally positive reviews by critics. The integration of various individual elements together, such as musical performances, humor and action, was commended in one review but panned in another, saying that the story was overloaded with too many elements. P.A.Works was praised for the animation of the action sequences and attention to detail with the weapons used. A major flaw noted by critics, however, was the length of the anime, with its short run leaving many of the characters' back-stories unexplored. The anime was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2010.<\/p>","86ca77ce":"> # Does Average Votes have an effect on the popularity rank?","1adbb0cb":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sh\u014dnen manga is typically characterized by high action and often humorous plots featuring male protagonists. Commonly-found themes in Sh\u014dnen manga include martial arts, mecha, science fiction, sports, horror or mythological creatures. The camaraderie between boys or men on sports teams, fighting squads, and the like are often emphasized. Protagonists of such manga often feature an ongoing desire to better themselves and often face challenges to their abilities, skills, and maturity. Values such as self-perfection, self-discipline, sacrifice in the cause of duty, and honorable service to society, community, family, and friends are often stressed. However, none of these characteristics are required in a Sh\u014dnen manga - what really defines Sh\u014dnen is the magazine it's serialized in. Notable magazines of this genre include Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, Jump Square, Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine, Bessatsu Sh\u014dnen Magazine, Monthly Sh\u014dnen Magazine, Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday, and Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion.","7d407c58":"<h1 style=\"font-size:30px;\">#3<center>- Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch -<\/center><\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/myanimeshelf.com\/upload\/dynamic\/2017-08\/07\/6cf9707096577fab2.jpg\">\n<br>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (Japanese: \u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ae\u30a2\u30b9 \u53cd\u9006\u306e\u30eb\u30eb\u30fc\u30b7\u30e5, Hepburn: K\u014ddo Giasu: Hangyaku no Rur\u016bshu), often referred to simply as Code Geass, is a Japanese anime television series produced by Sunrise. It was directed by Gor\u014d Taniguchi and written by Ichir\u014d \u014ckouchi, with original character designs by Clamp. Set in an alternate timeline, it follows the exiled prince Lelouch vi Britannia, who obtains the \"power of absolute obedience\" from a mysterious woman named C.C. Using this supernatural power, known as Geass, he leads a rebellion against the rule of the Holy Britannian Empire, commanding a series of mecha battles.\n\nCode Geass was broadcast in Japan on MBS from October 2006 to July 2007. Its sequel series, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2, ran as a simulcast on MBS and TBS from April to September 2008. The series has also been adapted into various manga and light novels, with the former showing alternate scenarios from the TV series.\n\nInitiation, Transgression, and Glorification, a compilation remake film trilogy recapping the events of both anime series' seasons\u2014while also altering storylines for various characters and establishing an alternate universe[4]\u2014was released between 2017 and 2018. A new original film titled Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection, taking place after the Zero Requiem of the film trilogy's alternate universe, was released in theaters in February 2019. Code Geass: Z of the Recapture, an anime series set in the same alternate universe, was announced in December 2020 as part of a 10-year plan.\n\nBandai Entertainment licensed most parts of the franchise for English release in December 2007, airing the two TV series on Adult Swim.

Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tank\u014dbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began streaming the anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended on March 2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.<\/p>","d300374d":"<h1 style=\"font-size:30px;\">#1\ud83d\udc51<center>- Toradora! -<\/center><\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/beneaththetangles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/toradora-episode-2c.png?resize=739%2C416&ssl=1\">\n<br>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toradora! (Japanese: \u3068\u3089\u30c9\u30e9!) is a Japanese light novel series by Yuyuko Takemiya, with illustrations by Yasu. The series includes ten novels released between March 10, 2006 and March 10, 2009, published by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko imprint.[3] Three volumes of a spin-off light novel series were also created, aptly titled Toradora Spin-off!. A manga adaptation by Zekky\u014d started serialization in the September 2007 issue of the sh\u014dnen manga magazine Dengeki Comic Gao!, published by MediaWorks. The manga ended serialization in Dengeki Comic Gao! with the March 2008 issue, but continued serialization in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh with the May 2008 issue.[4]\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Internet radio show was broadcast between September 2008 and May 2009 hosted by Animate TV. A 25-episode anime adaptation produced by J.C.Staff aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between October 2008 and March 2009.[5] A Blu-ray Disc (BD) box set containing an original video animation episode was released on December 21, 2011. NIS America licensed the anime and released it in North America in two half-season DVD collections in July and August 2010, with an English dubbed BD collection released in July 2014. A visual novel based on the series was released in April 2009 by Bandai Namco Games for the PlayStation Portable.[6]\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title Toradora! is derived from the names of the two main characters Taiga Aisaka and Ry\u016bji Takasu. Taiga's name is almost homophonic with taig\u0101 (\u30bf\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc) from English tiger (the final a is more lengthened in the English loanword), which is synonymous with the native Japanese word tora (\u3068\u3089). Inversely, ry\u016b (\u7adc) means dragon, and is synonymous with doragon (\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3), the English word dragon transcribed into Japanese.[7]<\/p>","78a821e6":"<img src=\"https:\/\/wallpapercave.com\/wp\/wp5164620.jpg\" style=\"border-radius:50%\">\n<h1><center>-Best Ranked Anime in 2021-<\/center><\/h1>","e10087d7":"<a id=\"psychological-section\"><\/a>\n<span style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size:50px; color:white; background-color:#C34A2C\">&nbsp;Psychological&nbsp;<\/span>","b9eaa8b5":"<div style=\"display:flex;\n            justify-content:center;\n            align-items:center;\">\n<div style=\"float:left;display:flex;\">\n    <h2>8th<\/h2>\n    <span style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px; color:white; background-color:#cc5933; margin-right:25px;\">&nbsp; Popularity Rank &nbsp;<\/span>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"float:left;display:flex;\">\n    <h2>7.9\u2b50<\/h2>\n    <span style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px; color:white; background-color:#cc5933; margin-right:25px;\">&nbsp; Average Votes &nbsp;<\/span>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"float:left;display:flex;\">\n    <h2>64229\ud83d\udc96<\/h2>\n    <span style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px; color:white; background-color:#cc5933; margin-right:25px;\">&nbsp; Favourite List Addition &nbsp;<\/span>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","ac52782a":"<div style=\"display:flex;\n            justify-content:center;\n            align-items:center;\">\n<div style=\"float:left;display:flex;\">\n    <h2>15th<\/h2>\n    <span style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px; color:white; background-color:#5353ac; margin-right:25px;\">&nbsp; Popularity Rank &nbsp;<\/span>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"float:left;display:flex;\">\n    <h2>8.1\u2b50<\/h2>\n    <span style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px; color:white; background-color:#5353ac; margin-right:25px;\">&nbsp; Average Votes &nbsp;<\/span>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","81db2d69":"# By the way those are the highest 20 ranked anime","884ae661":"<span style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size:50px; color:white; background-color:#C34A2C\">&nbsp;Intro&nbsp;<\/span>","dc95dc0c":"<h1 style=\"font-size:30px;\">#3<center>- Boku no Hero Academia -<\/center><\/h1>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wVvj5jdIcAw\/maxresdefault.jpg\">\n<br>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Hero Academia (Japanese: \u50d5\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30a2\u30ab\u30c7\u30df\u30a2, Hepburn: Boku no H\u012br\u014d Akademia) is a Japanese superhero manga series written and illustrated by K\u014dhei Horikoshi.
