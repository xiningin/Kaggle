First, the average ticket price is increasing according to the year and it may due to the cost of movie, theater and inflation. Also, the total box office is keep increasing as well but it is quite steady or decreased a little after the inflation adjustment. The total ticket amount increase slightly from 1995 but started to reduce after 2004. It is due to some movie stream platform such as NetFlix was getting popular.

People tend to stay at home and not going to any crown location. By merging the top movie that year, the total tickets sold for \"Bad Boy for Life\" & \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" was decresaed dramatically as well.\n\nTherefore, the sold ticker amount is dropped but the price ticket is still increasing.","0dc6c90a":"Most of the movie was produced using Original Screenplay.
