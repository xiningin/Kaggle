Correlation between various factor through heatmap","3026cacc":"Factors Affecting Gold Prices\n\n1.Demand and Supply:\n If the demand for gold increases, the price increases since the supply is relatively scarce\n\n2.Inflation\n\n3.Central Bank of India\n\n4.Interest rates:\n  Both gold and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When the interest rates increase, people sell off their gold and use the money to earn high interest. When the interest rates decrease, people buy more gold resulting in increase in demand.\n5.Monsoon:\n Rural demand plays an important role in demand for gold; the maximum purchase of gold in India is done from rural market. Good   monsoon results in good harvest and the amount earned is used to invest in gold which is used in rainy season as in poor      monsoon gold acts as a safe haven.\n \n6.Import Duty:\nAs gold is not produced in India, it is important for consumption from other countries and import duty plays a crucial role in price fluctuations.\n\n7.Indian Jewellery market:\nFor every Indian household, gold acts as an integral part. Wedding, festivals are incomplete without gold purchase. Therefore, during this season the demand for it increases and resulting in an increase in price.\n\n8.Government Reserves:\nThe government holds reserves of gold. When RBI starts to buy greater quantity than it sells, the price increases as it will result in insufficient supply of gold and vice versa.\n\n9.Currency fluctuations:\nAs gold is traded on the international market in US dollars, therefore, when US dollars are converted to Indian rupees during import, the price fluctuates. If the Indian rupee depreciates, gold import turns to be costlier.\n\n10.Protection from volatility or uncertainty:\nTo protect from uncertainties, people wish to invest or buy gold as it is a safe commodity.\n\n11.Correlation with other assets:\nGold is a highly effective portfolio diversification because of its low negative correlation with all the major asset classes. When shares of companies fall there is an inverse relationship shown between gold and equities.\n\n12.Geopolitical factors\n\n13.Future gold demand","d4319e1b":"### 8.Gold rate trend","4d3624bc":"### 1.Importing 2 files","fb5579ea":"value(0,1) shows directly propostional,  \nvalue(-1,0) shows  inversely proportional,  \nvalue 0 no linear relationship","4bccd176":"# Analyzing the factor that affect gold price","f0afc39e":"### 2.
