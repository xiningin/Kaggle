Then I would have checked if there might have been some rounding error using the code below. But the difference is far too large for this to be the reason, as seen below.","96df3f11":"## 4. Conclusion\n\nThe major conclusion is that we could find improvements to optimal guessing using ESG data. The results were most consistent for funds.\n\nFor ETFs or funds+ETFs we there seems to be some overfitting, since the validation error was much larger than the training error. In order to address this would could include me features from the dataset. There is likely some hidden factor that would account for this, see the weaknesses discussed in the beginning. \n\nFor future work I might look into using more features explore how this affects the predicts, and maybe to improve the performance of the ETF case. Trying to outperform a more advanced benchmark than optimal guessing would also be interesting.","1eaaa4b9":"### 3.1 Independent Correlation\nFirst we check the correlation matrix to see whether ther is any correlation between the ESG data and the YTD return. This is simply to spot any obvious correlation.\n\nThe YTD return seems independent for both funds and ETFs. It is close to zero for all. The only exception seems to be environmental score which had a weak _negative_ correlation for ETFs. \n\nHowever this is under the assumption that the variables are independent, which they are not as the matrix clearly shows. Thus we still might discover something if we try to dig further.","d74d20ff":"## 3. Return and ESG\nIn this section we try to find out whether ESG is useful in predicting the YTD return. I chose YTD return since I don't have historic ESG data, thus comparing returns for e.g. 2017 might not be relevant.","0690e970":"And find that it is not true for all but they seem similar, enought that we look into it in the Appendix, but in short it does not seem to be the same data.

Especially when using the fund data ($>0.8$ for all), for ETFs it's a bit more mixed, there the correlation is $0.4-0.8$.\n\nWe plot some correlations below, but first we must add a flag to make the ETF data distinct from the fund data. We also notice that there seems to be different biases in the data, ETFs have lower values.","1ce73700":"\n## 1.
