It is often used to help disambiguate natural language phrases because it can be done quickly with high accuracy. Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis (for example, _dis_-count as a noun vs dis-_count_ as a verb), for information retrieval, and for word sense disambiguation.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll use the [Pomegranate](http:\/\/pomegranate.readthedocs.io\/) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a \"universal\" tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve [>96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora](http:\/\/www.coli.uni-saarland.de\/~thorsten\/publications\/Brants-ANLP00.pdf). Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more. \n\n![_post-hmm.png](attachment:_post-hmm.png)","52fbdebb":"### IMPLEMENTATION: Sequence Ending Counts\nComplete the function below to estimate the bigram probabilities of a sequence ending with each tag.","4348c7e6":"### Evaluating Model Accuracy\n\nThe function below will evaluate the accuracy of the MFC tagger on the collection of all sentences from a text corpus. ","66bb8705":"## Step 1: Read and preprocess the dataset\n---\nWe'll start by reading in a text corpus and splitting it into a training and testing dataset. The data set is a copy of the [Brown corpus](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brown_Corpus) (originally from the [NLTK](https:\/\/www.nltk.org\/) library) that has already been pre-processed to only include the [universal tagset](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1104.2086.pdf). You should expect to get slightly higher accuracy using this simplified tagset than the same model would achieve on a larger tagset like the full [Penn treebank tagset](https:\/\/www.ling.upenn.edu\/courses\/Fall_2003\/ling001\/penn_treebank_pos.html), but the process you'll follow would be the same.\n\nThe `Dataset` class provided in helpers.py will read and parse the corpus. You can generate your own datasets compatible with the reader by writing them to the following format. The dataset is stored in plaintext as a collection of words and corresponding tags. Each sentence starts with a unique identifier on the first line, followed by one tab-separated word\/tag pair on each following line. Sentences are separated by a single blank line.\n\nExample from the Brown corpus. \n```\nb100-38532\nPerhaps\tADV\nit\tPRON\nwas\tVERB\nright\tADJ\n;\t.\n;\t.\n\nb100-35577\n...\n```"}}
