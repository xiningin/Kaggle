What is new rate of increase per case per day?","07b494cf":"*Observation*:\n\n1. China is the major sufferer and has been prime victime of Covid-19,and has first confirmed case in December. Since this dataset has data from 22 January onwards, number of confirmed cases by then reached was 533. *Italy on the other hand confirmed its first 2 cases on 31 January 2020- a month later than China and it took nearly 26 days from that day to reach incidence of 453 Confirmed Cases. Since, number of confirmed cases has increased by nearly 21% on day to day basis.\n\n2. On the other hand, USA has quite early confirmation of first report of CoronaVirus which was probably from a traveller from China to USA in early January. By 24th February, US had 36 cases and reached 400+ cases by 12 March. Since, then number of confirmed cases rose significantly in US. The number of confirmed cases in US is increasing by average of 50% every day. While number of daily confirmed cases in all countries are stabilized, the number of confirmed cases in USA is on exponential rise.\n\n3. Netherlands has a very different trajectory. Netherland has its first confirmed case of 27 February 2020. This date is very very late as compared to earlier confirmation period from US and Italy. However, it took just 12 days for US to cross 500 confirmed cases. This is major loophole indication in Netherland surveillance system. Number of Confirmed cases in Netherlands is also increasing by average of 20%.\n\n4. India on the other hand, detected its forst case on 30 January 2020 which is quite close to first confirmed case detection in Italy. However, its 500th case confirmed on 24 March 2020. There might be various reasons for this which is unconfirmed but are probably:\n                         * Less number of tests\n                         * Poor surveillance and detection\n                         * Less number of arrival from infected persons\n                         * Better control mechanism\n \n However, India has started showing the trends like other countries and number of daily reported cases are increasing . However, as compared to number of tests in other countries, number of tests in India are significantly lower.\n                         \n5. Overall exponential curve is visible with or without china's data. China's new confirmed cases has been low which according to its state agencies and WHO is because of strict enforcement of social distancing. But, number of cases are increasing cumulatively around the globe exponentially.\n\n6. Though, there is a huge variation in Rate of increase in number of new cases reporting on daily basis. The stark contrast comes in term of China which reported highest number of new cases reporting i.e. 15079 on 13 February 2020 and suddenly new cases reporting decreased to 6415 on 14 February 2020. Since, the number of case increase was on average was 40%. Sudden decrease of new case reporting since then by 57% is a strange phenomenon. It might be because of floowing hypothesis according to my understanding:\n\n                         * Citywide lockdown imposed in Wuhan on 22 January started showing its impact                                    and China succeedeed in containing Virus. This has an assumption that   \n                            spread before from virus was not contious and China tracked every infected \n                            patient.\n                         * China has stopped reporting actual infected numbers. Real time tracking was \n                           curbed.\n\n7. Comparing graph of confirmed cases shows a similar picture with average of 20% increase in new patients daily, as compared to US which showed sudden increase.","5f7019d7":"**Out of 180 countries data, we have only 8 countries who has given Province wise data for Corona confirmed and fatalities.
