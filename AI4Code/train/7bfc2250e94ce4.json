However, often we want to group our data, and then do something specific to the group the data is in. We do this with the `groupby` operation.\n\nIn these exercises we'll apply groupwise analysis to our dataset.\n\n# Relevant Resources\n- [**Grouping Reference and Examples**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/grouping-and-sorting-reference).  \n- [Pandas cheat sheet](https:\/\/github.com\/pandas-dev\/pandas\/blob\/master\/doc\/cheatsheet\/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)","f1ad50eb":"The rest of the exercises are visual.\n\n**Exercise 4**: Are there significant differences in the average scores assigned by the various reviewers?
