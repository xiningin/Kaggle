If we release a movie with these characteristics, it gives people high expectations from this movie. This was just one example of an influantial factor that would lead to different results, there are many that have to be taken care of.\n- During the data cleaning process, I split the data seperated by '|' into lists for easy parsing during the exploration phase.

There is a good possibility that movies with higher investments result in better revenues.\n- Correlation = 0.68\n\nI can't find a relationship here. The revenues don't seem to change with higher vote average.\n\n**Plot 2: Popularity vs Revenue **\n\nThe revenue seems to be increasing with popularity. We can say that if the popularity of movie is high then the revenue of the movie may be high.\n- Correlation = 0.62\n\n**Plot 3: Vote Average vs Revenue **\n\nThe correlation between revenue and vote average is **0.2069**. So vote average is not highly related to the revenue.\n\n**Plot 4: Runtime vs Revenue **\n\nThe correlation between revenue and runtime is **0.2378**. So runtime is not highly related to the revenue.","3b8ddfe9":"### Data Cleaning (Removing The Unused Information From The Dataset)\n> #### Information That We Need To Delete Or Modify\n1.
