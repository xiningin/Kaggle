In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the <b>most probable class<\/b> for that data point. For this, we use <b>Logistic Regression<\/b>.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success alertsuccess\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n<font size = 3><strong>Recall linear regression:<\/strong><\/font>\n<br>\n<br>\n    As you know, <b>Linear regression<\/b> finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, <b>y<\/b>, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n<br><br>\n$$\ny = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 + \\cdots\n$$\n<br>\nand finds the values of parameters $\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2$, etc, where the term $\\theta_0$ is the \"intercept\". It can be generally shown as:\n<br><br>\n$$\n\u210e_\\theta(\ud835\udc65) = \\theta^TX\n$$\n<p><\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n\nLogistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, <b>y<\/b>, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n\nLogistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function \ud835\udf0e:\n\n$$\n\u210e_\\theta(\ud835\udc65) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) =  \\frac {e^{(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 +...)}}{1 + e^{(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 +\\cdots)}}\n$$\nOr:\n$$\nProbabilityOfaClass_1 =  P(Y=1|X) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) = \\frac{e^{\\theta^TX}}{1+e^{\\theta^TX}} \n$$\n\nIn this equation, ${\\theta^TX}$ is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), `exp` is the exponential function and $\\sigma(\\theta^TX)$ is the sigmoid or [logistic function](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Logistic_function), also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve).\n\nSo, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic\/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability:\n\n<img\nsrc=\"https:\/\/ibm.box.com\/shared\/static\/kgv9alcghmjcv97op4d6onkyxevk23b1.png\" width=\"400\" align=\"center\">\n\n\nThe objective of __Logistic Regression__ algorithm, is to find the best parameters \u03b8, for $\u210e_\\theta(\ud835\udc65)$ = $\\sigma({\\theta^TX})$, in such a way that the model best predicts the class of each case.","d68daec5":"### jaccard index\nLets try jaccard index for accuracy evaluation. we can define jaccard as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two label sets.

However, while the actual label of 9 customers were 1, the classifier predicted those as 0, which is not very good.

So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. A good thing about confusion matrix is that shows the model\u2019s ability to correctly predict or separate the classes.
