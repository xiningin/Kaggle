Description:**\n\nOur case study starts with the medical subdomain **\u201cheart disease\u201d**. The first piece of code takes the raw sentences from the v7 dataset and outputs relevant bigrams\/trigrams related to risk factors of a particular subdomain in medicine. Each sentence is put through **Allen Ai's python nlp package** for biomedical\/scientific\/clinical data processing. The package processes each sentence, tokenizing only parts of the sentence that represents some useful named entity (NER: named entity recognition). \n\nThen those list of entities are processed by sci scapys \"UmlsEntityLinker\". This cross reference the named entity with any entity in the **Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)** which is developed by the National Institutes of Health. The purpose of this is to correctly distinguish any useful entity with something that has a medical connotation. If an entity receives a medical concept id, it then is then convert into an **ICD code**. ICD code is International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, one of many standardized medical terminology bases. The useful thing about ICD code is that it presents any medical term in a **hierarchical organization**, such that anything related to heart disease will be group together and have a common code denomination.\n\nThe notebook then captures only the ICD codes that fit within the ICD code range pertaining to what the user requires bigrams\/trigrams of. The **advantages** of such a complicated search for bigrams\/trigrams is that the output is something that can be traced back and is also backed by actual medical terminology. Furthermore, simpler methods of ngram search wouldn\u2019t find as many bigrams given that medical terminology don\u2019t follow conventional naming and would be hard press to grab such granularity.\n\n**2. Input:** \n\nThe medical subdomain \u201cheart disease\u201d. In the ICD code, heart disease is in category I (for circulatory diseases) and section 5-52.\n\n**3. Output:**\n\nA list of n-grams that correspond to heart diseases. Some examples that are generated are \u201caortic valve stenosis\u201d, \u201crheumatic heart disease\u201d, and \u201ccongestive heart failure\u201d.\n\nLink to code:

Selecting a single date will populate the map with the number of COVID cases up until that date. For example, if the date April 12 is selected, then the COVID statistics will display the accumulated cases up until April 12, and not the number of new cases\/recoveries\/deaths on April 12 only. Therefore, even though the visualization has a built-in slider to accommodate date range, it does not work correctly yet. Date ranges will be incorporated into future functionality. The Group B data at that given date will also be displayed (for climate data, and not applicable to demographic data).\n\n\n## Climate Metrics\n![](http:\/\/)\n\nThere are a variety of layers included in display group B to represent climate such as average temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, etc. A color spectrum is then used to mark regions depending on the value of the numerical climate metric measure. Currently, we have comprehensive climate data available for visualization only in the country of Italy (none of the other countries can be analyzed with this tool yet). The climate data for each region can be accessed by hovering the mouse over one of the colored dots inside the map view (the climate summary for the selected layer will be displayed above the cursor).\n\nSources:\n* Corona Data Scraper - https:\/\/coronadatascraper.com\/#home\n* NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) POWER project: https:\/\/power.larc.nasa.gov\/\n\n**WHAT IT DOES:*\n\nThis chart displays Italy\u2019s  municipal regions\u2019 covid-19 information and the corresponding climate condition for a given date.\n\nThis chart gives following INFORMATION of the region:\n* Number Covid Cases\n* Region Name\n* Number of Active Cases\n* Number of Deaths\n* Number of test conducted\n\nAnd ONE of the below CLIMATE conditions of that region is displayed:\n* Average Temperature\n* Minimum Temperature\n* Maximum Temperature\n* Relative Humidity\n* Pressure\n \n \n## Demographic Metrics\nhttps:\/\/juancalvo.carto.com\/builder\/b1b0b61e-acdc-4cc1-b47f-93c4a97b664d\/embed\n\n\nThis visualization shows various population demographic data from regional age and gender distributions to population density.\nThe options on the left are best when only using one selection from each group:\nGroup A - Age, Gender\nGroup B - COVID-19 cases: Total, Active, Recovered and Deaths\nGroup C - Regional Population Density of average number of people per square kilometer.\n\n**Group A**\nAge and gender\/sex distributions:\n\n9 age distribution brackets: 0-9, 20-29, 30-39, 30-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+\n\nThe order goes from top left like you would read a book. If a region had a uniform distribution of ages they would all be white dots, so this example from Emilia-Romagna shows a lower proportion of under 29\u2019s and an over representation of 40-59 year olds.\n\nGender\/sex distribution, 0.5 would be equal distribution. Is displayed with male on the left and female on the right, equal would make both white though the deviation is only small, on average most countries have slightly more women than men, except places like China that had long term policies that affected it.\n\n\n**Group B**\nThese allow different options to show regional counts for COVID-19\u2019s: Cumulative tested cases, number of active cases, number of recovered patients and number of deaths.\n\nThis is displayed as a circle in the centre of a region, the size displays the relative count.\n\n**Group C\nThis option only has one choice that colours the regions to display the population density measured in people per square kilometer.\n\n\n**Sources**\n* Population by different regional levels: http:\/\/demo.istat.it\/pop2019\n* Italian communes to province mapping: https:\/\/www.istat.it\/it\/archivio\/6789#Elencodeicodiciedelledenominazionidelleunitterritoriali-0\n* Cartographic data: https:\/\/www.istat.it\/it\/archivio\/222527\n\n\n**Errata**\n\nIn the climate visualization, the humidity data is missing some data points in specific Italian regions, and in the database, if there is a missing data point, the database records the humidity value as -999 instead of NaN.

Task Overview <a id=\"task_overview\"><\/a>\n\nA major topic of interest among researchers is the study of the various risk factors related to COVID-19. A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of being infected, or affects the severity or the survival outcome of the infection. Many of the papers in the dataset are studies on the severity and outcome of the infection, without, however, any systematic documentation that would be easily searchable.\n\nThe focus of this study is to extract and present in a meaningful and easily accessible way scientific papers that are related to risk factors associated with viral diseases through a procedure that can be automated as much as possible. \n\nAt the current stage, a semi-automated approach is implemented using manual review of retrieved papers. It is important to note that through the proposed procedure a small subset of papers is manually reviewed, the ones that are identified as most probable to be relevant to a specific risk factor. This brings the volume of papers for review down to less than 100-200 instead of multiple thousands, rendering the review task feasible in much shorter timeframes.\n\nAlso, at the current stage the paper extraction is limited to the following factors:\n* Environmental: Pollution, Population Density, Humidity, Temperature\n* Comorbidity: Heart diseases\n* Demographics: Senior age\n* Lifestyle: Smoking\n\nThe above risk factors were identified as being the most important by the medical community. An extensive list of risk factors is provided under [section 4](#risk_factors) below and is subject of a future extension of this study.\n","a1710ec9":"# 5. Defining Workflow <a id=\"task_workflow\"><\/a>\n\nOur current workflow is a pipeline formed from a commensuration of our methodologies and strategies used to take one search keyword and, from this simple output, generate a few papers (no more than 10) from the CORD-19 dataset that are specific and super-relevant to the keyword. Here is a high-level overview of our pipeline:\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n### The Stages in Detail\n-------\n\n**1. Produce N-gram synonyms:**\nBased on the initial input (currently not one keyword but a customized array of keywords chosen by MD input), this stage utilizes an assortment of linguistic\/medical packages to extend the initial input and search for synonymous\/similar N-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) in the CORD-19 database.\n\n**2. Search for N-grams in papers:**\nBased on the N-grams (output of the previous stage), this stage involves searching for the papers containing these N-grams inside the Abstract, Result, and Method sections of each paper. The search excludes body text as this section might contain rich content and lesser focus on the primary target of the research. It is also imperative that the papers also mention COVID or coronavirus-related infections for best results (coronavirus keywords are also currently inputted in the form of a custom array). After each paper undergoes a search using the N-grams list, the papers that have keyword mentions are filtered through as outputs of this stage. The number of papers that are outputted for each risk factor usually does not exceed 200 papers.\n\n**3. Quality Assessment - Medical Annotators:**\nIn this stage, the output papers from the previous stage undergo a manual examination to secure their place as relevant articles in the search. We have an amazing team of medical students who are helping with the annotations. The process of the annotation is detailed below:\n\n* Each article has associated with it the risk factor as predicted by the code.\n* The annotator reads the abstract of the paper\n* If the abstract contains the keyword as a risk factor (ex: \u201cPopulation density is correlated with\/influences ---\u201c), then the annotator deems the paper relevant.\n* If no, then the annotator reads the methods and results section of the paper\n* If the methods\/results section contains a mention of the keyword as a risk factor, then the annotator deems the paper relevant.\n* If no, then the paper is marked as not relevant\n* In addition, the annotators will comment on why they made their decision. For example, if they determined that the paper is relevant, they may state their reason as the phrase\/sentence that correlated the risk factor with infection. This will be useful in Phase 2 of our pipeline.\n\n### Degree of Automation\n--------\n\nCurrently, some parts of our workflow are automated, and some parts of our workflow are not automated. Here is a summary of automation currently implemented in our workflow:\n\n**1. Produce N-gram synonyms:**\n* Input keyword(s) - Currently, this is not automated. Custom keywords synonymous to the search topic are applied as inputs to the code that does this\n* Coronavirus keywords - Currently, this is not automated, but is pretty much a static array for COVID applications\n\n**2. Search for N-grams in papers:**\nThe search for N-grams is completely automated and will work for any general set of N-grams that are fed in as input.\n\n**3. Quality Assessment - Medical Annotators:**\nThis part of the process is not automated, but there is potential for this phase to be automated. Currently, our annotation process involves annotators commenting on why they made their decision. If we can take these reasonings and graft them into an NLP model, the model can serve as an artificial annotator to produce our golden papers in the output stage.\n\n### Portability\n--------\n\nThe clear advantage of our current workflow is that it can be used for a plethora of applications. Our team at CoronaWhy is not only focused on analyzing COVID-19, but is also interested in scaling our approach on researching COVID to other medical conditions as well. Simply plug in an array of cancer keywords as input, and a whole new field of research is analyzed by our pipeline. This is the power of our workflow: one pipeline can fit all.\n","bfb73f8d":"# 10.
