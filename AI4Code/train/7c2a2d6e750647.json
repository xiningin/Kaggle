It is not an alternative to actually taking the time to learn. What it aims to do is help someone get started fast and gain intuitive understanding of the typical steps early on","92068047":"## Step 3: Model and evaluate\nThis last step is three-fold.\n\nWe create the model and fit the model to the data we prepared for training.\n\nWe then proceed to classifying with the data we prepared for validation.\n\nLastly, we evaluate the model's performance with mainstream classification metrics.","76a11ef6":"## Step 2: Preprocess data and understand some more\nThis step typically takes the most time in the cycle but for our purposes, most of the datasets chosen in this series are clean.\n\nReal-world datasets are noisy and incomplete. The choices we make in this step to address data issues can impact downstream steps and the result itself. For example, it can be tricky to address missing data when we don't know why it's missing. Is it missing completely at random or not? It can also be tricky to address outliers if we do not understand the domain and problem context enough.","d610bd59":"## Step 0: Understand the problem\nWhat we're trying to do here is to classify whether a mushroom is a poisoned mushroom.","47ff1a8f":"## Learn more\nIf you found this example interesting, you may also want to check out:\n\n* [Machine learning in minutes - very fast fundamental examples in Python](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jamiemorales\/machine-learning-in-minutes-very-fast-examples)\n* [List of machine learning methods & datasets](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jamiemorales\/list-of-machine-learning-methods-datasets)\n\nThanks for reading.
