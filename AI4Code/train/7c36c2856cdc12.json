Unfortunately we don't have enough kernel memory to load the full dataset into memory; however we can get a glimpse at some of the statistics:","82210b94":"# Imports\nWe are using a typical data science stack: ``numpy``, ``pandas``, ``sklearn``, ``matplotlib``.","c30aeac8":"# TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge\n![](https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0V8CSoO23tw\/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nTalkingData is back with another competition: This time, our task is to predict where a click on some advertising is fraudlent given a few basic attributes about the device that made the click. What sets this competition apart is the sheer scale of the dataset: with 240 million rows it might be the biggest one I've seen on Kaggle so far.\n\nThere are some similarities with the last competition TalkingData launched: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics - that competition was about predicting the demographics of a user given their activity, and you can view this as a similar problem (predicting whether a user is real or not given their activity). However, that competition was plagued by a [leak](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/wiki\/Leakage) where the dataset wasn't sorted properly and certain portions of the dataset had different demographic distribtions. This meant that by adding the row ID as a feature you could get a huge boost in performance. Let's hope TalkingData have learnt their lesson this time around. \ud83d\ude09\n\nLooking at the evaluation page, we can see that the evaluation metric used is** ROC-AUC** (the area under a curve on a Receiver Operator Characteristic graph).\nIn english, this means a few important things:\n* This competition is a **binary classification** problem - i.e. our target variable is a binary attribute (Is the user making the click fraudlent or not?) and our goal is to classify users into \"fraudlent\" or \"not fraudlent\" as well as possible\n* Unlike metrics such as [LogLoss](http:\/\/www.exegetic.biz\/blog\/2015\/12\/making-sense-logarithmic-loss\/), the AUC score only depends on **how well you well you can separate the two classes**. In practice, this means that only the order of your predictions matter,\n    * As a result of this, any rescaling done to your model's output probabilities will have no effect on your score. In some other competitions, adding a constant or multiplier to your predictions to rescale it to the distribution can help but that doesn't apply here.\n  ","733f77f6":"### Imputation strategies\n- Test- Time series imputation\n\n- Non-time-series specific method\n\n- Mean imputation\n\n- Median imputation\n\n- Mode imputation\n\n- Calculate the appropriate measure and replace NAs with the values.\n\n- Appropriate for stationary time series, for example, white noise data\n\n- Random sample imputation replace missing values with observations randomly selected from the remaining (either of it or just some section of it)\n\n### Time-Series specific method\n- Last observation carried forward (LOCF)\n- Next observation carried backward (NOCB)\n\nA good article is Data Cleaning: A guide to dealing with NA values: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/data-cleaning-guide-dealing-na-values-karan-rajwanshi\/ Talk about types of missing data:\n\n- Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)\n- Missing at Random (MAR)\n- Missing Not at Random (MNAR)","3db24aa8":"# Target Distribution","ca3a9bfa":"##  Encoded variables statistics\n\nAlthough the actual values of these variables aren't helpful for us, it can still be useful to know what their distributions are.

This has likely been done because data such as IP addresses are sensitive, although it does unfortunately reduce the amount of feature engineering we can do on these.\n* The `attributed_time` variable is only available in the training set - it's not immediately useful for classification but it could be used for some interesting analysis (for example, one could fill in the variable in the test set by building a model to predict it).\n\nFor each of our encoded values, let's look at the number of unique values:","ce44760f":"Package called missingno (https:\/\/github.com\/ResidentMario\/missingno) ``!pip install quilt``","a81365e5":"### Nullity Matrix\nThe msno.matrix nullity matrix is a data-dense display which lets you quickly visually analyse data completion\n\n","30f9a8f9":"Test set","17b0846a":"# The end","9049e692":"Training set","737eaa46":"### Heatmap\nThe missingno correlation heatmap measures nullity correlation: how strongly the presence or absence of one variable affects the presence of another:"}}
