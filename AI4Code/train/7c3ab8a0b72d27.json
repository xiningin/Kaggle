Rarely, they turn into melanoma or other skin cancers. A nevus that changes shape, grows bigger or darkens should be evaluated for removal.\n\n* **Melanoma** :- We already know what this is.\n\n* **Seborrheic keratosis** :- A non-cancerous skin condition that appears as a waxy brown, black or tan growth.A seborrhoeic keratosis is one of the most common non-cancerous skin growths in older adults.\n\n* **Lentigo NOS** :- A typen of skin cancer that appears on your trunk, arms, and legs. Lentigo often starts at birth or during childhood. The spots can go away in time.\n\n* **Lichenoid keratosis** :- Lichenoid keratosis is a skin condition that typically occurs as a single, small, raised plaque, thickened area, or papule.This condition is harmless. However, in some cases lichenoid keratosis can be mistaken for other kinds of skin conditions, including skin cancers.\n\n* **Solar lentigo** :- Solar lentigo is caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. This type is common in people over age 40, but younger people can get it, too. It happens when UV radiation causes pigmented cells called melanocytes in the skin to multiply. Solar lentigo appears on sun-exposed areas of the body, like the face, hands, shoulders, and arms. The spots may grow over time.\n\n* **Cafe-au-lait macule** :- A caf\u00e9-au-lait macule is a common birthmark, presenting as a hyperpigmented skin patch with a sharp border and diameter of > 0.5 cm.\n\n* **Atypical melanocytic proliferation** :- Atypical Melanocytic lesions are irregular moles and skin spots that require further examination. The five visual characteristics used to identify an atypical melanocytic lesion are the same as the characteristics used to identify signs of invasive melanoma.","2d9c50ad":"* We have more benign cases than malignant.\n* About 98.2% are benign cases and only 1.8% malignant cases are there in train dataset.\n* We can clearly see , there is imbalance in class data.\n* This we need to keep in mind while model building.","0bd7b6fe":"## Dataset Info","38cb9e39":"* From nevus , we see that the moles are concentrated and not spread out .Showing no signs of malignant.","5e792550":"### Sex","c94a8cfe":"# Csv files","80d3a1de":"## Anatomy sites","f3970e93":"#### As we are predicting benign and malignant cases, let's look at these images.","fc3f44cf":"### Age","8104b689":"* In benign , we can see that it is concentrated and not spread out like me.\n* Also , the diameter is less.","d125107d":"Skin lesions grow on various parts of the body.\nIn the anatomy_site feature,skin lesions on six location has been given.\nLet's look at each part and study the images.","8964e731":"* In both train and test datasets , males are more than females.\n* If we relate it to target in the train dataset , then in both gender , there are more number of benign cases.","abeb7b17":"* Malignant images have some irregularities and also change in shapes and diameter.\n* Difference can be clearly seen in torso,palms,soles,genital and extremities sites.\n"}}
