Since WiFI access points are fixed to the building, they do not\nmove. Therefore a BSSID, in whichever path it appears in the dataset, is uniquely tied to one floor number.\n\nWe know from the training data, who (= a person on the path) received a WiFi signal from a particular WiFi access point (= BSSID. hereafter we use 'BBSID' and 'WiFi access point' interchangeably). We also know from the training data, on which floor this person was at the time of the signal reception. In this way, we can assign one floor to a particular BSSID.\n\nOne problem is that a person sometimes pick up a WiFi signal from the floors on which the person is not located, because WiFi signals can go through walls and floors, and a part of the building where the floor is removed to connect the adjacent stories.\n\nHowever, if we select those signal-reception events with strong signals (= large RSSI), the person should be close to the WiFi access point, and therefore the chances are high that the person is on the same floor with this WiFi access point. By selectively looking at the floor information in such large-signal reception-events, we can tie a BSSID to a particular floor with better accuracy.\n\nOnce we created a table of BSSIDs with the information on which floor they are in the building, we can use the table to assign a floor to a path in the test data by looking at the set of BSSIDs that are show up along the path.\n\nAgain the set of BSSIDs in a particular path could be contaminated by WiFi access points on other floors. We again selectively look at the signal-reception events with strong signals (= large RSSI) to filter out unexpected signal receptions from other floors.\n\nIn this notebook, the data analysis goes as follows.\n\n1. We pick up one site. \n2. List up all BSSID-RSSI pairs (=reception events), regardless on which paths they happen.\n3. Group the list by BSSID, and select 8 pairs (the number is arbitrary) that have strongest RSSI.\n4. Look at on which floor the pair happens.\n5. Now one BSSID has 8 entires of the floor. Let them vote, and find the floor that occurred most often. Assign this floor as the location of this BSSID.\n6. Use a validation set, and predict the floor of a particular path, using their BSSIDs that show up along the path.\n\n## Conclusion\nThere is one parameter we had to adjust, which is the number of signal-reception events to be included in the procedure 6. Once the number is tweaked, the prediction of the floor was perfect for the first building we tried (= zero error).\n \nOptimal number of votes that should be considered in the procedure 6 likely differs building by building. It makes sense as the range of WiFi signal differs depending on the structure of a building. It is worthwhile tuning the parameter, because the errors in the floor predictiosn cost more than those in the two dimensional positions.\n\n## Acknowledgement\nI used the data published by @kokitanisaka\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kokitanisaka\/create-unified-wifi-features-example\n\nThis notebook is inspired by the work of @nigelhenly \nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/nigelhenry\/simple-99-accurate-floor-model","46af11c5":"__Let us pick up one site.__ When we put the notebook in production, here is the part we have to change, and loop.
