all, I'd like to downsample dominant target class to reduce imbalance.\nTypically, we don't need 1:1 ratio of positive to negative class, because that will most likely result in considerable information loss, however, I'll use it here to speed up development.","137aa8f1":"Also it's worth doing cardinality check, as noted in the beginning of the section, categorical variables with many levels can cause issues for tree based algorithms, especially when One Hot Encoding is applied.\n    There's only a single variable, which has close to 60 categories, which is not too bad, so One Hot Encoding might actually be quite suitable in this case.","d2b58c24":"# Target encoding\nAnother popular way of dealing with categoricals is Target Encoding, which basically includes information about the mean of the dependent variable as it relates to particular category.
