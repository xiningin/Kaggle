Country & Salary","1ed27a7d":"- [My experience and thoughts on python visualization tools](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/general\/111519)\n\nAfter studying kaggle and ML, I wrote about my experiences and thoughts about visualization tools. Many thanks for making a good kernel that helped me to study a lot.\n\n> Experts are good at visualizing any library.\n\n- **[matplotlib](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/)** : basic to Python visualization, but apart from light plotting. Of course a lot of customization is possible, but I think it's a good idea to do it from the beginning. However, they are often used together with other packages, so knowing their overall structure makes them more useful. (The elements and positions of titles, axes, ax, etc., as if you are good at css and js, can feel free to use other packages.) + For pandas visualizations, import into matplotlib.\n\n\n- **[seaborn](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/index.html)** : It is a visualization tool based on matplotlib, which makes it much easier and allows various plots. It's probably the most used tool for kaggle right now. There are a lot of parts that work with matplotlib, so it's best to use them together. (a variety of attractions including lmplot, boxplot, barplot, countplot, violinplot, pariplot, FacetGrid, etc.)\n\n- **[plotly.express](https:\/\/plot.ly\/python\/plotly-express\/)** : I think it's a library between plotly and seaborn, and I personally think it's the best visualization library. The downside is that the official documentation is still unorganized, but I still think it's the best visualization tool.\n\n- **[plotly](https:\/\/plot.ly\/python\/), [bokeh](http:\/\/docs.bokeh.org\/en\/0.13.0\/)** : For those who are new to it, this tool will show you a new world of visualization. Enable interactive visualization. Of course, there is a lot of computation, which slows down the browser. Personally, bubble charts and bar charts are useful. Three-dimensional mapping is also attractive across domains. It seems that plotly is used more frequently than bokeh. Probably because of a browser problem.\n\n\n- **[altair](https:\/\/www.altair.com\/)** : Unlike plotly and bokeh, an interactive library specialized for heatmaps and barplot. It's relatively fast, the default design is pretty, and it's a specialized visualization. However, it is not recommended to use complicated setting.\n\n- **[plotnine](https:\/\/plotnine.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/)** (ggplot): This tool allows you to use ggplot in Python, which is familiar to R users. Few people use R and Python at the same time, so it doesn't seem to be used much.\n\n- **basemap, pygmap, geopandas, and folium** : A variety of python tools for displaying maps. All three are a bit uncomfortable for me. The advantage is that you can still plot the map.\n\nNow it's a bit minor, but if you briefly mention the packages you found while exploring kaggle:\n\n- **[squarify](https:\/\/github.com\/laserson\/squarify)** : A tool for drawing treemaps in python. It's based on matplotlib and personally my favorite plot.\n\n- **[wordcloud](https:\/\/github.com\/amueller\/word_cloud)** : It is a famous visualization method in text data, and it is a tool for mapping text according to frequency.  You can proceed the wordcloud to a specific vector image frame, which makes it an attractive tool.\n\n- **[missingno](https:\/\/github.com\/ResidentMario\/missingno)** : Tool to visualize empty data in the data. It is good to be able to see pattern and sparseness of null data.\n\n- **[NetworkX](https:\/\/networkx.github.io\/)** : A good tool for plotting graphs. There are many uses in certain areas such as GNN.\n\n- **[pywaffle](https:\/\/github.com\/gyli\/PyWaffle), venn** : A tool to draw unusual charts and band diagrams called waffle charts. Although not used much, there is no replaceable plotting, which makes it very useful.\n\nVisualizations often help model interpretation, such as:\n\n- **[dtreeviz](https:\/\/github.com\/parrt\/dtreeviz)** : One of the more efficient visualization tools for decision trees. I have posted this before, and it helps me to interpret it by graphing the classifiers and their status.\n\n\n- **[SHAP](https:\/\/github.com\/slundberg\/shap), [LIME](https:\/\/github.com\/marcotcr\/lime)** : Two of the most famous methods and visualizations for interpretable AI. Both aim to visualize the interpretation of the model.

That's why it's important to learn intuition and mathematical concepts in the classic ML.\n- Ensemble \n    - stacking, bagging, GBMs\n    - XGBoost -> LightGBM -> CatBoost\n    - LGBM seems to be the trend now.\n- Deep learning \n    - Personally I recommend starting with Keras or Pytorch.\n","324729d4":"Recently, the Colab GPU was upgraded to P100. Personally, I prefer the Kaggel notebook because of CSS.

Age & Salary\n\nI think Age & Salary is 'almost' numerical data, so I can draw scatter(bubble plot)","9d18a872":"The average amount is estimated as follows. (If the distribution within the interval is normally distributed, we thought we would use the median.)","38cd0f23":"I can see that Python has the most and follows a similar pattern depending on the person's career.\n\nI started Algorithm Problem Solving in C ++, now I'm working on several DS \/ AI fields with Python, and web development with JS.\n\nI also recommend Python for the first starter. There are no languages as good as Python in terms of versatility and difficulty.","b295d022":"## 3. How about ML Frameworks & Tools?\n\n> Q25.
