So for example the predicted salary corresponding to eight years of experience is about you know one hundred thousand dollars per year.\n\nSo that's how it works.\n\nAnd so we can clearly see that our predicted salaries are very close. The real salaries you know for most of them but that's on the training set. Remember that's important because our model was actually trained with these observations, with these years of experience and salaries. Now what we would like to observe is if we had the same result, the same closeness of the regression line to the real salaries in the test set with which the model wasn't trained. And that's exactly what this below graphic will tell us because now we're about to plot this time the real salaries of the test set and the predicted salaries of the same test set.\n","463e04a4":"Predicting the Test Set Results","597669cf":"We have Seperated Features and Dependent Variable from Dataset","f7373619":"So our model are simple in our regression model was able to do a wonderful job at predicting new observations. However just remember that the reason why we get such a good regression line here is simply because there was a linear relationship in the data set between the features and the dependent variable of the data set other words we had a perfectly linear dataset.\n\nIn other words we had a dataset with linear correlations and what I want to make sure you understand is that these results won't happen for any dataset, because of course you'll get to work on data with non-linear relationships. And for these data you will need a nonlinear model.\n\nSo, that concludes the basics of Simple Linear Regression Model.
