This can happen in two scenarios, the first is that we have two different types of stores, or that the value has changed with time.\n\nAs we are looking at a time series, our hipothesis is that the value has changed with time.","3005355b":"Here, we can notice that there is a certain seasonality. It appears that people don't tend to keep inventory for winter, which seems counter intuitive.\n\nLast but not least, let's look at the last 10 years","8cd5ea4f":"Our hipothesis seems right. We can easily notice a decreasing pattern until the years of 2007 to 2009, where it peaked and then slowly started to go up again.\n\nWe can also verify if this ratio has some kind of seasonality. For this, we will evaluate the last 2 years month by month.","8afb6ae6":"### Conclusion\n\nEconomic growth and crisis can cause a lot of impact in inventory management. We can notice that major economic shifts (2007\/2008 Crisis and the 2016 Elections) have affected the market in mostly negative ways. Although it tends to estabilize after a while.\n\nThat was a fun little research that I plan to extend in the near future.\n","b6919496":"The description of the data says that the columns realtime_start and realtime_end are automated columns from the day of the data extraction. Therefore we can remove both columns.\n\nAlso, we will index the data on date and assign all numeric values to numeric, since our info tells us that is an object.","1d34beae":"As our mean is smaller than the median, it may show some skewedness on our data. A visualization may help us identify what is going on.","70a8b82e":"## Initial Data Exploration\n\nOn this kernel we will take a look at the ratio between inventory and sales and how it changed throughout the years\n\n### Objective\nExplore the data"}}
