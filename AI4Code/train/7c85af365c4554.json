file","ef0fb146":"You'll notice that this code cell ran quite quickly. This is because of lazy evaluation. Spark does not actually execute the map step unless it needs to.\n\n\"RDD\" in the output refers to resilient distributed dataset. RDDs are exactly what they say they are: fault-tolerant datasets distributed across a cluster. This is how Spark stores data.\n\nTo get Spark to actually run the map step, you need to use an \"action\". One available action is the collect method. The collect() method takes the results from all of the clusters and \"collects\" them into a single list on the master node.","36be2afa":"# Users Downgrade Their Accounts\n\nLet's find when users downgrade their accounts and then flag those log entries.","4591cb3f":"# PySpark tutorial for beginners\n\n![pyspark.jpg](attachment:66ee4703-f3ec-4eb2-a789-947c5f5ebdf7.jpg)\n\nSpark is a  big data framework which contains libraries for data analysis, machine learning, graph analysis, and streaming live data. Spark is generally faster than Hadoop. This is because Hadoop writes intermediate results to disk whereas Spark tries to keep intermediate results in memory whenever possible.\n\nThe Hadoop ecosystem includes a distributed file storage system called HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Spark, on the other hand, does not include a file storage system. You can use Spark on top of HDFS but you do not have to. Spark can read in data from other sources as well such as Amazon S3.\n\nSpark doesn't implement MapReduce, you can write Spark programs that behave in a similar way to the map-reduce pattern.\n\n**Limitations of spark:**\n\n- Spark Streaming\u2019s latency is at least 500 milliseconds since it operates on micro-batches of records, instead of processing one record at a time. Native streaming tools such as Storm, Apex, or Flink can push down this latency value and might be more suitable for low-latency applications. Flink and Apex can be used for batch computation as well, so if you're already using them for stream processing, there's no need to add Spark to your stack of technologies.\n\n- Another limitation of Spark is its selection of machine learning algorithms. Currently, Spark only supports algorithms that scale linearly with the input data size. In general, deep learning is not available either, though there are many projects integrate Spark with Tensorflow and other deep learning tools.\n\n","65e7c14a":"# Reading and Writing Data with Spark\n","ed252f80":"# Drop Rows with Missing Values","b37aa137":"# Maps \nMaps take data as input and then transform that data with whatever function you put in the map. \nThey are like directions for the data telling how each input should get to the output.\n\nFirst, we need to create a SparkContext object.
