We can do this by predicting the happiness score of each country based on their GDP (and other factors), then comparing a countries actual happiness with their 'GDP predicted' happiness. This would even out the playing field and allow us to combine all countries when drawing the regression lines.\n\n## Adjusting for GDP\n\nTo predict the happiness of a country with a linear regression model we must check that there is infact a linear correlation.
