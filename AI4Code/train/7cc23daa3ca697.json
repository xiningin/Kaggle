We have a quite interesting dataset in here. It has nice features that I want to explore. These features are:\n\n1.     Ranking of the overal sales.\n1.     Name of the game.\n1.     Platform of the game got released.\n1.     Release year of the game.\n1.     Genre of the game.\n1.     Publisher of the game.\n1.     Total sales for North America, Europe, Japan and Global.\n\nHere are some questions that I think I can get answers to:\n\n1.     Which genre is the most popular over the globe?\n1.     Does culture have effect on game genre tendencies?\n1.     How is technological evolution effecting game sales?\n1.     Which company outranks others?\n1.     Do companies have tendencies about making same genre games?\n1.     Which gaming platform is the most popular?\n1.     Which gaming platform is for which genre?\n    ","8a329b4b":"* We can see that some genres are not suitable for every platform. For example even though shooter games are more popular than racing games it is available on fewer platforms.\n* Also, we see that strategy and puzzle games are not on many platform. There could be two reasons for this. First one is, already not many people were interested in these genres so why bother make them available on multiple platform? That would cost company unreasonable amount of money. And second one is, due to the nature of the games maybe it was not possible to develop them in many different platforms.","c9ba5ed9":"* As you can see North America nearly have half of the worlds total sales. So, its effect to the genre is huge. That is why we are seeing very similar genre approaches between North America and worldwide.\n* Europe on the other hand has small different tendencies. Europe like *shooting* games more than *platform* games. Other genres are similar to global.\n* Japan is the most unique one here. *Role-playing* games are huge on Japan. North America and Europe do not enjoy *role-playing* games that much. But I think more fascinating thing is very few people plays *shooting* games in Japan. When you look at other continents you expect some things should have certain thresholds but, nope.","15999072":"* When we look at genres of the games in different companies. We see that *Nintendo* has games in every genre and no other company has that wide range of genres in their games. Finally we can find reasons for *Nintendos* lead in the market.\n* Also we can see that TOP500 list companies really works heavy on *Action* games because people respond well to *action* games.\n* Least popular genres in TOP500 list are Puzzle and Strategy. Most of the people usually want to relax and ease up a little bit when they play games so this is not surprising.","422a2349":"**This was it for this notebook. We answered every question we asked in the beginning of the notebook. I try to analyze the data and make little assumptions along the way. I hope you like it and learn something from it. Take care.**","1e892e04":"* This is an interesting one here. Normally you would think that as years go by sales must follow that. **BUT** I think technology had a reverse effect here. Because technology allowed more detailed and magnificent games that game developers had to take their time to develop a game. So, as technology level increased it got harder and harder to develop games. By the way, this is just my opinion, I am not in this workfield or anything.","3b78039d":"<img src=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/xUPOqo6E1XvWXwlCyQ\/giphy.gif\">","d33a8c4d":"# What are the genres of the games of dominant companies?","6d01641b":"# How is technological evolutions over the years effecting the sales?","4768208f":"# ***GAMING* IS THE NEW BLACK..?**","76d6f991":"* Nintendo wins the market by nearly one million more total sales in the TOP500 list.\n* When we look at the data at first. We think that Nintendo dominates the market heavily because 17 of the first 20 best sold games are its but when we look at a different scale story little changed.","c828766c":"* It seems *platform* games leads the way. Followed by *shooter* games. Also it seems *advanture* games are the least favorite games to play.\n* Let's look at different parts of the world with this game genre feature. It will also look this way?","bed998a4":"# Which gaming platform is the most popular in people?","0262bb28":"# Which company is the most dominant in the market?","a94728f7":"# Which gaming platform is for which genre?","1975de44":"* Here we are looking at the TOP5000 games' platforms' global sale numbers. Even though PS2 and DS2 was the most developed platforms those numbers did not translate into sales. We see that GB platform has most sales in the globe. If I was working for a gaming company when this dataset was new, I would strongly recommend that we should do games in GB platform.","39c4dc64":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.gamedesigning.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/A6.jpg\">","b781084a":"# Which gaming platform is the most popular in companies?","a967e286":"* It seems companies heavily developed games for DS and PS2 platforms.
