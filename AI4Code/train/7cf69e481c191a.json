It occurred at 11:56 Nepal Standard Time(06:11:26 UTC) on 25 April 2015, with a magnitude of 7.8Mw and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Severe). Its epicenter was east of Gorkha District at Barpak, Gorkha, and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately 8.2 km (5.1 mi).\nSource:https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake\n\nMap2:Hourly Global Map of Earthquake Epicentres on December 26,2004\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami (also known as the Boxing Day Tsunami and, by the scientific community, the Sumatra\u2013Andaman earthquake occurred at 07:58:53 in local time(00:58:53 UTC) on 26 December, with an epicentre off the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 9.1\u20139.3 Mw, reaching a Mercalli intensity up to IX in certain areas. The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate.\n\nA series of massive tsunami waves grew up to 30 m (100 ft) high once heading inland, after being created by the underwater seismic activity offshore. Communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean were severely affected, and the tsunamis killed an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. The direct results caused major disruptions to living conditions and commerce in coastal provinces of surrounded countries, including Aceh, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, **Tamil Nadu, India** and Khao Lak, Thailand.\nSource:https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami\n\nMy hometown Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu is a coastal city.
