Worley\nReview Date:  2021-01-27\nIETF LC End Date:  2021-02-12\nIESG Telechat date:  [unknown]\n\nSummary:\n    This draft is basically ready for publication, but has nits that\n    should be fixed before publication.\n\nNits\/editorial comments:\n\n1.  Introduction\n\n   by marking basic emoji graphics\n\nProbably intended to be \"by marking with basic emoji graphics\".\n\n   Normative language, per [RFC8174]:\n\nIn most drafts, this material is placed in a separate section from the\nIntroduction.  Also, this draft contains a much longer version of this\nboilerplate than is common.\n\n2.  Reaction Content-Disposition\n\n   If such a field is specified the content-type of the part MUST be:\n\nProbably should be capitalized as \"Content-Type\".\n\n   The rule emoji_sequence is inherited from [Emoji-Seq].  It permits\n   one or more bytes to form a single presentation image.\n\nI haven't traced the definition of emoji_sequence, but it seems to be\nessentially a set of Unicode characters that have one or another of\ncertain attributes.  That is perfectly sensible.  But if I understand\ncorrectly, \"emoji_sequence\" is a sequence of characters, and you want\nto say \"In the UTF-8 encoding, some of these characters may be encoded\nas multiple bytes.\" or something like that.\n\n   The emoji(s) express a recipient's summary reaction to the specific\n   message referenced by the accompanying In-Reply-To header field.\n   [Mail-Fmt].\n\nThis is not specific as to where the In-Reply-To header is.  I assume\nyou want to say that it is a header of the parent multipart component\nof \"Reaction\" part.  Or perhaps this should be forward-referenced to\nthe discussion in section 3.\n\n   Reference to unallocated code points SHOULD NOT be treated as an\n   error; associated bytes SHOULD be processed using the system default\n   method for denoting an unallocated or undisplayable code point.\n\nCode points that do not have the requisite attributes to qualify as\npart of an emoji_sequence should also not be treated as an error,\nalthough you probably want to allow the system to alternatively\ndisplay them normally (rather than as an unallocated or undisplayable\ncode point).\n","e5720f62":"Skip to main content\n\nIETF logo\nAbout\nGroups\nInternet Engineering Steering Group\nThe Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) is responsible for technical management of IETF activities and the Internet standards process.\n\nThe IESG administers the process according to the rules and procedures that have been ratified by the Internet Society trustees [RFC 2026]. It is directly responsible for the actions associated with entry into and movement along the Internet \"standards track,\" including final approval of specifications as Internet Standards. \n\nThe IESG consists of the Area Directors (ADs) who are selected by the Nominations Committee (NomCom) and are appointed for two years. The process for choosing the members of the IESG is detailed in RFC 7437, \"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees.\"\n\nGeneral\nMembers | Areas | Directorates & Review Teams | Process Experiments | IESG Wiki\n\nTeleconferences\nAgenda | Documents on Future IESG Telechat Agendas | IESG Meeting Minutes | .ics Calendar of IESG Teleconferences | Webex Link\n\nStatements\nList All  |  On Mailing Lists | On Meetings | On Procedures | On Technical Issues\n\nIESG and the Standards Process\nRole of the IESG | How An AD Ballots | Announcements | Implementation Reports |\nInformational vs. Experimental Status | Document Shepherd Write-Up Templates\n\nAppeals and Posting Rights Actions\nRFC 2026 (see section 6.5) | Appeals to IESG | Appeals to IAB | IESG Statement On Appeals | List of PR-Actions\n\nBibliography\n[1]RFC 2026\nThe Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3\nThis memo documents the process used by the Internet community for the standardization of protocols and procedures.
