You can do more cool indexing, boolean sorting, etc. with all the different attributes available to manipulate the player dataset. If you play FIFA 19 maybe this could help you search up players and do interesting research. In terms of doing machine learning all you need to really know is how to import files and process them so you can train and test your models, you won't need to exactly analyze the data in a complex manner unless you want to.\n\n[Pandas Cheetsheet](https:\/\/assets.datacamp.com\/blog_assets\/PandasPythonForDataScience.pdf)\n\ncreated by rae385, for Coppell High School AI Club","6386460f":"The read_csv function gets the file and reads it into a DataFrame.
