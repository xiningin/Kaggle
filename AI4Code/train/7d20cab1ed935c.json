The writers were known to kill off and revive many of the superheroes so they were curious to know what data they could grab from the Marvel Wikia site, a fan-driven community site, to explore further. To learn how they collected their data, which is available on their Github repo, read the writeup they published on their site.\n\nWhile the FiveThirtyEight team has done a wonderful job acquiring this data, the data still has some inconsistencies. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to clean up their dataset so it can be more useful for analysis in Pandas. First things first: read our dataset into Pandas as a DataFrame and preview the first 5 rows to get a better sense of our data.","40daeba3":"We are interested in the number of total deaths each character experienced and we'd like a field containing that distilled information. Right now, there are 5 fields (Death1 to Death5) that each contain a binary value representing if a superhero experienced that death or not. For example, a superhero can experience Death1, then Death2, etc. until they were no longer brought back to life by the writers.\n\nWe'd like to coalesce that information into just one field so we can do numerical analysis more easily.\n\nCreate a new column, Deaths, that contains the number of times each superhero died. The possible values for each death field are YES, NO, and the Pandas NaN value used to represent missing data. Keep all of the original columns (including Death1 to Death5) and update true_avengers with the new Deaths column."}}
