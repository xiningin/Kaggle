Recursive feature elimination\n\nGiven an external estimator that assigns weights to features, recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a `coef_ attribute` or through a `feature_importances_` attribute. Then, the least important features are pruned from current set of features.That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached.\n\nReferences: <br>\nhttp:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/feature_selection.html <br>","5f4bab03":"<a id=\"t4.2.3.\"><\/a>\n### 4.2.3.

Passengers who boarded in Southhampton were marginally less likely to survive than those who boarded in Queenstown.  This is probably related to passenger class, or maybe even the order of room assignments (e.g. maybe earlier passengers were more likely to have rooms closer to deck). <br> It's also worth noting the size of the whiskers in these plots.  Because the number of passengers who boarded at Southhampton was highest, the confidence around the survival rate is the highest.  The whisker of the Queenstown plot includes the Southhampton average, as well as the lower bound of its whisker.  It's possible that Queenstown passengers were equally, or even more, ill-fated than their Southhampton counterparts.","f65de2fe":"Since \"Age\" is (right) skewed, using the mean might give us biased results by filling in ages that are older than desired. To deal with this, we'll use the median to impute the missing values. ","c178d4d3":"The age distribution for survivors and deceased is actually very similar.  One notable difference is that, of the survivors, a larger proportion were children.  The passengers evidently made an attempt to save children by giving them a place on the life rafts.
