Given that problem we need to define a way to map words to numbers. An easy way to do this is to use word embeddings, which is what was described above. Pytorch lets you incorporate your own word embeddings through a layer called the embedding layer. This layer is designed to map words directly with the emedding vectors as input. The only catch is that we have to individually map the words to indicies first.

(Obviously a car can't meow, but you get the idea) So why does any of this matter? Well in programming languages like Java and Python you can construct your own objects also referred to as classes. For example:","1ee697bc":"You may be wondering why the double import and the reason for this is that pytorch wraps all their deep learning layers under the nn package.
