I'm going to submit an answer where ALL users have zero revenue!\n\nWhy?\n* I believe the majority of users have zero revenue, thus predicting zero is acutally most accurate for most users.\n* 9,996 out of 714, 167 or 1.40% of users have revenue in the Train data set\n* This 'zero-answer' will then just test the error for this most basic case.\n* Of course, it should not win any prizes, but will be a great baseline.\n\nResults:\n* My RMS score after submitting is : 1.7804\n* This serves as a great baseline... If you don't do better than this, then your better off guessing zeros!\n\nHA! after submitting I can see many others with this exact same score... so my zeros idea is hardly unique!\nGreat thinkers, think alike?"}}
