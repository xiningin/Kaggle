So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`.

To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `df.iloc[0:1001]`.","04b3aef3":"Look at an overview of your data by running the following line","f35f1dcd":"# Set Up\n**Fork this notebook using the button towards the top of the screen.**\n\nRun the following cell to load your data and some utility functions","9b546a3a":"**Exercise 12**: <!--What is the distribution of reviews scores for the last 1000 wines in the dataset?--> Select the `points` column for the last 1000 wines."}}
