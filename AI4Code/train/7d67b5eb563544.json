Let's say that we want to know what fraction of images misclassified images contained hair, microscope's aperture, graduation scale etc.","ed638a93":"At any point of the inspection we can get the reslts dataframe by calling ```ii.get_results()```. Then we can use it to calculate fraction of errors falling into each category.","ec429388":"# Details\nLet's say that we have 1000 missclassified images. We suspect our models' poor performance on these images may be caused by the images being:\n- blurry\n- too bright\/dark\n\n\nKnowing what fraction of misclassified images falls into one of these categories may help us to improve the classifier e.g. by using appropriate augmentations, getting a more reliable dataset etc.\n\nHowever, inspecting 1000 images manually and writing it down in a spreadsheet would take too much time. Therefore, I decided to create a small package that will faciliate the whole process.","9d70850b":"# VERSION II\nThe coding part of this notebook was moved to this [github repo](https:\/\/github.com\/JanMalinowski\/image_inspector).","1c792ff3":"**Note: the navigation button work only inside of a running notebook.**","2c86f601":"# Motivation\nRecently I've been going through two great courses. First of them was Andrew Ng's [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/machine-learning-projects). The second one was the famous FasAi's course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders v4](https:\/\/course.fast.ai\/). \n\\\nAndrew Ng suggested a neat way of inspecting a dataset (more specifically misclassified images), while Jeremy Howard showed how such application can be created using ipywidgets."}}
