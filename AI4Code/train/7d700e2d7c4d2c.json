This is largely due to a 10 to 46 loss against the Chicago Bears in 1986. \n\nSome impressive point differentials include those of the Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, and Green Bay Packers. The Cowboys won two Super Bowls in the 70s and three more in the 90s. The 49ers' success throughout the 80s and 90s came mostly from legendary QB Joe Montana, HC Bill Walsh, and later wide receiver (WR) Jerry Rice. The Packers won the first two SBs ever under two-time SB MVP and QB Bart Starr.
