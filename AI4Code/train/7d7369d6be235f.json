The rules of this system have changed many times in the past. \n\nCurrently, round loss bonuses are based on a count of a team's round loss bonus. This count is increased by one after every loss and decreased by one after every win (minimum 0). The money returned after losing a round is:\n\n - 0 Losses: &dollar;1400;\n - 1 Loss: &dollar;1900;\n - 2 Losses: &dollar;2400;\n - 3 Losses: &dollar;2900;\n - 4+ Losses: &dollar;3400.\n\nPreviously to 2019, a win would reset the round loss bonus back to &dollar;1400 per player. Now, a win reduces the loss count by one.\nTeams begin the half with a loss count of 1, so that losing the pistol round is not as damaging to the economy.\n\nPlayers start the half with &dollar;800, which is enough to buy either armour or an improved pistol, but not both, nor better weapons. That is why rounds 1 and 16 are called pistol rounds.\n\nWinning a round by eliminations grants &dollar;3250 to the winning team. If the win was achieved by defusing the bomb as CT or by having it detonate as T, the reward is of 3500 dollars.\n\nAnother way of getting money in the match is by killing players in the opposing team. The money received per kill varies according to the weapon wielded:\n- &dollar;100: Sniper rifle kills;\n- &dollar;300: pistol, assault rifle and grenade kills;\n- &dollar;600: SMG kills;\n- &dollar;900: Shotgun kills;\n- &dollar;1500: Knife kills.","e054d4e7":"# Economy DataFrame","e85e8bcd":"As pointed out previously, <b>Nuke<\/b> is historically the least popular map in the pool.

Since its update, <b>Inferno<\/b> has actually been the most balanced map in this aspect.\n\n","0a48e317":"# Picks DataFrame","456e88ca":"This section is copied from the Dataset description.\n\nCounter-Strike Global Offensive is a game released in 2012, as a sequel to Counter-Strike Source (released in 2004), which is itself a sequel to the original Counter-Strike (released in 2000). The game's longevity is primarily caused by its competitive approach and vibrant professional scene. This longevity has shown in numbers recently, as CS:GO reached in March its all-time high concurrent weekly players (1.1M players), making it the most played game on Steam, 7 years after it was launched.\n\nThe game retains the same gameplay concepts since its first version, which include a Terrorist side (T) that is tasked to plant a bomb and have it detonate, and a Counter-Terrorist side (CT) that is tasked to defuse the bomb or prevent it from being planted. Both teams can also win a round by eliminating all players on the opposing team before the bomb is planted.\n\nA standard game of Counter-Strike is a best of 30 rounds, the winning team being the first to win 16 rounds. The 30 rounds are played in two halves of 15 on each side of the map, with a round time limit of 1 minute 55 seconds, plus 40 seconds after the bomb is planted.\n\nIn case both teams draw at the 30th round on 15x15, 6 more rounds are added-on, which constitutes overtime. The overtime ends if a team wins 4 out of 6 rounds. If both teams win 3 rounds in overtime, another overtime of 6 rounds is played, and the process might repeat indefinitely until one team wins it.\n\nThere are 7 maps in the map pool that are available to be played competitively at any given time. Maps are removed and added frequently for updates and revamps, as to not make the game stale. Matches are normally played as a 'bo3' (Best of 3) maps, with less important matches played in a 'bo1' fashion and finals often played as 'bo5's.\n\nThere is a money management side to rounds in Counter-Strike. This side is detailed in the 'Economy DataFrame' topic.","9fbb0b16":"In CS:GO, the most reputable tournaments are the Majors. These tournaments are normally played twice a year and have a prize pool of $1,000,000. More information about the subject can be seen here: https:\/\/liquipedia.net\/counterstrike\/Majors\n\nFor the next step, we are going to discretize the 'date' column in a dataframe into a 'time_period' column. This new column will refer to the most recently played major tournament.\n\nAs an example, following this binning technique, we are currently on the Berlin 2019 period, as that was the most recently played tournament.","03d711ca":"# Further exploration and predictions","5e9fb98f":"## Pistols ranking","ad60aec3":"There has long been a dispute in CS:GO to determine the most CT-sided maps, and always present discussion if having a heavily one-sided map is a desirable outcome.
