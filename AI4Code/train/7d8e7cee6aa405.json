Begin by clicking on the **Save Version** button in the top right corner of the window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n2. Ensure that the **Save and Run All** option is selected, and then click on the **Save** button.\n3. This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **Save Version** button.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen.  Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n4. Click on the **Output** tab on the right of the screen.  Then, click on the file you would like to submit, and click on the **Submit** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n\nYou have now successfully submitted to the competition!\n\nIf you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your code and repeat the process. There's a lot of room to improve, and you will climb up the leaderboard as you work.","402b1e18":"# Step 2: Load the data\n\nNext, we'll load the training and test data.  \n\nWe set `index_col=0` in the code cell below to use the `id` column to index the DataFrame.

If you took the **[Intermediate Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intermediate-machine-learning)** course, then you learned about **[XGBoost](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/xgboost)**.  Try training a model with XGBoost, to improve over the performance you got here.\n\n2. Take the time to learn about **Light GBM (LGBM)**, which is similar to XGBoost, since they both use gradient boosting to iteratively add decision trees to an ensemble.  In case you're not sure how to get started, **[here's a notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/svyatoslavsokolov\/tps-feb-2021-lgbm-simple-version)** that trains a model on a similar dataset.","b506238b":"# Step 3: Prepare the data\n\nNext, we'll need to handle the categorical columns (`cat0`, `cat1`, ... `cat9`).  \n\nIn the **[Categorical Variables lesson](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/categorical-variables)** in the Intermediate Machine Learning course, you learned several different ways to encode categorical variables in a dataset.
