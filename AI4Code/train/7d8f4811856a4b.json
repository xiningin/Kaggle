Country - this is the country for which the vaccination information is provided;\n2. Country ISO Code - ISO code for the country;\n3. Date- date for the data entry; for some of the dates we have only the daily vaccinations, for others, only the (cumulative) total;\n4. Total number of vaccin ations - this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country;\n5. Total number of people vaccinated - a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people;\n6. Total number of people fully vaccinated - this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme;\n7. Daily vaccinations (raw) - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date\/country;\n8. Daily vaccinations - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date\/country;\n9. Total vaccinations per hundred - ratio (in percent) between vaccination number and total population up to the date in the country;\n10. Total number of people vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population immunized and total population up to the date in the country;\n11. Total number of people fully vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population fully immunized and total population up to the date in the country;\n12. Number of vaccinations per day - number of daily vaccination for that day and country;\n13. Daily vaccinations per million - ratio (in ppm) between vaccination number and total population for the current date in the country;\n14. Vaccines used in the country - total number of vaccines used in the country (up to date);\n\n\nData Source - Kaggle;\n\nSource website - https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/gpreda\/covid-world-vaccination-progress\/","38428f2d":"## 4.

Which country developed the vaccine the fastest?**","30767efd":"From the above analysis and visualizations, we can conclude that:\n\n1. The rate of applying vaccines to the patients is highest in Isreal.\nConjecture: It is because of its small size (in terms of both area and population), a relatively young population, relatively warm weather in December 2020, a centralized national system of government, and well-developed infrastructure for implementing prompt responses to large-scale national emergencies.\n\n2. The United States has the most vaccinated people of around 60M of its total population followed by China and the United Kingdom.\nConjecture: Since these are developed countries the accessibility of the vaccine is easier to its public.\n\n3. Moderna, Pfizer\/BioNTech are the most popular vaccine used worldwide, since it has almost negligible side effects (known till date). Also, India uses Covaxin, Covishield for vaccinating its citizens.\n\n4. Different countries are using various vaccines viz., India\u200a-\u200aCovaxin, Oxford\/AstraZeneca, USA\u200a-\u200aModerna, Pfizer\/BioNTech, Israel\u200a-\u200aModerna, Pfizer\/BioNTech, UK- Oxford\/AstraZeneca, Pfizer\/BioNTech.\n\nFrom the inferences and conjectures, it can be concluded that people from all parts of the world are educating themselves and willingly taking the vaccines under the governments' free vaccination program. Also, these vaccines have been proved effective against COVID-19 (till now). If the rate of people taking the vaccine continues to grow then all the countries can vaccinate their people before the end of this year.","c8de6418":"# COVID-19 Vaccination Progress Around The World","45602b32":"# **2.
