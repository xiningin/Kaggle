The `iter_test` generator will simply stop returning values once you've reached the end.\n\nWhen writing your own Notebooks, be sure to write robust code that makes as few assumptions about the `iter_test`\/`predict` loop as possible.

However, while you're iterating on your model it's reasonable to try something out, change the model a bit, and try it again.  Unfortunately, if you try to simply re-run the code, or even refresh the browser page, you'll still be running on the same Notebook execution session you had been running before, and the `riideducation` module will still throw errors.  To get around this, you need to explicitly restart your Notebook execution session, which you can do by **clicking \"Run\"->\"Restart Session\"** in the Notebook Editor's menu bar at the top.","34abdee3":"Note that we'll get an error if we try to continue on to the next batch without making our predictions for the current batch.","b6e8812c":"## `iter_test` function\n\nGenerator which loops through each batch of questions in the test set.

Answer Correctness Prediction\n## Introduction\nIn this competition you will predict which questions each student is able to answer correctly. You will loop through a series of batches of questions. Once you make that prediction, you can move on to the next batch.\n\nThis competition is different from most Kaggle Competitions in that:\n* You can only submit from Kaggle Notebooks\n* You must use our custom **`riiideducation`** Python module.  The purpose of this module is to control the flow of information to ensure that you are not using future data to make predictions.  If you do not use this module properly, your code may fail.\n\n## In this Starter Notebook, we'll show how to use the **`riiideducation`** module to get the test features and make predictions.\n## TL;DR: End-to-End Usage Example\n```\nimport riiideducation\nenv = riiideducation.make_env()\n\n# Training data is in the competition dataset as usual\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('\/kaggle\/input\/riiideducation\/train.csv', low_memory=False)\ntrain_my_model(train_df)\niter_test = env.iter_test()\nfor (test_df, sample_prediction_df) in iter_test:\n    test_df['answered_correctly'] = 0.5\n    env.predict(test_df.loc[test_df['content_type_id'] == 0, ['row_id', 'answered_correctly']])```\nNote that `train_my_model` is a function you need to write for the above example to work.","d7ebfdc6":"Let's get the data for the first test batch and check it out."}}
