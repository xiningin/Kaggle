Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (ISAs). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei have all seen huge falls since the outbreak began on 31 December. The Dow and the FTSE saw their biggest quarterly drops in the first three months of the year since 1987 due to corona pandemic. Investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that government action may not be enough to stop the decline.In response, central banks in many countries, including the United Kingdom, slashed interest rates due to corona pandemic.That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy.\"\nprint(wrapper.fill(bert_abstract))","931f776d":"question = \"What is the impact of coronavirus on Dow Jones Industrial Average?\"\n\nstock_chat_bot(question, bert_abstract)","b5f4eff7":"question = \"What is the impact of coronavirus on interest rates?\"\n\nstock_chat_bot(question, bert_abstract)","e440a981":"# Loading Fine-tuned BERT Large","7adc3941":"# Question-answering model","a57bbc03":"# BERT for answering queries related to Stocks\n\nThis notebook is an attempt to use BERT as a chat-bot for queries related to stocks. \n\n## References \n\n1. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l8ZYCvgGu0o\n2.
