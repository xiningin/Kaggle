I made count vectorizer dataframe of Pokemon types, by passing in zero matrix of 800 rows (poke_df rows) and 19 columns (len of type 2 unique strings)\n\nType 1 and Type 2 have same categories but why i used type 2 is because it has an additional 'None' string which i added while filling in null values, so that the type 2 of single type pokemon will be taken as 'None' when i run for loop, Later this None column will be dropped from countvectorizer dataframe\n\nIn the for loop below i took type 1 and type 2 of every row from original dataframe and passed it as list to .loc of every row in zero matrix and assigned it to 1, so it goes to that respective type column and marks it as 1\n\nInitially i tried using pd.get_dummies['Type 1','Type 2'] , but the problem with this is it made 37 columns treating the same type in type1 and type2 as different types, for example if one pokemon has \"Fire\" in type1 and other has \"Fire\" in type2 ,it made two columns as Type 1_Fire and Type 2_Fire which affects the similarity score","2f54cc4d":"Cosine similarity calculates similarity between each and every pokemon which gives us a similarity matrix of shape (800,800),\n\nSo each row has

dataframe with tags Normal\/Mega\/Legendary\n\n* Normal tag is for normal pokemon\n* Mega tag for Mega evloved pokemon and\n* Legendary for Legendary pokemon\n\nSince there is already a column which says whether a pokemon is legendary or not, I'll be using that to tag Legendary pokemon, For Mega I'll be using str.rfind('Mega ') to mark the Mega evolved pokemons and rest as normal\n\nThere are two pokemons Meganium and Yanmega, which have mega in their , since Yanmega has small case m so it's not a problem but Meganium starts with upper case M, so to avoid this I added space to \"Mega' '\" since all mega pokemons have space after the word 'Mega' to tag only Mega pokemons.\n\nDropped columns which are not required","dae24383":"There are two types of pokemon\n* Single type pokemon\n* Dual

them as list\n* sorting the score based on the similarity score in Descending order so that similar pokemons will be on top\n* In similar_pokemon variable i am only storing scores based on
