The majority of pets have no fee across all adoption speed classes. The variability is present due to outliers shown in the boxplot. Health, however seems to affect the fee, as there are almost no outliers at all for pets with bad health condition across all classes. Probably these outliers are due to variations in breed. Mixed breeds and now breeds are adopted at no cost while expensive breeds are adopted at some charge. ","5d39b4cc":"Distribution of Ages across Adoption Speed ranges has similar shape. The most pets are having age around 0-5 months. The distribution of age for not adopted pets looks a bit different. More aged pets are not adopted compared to other adoption ranges. The age distribution for test set looks the same, however we can not look at the breakdown across Adoption Speed Ranges. ","e16ae993":"Can not say there is a strong trend between Age and Fee, probably because the age distributinon is left skewed, hoewever young pets are tend to have a a fee in general, while old pets are given for adoption fo free. Probably this also depends on breed + as I mentioned probably because the majority of pets in the dataset are of yanger age. So, hardly can conclude anything on Age-Fee variable, probaby correlation matrix will help. This applyies for test and train set.","cc4a5abc":"To be continued"}}
