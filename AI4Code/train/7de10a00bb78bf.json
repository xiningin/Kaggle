Canny Edge Detection  \nNow we are applying **Canny** to the gray-scaled image and our output will be another image called edges. **low_threshold** and **high_threshold** are your **thresholds for edge detection**.\n\nThe algorithm will first detect strong **edge** (strong gradient) pixels above the **high_threshold**, and reject pixels below the **low_threshold**. Next, pixels with values between the **low_threshold** and **high_threshold** will be included as long as they are connected to strong edges. **The output edges is a binary image with white pixels tracing out the detected edges and black everywhere else**. See the [OpenCV Canny Docs](http:\/\/docs.opencv.org\/2.4\/doc\/tutorials\/imgproc\/imgtrans\/canny_detector\/canny_detector.html) for more details.\n\n**What would make sense as a reasonable range for these parameters?** In our case, converting to grayscale has left us with an 8-bit image, so each pixel can take 2^8 = 256 possible values. Hence, the pixel values range from 0 to 255.\n\nThis range implies that **derivatives** (essentially, the value differences from pixel to pixel) will be on the scale of tens or hundreds. So, a reasonable range for your threshold parameters would also be in the tens to hundreds.\n\nAs far as a ratio of **low_threshold** to **high_threshold**, **[John Canny](http:\/\/docs.opencv.org\/2.4\/doc\/tutorials\/imgproc\/imgtrans\/canny_detector\/canny_detector.html#steps) himself recommended a low to high ratio of 1:2 or 1:3.**\n\nWe'll also include **Gaussian smoothing**, before running **Canny**, which is **essentially a way of suppressing noise and spurious gradients by averaging (check out the OpenCV docs for GaussianBlur). cv2.Canny() actually applies Gaussian smoothing internally, but we include it here because you can get a different result by applying further smoothing (and it's not a changeable parameter within cv2.Canny()!).****\n\nYou can choose the **kernel_size** for Gaussian smoothing to be any odd number. **A larger kernel_size implies averaging, or smoothing, over a larger area.**","756f2686":"## Opps!

Hough Transform and detecting Lane Lines  \n## Hough Transform \nIn image space, a line is plotted as x vs. y, but in 1962, Paul Hough devised a method for representing lines in parameter space, which we will call \u201cHough space\u201d in his honor.\n\nIn Hough space, I can represent my \"x vs. y\" line as a point in \"m vs. b\" instead. The Hough Transform is just the conversion from image space to Hough space. So, the characterization of a line in image space will be a single point at the position (m, b) in Hough space.

Color Selection  \nFirst let us select some colors. For Instance: Lane Lines are usually **White** in color and we know the RGB value of White is (255,255,255). Here we will define a color threshold in the variables **red_threshold**, **green_threshold**, and **blue_threshold** and populate **rgb_threshold** with these values. This vector contains the minimum values for red, green, and blue (R,G,B) that I will allow in my selection.","4b687558":"## **Shortcomings**  \n**1.

Region Masking  \nI'll assume that the front facing camera that took the image is mounted in a fixed position on the car, such that the lane lines will always appear in the same general region of the image. Next, I'll take advantage of this by adding a criterion to only consider pixels for color selection in the region where we expect to find the lane lines.\n\nCheck out the code below. The variables **left_bottom**, **right_bottom**, and **apex** represent the vertices of a **triangular region** that I would like to retain for my color selection, while masking everything else out. Here I'm using a triangular mask to illustrate the simplest case, but we can use a quadrilateral, and in principle, we could use any polygon.","19cf6e3e":"### **Output**","7777e874":"<b><h1 align=center>Lane Line Detection using Computer Vision<\/h1><\/b>  \n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/udacity\/CarND-LaneLines-P1\/raw\/master\/examples\/laneLines_thirdPass.jpg\" width=\"480\" alt=\"Combined Image\" \/>\n## Overview  \nWhen we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.\n\nIn this project you will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means \"Open-Source Computer Vision\", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  \n  \n**The tools we have are color selection, region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Tranform line detection. Our goal is piece together a pipeline to detect the line segments in the image, then average\/extrapolate them and draw them onto the image for display. Once we have a working pipeline, we will try it out on the video stream.**  \n  \n  \n  \nSource: [Udacity](https:\/\/udacity.com)","50b28d5d":"## **Thank you for your time.
