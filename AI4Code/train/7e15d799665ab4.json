This notebook shows an implementation of gabor filters in python using sklearn and other libraries to segment textures within an image. We will take an example of a slab image and segment the textures within the image using gabor filter. Our implementation shows three steps: pre-processing, gabor filter and post-processing.\n\nNow lets begin with the required imports.","fd1e7419":"**And here's the result**","61d796df":"Now we have obtained the magnitude of 24 gabor filters. The next step is to smooth and reduce the magnitude array. We can apply gaussian smoothing to each of the magnitude response and then apply PCA to reduce the dimensions.

In this implementation, we have used six orientations from 0 degree to 150 degree with a seperation of 30 degree each. Instead of this, we can also take an orientation seperation of 45 degree but, this would not produce as good results. \n<p>\n**Frequency**:\nAccording to this, for an orientation seperation of 30 degree, the total number of gabor filters required is: 6log2(Nc\/2) where, Nc is the width of the image. The frequencies that should be used are:\n1sqrt(2), 2sqrt(2), 4sqrt(2) ... Nc\/4sqrt(2)<p>\nHowever, in case of our image, we have experimentally chosen the following set of frequencies:\nsqrt(2), 1+sqrt(2), 2+sqrt(2), 2sqrt(2)<p>\nYou can visualize the result of each gabor filter to decide for yourself.\n<p>\nHence we have a total of 24 gabor filters.\n<p>\nThe gabor filter gives a complex response. So we take the magnitude of the response for further processing. ","0f1089d4":"## Post-processing","2117af4d":"**Bandwidth**:\nNarrower bandwidth is desirable because they make finer distinction in texture. In this implementation, we have determined the value of bandwidth using energy density of image. The higher the energy density, the lesser the bandwidth so that more textured areas do not overpower less textured areas. "}}
