Most of the students had between 0 and 20 absences, but the grades still are pretty scattered.\n\nAnother hypothesis was about the time that a student takes from home to school. If a longer distance could afect the grades somehow. For example, less time traveling from home to school, means more time the person has to study. So I highlighted the students that take more and less time to arrive at school. We don't have enough data of the ones who take more than 1 hour, but we can see that the grades of who takes 15 minutes or less are also very scattered.","2b41ad4d":"The good thing about this dataset is that we don't have to fill any missing values.

First thing we notice (and expected) is that who studied less time, had the lowest grades. We can also see that 2-5h os study time has the same median as <2h but third quartile is bigger.\n\nThere are not so many differences between who studied 5-10 hours and more than 10 hours, of course we can see that the highest grade were only achieved by who studied for the longest period of time.\n\nAnd finally we can observe that in these four categories there are some outliers on the 0.0 mark. Probably beacause they didn't attend to the tests or a high number of absences makes the school annul the student's grades.\n\nTalking about absences, let's check if that correlates with the students' grades.","7f5e79c3":"<a id=\"introduction\"><\/a>\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. \n\nTwo datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). \n\nIn [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary\/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades.","9e67bbe6":"<a id=\"loading\"><\/a>\n## 2.
