If not, what gaming platform seems to be the best alternative?","91010ad2":"## Step 3: Which platform is best?\n\nSince you can remember, your favorite video game has been [**Mario Kart Wii**](https:\/\/www.ign.com\/games\/mario-kart-wii), a racing game released for the Wii platform in 2008.  And, IGN agrees with you that it is a great game -- their rating for this game is a whopping 8.9!  Inspired by the success of this game, you're considering creating your very own racing game for the Wii platform.\n\n#### Part A\n\nCreate a bar chart that shows the average score for **racing** games, for each platform.  Your chart should have one bar for each platform. ","cfaffc45":"#### Part B\n\nWhich combination of genre and platform receives the highest average ratings?  Which combination receives the lowest average rankings?","c4bda503":"## Step 4: All possible combinations!\n\nEventually, you decide against creating a racing game for Wii, but you're still committed to creating your own video game!  Since your gaming interests are pretty broad (_... you generally love most video games_), you decide to use the IGN data to inform your new choice of genre and platform.\n\n#### Part A\n\nUse the data to create a heatmap of average score by genre and platform.  ","59d55046":"# Keep going\n\nMove on to learn all about **[scatter plots](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/scatter-plots)**!","beb9b605":"In this exercise, you will use your new knowledge to propose a solution to a real-world scenario.  To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **bar charts** and **heatmaps** to understand patterns in the data.\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou've recently decided to create your very own video game!  As an avid reader of [IGN Game Reviews](https:\/\/www.ign.com\/reviews\/games), you hear about all of the most recent game releases, along with the ranking they've received from experts, ranging from 0 (_Disaster_) to 10 (_Masterpiece_).\n\n![ex2_ign](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Oh06Fu1.png)\n\nYou're interested in using [IGN reviews](https:\/\/www.ign.com\/reviews\/games) to guide the design of your upcoming game.  Thankfully, someone has summarized the rankings in a really useful CSV file that you can use to guide your analysis.\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.","3646bc44":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
