The possibility of finding a good bargain in this region is therefore high.","96c6d125":"# Data Cleansing\nLets check for data quality. In this stage, we are mainly trying to answer the following questions:\n- Total number of records: How many records exist for each feature?\n- Data types: What are the data type of different features. How many numeric\/categorical features are there in dataset?\n- Samples of records. What kind of information is in the feature column. Is the assigned data type appropriate for the features.\n- Empty records: Are there any? How do we adjust these values?","dfa5e926":"# Importing Data\nThe dataset I am using is made available by Erik Bruin. We start by importing the data. Straight after, I like to get a quick preview by making histograms for all the features to get an initial impression of the dataset."}}
