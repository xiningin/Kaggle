Not far behind it is Office and Construction job groups, both with minor gaps of $\\$$47 a week.","96daf591":"This dataset includes job groups and provides summary statistics for each: Management, Business, Computational, Engineering, Science, Social Service, Education, Arts, Healthcare Professional, Healthcare Support, Protective Service, Culinary, Groundskeeping, Service, Sales, Office, Agricultura, Construction, Maintenance, Production, Transportation","4606ae7b":"### Identifying Job Groups with Largest Gaps\n\nWe saw earlier the largest weekly pay gap between men and women in a single job group was $\\$$347. Here, that job group is identified as Management jobs. That could make sense if women aren't viewed as or valued as leaders, and are therefore paid less than their counterparts.\n\nSome of the job groups appearing on the top 10 job groups with the largest pay gaps aren't necessarily ones I had anticipated. For example, when I think of education jobs, I think likely largely public sector and therefore on a payscale that wouldn't be impacted by biases.","78f7b5aa":"### Observations\n\nMany of the largest pay gaps between men and women occur in occupations commonly thought of as being dominated by men: management, business, science, and engineering. Comparing the top 10 highest and smallest pay gaps produced an observation I didn't expect, which is manual labor seems to have much smaller pay gaps. Of the 10 job groups with the narrowest weekly pay gaps, seven would seem to be laborious to extremely laborious: agriculture, construction, culinary, mainetance, healthcare support, groundskeeping, and service industry. Conversely, all the jobs in the highest weekly pay gap groups are considered white collar office jobs.\n\nWhile this was a learning exercise, it seems that job prestige may be an important factor in the gender pay gap that I hadn't yet considered.","ec996c2b":"### Basic Descriptors\n\nThe average weekly salary for these job groups is $\\$$938 for men and $\\$$761 for women, which is a difference of about $\\$$177 in weekly pay for the two groups. The minimum and maximum differences in weekly pay between men and women provide us with the smallest weekly pay gap at $\\$$40 compared to the largest weekly pay gap, which is $\\$$347; we'll be able to identify those job groups once we delved into the data.\n\nLess compelling, but interesting to note, is the pay gap between the lowest weekly salary job group is noticeably larger for men compared to women at $\\$$1,026 and $\\$$843, respectively.","acd32857":"### The legend provides the description for each legend\n* Occupation: Job title as given from BLS.

There are many studies that have produced research pointing to the fact that women indeed receive lower pay for equal work, controling for factors such as job tenure, skills, etc. I am providing a superficial review of pay among a variety of job categories to see what pay looks like between genders to provide a basis for understanding the gender pay gap.\n\nThis dataset, retrieved from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, shows the median weekly incomes for 535 different occupations. The data encompasses information for all working American citizens as of January 2015. The incomes are broken into male and female statistics, preceded by the total median income when including both genders. The data has been re-formatted from the original PDF-friendly arrangement to make it easier to clean and analyze.\n\n### Questions to resolve\n* What job groups have the highest pay gaps?\n* What job groups have the lowest pay gaps?\n* Surprising conclusions?","a78a80dd":"### Organizing Data by Job Group\n\nThere are hundreds of jobs listed in the report.
