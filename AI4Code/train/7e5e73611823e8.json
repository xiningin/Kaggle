In this exercise, you'll make a few improvements.\n\nTo get started, run the code cell below to set up our feedback system.","056a07bc":"### 2) An even smarter agent\n\nIn the previous question, you created an agent that selects winning moves.  In this problem, you'll amend the code to create an agent that can also block its opponent from winning.  In particular, your agent should:\n- Select a winning move, if one is available.\n- Otherwise, it selects a move to block the opponent from winning, if the opponent has a move that it can play in its next turn to win the game. \n- If neither the agent nor the opponent can win in their next moves, the agent selects a random move.\n\nTo help you with this exercise, you are encouraged to start with the agent from the previous exercise.  \n\n**To check if the opponent has a winning move, you can use the `check_winning_move()` function, but you'll need to supply a different value for the `piece` argument.**  ","98e4ab49":"Run the next code cell to play a game round against the agent.  To select a move, click on the game screen in the column where you'd like to place a disc.\n\nAfter the game finishes, you can re-run the code cell to play again!","af78af36":"The `check_winning_move()` function takes four required arguments: the first two (`obs` and `config`) should be familiar, and: \n- `col` is any valid move \n- `piece` is either the agent's mark or the mark of its opponent.  \n\nThe function returns `True` if dropping the piece in the provided column wins the game (for either the agent or its opponent), and otherwise returns `False`.  To check if the agent can win in the next move, you should set `piece=obs.mark`.\n\n**To complete this exercise, you need to define `agent_q1()` in the code cell below.  To do this, you're encouraged to use the `check_winning_move()` function.**  \n\nThe `drop_piece()` function (defined in the code cell above) is called in the `check_winning_move()` function.  Feel free to examine the details, but you won't need a detailed understanding to solve the exercise.","1ce28724":"**[Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-game-ai-and-reinforcement-learning)**\n\n---\n","36731991":"### 3) Looking ahead\n\nSo far, you have encoded an agent that always selects the winning move, if it's available.  And, it can also block the opponent from winning.\n\nYou might expect that this agent should perform quite well!  But how is it still possible that it can still lose the game?","e7e2cd6f":"### 1) A smarter agent\n\nWe can improve the performance without devising a complicated strategy, simply by selecting a winning move, if one is available.\n\nIn this exercise, you will create an agent that:\n- selects the winning move, if it is available.  (_If there is more than one move that lets the agent win the game, the agent can select any of them._)\n- Otherwise, it should select a random move.\n\nTo help you with this goal, we provide some helper functions in the code cell below.
