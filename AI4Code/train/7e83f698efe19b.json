You have noticed that there are different ways to stream data into machine learning.\n\nmost of these books share the following steps (checklist):\n*   Define the Problem(Look at the big picture)\n*   Specify Inputs & Outputs\n*   Data Collection\n*   Exploratory data analysis\n*   Data Preprocessing\n*   Model Design, Training, and Offline Evaluation\n*   Model Deployment, Online Evaluation, and Monitoring\n*   Model Maintenance, Diagnosis, and Retraining\n\n**You can see my workflow in the below image** :\n <img src=\"http:\/\/s9.picofile.com\/file\/8338227634\/workflow.png\" \/>\n## 8-1 Real world Application Vs Competitions\nJust a simple comparison between real-world apps with competitions:\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s9.picofile.com\/file\/8339956300\/reallife.png\" height=\"600\" width=\"500\" \/>\n**you should\tfeel free\tto\tadapt \tthis\tchecklist \tto\tyour needs**\n \n## 8-2 Problem Definition\nI think one of the important things when you start a new machine learning project is Defining your problem. that means you should understand business problem.( **Problem Formalization**)\n\nProblem Definition has four steps that have illustrated in the picture below:\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s8.picofile.com\/file\/8338227734\/ProblemDefination.png\">\n \n### 8-2-1 Problem Feature\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. **On April 15, 1912**, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing **1502 out of 2224** passengers and crew. That's why the name DieTanic. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget.\n\nIt took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.\n\nwe will use the classic titanic data set. This dataset contains information about **11 different variables**:\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s9.picofile.com\/file\/8340453092\/Titanic_feature.png\" height=\"500\" width=\"500\">\n\n* Survival\n* Pclass\n* Name\n* Sex\n* Age\n* SibSp\n* Parch\n* Ticket\n* Fare\n* Cabin\n* Embarked\n\n<font color='red'><b>Question<\/b><\/font>\n1. It's your train what's House Price Data sets feature?\n\n### 8-2-2 Aim\n\nIt is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.  For each PassengerId in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.\n\n \n### 8-2-3 Variables\n\n1.  **Age** ==>> Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5\n\n2. **Sibsp** ==>> The dataset defines family relations in this way...\n\n    a. Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister\n\n    b.

Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson\n\n    c. Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.\n\n4. **Pclass** ==>> A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n\n    * 1st = Upper\n    * 2nd = Middle\n    * 3rd = Lower\n    \n5. **Embarked** ==>> nominal datatype \n6. **Name** ==>> nominal datatype . It could be used in feature engineering to derive the gender from title\n7. **Sex** ==>>  nominal datatype \n8. **Ticket** ==>> that have no impact on the outcome variable. Thus, they will be excluded from analysis\n9. **Cabin** ==>>  is a nominal datatype that can be used in feature engineering\n11. **Fare** ==>>  Indicating the fare\n12. **PassengerID ** ==>> have no impact on the outcome variable. Thus, it will be excluded from analysis\n11. **Survival** is ==>> **[dependent variable](http:\/\/www.dailysmarty.com\/posts\/difference-between-independent-and-dependent-variables-in-machine-learning)** , 0 or 1\n\n\n**<< Note >>**\n\n> You must answer the following question:\nHow does your company expact to use and benfit from your model.\n\nfor Reading this section **please** fork and upvote  this kernel:\n\n[How to solve Problem?](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mjbahmani\/a-data-science-framework-for-quora)\n###### [Go to top](#top)","a4db8bff":"## 10- How to see unique values for a culomns?","2bd9c0e4":"<a id=\"PythonPackages\"><\/a> <br>\n# 2-Python Packages\nIn the second step, we will learn  the necessary libraries that are essential for any specialist.\n1.
