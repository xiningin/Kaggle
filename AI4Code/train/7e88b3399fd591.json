Which means a unit of money received in 1 year is less than a unit of money receive today.\n\nEx: $1 today is always worth more than $1 one year from today\n\n### Question: Which one do you prefer?\n1.\tDo you wanna $100 today (or) \n\n2.\tDo you wanna $100 a year from today?\n\nA.\tI can put in FD & earn 9% returns. When it comes to $100 a year from today I\u2019ve lost interest. It is a basic economics. Feature cash flows are not worth as much as today. So, we need to discount.\n\nB.\tIf I\u2019ve a $100 a year from today.

So that\u2019s the reason you\u2019re getting the word net present value. \n Rule: \n 1. You usually shows outflows as (-) ve numbers &\n 2. Inflows as (+) ve numbers**\n\n **In Finance you always discount cash flows before compare. You cannot compare cash flows across Time.**\n","69ca316a":"***Example: If Anybody asking me invest 10,00,000\/- Today.
