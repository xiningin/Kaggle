My 10 fold Xgb best score was 0.89227 and 10 fold lgbm best score was around 0.89220. Combining these and some other basic models with a second level classification using RidgeClassifier turned out my score to be 0.89288. Try Stacking models if you see some improvement in your basic model score you will definetely score even more.","7fabfaea":"This is a very basic notebook to show how can you further increase your score combining the predictions of all the models you have used in this competiton.
