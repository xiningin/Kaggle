Take a look at the first two images. Both have similar skewed intensity distributions in their originals. After normalization we can see that the bright regions (> 200) of the first image now have lower values higher than 3. In contrast the bright values (> 200) of the second image are now given by values higher than 4. **Hence our normalization has caused a shift! Similar bright regions of the originals are now different from each other. I think this does not make sense.** This shift was caused by the skewness of the distribution as the mean is not robust towards outliers and shifted towards higher values. Consequently the mean of the first image is higher than of the second. Consequently images with bright regions always will be normalized to lower values and their distributions are clinched. This comes especially clear for the third image. It's not a good idea to clinch bright images and to strech dark ones. We don't know if cancer cells are always similar bright. If we do this normalization we would end up with different valued cancers that were similar once. But we are dependent on this similarity as our kernel weights only can work this way. \n\n#### Min-Max Scaling\nScaling to min of -0.5 and max of 0.5 does only act on the value range but leaves the shape of the distribution the same as in the original cases. Why is it good to use this scaling method? To find an answer we should take a look at the activation function we are working with. Wally uses relu as activation function.

The latter has $k$ elements with one hot and all others zero. Let's assume that all $N$ samples were drawn independently from the same distribution. With this independence assumption we can split into $n$ factors and describe the target distribution of our data set as follows:\n\n$$ p(T|Y) = \\prod_{n=1}^{N} \\prod_{k=1}^{K} y_{n,k}^{t_{n,k}} $$\n\nOur goal now is to maximize this function by computing nice predictions that fit well to the targets. In case of neural networks this is done by adjusting the model parameters, the weights between neurons. Let's describe all weights (and biases) by one parameter $\\theta$. Then we compute all predictions $Y$ given the images $X$ and weights $\\theta$: \n\n$$Y = Y(X,\\theta)$$\n\nBy using a neural network we try to find weights that are able to describe the mapping between images, predictions and targets for all samples. Hence weights are shared over all samples regardless if we are computing predictions for the first image of our dataset or for the last one. Once we find - estimated - its weights $\\theta^{MLE}$ by learning they are fixed and the neural network doesn't change.  \n\n$$ \\theta^{MLE} = \\max_{\\theta} p(T|X, \\theta)  $$\n\nProbably you know that optimizing a function with respect to some variable means that we need to compute its first and second dervative. We would set the further to zero and would check the solution found given the second derivative. This way we could say if the solution found is a maximum, minimum or a saddle point for example. Regardless if we can do this procedure analytically by hand or using numerical optimization, we need to find the first derivative of our likelihood function with respect to neural network parameters $\\theta$ for each layer $l$ and each connection between neurons $i$ and $j$:\n\n$$\\partial_{\\theta_{i,j}^{l}} p(T|Y) = \\frac{\\partial} {\\partial \\theta_{i,j}^{l}} \\prod_{n=1}^{N} \\prod_{k=1}^{K} y_{n,k}^{t_{n,k}}  $$\n\nDue to the products this job is infeasible. To make it tractable we can use the natural logarithm. As it's a monotonically increasing function the maximization of the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximization of the likelihood. In addition it subpresses underflow of numerical precision of the computer caused by products of a large number of very small single sample probabilites. Using the log everything turns out to be nice and smart :-) ...\n\n$$ \\partial_{\\theta_{i,j}^{l}} \\ln p(T|Y) = \\frac{\\partial} {\\partial \\theta_{i,j}^{l}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} t_{n,k} \\cdot \\ln y_{n,k} $$\n\nNow the derivative acts on sums which can be done for each summand separately. Cool! You might have already detected that the log-likelihood looks like a cross entropy apart from a missing minus sign. With adding this minus sign our task changes to minimization of the negative log-likelihood which is our well known loss function. :-) \n\n$$ E = - \\ln p(T|Y) = - \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} t_{n,k} \\cdot \\ln y_{n,k}  $$\n","01f3cc59":"Well.... so far I can't conclude something out of it. :-)","40113f96":"### How many samples per cancer class are present?","4f6f5649":"## Building a model with tensorflow - Wally <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"wally\"><\/a>\n\nFollowing this [nice tutorial ](http:\/\/cs231n.github.io\/convolutional-networks\/) I like to start with a very reduced network architecture:\n\n1.

One can see that the choice of the cross entropy below is not arbitrary and has some deeper motivation. Knowing this way can be an entry point to build own likelihoods that suite better to your current problem. One example: What if you have a mutlilabel classification problem to solve but with couplings between target variables? What if independence assumption between observations is not true? If you like you can but something on top and customise your objective as you need it. \n\n### Where to go next?\n\nFor our case study and baseline model we are almost done. We have found a suitable loss function. Where to go next? If you are new to the likelihood concept this way probably full of new stuff. To cool down let's switch do data exploration. After that we will go one step back to find out how the derivatives - alias gradients - of our model will look like and how the model will be influenced during learning.

Thus let's have a look at the overall intensitiy distribution per class:","56feb75f":"## Setting up the loss <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"loss\"><\/a>\n\nBefore we start with building a small baseline model, let's discover the data we are working with. As the target distribution is often the origin to setup an objective function or loss, it's worth to look at it. \n\n### The cancer target distribution\n\nFor each image there is only 1 possible true target class $t_{k}$ out of 8 classes. Hence the target per sample is following a one-hot-coding scheme: All elements of t are zero except from the true class that holds one. Consequently we can **describe the target distribution by a multinomial distribution** this way:\n\n$$ p(t) = \\prod_{k=1}^{8} y_{k}^{t_{k}}$$\n\nGiven an image our model tries to predict which cancer class is true and for each possible class it yields a probability $y_{k}$. Looking at the equation you can see that all classes that are not the target class yield $y_{k}^{0} = 1$. Only the probability of the true class contributes with $y_{k}^{1} = y_{k}$. Consequently $p(t)$ reaches its maximum value of 1 when $y_{k} = 1$. This is the case of a perfect prediction! Then our model is sure with 100% that this image belongs to the true class. Using our multinomial distribution we are able to describe how well the model predictions fit to our target values. By fitting a model to our data we are trying to maximize how likely it is that our predictions suite to target values. \n\nAs a take-away we can say that we can setup a so called likelihood function by probability distributions that tell us how well predictions $Y$ fit to our targets $T$. The function we build this way is often called an objective function. But before we can do this for cancer classification we should describe all data samples, all images, their predictions and target cancer classes.","52f3aaf5":"Before we start, let's transform all labels to a binary representation with one-hot-encoding as only one cancer class is true for each image.","f015843e":"## Loading packages and data <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"load\"><\/a>","8067c266":"## Data Preprocessing <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"preprocessing\"><\/a>","a7270454":"### Take-Away\n\nWe can see that we started to overfit badly after roughly 50 steps.
