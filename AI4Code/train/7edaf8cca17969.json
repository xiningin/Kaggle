Registration requires a credit card or bank account details. Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and serverless computing environments.\n\nIn April 2008, Google announced App Engine, a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers, which was the first cloud computing service from the company. The service became generally available in November 2011. Since the announcement of App Engine, Google added multiple cloud services to the platform.\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform is a part of Google Cloud, which includes the Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as G Suite, enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and enterprise mapping services.\n\n**Source:** Wikipedia","7cfa5e3b":"### Learning Rate: 0.002, Epochs: 10, Patience: 5","0b879b87":"# Resnext & Xception Ensemble\n\n- The following have been taken from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/khoongweihao\/xception-resnext-ensemble-inference","4c7a3765":"You can refer to https:\/\/github.com\/Kaggle\/kaggle-api, where the README describes the CLI and API commands required to download the competition data and files into the VM's directory.","5e1c416f":"## Some Training Outputs in the VM","4efb346f":"## Resnext Model","6100e442":"### Learning Rate: 0.0015, Epochs: 42, Patience: 5","0c2adfbe":"## Ensemble of Resnext & Xception\n\n- Resnext single model public score: 0.46441\n- Xception single model public score: 0.50480","87b9be29":"# Running the Instance in the Backend with Screen","6bf96d48":"## Epochs, Factor, Learning Rates & Patience (IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTAL NOTES)\n\nI've tried various learning rates `lr` (0.001, 0.0015, 0.002, 0.004), `epochs` (10, 12, 20, 42), `patience` (2, 5, 7) and `factor` (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7). The result from these is the score of 0.50480 for the Xception single model, and 0.43846 for the Resnext + Xception esemble. Further tweeking of these parameters do help increase the public LB score by a bit. Also, yet interestingly, as the score of the single model Xception decreases, the higher scoring esembles have equal weights, i.e. 0.5 for Resnext and 0.5 for Xception. \n\nFeel free to tweek these parameters further! Note that the total time for each run of 30 epochs or more on Google Cloud Compute took **more than 20 hours**. So it may be wise to plan your parameters properly based on the insights gathered from past trainings!","7934d69b":"### Prediction Loop","44f85c02":"### Learning Rate: 0.004, Epochs: 30, Patience: 2","dc61f4bc":"## Free Credits\n\nIf you are a first time user, you can get around 300 USD free credits to play around with, which I personally feel is quite decent!

The end of the competition is in about a month, and I figured that some insights on the tweeks to the existing training scripts could help those who have yet to make some sort of breakthrough at this point. \n\n\nBest regards,\n\nWei Hao","e2f57ccc":"### Learning Rate: 0.004, Epochs: 12, Patience: 2"}}
