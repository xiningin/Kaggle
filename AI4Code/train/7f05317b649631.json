Data Types \n\nEach piece of data has two fundamental characteristics:\n- The value of the data itself.\n- Every value has a data type which explains what kind of data the value is.\n- For example, the integer 2 has the value of 2 and the data type is integer.\n- The first data-types to learn:\n    - None\n    - Boolean\n    - Integer\n    - Float\n    - String\n    - List\n    - Function\n    - Dictionary","ef0795db":"## Let's Create Some Example Functions\n\nImagine the exercise asks us to write a function called is_five that takes in a variable and returns True\/False if that variable is the number five.\nThe function would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef is_five(x):\n    result = x == 5\n    return result\n```\n\nOr we could write this a little more succinctly (since returning the result is the same as returning the expression assigned to the result variable)\n```python\ndef is_five(x):\n    return x == 5\n```\n\nThe result of this function is entirely dependent on the input values we send into the function.\nFor example:\n- `is_five(10)` will return `False`\n- `is_five(-5)` returns `False` because -5 is not 5.\n- `is_five(\"hello\"`) returns `False` because the string \"hello\" certainly isn't the number 5.\n- `is_five(5)` returns `True` because 5 == 5 evaluates to True.\n\nNotice how this function is returning the result of a comparison operation and that the comparison operator will give us a True or a False, depending on the value contained in the input variable sent into the function.\n\nIf the exercise was to make a function named is_more_than_three, we could define the function in the following way:\n```python\ndef is_more_than_three(x):\n    return x > 3\n```\n\nNotice that we're returning the result of x > 3, which can change with different inputs.\nFor example:\n- `is_more_than_three(10)` returns `True`\n- `is_more_than_three(30)` returns `True`\n- `is_more_than_three(3)` returns `False` (because 3 is not greater than 3)\n- `is_more_than_three(3.025`) returns `True` because 3.023 > 3 returns True.\n- `is_more_than_three(-23)` returns `False` b\/c  negative 23 is less than 3.\n","3240bdf4":" > \"Programming languages allow us to formalize instructions and express logical rules, business rules, mathematics, processes, and automation instructions in one single notation.\" - Ryan Orsinger","e8d36232":"# Part II -  Lists, Dictionaries, and Functions\n- With programming and analysis, we work with lots of lists of numbers.\n- The primary data type in Python for holding lists of numbers is called a list.

Comparison Operators\n\n### Python Comparison Operators compare two values and return a True or False\n- `==` compares two values to see if they are the same value.\n- `!=` asks if the values on each side of the operator are **not** the same.]\n- `<` and `<=` are less than and less than or equal to\n- `>` and `>=` are greater than and greater than or equal to, respectively.\n\n### Let's look at some concrete examples of using comparison operators and values that return a True or a False.\n\n- `2 < 3` returns `True` because it's a true statement that two is less than three\n- `2 <= 2` returns `True` because two is less than or equal to two\n- `2 < 2` returns `False` because two is not less than two\n- `4 <= 2` returns `False` because four is not less than or equal to two\n- `10 < 5` returns `False` because 10 is not less than 5\n- `10 > 5` returns `True` because ten is greater than 5\n- `2 == 2` returns `True` because the number two is equal to the number two\n- `2 == 3` returns `False` because two is not three\n- `3 != 2` returns `True` because three is not equal to two.\n- `4 in [1, 2, 3, 4]` returns `True` because 4 exists in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`\n- `\"b\" in \"banana\"` returns `True` because the string \"b\" exists inside the string `\"banana\"`\n\nIf we have `x = 3` followed by `result = x > 0` on the next line, the result variable will hold `True` because 3 is greater than 0. \n\n### Comparison Operators ask the following questions\n- Are these two things equal?\n- Are these two things not equal?\n- Is A greather than B?\n- Is A greater than or equal to B?\n- Is A less than B?\n- Is A less than or equal to B?\n- Does A exist in a list or collection of values named B","571ed33e":"## To get better at Python faster, see [101 Exercises](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ryanorsinger\/101-exercises\/)","79267d34":"## Getting Started\n0.
