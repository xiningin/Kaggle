Whether they represent an historical or sentimental value, they are often valuable. They have been preserved, kept or forgotten and have thus crossed decades or millennia to reach venerable ages and\/or sizes. Sometimes these trees are senescent, and they arouse our curiosity and awaken our desire to protect them by a \u2018remarkable tree\u2019 status.\n\nIn France, this \u2018 remarkable tree \u2018 status allows the classification of the tree to the local urban Plan and thus protects the tree from an inconsequential felling.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.valuable-trees.com\/what-is-a-remarkable-tree\/"}}
