This kernel \u201cslides\u201d over the 2D input data, performing an elementwise multiplication with the part of the input it is currently on, and then summing up the results into a single output pixel. - [SOURCE- read more click here](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1)\n\n![A standard convolution](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/535\/1*Zx-ZMLKab7VOCQTxdZ1OAw.gif)\n\n\nBelow is a function defining a CNN model with 3 main blocks of Convolutional layers. The first two blocks follow the same structure:\n1. Apply a Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel size and valid padding, then another Conv2D layer with 3x3 kernel but with same padding to keep the same dimensions\n2. Apply a BatchNormalization layer to avoid layers being too depended from one another and allowing each activation to have 0 mean\n3. A RELU activation and a MaxPooling2D layer with 2x2 kernel size and stride=2\n4. An element-wise Dropout layer applied to MaxPooling2D keeping 80% of the activation units\n\nThe final 2 layers consists of a Fully Connected Layer that uses a Softmax activation for classification.","86dc7760":"Download the predictions from folder \"output\" \n\nrefresh  if not visible\n\nSUBMIT the predictions here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/digit-recognizer","1375ab18":"##  Display images\n\nTo check whether everything worked as expected, let's take a look at a few images from each folder.","885edfd0":"You can try different models- Resnet or Efficientnet and see how they work!\n\nHere is a link to my model on multiclass classification of Human Protiens which was in the top 4% in the in-class competition\nThis uses CNN,  Resnet34,  Resnet50 and Resnet101 : [Human Protein Classification (top 4%) : PyTorch](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kmldas\/human-protein-classification-top-4-pytorch)\n","5dd19962":"## Load the Data\n\n","f22d424d":"# Import Libraries","c283755b":"Here 1 is black and 0 is white....after normalization\n\nSmaller size helps us visualise better?","27e1887c":"#  MNIST Classification\n\nMNIST is a Multiclass Classification project involving image recognition.
