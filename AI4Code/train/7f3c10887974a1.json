Let's see what the 2019 Kaggle Survey can tell us.","112e3c86":"<a id=\"10_1\"><\/a>\n## 10.1 - Experience in Writing Code to Analyze Data\n***\nLet's see the experience in writing code to analyze data (at work or at school).","534e1028":"**What can we say?**\n> * Top 3 database in USA: MySQL, PostgresSQL and Microsoft SQL Server.\n* Top 3 database in China: MySQL, PostgresSQL and SQLite.\n* Here the winner is neither USA nor China, it's MySQL!","3e82b720":"**What can we say?**\n> * Respondents from USA have a bigger experience in writing code to analyze data.\n> * Let's plot below the same data but with a 2 years threshold.","d38325a5":"**What can we say?**\n> * Here we can see some huge differences between USA and China.
