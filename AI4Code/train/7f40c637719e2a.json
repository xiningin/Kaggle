For the reference component, [**click here**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/indexing-selecting-assigning-reference).\n\nSelecting specific values of a pandas `DataFrame` or `Series` to work on is an implicit step in almost any data operation you'll run, so one of the first things you need to learn in working with data in Python is how to go about selecting the data points relevant to you quickly and effectively.\n\nIn this set of exercises we will work on exploring the [Wine Reviews dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/zynicide\/wine-reviews). \n\n# Relevant Resources\n* **[Quickstart to indexing and selecting data](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/indexing-and-selecting-data\/)** \n* [Indexing and Selecting Data](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/indexing.html) section of pandas documentation\n* [Pandas Cheat Sheet](https:\/\/assets.datacamp.com\/blog_assets\/PandasPythonForDataScience.pdf)\n\n\n","b09bfc35":"## 5.\n\nSelect the records with index labels `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, and `8`, assigning the result to the variable `sample_reviews`.\n\nIn other words, generate the following`DataFrame`:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sHZvI1O.png)","21a2d3f7":"## 8.\n\nCreate a DataFrame `italian_wines` containing reviews of wines made in `Italy`.

When working on the answer this question and the several of the ones that follow, keep the following \"gotcha\" described in the [reference](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/indexing-selecting-assigning-reference) for this tutorial section:\n\n> `iloc` uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `reviews.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `reviews.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `reviews.iloc[0:1001]`.","601595d9":"## 6.\n\nCreate a variable `df` containing the `country`, `province`, `region_1`, and `region_2` columns of the records with the index labels `0`, `1`, `10`, and `100`.
