While it's useful to look at these images, there's just one problem here: PyTorch doesn't know how to work with images. We need to convert the images into tensors. We can do this by specifying a transform while creating our dataset.","e9c5c20f":"We can use our new custom model in the same way as before. Let's see if it works.","f6fac267":"Accuracy is an excellent way for us (humans) to evaluate the model. However, we can't use it as a loss function for optimizing our model using gradient descent for the following reasons:\n\n1. It's not a differentiable function. `torch.max` and `==` are both non-continuous and non-differentiable operations, so we can't use the accuracy for computing gradients w.r.t the weights and biases.\n\n2. It doesn't take into account the actual probabilities predicted by the model, so it can't provide sufficient feedback for incremental improvements. \n\nFor these reasons, accuracy is often used as an **evaluation metric** for classification, but not as a loss function. A commonly used loss function for classification problems is the **cross-entropy**, which has the following formula:\n\n![cross-entropy](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VDRDl1D.png)\n\nWhile it looks complicated, it's actually quite simple:\n\n* For each output row, pick the predicted probability for the correct label. E.g., if the predicted probabilities for an image are `[0.1, 0.3, 0.2, ...]` and the correct label is `1`, we pick the corresponding element `0.3` and ignore the rest.\n\n* Then, take the [logarithm](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Logarithm) of the picked probability. If the probability is high, i.e., close to 1, then its logarithm is a very small negative value, close to 0. And if the probability is low (close to 0), then the logarithm is a very large negative value. We also multiply the result by -1, which results is a large postive value of the loss for poor predictions.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.intmath.com\/blog\/wp-content\/images\/2019\/05\/log10.png)\n\n* Finally, take the average of the cross entropy across all the output rows to get the overall loss for a batch of data.\n\nUnlike accuracy, cross-entropy is a continuous and differentiable function. It also provides useful feedback for incremental improvements in the model (a slightly higher probability for the correct label leads to a lower loss). These two factors make cross-entropy a better choice for the loss function.\n\nAs you might expect, PyTorch provides an efficient and tensor-friendly implementation of cross-entropy as part of the `torch.nn.functional` package. Moreover, it also performs softmax internally, so we can directly pass in the model's outputs without converting them into probabilities.","aa14a5ce":"Here's how we create or _instantiate_ an object of the class `Person`.","176a7470":"Most of the predicted labels are different from the actual labels. That's because we have started with randomly initialized weights and biases. We need to train the model, i.e., adjust the weights using gradient descent to make better predictions.","f847fac2":"The code above leads to an error because our input data does not have the right shape. Our images are of the shape 1x28x28, but we need them to be vectors of size 784, i.e., we need to flatten them. We'll use the `.reshape` method of a tensor, which will allow us to efficiently 'view' each image as a flat vector without really creating a copy of the underlying data. To include this additional functionality within our model, we need to define a custom model by extending the `nn.Module` class from PyTorch. \n\nA class in Python provides a \"blueprint\" for creating objects. Let's look at an example of defining a new class in Python.","57faf325":"The `fit` function records the validation loss and metric from each epoch. It returns a history of the training, useful for debugging & visualization.\n\nConfigurations like batch size, learning rate, etc. (called hyperparameters), need to picked in advance while training machine learning models. Choosing the right hyperparameters is critical for training a reasonably accurate model within a reasonable amount of time. It is an active area of research and experimentation in machine learning.

As discussed earlier, we'd like these outputs to represent probabilities.

The resulting vector can thus be interpreted as probabilities.\n\nWhile it's easy to implement the softmax function (you should try it!), we'll use the implementation that's provided within PyTorch because it works well with multidimensional tensors (a list of output rows in our case).","55cdb3ce":"### Save and upload your notebook\n\nWhether you're running this Jupyter notebook online or on your computer, it's essential to save your work from time to time.

It contains weights and bias matrices, and the output is obtained using simple matrix operations (`pred = x @ w.t() + b`). \n\n* As we did with linear regression, we can use `nn.Linear` to create the model instead of manually creating and initializing the matrices.\n\n* Since `nn.Linear` expects each training example to be a vector, each `1x28x28` image tensor is _flattened_ into a vector of size 784 `(28*28)` before being passed into the model. \n\n* The output for each image is a vector of size 10, with each element signifying the probability of a particular target label (i.e., 0 to 9).

This randomization helps generalize & speed up the training process. On the other hand, since the validation data loader is used only for evaluating the model, there is no need to shuffle the images. \n","8ef3351a":"It's quite clear from the above picture that the model probably won't cross the accuracy threshold of 90% even after training for a very long time. One possible reason for this is that the learning rate might be too high. The model's parameters may be \"bouncing\" around the optimal set of parameters for the lowest loss. You can try reducing the learning rate and training for a few more epochs to see if it helps.\n\nThe more likely reason that **the model just isn't powerful enough**. If you remember our initial hypothesis, we have assumed that the output (in this case the class probabilities) is a **linear function** of the input (pixel intensities), obtained by perfoming a matrix multiplication with the weights matrix and adding the bias. This is a fairly weak assumption, as there may not actually exist a linear relationship between the pixel intensities in an image and the digit it represents. While it works reasonably well for a simple dataset like MNIST (getting us to 85% accuracy), we need more sophisticated models that can capture non-linear relationships between image pixels and labels for complex tasks like recognizing everyday objects, animals etc. \n\nLet's save our work using `jovian.commit`. Along with the notebook, we can also record some metrics from our training.","da6360cc":"Since we've trained our model for a long time and achieved a resonable accuracy, it would be a good idea to save the weights and bias matrices to disk, so that we can reuse the model later and avoid retraining from scratch.

[Google Colab](https:\/\/colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab.\n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https:\/\/www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https:\/\/docs.conda.io\/projects\/conda\/en\/latest\/user-guide\/install\/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n\n>  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https:\/\/jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" or \"Edit > Clear Outputs\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.","d81851ff":"Let's define a helper function `predict_image`, which returns the predicted label for a single image tensor.","74425904":"It's essential to choose a random sample for creating a validation set. Training data is often sorted by the target labels, i.e., images of 0s, followed by 1s, followed by 2s, etc. If we create a validation set using the last 20% of images, it would only consist of 8s and 9s. In contrast, the training set would contain no 8s or 9s. Such a training-validation would make it impossible to train a useful model.\n\nWe can now create data loaders to help us load the data in batches.

What happens if you use too high a batch size, or too low?\n* Modify the `fit` function to also track the overall loss and accuracy on the training set, and see how it compares with the validation loss\/accuracy. Can you explain why it's lower\/higher?\n* Train with a small subset of the data, and see if you can reach a similar level of accuracy.\n* Try building a model for a different dataset, such as the [CIFAR10 or CIFAR100 datasets](https:\/\/www.cs.toronto.edu\/~kriz\/cifar.html).\n\nHere are some references for further reading:\n* For a more mathematical treatment, see the popular [Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/lecture\/machine-learning\/classification-wlPeP) course on Coursera.

The length along the 2nd dimension is 28\\*28 (i.e., 784). One argument to `.reshape` can be set to `-1` (in this case, the first dimension) to let PyTorch figure it out automatically based on the shape of the original tensor.\n\nNote that the model no longer has `.weight` and `.bias` attributes (as they are now inside the `.linear` attribute), but it does have a `.parameters` method that returns a list containing the weights and bias.","f62ee659":"The `==` operator performs an element-wise comparison of two tensors with the same shape and returns a tensor of the same shape, containing `True` for unequal elements and `False` for equal elements.

Finally, we divide by the total number of images to get the accuracy. \n\nNote that we don't need to apply softmax to the outputs since its results have the same relative order.
