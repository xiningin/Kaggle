And it looks pretty great!","279b41d5":"So looks like you have reached the end of this kernel. This was an extremely basic implementation of WordCloud and there is a lot you can play around with. Since I am by no means an expert, feel free to correct me if there is any mistake in the kernel.\n\nAlso, if you liked it, please drop an upvote, it really motivates me to make even better kernels. Cheers!","c4af580e":"Hmm, looks good. But I am sure we can make it look better.

We should subtract one from the count because of the '\"character\" \"dialogue\"' text in the start.","461a677c":"Hey everyone! Today we are going to learn how to create simple WordClouds. We will be using the wordcloud library and hopefully by the end of this tutorial you all will have a simple understanding to start building your own wordclouds!","1dfdbc89":"Creating a \"mask\" on which the WordCloud will be made.","1a34e308":"**Some Great Quote by Yoda to start off the Kernel**"}}
