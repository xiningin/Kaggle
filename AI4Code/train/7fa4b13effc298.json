regression model, to predict the amount spent by the customer on Black Friday.\n\nLinear regression represents a very simple method for supervised learning and it is an effective tool for predicting quantitative responses. You can find basic information about it right here: Linear Regression in Python\n\nThis model, like most of the supervised machine learning algorithms, makes a prediction based on the input features. The predicted output values are used for comparisons with desired outputs and an error is calculated. The error signal is propagated back through the model and model parameters are updating in a way to minimize the error. Finally, the model is considered to be fully trained if the error is small enough. This is a very basic explanation and we are going to analyze all these processes in details in future articles.","0e4e1400":"Category labels 1, 5, and 8 clearly have the most items within them.

There are a total of 5891 users in the dataset.\n* Product_ID: Unique ID of the product. There are a total of 3623 products in the dataset.\n* Gender: indicates the gender of the person making the transaction.\n* Age: indicates the age group of the person making the transaction.\n* Occupation: shows the occupation of the user, already labeled with numbers 0 to 20.\n* City_Category: User's living city category. Cities are categorized into 3 different categories 'A', 'B' and 'C'.\n* Stay_In_Current_City_Years: Indicates how long the users has lived in this city.\n* Marital_Status: is 0 if the user is not married and 1 otherwise.\n* Product_Category_1 to _3: Category of the product.
