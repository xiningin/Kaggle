For more information with regards to Term Deposits please click on this link from Investopedia: https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/t\/termdeposit.asp\n\n\nToday organizations, which hire data scientists are especially interested in job candidate's portfolio. Analysis of organization's marketing data is one of the most typical applications of data science and machine learning. Such analysis will definetely be a nice contribution to the protfolio.\n\n\nFinding out customer segments, using data for customers, who subscribed to term deposit. \nThis helps to identify the profile of a customer, who is more likely to acquire the product and develop more targeted marketing campaigns.","ab4efc8d":"## Attribute - Previous","746882c4":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.interest.co.nz\/sites\/default\/files\/feature_images\/td-to-managed-fund-transition.jpg\" width=600 height=200>\n","41494b03":"# Conclusion\n\n* The people who younger than 30 and older than 60 years old most likely to subscribe for term deposit.\n* Age attribute confirmed with job attribute. Because Retired and Students are most likely to subscribe for term deposit.\n* Customers with 'blue-collar' and 'services' jobs are less likely to subscribe for term deposit.\n* Divorced have a considerably low amount of balance.\n* Education significant impact the amount of balance.\n* Customers are more willing to invest either before 8th or after 23rd of the month.\n* Potential clients opted to suscribe term deposits during the seasons of fall and winter.\n*  Potential clients in the low balance and no balance category were more likely to have a house loan than people in the average and high balance category. What does it mean to have a house loan? This means that the potential client has financial compromises to pay back its house loan and thus, there is no cash for he or she to suscribe to a term deposit account. However, we see that potential clients in the average and hih balances are less likely to have a house loan and therefore, more likely to open a term deposit. Lastly, the next marketing campaign should focus on individuals of average and high balances in order to increase the likelihood of suscribing to a term deposit.\n* Target individuals with a higher duration (above 375): Target the target group that is above average in duration, there is a highly likelihood that this target group would open a term deposit account. The likelihood that this group would open a term deposit account is at 78% which is pretty high. This would allow that the success rate of the next marketing campaign would be highly successful.\n","315ac147":"## Attribute - Day","e5b74086":"# DATA PREPARING FOR ML","42e68026":"* Default is one of the most important variables for analysing credit customers.
