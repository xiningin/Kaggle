You can run this kernel to see the evaluation results of the model, for each of the validate and test subsets.  The results are excellent: better than 99.5% accuracy.\n\nThe results shown below might be a little startling: 100% accuracy for both the test and validation subsets.  We all know that's not possible, so there must be an explanation.  I propose that the reason the accuracy is impossibly high is because my test subset is too small; it contains only 500 images.  Still, given that the model guesses correctly for 100% of 500 instances, therefore the true accuracy must be at least 99.5%.\n\nThe model was trained in colab because it's so much faster.  That training kernel is named Honeybee Health Classifier - Simplified, and is posted to this same dataset.  It is based on Chollet's VGG16 pretrained model.  It takes too long to run on kaggle, and kept timing out after nine hours.\n\nIn this simplified dataset, the missing queens were removed, and the two varrao categories were collapsed into a single category.  To run it, you will also need my \"honeybees - simplified\" and \"model-cache\" datasets.\n","2082e018":"## Dataset","26b8c7d7":"The credit for collecting and preparing the honeybee dataset goes to Jenny Yang from Kaggle: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jenny18\/honey-bee-annotated-images\/.\n"}}
