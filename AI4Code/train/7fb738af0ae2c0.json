Normally, China was \"Mainland China\" in the dataset, but this time, there are 48 meaningless row for China (for the dataset in May 25, 2021). Thus we have actually 4 different \"Country\/Region\"; US, China, Canada and Others. Among these countries, USA has lots of provinces and counties. Using US data will lead very confusing legend in plot. \"Others\" has 2 \"Province\/State\", but one of 2 has almost no effect besides the other. And we have just China and Canada. By having smaller number (22), Canada is more suitable for our \"hue\" example. Thus, relation between \"Confirmed\" and \"Deaths\" for \"Province\/State\" in Canada will be plotted.","1581e72a":"As you see, there would be lots of unique terms in a feature. If we want to determine how many different value in  a feature, we can use for loop to determine it. An \"for loop\" construction can be found below for our example.","8bb9b322":"<a id = \"line\"> <\/a><br>\n### Line Plot\n\nLine plot is probably the most basic plot and the simplest way of visualization.\n\n\nIt can be used for the purpose of attaining some mathematical functions like (y=x^2).\n","ace33355":"From our data, we visualize confirmed covid-19 percantages for three countries (US, China, Turkey) at their last announcement.\n\n\nWe need also import other csv file for this application to code it easier. The new dataframe is below:","d70cb528":"<a id = \"2\"> <\/a><br>\n# 2. Correlations between Features\n\nTo understand relations between numerical values, correlations methods have been developed. Thus, we may need this correlations when we ara mess around with some complicated data. Finding this correlation coefficient enable us to know if two numerical features are directly proportional or not.\n\nTo see correlation, we can use corr() function in pandas. In our dataframe, there is 4 numerical features (it is seen above with datainfo()). But one of them is unnecessary to investigate (the \"SNo\" feature). Thus we'll drop this feature before calculate the correlation coefficients.","c03c7cda":"In [Scatter Plot](#scatter), we plotted Turkey's \"Confirmed\" and \"Deaths\" relations. And this time, we will plot same relation by joint plot's \"reg\" kind. But, we now be able to have regression line thanks to \"reg\" kind of joint plot.\n\nIn joint plot, we can also see which number has been repeated how many times.","3d176c99":"<a id = \"box\"> <\/a><br>\n### Boxplot\n\nBoxplot shows us median, quartiles, max, min and outliers of the numerical data.\n\n\nFor a example:\n\nlist1 = [10,20,30,35,36,38,42,48,63,72,73,75,79,99,250] \n\n\n(Median and quartiles of this list are respectively 48,35,75.) ","b05a24a6":"After compared two countries, China seems to beat coronavirus as we hear from news.\n\nPlotting this bar plot by seperately is enough to compare two country, but seeing them in one figure would be better for our understanding. So we will combine two dataframe and visulaze from it.\n\nTo do this we have two options; append() and concat() functions.\n\nTo promote visualization, we also change color of bar depends on country. To do that we code a loop or as a better choice we will make use of list comprehension.\n\n<a id = \"lc\"> <\/a><br>\n### List Comprehension\n\nWhen we want to create other list from a list, list comprehension is very helpful tool to achive that. We can code this command in just one line while we normally use for-while to do that.\n\nFor example;\n\nlist1 = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nIn a case that we need a list that contains squares of number from list1, we normally can use for loop;\n\nlist=[]\nfor i in list1\n    list2.append(i**2)\n\nBut we can use list comprehension instead of this. It will reduce our code line into 1 with a easy sytnax.\n\nlist2 = [ i**2 for i in list1]\n\nAlso we can use if conditionals while using list comprehension.\n\nlist3 = [ i**3 if i<3 else i if i == 3 else i**2 for i in list1 ] \n\n\nIn our case, we we add new feature(color) by using list comprehension. Then USA will be blue and China will be red in plot. ","7a78cf10":"As you see, \"US\" and \"Canada\" are the only countries that mislead our correlation calculations. Thus we will recalculate correlations coefficients by excluding \"US\" and \"Canada\".\n","550e7ab4":"<a id = \"seabornlmplot\"> <\/a><br>\n### Lm Plot\n\nLm plot is very useful tool to see linear regression.","53841729":"<a id = \"seabornpointplot\"> <\/a><br>\n### Point Plot\n\nPoint plot is like line plot, but it also gives exact value in data.\n\nIn this example, we'll code for changing confirmed case of Turkey in time. For that, \"matplotlib.dates\" will be used.","42397a33":"<a id = \"seabornjointplot\"> <\/a><br>\n### Joint Plot\n\nJoint plots gives a relationship between two variables. In default kind, joint plot is so similiar to scatter plot (Also, there are other kinds).\n\nIt will be more clearer with sample.","e69aabc6":"As a result of this joint plot, we can see Ontario and Quabec is in the worst condition for death and confirmed cases (in May 25 2021). But their ratio of Deaths\/Confirmed Case is falling.","1ca784e1":"<a id = \"seabornbarplot\"> <\/a><br>\n### Barplot\n\nPlotting barplot in seaborn is similiar to matplotlib. Its code is below.","cb7c0371":"When we look at the plot, there is a sudden increase to 1.75 million in December. To learn what happened in December, we'll search what happened in Turkey with the key words \"Turkey\" \"covid\" \"increase\" \"december\" \"case\" \"1.75 million\". After a quick investigation we'll see that Turkey goverment did not count asymptomatic cases as confirmed case and did not share this number. Thus, a misleading occured in our data. After all cases(including asymptomatic cases) was anounced as confirmed case, it ended up with sudden increase.","49c47d7e":"<a id = \"hist\"> <\/a><br>\n### Histogram Plot\n\nHistogram plot is a type of bar plot. It is great to obtain how often a value has repeated in a feature.\n\nOur dataframe is not perfect to understand histogram plots, so we will not use our dataframe to take get it.","3701d00d":"Another important parameter in joint plot is \"hue\". Attending another feature by \"hue\" provides us that we can also see distribution for this feature.\n\nWe will again look at relation between \"Confirmed\" and \"Deaths\". Probably \"Province\/State\" feature is the only sensible feature to use this parameter(\"hue\"). In our data, we have 226 countries; however, most of them has no \"Province\/State\" (they have Nan). Some of them has more than one unique \"Province\/State\" term, there is nan among this terms. For example, France has 14 \"Province\/State\"; however one of them is nan. Also the country like Turkey has just nan value in \"Province\/State\" column.","43dcedc3":"As a result, our correlation coefficient between \"Confirmed\" and \"Recovered\" rise to 0.82 after we cleared our dataframe.\n\n\nOur dataframe includes the first announcements of the countries, but there will delay for that there will be someone who recovered after first case was confirmed.\n\nFor example, we take first 11 days of Turkey;\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/imgbb.com\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/pjRjpf8\/kaggle2.png\" alt=\"kaggle2\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>\n\n\n\n\nAs it is seen, there are 1872 confirmed patient while there is no recovered one in the second week. There is no recovered one until 2 week last. Thus, we understand that there is a delay between confirmed status and recovered. Scientifically, this is about 10-12 days. And this fact leads our correlation between \"Confirmed\" and \"Recovered\". For a better correlation we need next 10 days' recovered data. Otherwise, we can ignore 10-12 days after the countries' first announcements.\n\nHowever, we will simply ignore the rows that has \"0\" \"Recovered\" value. And we will see how it affects our correlation coefficient.","dd07920b":"<a id = \"seabornswarmplot\"> <\/a><br>\n### Swarm Plot","5ca73e0f":"After we get filtered dataframe, we need to detect which countries are included in our filtered dataframe. Thus we will make use of unique() function. After we detect the countries, we will filtered our original dataframe and apply corr() function on it to obtain correlation coefficint for cleared data.","84c682fc":"<a id = \"seabornboxplot\"> <\/a><br>\n### Boxplot","ce50ae55":"There is a discontinuity in the scatter plot. This because of the same reason that leads sudden increase in line plot above. That Turkey anounced all cases made number of \"Confirmed\" case increase while it has no impact on number of \"Deaths\". After all cases anounced, confirmed case suddenly rise up to 1.75 million, but there is no such increase in deaths\n\nAs a comparison, if we look at the neighbouring countries of Turkey -Bulgaria and Greece-, there are full continuities in their plots. That confirms our comments.","0a7a1a79":"<a id = \"seabornviolinplot\"> <\/a><br>\n### Violin Plot\n\nViolin plot is so similiar to [Boxplot](#box).","a8ef6a60":"<a id = \"3\"> <\/a><br>\n# 3. Basic Visualization Tools\n\nWhile we examine the dataframe, visualization of data is so vital. To accomplish this we will practice some types of plots by using pandas.DataFrame.plot() and matplotlib library.\n\nIn this section we will see;\n\n* [Line Plot](#line) \n* [Scatter Plot](#scatter)\n* [Bar Plot](#bar)\n* [Histogram Plot](#hist)\n* [Pie Chart](#pie)\n* [Boxplot](#box)","b00271a0":"We can also visualize this correlation with correlation map.\n\nCorrelation Map according to standard correlation method is figured below;","8caf2fce":"<a id = \"4\"> <\/a><br>\n# 4.

And, I found some issues that mislead our data analysis. When I filtered data for just USA, I realised, the Recovered column of dataframe mostly takes the \"0\" value. The number of recovered patients was not indicated with confirmed cases and deaths. The recovered patients were indicated in different rows. The recovered patients were given as sum of all Provinces\/States and was shown as different \"Province\/State\" below \"Province\/State\". \n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/ibb.co\/LhzZ1rg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/XkZCtD5\/kaggle.png\" alt=\"kaggle\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>\n\nIt is obvious that this condition spoils our correlation coefficients for \"Recovered\" value. To get better correlation chart, we can drop this value. However, I need investigate if there is \"Recovered\" value in the other columns like the column  \"Province\/State\".\n\nTo determine that, we may use for loop. The for loop construcion was coded below.","c5ff74fc":"In our dataframe, our data values change depends on date. Thus, the line plots are also perfect tools to visualize in this condition.\n\nBefore visualization, we filter our dataframe for just one country and examine its \"Confirmed\" values and \"Recovered\" values changing by time.","4100e6dd":"<a id = \"scatter\"> <\/a><br>\n### Scatter Plot\n\nBy using scatter plots, we have closer look at two numerical variable and see the relations between them. For example, we detected high correlation between \"Confirmed\" and \"Deaths\" values above. We can see this high correlation between this two features.","b640d274":"As seen in dataframe, this dataset gives all announcement in one row.
