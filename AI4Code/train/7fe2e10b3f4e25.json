In addition, you can use .head( ) or any other method to display your results. You can use comments to describe new methods, arguments or alternative approaches.\n\nFirst load the requested packages and data files for this assignment:","3734b1e3":"### Question 1: Create a DataFrame that has the orders and the products purchased","08dbc2ba":"### Question 2: Get the average days since a prior order for each user.\n","5b609916":"## Create variables that describe each customer\n### Question 1: Create a DataFrame that has the orders and the products purchased\n1. Create a DataFrame that contains information for both the orders & order_products_prior DataFrame. Use a inner join and save it as **prd** DataFrame.\n\n### Question 2: Get the average days since a prior order for each user.\n1. Get the average days since a prior order for each user.  You will need to use the prd DataFrame , .groupby( ) method & the appropriate aggregation function. Save the results as **avg_days** and name the column as **'days_order_mean\u2019**\n2. Create a histrogram for **'days_order_mean'** of **avg_days**. Use arguments: bins=100.\n\n### Question 3: How often does a customer reorder products (reorder ratio of a customer)\n1. Get the total purchased products of each customer. Save the results as a DataFrame with name **reorders** and name the column as **'total_bought\u2019**\n2. For each user, get the distinct number of its purchased products (no reordered products - only products purchased for first time). Save the column as **\"total_unique_bought\"** on **reorders** DataFrame.\n> Hint: Use prd[prd.reordered==0] to perform a .groupby( ) on\n3. Create a ratio of **total_unique_bought**\/**total_bought**. Save the column as **'reorder_ratio'** on **reorders** DataFrame.\n4. Create a histrogram for **'reorder_ratio'** of **reorders**. Use arguments: bins=100\n5. Sort the rows of  **reorders**  in order to get first the customers with the lowest **'reorder_ratio'**. Keep the results with the same name (**reorders**).\n6. Save the index of the customer with the lowest ratio on a new variable. Name it as **low_ratio_customer**. You will use this index (user_id) on the next step.\n7. Now use the **low_ratio_customer** to get from **prd** all of its orders and products purchased. Store the results on **user_low**.\n8. Perform an appropriate join of **user_low** with **products** so you can get the name of products. Save the results on **user_low** .\n9. Get the name of the products that the user has bought. Select the column **'product_name'** of **user_low**  DataFrame and use an appropriate method to get the distinct values of the column.","110ca593":"### Question 3: How often does a customer reorder products (reorder ratio of a customer)"}}
