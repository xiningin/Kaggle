In a two-sample test, the null hypothesis is that the means of both groups are the same.

You can conduct a two-sample t-test by passing with the stats.ttest_ind() function.

In some cases, you might be interested in testing differences between samples of the same group at different points in time. For instance, a hospital might want to test whether a weight-loss drug works by checking the weights of the same group patients before and after treatment. A paired t-test lets you check whether the means of samples from the same group differ.\n\nWe can conduct a paired t-test using the scipy function stats.ttest_rel().

A test provides evidence for or against the null hypothesis and then you decide whether to accept or reject it based on that evidence, but the evidence may lack the strength to arrive at the correct conclusion. Incorrect conclusions made from hypothesis tests fall in one of two categories: type I error and type II error.\n\nType I error describes a situation where you reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This type of error is also known as a \"false positive\" or \"false hit\". The type 1 error rate is equal to the significance level \u03b1, so setting a higher confidence level (and therefore lower alpha) reduces the chances of getting a false positive.\n\nType II error describes a situation where you fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. Type II error is also known as a \"false negative\" or \"miss\". The higher your confidence level, the more likely you are to make a type II error.\n\nLet's investigate these errors with a plot:","903220b2":"The [power](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Power_(statistics)) of a statistical test is the probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative is actually different from the null. In other words, power is the probability that the test detects that there is something interesting going on when there actually *is* something interesting going on. Power is equal to one minus the type II error rate. The power of a statistical test is influenced by:\n\n1. The significance level chosen for the test.\n2. The sample size.\n3. The effect size of the test.\n\nWhen choosing a significance level for a test, there is a trade-off between type I and type II error. A low significance level, such as 0.01 makes a test unlikely to have type I errors (false positives), but more likely to have type II errors (false negatives) than a test with larger value of the significance level \u03b1. A common convention is that a statistical tests should have a power of at least 0.8.\n\nA larger sample size reduces the uncertainty of the point estimate, causing the sample distribution to narrow, resulting in lower type II error rates and increased power.\n\n[Effect size](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Effect_size) is a general term that describes a numeric measure of the size of some phenomenon. There are many different effect size measurements that arise in different contexts. In the context of the T-test, a simple effect size is the difference between the means of the samples. This number can be standardized by dividing by the standard deviation of the population or the pooled standard deviation of the samples. This puts the size of the effect in terms of standard deviations, so a standardized effect size of 0.5 would be interpreted as one sample mean being 0.5 standard deviations from another (in general 0.5 is considered a \"large\" effect size).\n\nSince statistical power, the significance level, the effect size and the sample size are related, it is possible to calculate any one of them for given values of the other three. This can be an important part of the process of designing a hypothesis test and analyzing results. For instance, if you want to conduct a test with a given significance level (say the standard 0.05) and power (say the standard 0.8) and you are interested in a given effect size (say 0.5 for standardized difference between sample means), you could use that information to determine how large of a sample size you need.\n\nIn python, the statsmodels library contains functions to solve for any one parameter of the power of T-tests. Use statsmodels.stats.power.tt_solve_power for one sample t-tests and statsmodels.stats.power.tt_ind_solve_power for a two sample t-test. Let's check the sample size we should use need to use given the standard parameter values above for a one sample t-test:","7766c406":"With the normal distributions above, we'd fail to reject the null hypothesis about 30% of the time because the distributions are close enough together that they have significant overlap.","cc152cfd":"In the plot above, the red areas indicate type I errors assuming the alternative hypothesis is not different from the null for a two-sided test with a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe blue area represents type II errors that occur when the alternative hypothesis is different from the null, as shown by the distribution on the right. Note that the Type II error rate is the area under the alternative distribution within the quantiles determined by the null distribution and the confidence level. We can calculate the type II error rate for the distributions above as follows:","ca0549b4":"A one-sample t-test checks whether a sample mean differs from the population mean. Let's create some dummy age data for the population of voters in the entire country and a sample of voters in Minnesota and test the whether the average age of voters Minnesota differs from the population:","ed48b2a9":"# One-Sample T-Test","c89bef13":"Point estimates and confidence intervals are basic inference tools that act as the foundation for another inference technique: statistical hypothesis testing. Statistical hypothesis testing is a framework for determining whether observed data deviates from what is expected. Python's scipy.stats library contains an array of functions that make it easy to carry out hypothesis tests.","5ca5cceb":"The t-test is a powerful tool for investigating the differences between sample and population means. T-tests operate on numeric variables; in the next lesson, we'll discuss statistical tests for categorical variables.","f9d30f72":"Statistical hypothesis tests are based a statement called the null hypothesis that assumes nothing interesting is going on between whatever variables you are testing. The exact form of the null hypothesis varies from one type test to another: if you are testing whether groups differ, the null hypothesis states that the groups are the same. For instance, if you wanted to test whether the average age of voters in your home state differs from the national average, the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the average ages.\n\nThe purpose of a hypothesis test is to determine whether the null hypothesis is likely to be true given sample data. If there is little evidence against the null hypothesis given the data, you accept the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is unlikely given the data, you might reject the null in favor of the alternative hypothesis: that something interesting is going on. The exact form of the alternative hypothesis will depend on the specific test you are carrying out. Continuing with the example above, the alternative hypothesis would be that the average age of voters in your state does in fact differ from the national average.\n\nOnce you have the null and alternative hypothesis in hand, you choose a significance level (often denoted by the Greek letter \u03b1.). The significance level is a probability threshold that determines when you reject the null hypothesis. After carrying out a test, if the probability of getting a result as extreme as the one you observe due to chance is lower than the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This probability of seeing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one observed is known as the p-value.\n\nThe T-test is a statistical test used to determine whether a numeric data sample of differs significantly from the population or whether two samples differ from one another.","d92ed365":"# Python for Data 24: Hypothesis Testing\n[back to index](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hamelg\/python-for-data-analysis-index)","3b024fe6":"# Next Lesson: [Python for Data 25: Chi-Squared Tests](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hamelg\/python-for-data-25-chi-squared-tests)\n[back to index](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hamelg\/python-for-data-analysis-index)"}}
