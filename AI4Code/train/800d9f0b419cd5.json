The games listed here are included on at least six separate \"best\/greatest of all time\" lists from different publications. While any single publication's list reflects the personal opinions of its writers, when the lists are taken in aggregate, a handful of notable games have achieved something approaching critical consensus by multiple appearances in such lists.\n\n## Context\nThis notebook is based on a dataset based on data from a wikipedia page of the same name.","9c9f3261":"## What was the best year for games?","a96d6ab6":"## All games by number of references","84e56fb7":"## Publishers by games","708ef198":"Show the word frequency ","daf64a08":"Return a tuple representing the dimensionality"}}
