`date`: date of the observation.\n* `total_vaccinations`: total number of doses administered. This is counted as a single dose, and may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (e.g. people receive multiple doses). If a person receives one dose of the vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive a second dose, it goes up by 1 again.\n* `total_vaccinations_per_hundred`: `total_vaccinations` per 100 people in the total population of the state.\n* `daily_vaccinations_raw`: daily change in the total number of doses administered. It is only calculated for consecutive days. This is a raw measure provided for data checks and transparency, but we strongly recommend that any analysis on daily vaccination rates be conducted using `daily_vaccinations` instead.\n* `daily_vaccinations`: new doses administered per day (7-day smoothed). For countries that don't report data on a daily basis, we assume that doses changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window. An example of how we perform this calculation can be found [here](https:\/\/github.com\/owid\/covid-19-data\/issues\/333#issuecomment-763015298).\n* `daily_vaccinations_per_million`: `daily_vaccinations` per 1,000,000 people in the total population of the state.\n* `people_vaccinated`: total number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive the second dose, the metric stays the same.\n* `people_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the state.\n* `people_fully_vaccinated`: total number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric stays the same. If they receive the second dose, the metric goes up by 1.\n* `people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred`: `people_fully_vaccinated` per 100 people in the total population of the state.\n* `total_distributed`: cumulative counts of COVID-19 vaccine doses recorded as shipped in CDC's Vaccine Tracking System.\n* `total_distributed_per_hundred`: cumulative counts of COVID-19 vaccine doses recorded as shipped in CDC's Vaccine Tracking System per 100 people in the total population of the state.\n* `share_doses_used`: share of vaccination doses administered among those recorded as shipped in CDC's Vaccine Tracking System.","a6bba1e9":"<h1 style='background:#ffa500; border:0; color:black'><center>Overall Vaccine Progress<\/center><\/h1>  \n\n<center><a href='https:\/\/www.census.gov\/popclock\/'>Approximately 330 million people live in the US<\/a><\/center> ","83e2ea8c":"<h1 style='background:#ffa500; border:0; color:black'><center>State Vaccination Progress<\/center><\/h1>  \n<center>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Which states are leading in vaccines administered?<\/li>\n        <li>Which states are leading in vaccines administered based on percent population?<\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/center>"}}
