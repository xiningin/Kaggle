College code and subject is real and the semester cgpa is also a real world dataset.\n\nSolution :\nPrediction of the next semester marks can be determined by using machine learning algorithms. In my point of view advance regression technique can be a good performer for this case.\n\n","87d3b6f8":"# Select only relevent columns only.
