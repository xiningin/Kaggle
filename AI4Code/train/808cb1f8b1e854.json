Throughout this notebook there are markdown cells with instructions and questions for you to answer.  After each question is a markdown cell for your answer -- double click on the markdown cell to edit it.  You only need to single click on a code cell to edit it.\n\nAt a minimum, complete all the cells in this notebook.\n"}}
