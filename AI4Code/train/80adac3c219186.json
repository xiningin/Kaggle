Elevation alone can differentiate between the first 4 covertypes and the last one. This might turn out to be the most important variable in this whole dataset!\n2. Hillshade_Noon and Hillshade_9am can distinguish between the first 3 covertypes for certain instances and the last 3 covertypes for other instances. It could be very useful variables.\n3. Vertical Distance to Hydrology looks like it can do a nice job of separating covertypes as well provided it was visualized as a radial or some other axis.\n4. \n","c2650d01":"# When you are using AutoViz, you can ask AutoViz to randomly sample a huge data set like this for visualization which makes it fast and easy to use. Notice that I have chosen to sample only about 10% of this data and still get the same insights."}}
