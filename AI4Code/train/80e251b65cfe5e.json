It is also composed of people in different stages in their professional lives. \n\nThe Annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey, conducted every year since 2017, allows us to obtain a comprehensive view of our community and its subsets. Some commonly covered topics include the analysis of Kagglers by country, gender, age and preferred programming language. The question \"Select the title most similar to your current role\" also encourages the creation of notebooks focused on the most popular professions and on the student community. However, there is one group that doesn't normally receive a similar attention: The Kagglers who selected the option \"Currently Not Employed\".\n\nIn this notebook, I explore this subset of the Kaggle community, analyzing their distribution among different demographic features (gender, age and education) and the unemployment rate for each chosen category.\n\n## Notes About the Dataset\n\nRemoved Samples: In an attempt to focus on people that are most likely looking for a job, I removed the samples that have the option \u2018Student\u2019 as their current role. I also made the decision to remove the respondents that are less than 22 years old or above 60 years old.\n\nQuestion #2 (Gender): The options \u201cNonbinary\u201d, \u201cPrefer not to say\u201d and \u201cPrefer to self-describe\u201d have a low number of respondents. To analyze the unemployment rate by group, I created a new column called \u201cGender\u201d, where those answers were set as \u201cOther option\u201d.\n\nQuestion #3 (Country):\nSome countries account for a small number of respondents. To analyze the unemployment by country, I made the decision to create a new column called \u201cCountry\u201d, where all answers that correspond to nations with less than 200 respondents on the remaining dataset were changed to the option \u201cOther\u201d.\n\nQuestion #4 (Education Level):\n-\tThe options \u201cDoctoral degree\u201d and \u201cProfessional doctorate\u201d were changed to \u201cDoctor\u2019s degree\u201d;\n-\tThe options \u201cNo formal education past high school\u201d and \u201cSome college\/university study without earning a bachelor\u2019s degree\u201d were changed to \u201cNo degree\u201d.\n\n","79fa5ec5":"### Unemployment Rate by Gender and Age.\n\nTo have a better understanding on the unemployment landscape, we can analyze different demographic features at the same time, checking how each combination of categories affects the unemployment rate. We start with gender and age range.\n\nWhen combining those features, we can observe an interesting point. The unemployment rates by gender are somewhat close among Kagglers who are less than 30 years old. The gap is considerably larger, especially between men and women, among the older subset of respondents.\n","38ae4172":"### Unemployment Rate by Education Level\n\nThe highest unemployment rate (17.41%) is found among the respondents who preferred to not state their education level. We can notice that the unemployment rate among Kagglers who have no formal degree and those who have a bachelor\u2019s degree are actually quite close, around 14%. As we move on the \u2018formal education ladder\u2019, the unemployment rate seems to decrease, reaching 4,97% on Kagglers with doctor\u2019s degree.","4bc53fdf":"### Unemployment Rate by Gender and Education Level\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at the unemployment rate analyzing the samples both by gender and education level.\n\nThe highest unemployment rate is found among the Kagglers who don\u2019t define themselves as either man or woman and don\u2019t have a formal degree. However, it\u2019s important to point out that, given the small number of samples on that group, we should avoid drawing definitive conclusions.\n\nAmong the respondents who declared themselves as man or woman, we can see that the unemployment rate is always higher on the female subset. Apart from the \u2018no degree\u2019 option, the gap is always significant. Surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t seem to reduce even when we progress on the education level. We can see that among the doctors, 3.71% of the male respondents are unemployed while we have an unemployment rate of 9.43% for women.\n","3afbcaff":"### Additional Note\n\nThe use of Plotly annotated heatmaps and part of the structure adopted in this work were inspired by [@desalegngeb\u2019s](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/desalegngeb) notebook [\u201cHow popular is kaggle in Africa?\u201d](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/desalegngeb\/how-popular-is-kaggle-in-africa).","03e235bb":"### Distribution by Age\n\nOver 50% of the respondents that are currently not employed are 29 years old or less. Above 30 years, the percentage of respondents that compose this subset declines as we advance on the age range.","30f51363":"## Conclusion\n\nThis notebook presents a brief exploration on the subset of Kagglers who are currently not employed. It's important to point out that it doesn't attempt to answer specific questions, such as how to maximize the chances of employment. The intent was to simply provide an overview of this particular group.\n\nWhen it comes to use this dataset to provide some guidance for those who are currently unemployed, notebooks that focus on exploring the tools and technologies used by those who are working on a \u2018data-related\u2019 job are a good place to start. However, I believe the survey can still be improved, including, for instance, questions related to the level of knowledge on each of those tools. Such questions would help us to understand the knowledge\/skill gap between those who are successful on this field and those who aim to enter it.\n","c1bfca06":"### Unemployment Rate by Country for respondents with Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s Degree\n\nAmong the five countries with the highest unemployment rate for Kagglers who have a bachelor\u2019s degree as their highest level of education, we find Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria and India, countries who have a higher overall unemployment rate. However, the #1 in this list is France. France presents a substantial gap in unemployment rate between respondents with Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degree (25.00% and 7.08%, respectively).\n\nGenerally, having a higher formal degree translates to a higher chance of find a job. Curiously, this doesn\u2019t seem to be true in some countries. In Italy, China, United Kingdom and Egypt, the unemployment rate is actually higher among respondents with Master\u2019s degree.\n","e8bedb29":"On the choropleth map for female unemployment rate, it\u2019s noticeable how Spain and Canada differ from the other countries of their respective continents.","3bbe3dd0":"### Unemployment Rate by Gender\n\nGiven the small number of samples that correspond to the options \u2018Nonbinary\u2019, \u2018Prefer not to say\u2019 and \u2018Prefer to self-describe\u2019, they were combined in an attempt to reduce possible distortions when we analyze the unemployment rate.\n\nWe see that less than 9.50% of male respondents are unemployed, while the unemployment rate for woman and the other options are 14.19% and 12.13%, respectively. Given the restrictive nature of the survey and the lack of some additional context, we should be careful when drawing certain conclusions, but this result may be an indicative of gender bias.","0ccff82f":"### Unemployment Rate\n\nAfter limiting the scope of the dataset to Kagglers between 22 and 59 years old, who didn\u2019t declare themselves as \u2018students\u2019, we have the 17152 remaining respondents. In this group, 10.34% of the respondents are currently not employed.","88fb1ce8":"We finish this notebook by plotting the choropleth map for both categories. It\u2019s interesting to see how France stands out from the rest on the first plot (Bachelor\u2019s degree) and how the overall landscape changes on the second (Master\u2019s degree).","8ff90750":"### Distribution by Education Level\n\nThe immense majority of currently not employed Kagglers have selected Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degree as their highest level of education, corresponding for above 80% of those respondents.","ef1536e3":"### Men and Women Unemployment Rate by Country\n\nWe can also analyze the unemployment rate by country for men and women.\n\nWhen we focus on the female Kagglers, the top five countries in unemployment rate changes to the following configuration: Spain, Canada, Egypt, Nigeria and India.\n\nThe last two countries have a high \u2018overall\u2019 unemployment rate, with similar values between men and women. However, the first three countries have an alarming difference on the unemployment between genders. The #1 Spain has a rate of 20% for women while only 5.62% of Spanish male Kagglers are unemployed. \n\nIn almost all listed countries, the unemployed rate for men is either significantly lower or around the same percentage as for women. An interesting exception is the United Kingdom, where 11.36% of male respondents are unemployed, against 5.75% for women.","a063cb64":"### Unemployment Rate by Age\n\nAs expected, the higher unemployment rates are found among the youngest Kagglers. The lower unemployment rates are found among the samples who are between 30 and 49 years old. After that age, we see a little increase on unemployment.","316279ea":"### Unemployment Rate by Country and Age Range\n\nThe five countries with the highest unemployment rate for younger Kagglers (22 to 29 years old) are: Indonesia, Nigeria, India, Egypt and United Kingdom.\n\nAs expected, the Unemployment rate for respondents who are less than 29 years old is significantly higher in comparison with older Kagglers on most countries. However, there are interesting exceptions, mainly Italy, Japan and Canada, where the unemployment rate is actually higher for those above 30 years old.","548aa57f":"### Unemployment Rate by Country\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look on the unemployment rate by country.\n\nThe five countries with the highest unemployment rate are: Indonesia, Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Egypt.\n\nThe country with the lowest unemployment rate is Italy (4.62%) followed by: China, Brazil, Germany and France.","997adae2":"## <center> Thank you for reading! <center>","2611b8e3":"We can plot the choropleth map for both categories to highlight the contrasts."}}
