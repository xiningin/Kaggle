Going further down we find a cortex tile with no gloms.","53fcffa6":"# Tiling the Large Images into tiles with overlap\nTiles are square arrays of pixels with two regions:   An inner region consisting of a P['TILE_SIZE'] pixel diameter square surrounded by an outer annular region with a radius\nof P['TILE_OVERLAP'] pixels.  Tiles are arranged so that inner regions abut to cover the entire image, with outer regions overlapping adjacent tiles.\n\nNOTE: The image numpy arrays have dimensions [height, width, channels]. This Notebook will tile the image using offsets for the height index and width index. So:\n- a Tile with coordinate [0,0] represents the first tile on the top left corner.  \n- a Tile with coordinate [1,0] represents a tile with height offset = 1*Tile Size, in this case it starts at numpy coordinates [P['TILE_SIZE'],0], which means it is the tile below [0,0]\n- a Tile with coordinate [0,1] represents a tile with wodth offset = 1*Tile Size, in this case it starts at numpy coordinates [0,P['TILE_SIZE']], which means it is the tile to the right of [0,0]\n\nHere are some useful functions that use the numpy slicing capability to select specific tiles of the image.

We found our first glom. Let's now derive a metric for masks, so that in the future we can easily find tiles with gloms.

The images in this competition have very high resolution, averaging 30,000 x 30,000 pixels, and this presents a difficult challenge in memory management. It is just not possible to read them all in memory in the Kaggle environment, and it is also not possible to build a model using the whole image as input. This notebooks provides some tips for reading the competitions images and masks, and proposes a strategy to deal with the large sizes. \nThe strategy adopted in this Notebook is to tile the images into overlapping tiles, and then transforming the tiles into TFRecords such that we can later use them as input to train models using GPU or TPU accelerators. \n\nThis Notebook takes a long time to run because it processes all the competition files and the resulting, compressed dataset is 18.1G, almost exceeding the Kaggle VM limit. I was able to process all files and then uploaded the results to a Kaggle daset that I have made public:\n--> [Link to the TFRecord Dataset Produced by this Notebook.](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/marcosnovaes\/hubmap-tfrecord-512)\n\nI have also developed a Notebook that explains how to use the TFRecord Dataset: [https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/marcosnovaes\/hubmap-looking-at-tfrecords\/](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/marcosnovaes\/hubmap-looking-at-tfrecords\/)\n\nIf you want to use the dataset without change you don't need to run the Notebook -- but do read through it because it provides a lot of insight on how the read the images, masks and convert them to TFRecords. I will be using this dataset on my subsequent notebooks. You can also easily costumize this Notebook if you want to produce tiles of different sizes (P['TILE_SIZE']) or if you want to include more metadata for each tile.

As we explore the tiles, I also calculate the tile histogram. If we observe the histogram we will notice that it will provide a useful way to filter black and white tiles later. The numpy.histogram function divides the color spectrum in 10 bins and shows how many pixels call within each bin. We can notice that black and white fall into the higher end of the spectrum. Black tiles have 0 pixels in the lower end, while \"white\" (actually \"dirty gray\") has only about 20 pixels in that region. We then see that tiles with some actual tissue have a more even distribution. Let's call this metric \"lowpass energy\". It turns out that if we later select lowpass energy > 100 we are garanteed to have actual tissue in the slide, and we can discard anything with < 100. ","3ad2a918":"# Transforming the Tiles into a TFRecord Dataset\nWe are now ready to read all the images (one at a time or we will run out of memory!) and then writing each tile to a TFRecord file. Kaggle has a limit of 50 upper level directories, so we will create one dir for each image. We will also build a pandas dataframe that has the metadata for each tile, including the lowpass energy and mask density metrics that we derived above. \n\nUsing the TFRecord format for storing data should be easy, but unfortunately it requires data serialization which complicates it a little bit. This is done using [protocol buffers](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/protocol-buffers\/) and that is a bit of a learning curve. But in ML you only need to understand the [TFExample](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/api_docs\/python\/tf\/train\/Example) format. In this Notebook I provide a little template code for dealing with TFExamples that can be quickly customized for any type of data. This template is explained in detail in [this tutorial](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/load_data\/tfrecord); but you don't need to read all this, in this Notebook I provide an example specific for image data that you can quickly customize.\n\nFor serialization using TFExample, we have to make any data fit into either one of 3 types:\n* bytes_feature\n* float_feature\n* int_64_feature\n\nIn this Notebook and image and mask are passed as bytes_features and the other metadata as int_64.
