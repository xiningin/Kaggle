There are a wide variety of recipes and cuisines in part because Indonesia is composed of approximately 6,000 populated islands of the total 17,508 in the world's largest archipelago,with more than 300 ethnic groups calling Indonesia home.Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture with some foreign influences.Indonesia has around 5,350 traditional recipes, with 30 of them considered the most important.Indonesia's cuisine may include rice, noodle and soup dishes in modest local eateries to street-side snacks and top-dollar plates.\n\nIndonesian cuisine varies greatly by region and has many different influences.Sumatran cuisine, for example, often has Middle Eastern and Indian influences, featuring curried meat and vegetables such as gulai and curry, while Javanese cuisine is mostly indigenous,with some hint of Chinese influence. The cuisines of Eastern Indonesia are similar to Polynesian and Melanesian cuisine. Elements of Chinese cuisine can be seen in Indonesian cuisine: foods such as noodles, meat balls, and spring rolls have been completely assimilated.\n\n<img style=\"width:700px;height:450px\" src=\"https:\/\/s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com\/thebalibible.com\/uploads\/images\/venue\/632402f7edcea19924e58e0b99316e52.jpg\"\/>\n<h3 align=\"center\" style='font-size:10px'>Image source : thebalibible.com<\/h3>","54064ccf":"<h3 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\">The most loved food recipe<\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\"><\/h3>","ff2c4d6a":"<a style=\"color:blue;font-size:20px\">Work in progress...<\/a>","03c46bfc":"### Basic Library","176a3e5b":"Let's drop the URL since it can't give us much information"}}
