These unique structures are considered as\nthe dominant contribution to the excellent properties, including\ngood thermal stability [5], outstanding mechanical properties\n[6,7], high hardness and wear resistance [8,9], exceptional\nhigh-temperature strength [10,11], irradiation resistance [12,13],\nexcellent corrosion and oxidation resistance [14\u201315].
