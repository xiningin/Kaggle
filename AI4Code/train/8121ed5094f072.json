Is it a supervised, unsupervised, or Reinforcement Learning?\n        This is a supervised learning. We know that we have to predict miles per gallon (mpg).\n2. Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else?\n        We have to predict Miles per gallon. mpg is a measure of fuel economy of a car and it is a numerical value. Hence this is a regression task.\n3. Should we use batch learning or online learning techniques?\n        As there is no continuous flow of data coming into the system, so batch learning is enough.\n","ce1e44be":"a.
