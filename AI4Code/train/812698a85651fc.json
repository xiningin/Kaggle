The data in this competition contains images of over 15,000 unique individual marine mammals from 30 different species collected from 28 different research organizations. Individuals have been manually identified and given an individual_id by marine researches.\n\nThe task is to correctly identify these individuals in the images. It's a challenging task that has the potential to drive significant advancements in understanding and protecting marine mammals across the globe.\n\nThis is an image classification problem .I will be using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) technique for the solution.
