Currently, there are few data showing whether the left and right limbs progress at the same or different rates. That study addresses rates of decline in specific muscle groups of patients with ALS and assesses whether there is a relationship between left and right muscles in the same patient, regardless of overall progression.\"\n\n\"That report shows that linearized progression models can predict general slopes of decline with good accuracy. Critically, the data demonstrate that while overall decline is variable, there is a high degree of correlation between left and right muscle decline in ALS. This implies that irrespective of which muscle starts declining soonest or latest, their rates of decline following onset are more consistent.\"\n\n\"That study demonstrates a high degree of power when using unilateral treatment approaches to detect a slowing in disease progression in smaller groups of patients, thus allowing for paired statistical tests. These findings will be useful in transplantation trials that use muscle decline to track disease progression in ALS. Second, these findings discuss methods, such as tactical selection of muscle groups, which can improve the power efficiency of all ALS clinical trials.\" \n\nhttps:\/\/n.neurology.org\/content\/89\/2\/196","2d46e18c":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Portable fixed dynamometry: towards remote muscle strength measurements in patients with motor neuron disease<\/h1>\n\nCitation: Bakers, J.N.E., van den Berg, L.H., Ajeks, T.G. et al.

Evaluating muscle strength is therefore an important way to monitor disease progression in clinical trials. This is usually done in the hospital by means of a \u2018hand-held dynamometer\u2019. Using this method, the strength of various muscle groups is measured. New research from the Netherlands ALS Centre now shows that the reliability and sensitivity of muscle strength testing can be improved using a portable fixed dynamometer.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tricals.org\/news\/towards-remote-muscle-strength-measurements-using-a-newly-developed-portable-fixed-dynamometer\/","dc1c123d":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Understanding Variability in Assays <\/span>**\n\n\n\"It's important to understand variability in assays used when designing clinical trials, especially in diseases with a complex progression like ALS.\"\n\n\"Currently, it would appear that direct muscle strength assessments are the most effective assays for ALS progression, being the best compromise between ease of use and accuracy. However, choosing muscles that are least variable can further reduce the length of assessments and maintain the highest ratio of power to patients possible when using direct muscle assays.\"\n\n\"That study demonstrates that the biceps and triceps could be very effective for this purpose in both unilateral and bilateral experimental designs, with the quadriceps being only slightly better in the unilateral design.\" \n\n\"New clinical trials are required for ALS in order to develop a successful treatment, and the knowledge provided in this report will be critical for designing optimal, high power future trials.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/n.neurology.org\/content\/89\/2\/196","ee2069a8":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Assessment of Isokinetic and Hand-Held Dynamometer \nMeasures of Shoulder Rotator Strength Among Individuals \nWith Spinal Cord Injury<\/h1>\n\nAuthors: Laura A. May, MSc, PT, Robert S. Burnham, MD, Robert D.

Setting: Private practice clinic.\"\n\n\"The intraclass correlation coefficients for the intrarater reliability ranged from .89 to .96. The Pearson product moment correlation was used to analyze the relationship between the two devices. All coefficients (.52 to .88) were statistically significant (p < .01); however, separate analyses for the \npersons with paraplegia and tetraplegia differed considerably.\"\n\n\"There was substantial variability of the isokinetic strength values at the lower levels of isometric strength.\" \n\n\"Conclusions: The HHD (Hand Held Dynamometer) can be used reliably to measure shoulder rotation in paraplegic and tetraplegic spinal cord injured individuals. Although it appears that the relationship between HHD and isokinetic measurement is poor for the participants with tetraplegia, the variability of the isokinetic scores indicates that this observation may be a function of the method of isokinetic measurements.\"\n\n\"An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if significant differences existed for the results of each side for both rotation movements and under both test conditions (p < .05). Analyses were performed using the data of all SCI individuals combined, in addition to separate calculations for the participants with paraplegia and tetraplegia.\"\n\n\"The results of the ANOVA indicated that there was no significant difference between the right and left arms for either internal or external rotation for both test instruments. Therefore, the data were collated to consider each shoulder independently.
