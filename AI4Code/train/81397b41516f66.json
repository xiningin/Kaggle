Maybe people didnt buy many cars in 2009 due to economic troubles and consequently, there are lesser cars made in 2009 for sale .","c271ca5f":"We have to make some hard decisions now. There are way too many dubious values that hinder us from doind any kind of analysis. \nI saerch online for averge car prices this year.

Cars in this section start at an averge of arounf ~100k. \nI am willing to go to upto 200k for my analysis and droppping all other values.","e3b142b0":"We shouldnt be swayed by some of the figures above. This mean is close to 600k becuase of few car prices that are in the millions. On further anaysis of the prices column, I found that there were 43 cars that were being sold for values >600k. These include a \\$1,000,000 Ferrari and a \\$1,000,000,000 chevy! I could also see that there were a lot of dirty values such as 999,999,999 ans 123,456,789. \nWe can safely conclude that the data is dirty and its upto us to refine it if we want to derive some valuable insights. \nSome possible reasons for dirt prices:\n* Users *might* have forgot to put a decial point. For eg: a Jeep Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 2018 starts at around 35,000. I saw a price for the same at 3,200,000.    \n\nIf you have any other reasons, then please do let me know down in the comments below. ","c2421ead":"Anchorage seems to have a peculiarly high number.
