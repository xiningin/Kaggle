Monsoon was subdued in August with a large deficiency of 28% of LPA. In September (rainfall +17% above LPA), monsoon became active again helping a timely revival and improving the seasonal rainfall situation over the country.\n\n#### 2011\nOut of the total 36 meteorological subdivisions, 33 subdivisions constituting 92% of the total area of the country received excess\/normal season rainfall and the remaining 3 subdivisions (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, and NMMT constituting 8% of the total area of the country) received deficient season rainfall.\n\nRef:\n\nhttps:\/\/reliefweb.int\/report\/india\/india-meteorological-department-southwest-monsoon-2005-end-season-report\n\nhttps:\/\/reliefweb.int\/report\/india\/southwest-monsoon-2011-end-season-report\n\n### Zone-Wise Production - Total","07730525":"##### **Coconut** \n\nSo, now what all do I know?
