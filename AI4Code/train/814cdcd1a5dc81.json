Nothing special to note here, except there is a single outlier at 265 seconds where every other value is below 180.\n\nThe fact that our ID is not equal to the row ID seems to suggest that the train and test sets were randomly sampled from the same dataset, which could have some special order to it, for example a time series.

This time from Mercedes-Benz - our job is to predict how long a car on a production line will take to pass the testing phase. This is a classical regression problem, and we're evaluated with the R2 metric. Let's take a look at the data we're given:","bb3dfacc":"At first glance, there doesn't seem to be anything overly suspicious here - looks like how a random sort would. I might take a closer look later but for now let's move on to the features.\n\n## Feature analysis","6b7a0c55":"So, a much smaller dataset than what we've been used to recently. No images here! :)\nWe're given a single train and test csv, indicating that the data should also be pretty simple to play with.\n\nTime to load it into memory!\n## Training set","bfe96146":"Interestingly, we have 12 features which only have a single value in them - these are pretty useless for supervised algorithms, and should probably be dropped (unless you want to use them for anomaly detection in case a different value appears in the test set)\n\nThe rest of our dataset is made up of many binary features, and a few categorical features.","13c6e12b":"So out of all our features, we are given 8 object (likely a string) variables, 368 integer variables. What about the cardinality of our features?","8bea55f5":"Just from this, we can see that our training data is made up of just 4000 rows, but has 400 seemingly anonymised features inside. As well as this, we are given an ID (which is not equal to the row number, this could be significant) and the target value, which is the number of seconds taken.\n\nLet's start off by looking at the distribution of the target value:","1733ba39":"## XGBoost Starter\nNow that we know the outline of what the data's made up of, we can make a simple model on it.
