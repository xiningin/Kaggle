But who wants to be a billionaire? \nBefore raising your hand, pause and think about the old adage - \"More Money More Problems.\" We've all heard of that saying right? Well, in this analysis we're not going to discuss the number of times a billionaire finds himself\/herself in the middle of a divorce settlement\/battle or testifying before U.S. Congress. In this analysis, we will identify the richest people in the world in order to identify those with greater social responsibility and accountability leading to global impact in areas of poverty and climate change. No, the worlds problems do not belong to billionaires - they belong to all of us - but if we can work collaboratively, we might be able to get things done. \n\n**<font color = 3c8587 size = 4> Data Dictionary <\/font>**\n\n* **Names** - the billionaires name\n* **Net Worth** - their net worth\/ value of assets in billions (USD)\n* **Country** - the name of the country where they reside\/ are citizens\n* **Source** - their income source\n* **Rank** - their global position in comparison based on their net worth\n* **Age** - the age of the billionaire\n* **Industry** - the sector, industry, or market segment of their income source\n\n\n(What's missing here that would have been nice to know? **Their Genders!** But I did find out the richest female billionaire is Alice Walton, the heiress of the American heiress to the fortune of Walmart.
