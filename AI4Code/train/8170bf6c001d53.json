If the output from a model is the particular course of treatment (potentially with side-effects), or surgery, or the *absence* of treatment, people are going to want to know **why**.\n\nThis dataset gives a number of variables along with a target condition of having or not having heart disease. Below, the data is first used in a simple random forest model, and then the model is investigated using ML explainability tools and techniques.\n\n,","efe23733":"It's a clean, easy to understand set of data. However, the meaning of some of the column headers are not obvious. Here's what they mean,\n\n- **age**: The person's age in years\n- **sex**: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)\n- **cp:** The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\n- **trestbps:** The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n- **chol:** The person's cholesterol measurement in mg\/dl\n- **fbs:** The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg\/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false) \n- **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)\n- **thalach:** The person's maximum heart rate achieved\n- **exang:** Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n- **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more [here](https:\/\/litfl.com\/st-segment-ecg-library\/))\n- **slope:** the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)\n- **ca:** The number of major vessels (0-3)\n- **thal:** A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)\n- **target:** Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)\n"}}
