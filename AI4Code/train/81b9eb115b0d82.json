Beef and pork are become increasingly expensive as improving global economies lead to greater meat demand. That's forced meatpackers to bid more aggressively for smaller supplies of slaughter-ready animals, a function of the 2008-09 recession that prompted widespread herd contraction.\n- Same observation in 2020 due to COVID19.","83202dc8":"## Looking into prices of chicken over the years","393d30e6":"![](https:\/\/thumbs.gfycat.com\/ShrillPoisedGourami-size_restricted.gif)\n# Introduction\nThe purpose of this kernel is to have a basic understanding of the data and also identify any reason for the price change.

Presently, growing demand is being driven by consumers\u2019 increasingawareness of the health benefits of a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, a growing acceptance for consuming farmed fish, the sustainability of production, and a stable, year-round supply. ","6a5580c8":"### What do we see?\n- We see that price % change is deemed as an object. We will need to fix that by removing the \"%\" sign.\n- We also notice that the percentages of NaN values are significant (more than 5 %). We will drop the NaN values for those columns with 1 NaN value and as for the rest, we will replace them with median value. ","298a8b24":"## Looking into prices of pork","3da6cfcf":"## What do we see here?\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5hwUthW.jpg)\n- Lamb prices increased steadily since 2000. Speaking of lamb, you should try the grill lamb Dwight brought in this morning. Much better than the bull testicle he brought me the last time.\n- We are still spending about the same per cent of our money on chicken and slightly less on lamb, but what we get for that money has greatly changed. The price of lamb has increased over the past 25 years out of all proportion to other meats.\n- To purchase the same amount of chicken that cost 10 bucks in 1994 you would now need to pay just 13.64 \u2013 a 36% increase over a period where the average male full-time earnings have risen 161% from 659 dollars a week to 1,726 dollars. By contrast, to get the same amount of lamb that cost you 10 bucks in 1994, you would now need to outlay 32.26 \u2013 a 222% increase.","972bd7bd":"## Overview of data","afb33e3c":"### What do we see here\n- Similar to lamb, price has steadiliy increase since 1999.","42156077":"## What do we see here?\n- We observe drastic changes to chicken prices from 2014 onwards. After doing some research, what we found out was feeder prices were at their peak. \n- When 8 dollars per bushel corn pushed up feed prices, the US economy was experiencing a downturn and the poultry processors cut back on both meat production and the numbers of breeding birds.\n- The sharp drop in early 2020 was possibly due to the coronavirus pandemic. With less people going out and more restaurant forced to close, the supply of chicken exceeds demand, resulting in price drop."}}
