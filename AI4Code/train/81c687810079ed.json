One dimension is given by the x-axis and the other by the y-axis. The third dimension is given by the color. We will go through this figure carefully.\n\n- The y-axis is depth, just like in the permafrost picture we looked at earlier. \n- The x-axis is time, as shown at the top. The year is given at the very top. Below that, the month is given, where the S stands for September, O for October, and so on.

Learning how to take a numerical derivative (For calculus students)\n\nOur goal is to examine the heat flux through our layer of permafrost, using the equation for $j_h$ given in the Introduction. Before doing so, however, you'll need to develop some skill at taking numerical deriviatives. Below, you'll learn how to create x, dx, f(x), and df\/dx.\n\nFirst, learn how to create x using arange:","186c1e1f":"If the temperature is measured with depth underground, we can calculate the heat flow. We need to make some definitions first. We'll let $z$ be the depth into the ground. This means that in the image below $z$=0 would be at the surface, and $z$ = 2 m would be around knee-level. \n\nNow suppose that you measured the temperature in each of the carved-out squares. These measurements would indicate the temperature for the layer of ice at that depth. We'll use $T$ to indicate temperature, so $T(z)$ is the temperature for a layer at depth $z$. The vertical heat flux through that layer depends on how $T$ changes with $z$:\n\n$j_h = -K_h \\frac{dT}{dz}$,\n\n\n\nYou may remember from calculus that $\\frac{dT}{dz}$ is the change in $T$ for a small change in $z$. It has units of $K m^{-1}$.\n\n$K_h$ is the _thermal conductivity_, and it quantifies how well permafrost is able to transfer heat. It depends on two factors: how much heat is needed to increase the temperature of permafrost and how fast permafrost transfers heat. Suppose that each of the squares in the figure is hotter on one side than the other (for example, when the sun is warming the ground, it might be hotter at the top side than the bottom side). The rate of heat transfer of the permafrost from the hot side to the cold side is called the _thermal diffusivity_\n\n$D_h$, with units of [$m^2\/s$].\n\nThe thermal diffusivity tells us how quickly the permafrost transfers heat. We also need to know how much heat is needed to increase the temperature of the permafrost, or the _specific heat capacity_\n\n$c_h$, with units of [$ J \\space kg^{-1} K^{-1} $].  \n\nThe specific heat capacity is defined to be per kg of permafrost. It's more convenient to have a heat capacity per m of permafrost, or the _volume heat capacity_. This is obtained from the specific heat capacity by multiplying by the density of the material, $\\rho$ ($kg \\space m^{-1}$)\n\n$C_h = \\rho c_h$, with units [$ J \\space m^{-1} K^{-1} $].\n\nFrom $C_h$ and $D_h$ we can get $K_h$, as follows \n\n$K_h = C_h D_h$, with units [$ J \\space m^{-1}s^{-1} K^{-1} $].\n\nThe thermal conductivity tells you how heat (in J) moves through the permafrost (m) with time (s), based on the temperature (K). Thus $j_h$ at each depth depends on the change in temperature with depth and how heat moves through the permafrost with time for the given temperature.\n\nNote that we've defined terms so that a positive value of $j_h$ means heat is moving _down into the ground_, and a negative value means heat is moving _up toward the surface_. \n\nDefine the terms _thermal diffusivity_, _thermal conductivity_, _specific heat capacity_, and _volume heat capacity_.","0ca25629":"## Part 6.

These images reveal land cover and allow tracking events like hurricanes and fires. This module explores image processing of satellite images in polar regions. The module starts with exploring how images are loaded, plotted, and stored; how they can be manipulated to produce true and false-color and black and white images; and color mapping. Activites also include edge detection, noise removal, determining snow and sea ice extent, and scene identification. \n\n<font size=\"4\">[Ice Cores and Climate Change](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pennyrowe\/ice-cores)<\/font>  \nAs snow accumulates onto ice sheets over hundreds or thousands of years, air bubbles are trapped as the snow is compressed into firn and then ice.

Finally, try a second method of estimating the near-surface temperature, through matching South Polar radiative emission to a Planck Blackbody Spectrum. \n\n<font size=\"4\">[Seasonal Arctic Ice Melt](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/pennyrowe\/sea-ice-melt-1)<\/font>  \nLearn about thermodynamics topics through calculation of the amount of heat required to melt Arctic sea ice. Watch an online animation of changing polar ice with time, downloading data of Arctic ice extent and volume. Activities include using thermodynamic principles and equations to plot the phase diagram of water, find the freezing point depression of Arctic sea ice in equilibrium with sea water, and compute the change in the enthalpy of fusion of water resulting from that temperature depression.\n","f1230796":"### Pause for analysis: heat flow\n1. Is heat flowing up through the surface, or down into it?  \n2. At what depth is the heat flux the greatest?  \n3. Which profile (July 1998 or November 1998) has the greater heat flux?  \n4. Can you explain why based on the profiles themselves?","2dbfd0dc":"Below you will graph your temperatures. Run the cell below (shift+enter) and a plot should appear below it.","569c383a":"### Pause for analysis: calculating the derivative\nDoes this graph make sense to you? Using your knowledge of calculus, obtain an analytical expression for df\/dx, and compare it to the graph above.","e6b76eda":"### What is heat flux?\n\nWe can use physics to determine heat flux through permafrost. Heat flux is the flow of energy through an area. You can watch a YouTube video about heat flux here: add link.\n\nLook at the picture below, which shows a slice through permafrost. \n\n<p style ='text-align: center;'>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/globalcryospherewatch.org\/assessments\/permafrost\/permafrost.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\"\/> \n<b>Figure 2. <\/b>Measuring temperature with depth in permafrost (Image from the International Permafrost Association courtesy of the Global Cryosphere Watch).\n<\/p>  \n\nImagine you are standing at the top look down at a square of ground, say a 1 m x 1 m square. You want to understand how energy is flowing down into the ground through that square, or up out of that square. The energy has units of Watts (think of a 60 Watt old-fashioned lightbulb), so the heat flux is Watts per square meter, or W\/m$^2$.\n\nTo calculate the heat flux, you would first need to know the temperature going down into the ground. In the picture, they took temperature measurements in each of the squares on the side of the wall of permafrost. In this activity, you will first examine some temperature profiles and then learn how to calculate the heat flux from them.\n\nTo allow you to work directly with observed data, you will use Python code. Although you will learn some basics of coding along the way, the Juypter Notebooks should provide a framework to guide you through each step.\n\n\n**End of Introduction**","770358c6":"### Pause for Analysis\n1. Use the zoom feature to zoom in around -0.05 to 0.1 C.  \n2. How do the heat fluxes compare?  At what depths are they the same\/different for different years?\n3. How does this compare to your prediction?\n4. Explain how the temperature and heat fluxes are different in 2011 from the other years. What are the consequences of this difference for permafrost melt?","c4bd5832":"### Why are polar regions important?\nAlthough difficult to study, polar regions are very important for climate change research, because the unique conditions of the polar regions lead to amplification of climate change. You can learn more about polar regions are affected by climate change here (link needed).","8516e421":"### We hope you enjoyed this PENGUIN module","ae2c3645":"### Pause for analysis: Comparing ways of displaying temperature with depth.\n1. Find November 1998 in Figure 4. Do you agree that that the green profile above corresponds to this date? What other dates look similar?\n2. How does the green curve compare to the orange curve? Where is the ground warming or cooling between November and July? Why do you think this might be the case?  \n3. When was the purple temperature profile above measured? Go back to Figure 4 and find out.  \n4. In the cell above, what date do you think corresponds to the purple curve? Write your answer in your notebook.\n5.

Note that the graph will be added to the figure above.","76d9b755":"It's useful to convert the density into a more familiar unit, $g\/cm^3$, since we know that the density of pure water has a density of $1 g\/cm^3$, so the density of permafrost should be a little less. Print the density of our soil as $g\/cm^3$. ","080b0b9c":"How did you do? Don't worry if your values don't agree perfectly, but they should be similar.  \n\nNext you will load in and plot profiles of temperature at two other times. These will correspond to vertical slices through Figure 4 at at other times.","9741e444":"We're almost done with this tutorial. A slight twist comes when you want to graph df\/dx. Because both df and dx are one shorter than the original f and x, you need to shorten the x too. You can do this with the following command:","7282f79e":"### Post-activity reflection\n1. The first set of data only went down to 1.4 m, whereas the second set didn't even start until between 1 and 4 meters below the surface.
