It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.\n\n        Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\n\n**Python is Interpreted\u2212** Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\n\n**Python is Interactive** \u2212 You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\n\n**Python is Object-Oriented** \u2212 Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\n\n**Python is a Beginner's Language** \u2212 Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.","3fb91d10":"                            **Characteristics of Python**\nFollowing are important characteristics of Python Programming \u2212\n\nIt supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.\n\nIt can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.\n\nIt provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.\n\nIt supports automatic garbage collection.","3097e41f":"Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.\n","770de6bc":"**Simple programme**\n     It simply print \"hello world\"","689e597e":"                      **Basic Understanding with Python**","71fd0a65":"                                    **Python - Variable**","0256f9f7":"The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.\n\nThe message can be a string, or any other object, the object will be converted into a string before written to the screen."}}
