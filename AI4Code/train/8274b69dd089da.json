What do you think? Where do the peaks come from, just coincidence? If you know more about it or have suggestions for improvement, write it to me in the comments.\n\nPS: I have not looked at any notebook for this competition, maybe there is already a notebook similar to mine...","9cbb778f":"### First we look at a histogram of the scores to get a first impression of the distribution","36d0ec38":"* In fact nothing new. We have already seen that it becomes very tight at 0.120 - 0.125. More than 10% of the participants are in this range. If we want to be in the top 10%, we need a score less than 0.12017, for the top 5% less than 0.11877. Maybe we should also drop the 0.00044 to get a more realistic ranking.","586b19ed":"### Leaderboard: 14.10.2020","f71597a1":"My first educational competition was the Titanic competition. In this competition I missed to check the leaderboard for any abnormalities before I started to create models. The problem with the Titanic competition is that there are so many cheated scores, so I had no clue which score was actually good. After some research I found [this notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/carlmcbrideellis\/titanic-leaderboard-a-score-0-8-is-great), which gave me information about which score is good\/to achieve and which inspired me to this notebook. This time I try to do it better and check the leaderboard for anomalies before I start...","aab6fca6":"### Now let's take a look at the quantiles","c3ac9079":"* Again nothing new. I think there are three milestones that will give us a boost to the ranking when exceeded: 0.122, 0.120, 0.117","b5ad08a5":"### Now let's take a look at the most common scores","b6854e77":"* 55 participants with score 0.0044... Now we can almost be sure that this score is cheated somehow.\n* 36 participants with score 0.11720. Coincidence?\n* 74 participants with score 0.12010 - 0.12013. That is quite tight.\n* 138 participants with score 0.40613, would bet that this is the sample_submission.","eb0b3c2f":"### Finally we take a look at the histogram of the top 20% scores","405ad6bf":"* Ok, we have a peak near zero, probably cheated again?\n* A big peak at 0.125, any score lower is probably already very good. We'll look at this more closely later with quantiles.\n* One peak at about 0.400, possibly the sample_submission?"}}
