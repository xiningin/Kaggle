From fig in (row 1,col 3), it is clear that if the number of axilnods is very less roughly between(0-5), then the chances of survival are more.\n2. Age and Axilnodes turned out to be the more important factors in determining the survival.","e06b21bf":"**Analysis:**\n1. Univariate Analysis: PDF, CDF, boxplot, violin plots\n2. Bivariate Analysis: Scatter plot, pairplot\n3.

Number of independent variables are 3 i.e. Age, YearOfOperation and AxilNodes while the dependent one is SurvivalStatus.","f0b3237d":"Observations:\n    \n1. Axilnodes is more informative than other two features.\n2. While there is a lot of difference in values between mean and median of Axilnodes, indicating some outliers.","dc888483":"Here the mean value of age is 52. And the mean value of axilnodes is 4. The maximum no of axilnodes is 52 while minimum is 0.","43b112a4":"Description:\n1. Age- Age of the patient at the time of operation.\n\n2. YearOfOperation- The year in which operation was done.\n\n3. AxilNodes- The axillary lymph nodes or armpit lymph nodes are lymph nodes in the human armpit. Between 20 and 49 in number, they drain lymph vessels from the lateral quadrants of the breast, the superficial lymph vessels from thin walls of the chest and the abdomen above the level of the navel, and the vessels from the upper limb. They are divided in several groups according to their location in the armpit. These lymph nodes are clinically significant in breast cancer, and metastases from the breast to the axillary lymph nodes are considered in the staging of the disease.\nAbout 75% of lymph from the breasts drains into the axillary lymph nodes, making them important in the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer. \n\n4. SurvivalStatus- Label Feature has value of 1,2 where 1 corresponds to the patient who survived for more than 5 years and 2 corresponds to patient who survived less than 5 years.","acbf04bc":"Observation:\n    \n1.

The important features to study are Age and AxilNodes.\n2. If Age lies in the interval(30-40) and the number of AxilNodes lie in (0,10), then the chances of survival are more.\n3. If Age lies in the interval(30-48) and the number of AxilNodes lie in (10,20), then the chances of survival are more.\n4. If Age lies in the interval(50-70) and the number of AxilNodes lie in (10,20), then the chances of non-survival are more.\n5. If Age lies in the interval(70-80), then the chances of survival are more.\n6. If Age is greater than 80, then the chances of non-survival are more.\n7. If AxilNodes lies in the interval(0-1), then there is maximum chance of survival.","7ee1fef1":"Observation:\n    \n1. There are no outliers and much can be derived from this plot.\n2.
