Descriptive statistics in pandas <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"18\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n\nThere exists a large number of methods for computing descriptive statistics and other related operations on Series, DataFrame, and Panel. Most of these are aggregations (hence producing a lower-dimensional result) like sum(), mean(), and quantile(), but some of them, like cumsum() and cumprod(), produce an object of the same size. Generally speaking, these methods take an axis argument, just like ndarray.{sum, std, \u2026}, but the axis can be specified by name or integer.\n\n\n- Series: no axis argument needed.\n\n\n- DataFrame: \u201cindex\u201d (axis=0, default), \u201ccolumns\u201d (axis=1).\n\n\n- Panel: \u201citems\u201d (axis=0), \u201cmajor\u201d (axis=1, default), \u201cminor\u201d (axis=2).\n\n\n\n### Functions and description\n\n\nThe following table list down the important functions under Descriptive Statistics in Python Pandas. \n\n\n\n- 1   **count()** -\tNumber of non-null observations\n\n\n- 2\t  **sum()**\t  - Sum of values\n\n\n- 3\t  **mean()**  -\tMean of values\n\n\n- 4\t **median()** -\tMedian of values\n\n\n- 5\t **mode()**  -\tMode of values\n\n\n- 6\t **std()**   -\tStandard deviation of the values\n\n\n- 7\t **min()**   -\tMinimum value\n\n\n- 8\t **max()**   -\tMaximum value\n\n\n- 9\t **abs()**   -\tAbsolute value\n\n\n- 10 **prod()**  -\tProduct of values\n\n\n- 11 **cumsum()** -\tCumulative sum\n\n\n- 12 **cumprod()** - Cumulative product\n\n\n\nThe dataframe is a heterogeneous data structure. So, the different column values have different data types. Generic operations don't work with all functions.\n\n\nFunctions like **sum()**, **cumsum()** work with both numeric and character (or) string data elements without any error. \nIn practice, character aggregations are never used generally. These functions do not throw any exception.\n\n\nFunctions like **abs()**, **cumprod()** throw exception when the dataframe contains character or string data because such operations cannot be performed.\n","b3079dce":"# 19. Statistical functions in pandas <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"19\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n\nStatistical functions help us to understand and analyze the behavior of data. In this section, I will discuss few statistical functions, which we can apply on Pandas objects.\n\n\n\n### Percent_change\n\n\nSeries, datFrames and panel, all have the function **pct_change()**. This function compares every element with its prior element and computes the change percentage.\n\nBy default, the pct_change() operates on columns; if you want to apply the same row wise, then use axis=1() argument.\n\n\n\n### Covariance\n\n\nCovariance is applied on series data. The series object has a method **cov()** to compute covariance between series objects.

Some examples are :-\n\n    - Discard data that belongs to groups with only a few members.\n    \n    - Filter out data based on the group sum or mean.\n    \n    \n    \n- Some combination of the above: **GroupBy** will examine the results of the apply step and try to return a sensibly combined result if it doesn't fit into either of the above two categories.","c8f9137b":"### Merge using 'how' argument\n\n\n\nThe **how** argument to merge specifies how to determine which keys are to be included in the resulting table.
