The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled way.\n\nBreast cancer is cancer that develops in breast cells. Typically, the cancer forms in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast. Lobules are the glands that produce milk, and ducts are the pathways that bring the milk from the glands to the nipple. Cancer can also occur in the fatty tissue or the fibrous connective tissue within your breast.\n\nThe uncontrolled cancer cells often invade other healthy breast tissue and can travel to the lymph nodes under the arms. The lymph nodes are a primary pathway that help the cancer cells move to other parts of the body.

While invasive cancer has spread from the breast ducts or glands to other parts of the breast, noninvasive cancer has not spread from the original tissue.\n\nThese two categories are used to describe the most common types of breast cancer, which include:\n\n1. Ductal carcinoma in situ. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition. With DCIS, the cancer cells are confined to the ducts in your breast and haven\u2019t invaded the surrounding breast tissue.\n2. Lobular carcinoma in situ. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is cancer that grows in the milk-producing glands of your breast. Like DCIS, the cancer cells haven\u2019t invaded the surrounding tissue.\n3. Invasive ductal carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer. This type of breast cancer begins in your breast\u2019s milk ducts and then invades nearby tissue in the breast. Once the breast cancer has spread to the tissue outside your milk ducts, it can begin to spread to other nearby organs and tissue.\n4. Invasive lobular carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) first develops in your breast\u2019s lobules and has invaded nearby tissue.","cdb5798d":"## Accuracy: 98%","c5f140bd":"The most outliers can be noticed in the benign plot of the concavity feature.","f73d9082":"# Distribution based on diagnosis","16844260":"# Correlation of the variables","254673c6":"### For now this is the end of the analysis.
