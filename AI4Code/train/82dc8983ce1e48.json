Netflix added most content from year 2018 with 1063 titles. Year 2019 was an exception as it saw a decrease in the number of titles added from that year. It could be the outcome of Network companies starting their own streaming services and not giving streaming rights to Netflix. Also, many of the titles may not yet be available for streaming (because they are in theates or other contractual reasons).
