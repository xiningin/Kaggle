Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP helps human language to be understandable to the Machine\/Computer. NLP offers a set of different functionalities the processes the textual data and provides useful information, insights and patterns.\n\nNLP can be used for speech recognition, creating voice-based search engines, analyzing sentiments of textual data etc. NLP offers a variety of operations to process text data like Tokenizing, Lamenting, Stemming POS tagging etc.\n\n**NLP Profiler** is a simple NLP library which profiles textual datasets using one or more features. It profiles dataset and provides high-level insights about the data along with the statistical properties of the data. \n\nNLP Profiler takes the textual data as an input and returns a data frame containing a variety of insights. It may take one or more columns of textual data. However, NLP Profiler is in its early stage but is continuously improving. ","bafc7d38":"# Preparing dataset for Profiling","b92df294":"In this Notebook, we will use Twitter US Airline Sentiment. I have added Tweets.csv file with this Notebook. We will load Tweets.csv dataset containing tweets and will pass it to the NLP profiler to get a new dataframe on Text Profile. We will be able to analyze the statistical properties of the dataset and will also be able to create some visualizations which give us useful insights from an NLP perspective.\n\nNLP Profiler is relatively easy to use and creates the text profile in few lines of code only. I did this experiment with only 100 records because NLP Profiler takes quite a considerable time for analyzing a large dataset. Hope this will be helpful!"}}
