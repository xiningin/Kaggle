As we talked about in Tutorial 2, the top scoring features will usually pay-off the most during feature development, so it could be a good idea to focus your efforts on those. On the other hand, training on uninformative features can lead to overfitting. So, the features with 0.0 scores we'll drop entirely:","44434a33":"Removing them does lead to a modest performance gain:","390b8222":"Use it like:\n\n```\nencoder = CrossFoldEncoder(MEstimateEncoder, m=1)\nX_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X, y, cols=[\"MSSubClass\"]))\n```\n\nYou can turn any of the encoders from the [`category_encoders`](http:\/\/contrib.scikit-learn.org\/category_encoders\/) library into a cross-fold encoder. The [`CatBoostEncoder`](http:\/\/contrib.scikit-learn.org\/category_encoders\/catboost.html) would be worth trying. It's similar to `MEstimateEncoder` but uses some tricks to better prevent overfitting. Its smoothing parameter is called `a` instead of `m`.\n\n## Create Final Feature Set ##\n\nNow let's combine everything together. Putting the transformations into separate functions makes it easier to experiment with various combinations. The ones I left uncommented I found gave the best results. You should experiment with you own ideas though! Modify any of these transformations or come up with some of your own to add to the pipeline.","00e4e5d8":"### Clean Data ###\n\nSome of the categorical features in this dataset have what are apparently typos in their categories:","345b32f7":"We can reuse this scoring function anytime we want to try out a new feature set. We'll run it now on the processed data with no additional features and get a baseline score:","47add766":"## Target Encoding ##\n\nNeeding a separate holdout set to create a target encoding is rather wasteful of data. In *Tutorial 6* we used 25% of our dataset just to encode a single feature, `Zipcode`. The data from the other features in that 25% we didn't get to use at all.\n\nThere is, however, a way you can use target encoding without having to use held-out encoding data. It's basically the same trick used in cross-validation:\n1. Split the data into folds, each fold having two splits of the dataset.\n2. Train the encoder on one split but transform the values of the other.\n3. Repeat for all the splits.\n\nThis way, training and transformation always take place on independent sets of data, just like when you use a holdout set but without any data going to waste.\n\nIn the next hidden cell is a wrapper you can use with any target encoder:","76462a16":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

This competition uses nearly the same data you used in the exercises of the [Feature Engineering](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/feature-engineering) course. We'll collect together the work you did into a complete project which you can build off of with ideas of your own.\n\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto; background-color: #ebf9ff; padding: 1em; margin:24px;\">\n    <strong>Fork This Notebook!<\/strong><br>\nCreate your own editable copy of this notebook by clicking on the <strong>Copy and Edit<\/strong> button in the top right corner.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n# Step 1 - Preliminaries #\n## Imports and Configuration ##\n\nWe'll start by importing the packages we used in the exercises and setting some notebook defaults. Unhide this cell if you'd like to see the libraries we'll use:","46fa6fa8":"## Principal Component Analysis ##\n\nPCA was the second unsupervised model we used for feature creation. We saw how it could be used to decompose the variational structure in the data. The PCA algorithm gave us *loadings* which described each component of variation, and also the *components* which were the transformed datapoints. The loadings can suggest features to create and the components we can use as features directly.\n\nHere are the utility functions from the PCA lesson:","9bcc6cb0":"# Step 4 - Hyperparameter Tuning #\n\nAt this stage, you might like to do some hyperparameter tuning with XGBoost before creating your final submission.","29dfebd5":"And here are transforms that produce the features from the Exercise 5. You might want to change these if you came up with a different answer.\n","0e234307":"### Encode the Statistical Data Type ###\n\nPandas has Python types corresponding to the standard statistical types (numeric, categorical, etc.). Encoding each feature with its correct type helps ensure each feature is treated appropriately by whatever functions we use, and makes it easier for us to apply transformations consistently. This hidden cell defines the `encode` function:","97a30421":"This baseline score helps us to know whether some set of features we've assembled has actually led to any improvement or not.\n\n# Step 2 - Feature Utility Scores #\n\nIn Lesson 2 we saw how to use mutual information to compute a *utility score* for a feature, giving you an indication of how much potential the feature has. This hidden cell defines the two utility functions we used, `make_mi_scores` and `plot_mi_scores`: ","02a31fdd":"Uncomment and run this cell if you'd like to see what they contain. Notice that `df_test` is\nmissing values for `SalePrice`. (`NA`s were willed with 0's in the imputation step.)","beffad30":"Groups of highly correlated features often yield interesting loadings.\n\n### PCA Application - Indicate Outliers ###\n\nIn Exercise 5, you applied PCA to determine houses that were **outliers**, that is, houses having values not well represented in the rest of the data. You saw that there was a group of houses in the `Edwards` neighborhood having a `SaleCondition` of `Partial` whose values were especially extreme.\n\nSome models can benefit from having these outliers indicated, which is what this next transform will do.","3fb6ad1f":"Later, we'll add the `drop_uninformative` function to our feature-creation pipeline.\n\n# Step 3 - Create Features #\n\nNow we'll start developing our feature set.\n\nTo make our feature engineering workflow more modular, we'll define a function that will take a prepared dataframe and pass it through a pipeline of transformations to get the final feature set. It will look something like this:\n\n```\ndef create_features(df):\n    X = df.copy()\n    y = X.pop(\"SalePrice\")\n    X = X.join(create_features_1(X))\n    X = X.join(create_features_2(X))\n    X = X.join(create_features_3(X))\n    # ...\n    return X\n```\n\nLet's go ahead and define one transformation now, a [label encoding](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/categorical-variables) for the categorical features:","ab2eb27f":"## Load Data ##\n\nAnd now we can call the data loader and get the processed data splits:","47a36ba8":"Here are some ideas for other transforms you could explore:\n- Interactions between the quality `Qual` and condition `Cond` features. `OverallQual`, for instance, was a high-scoring feature. You could try combining it with `OverallCond` by converting both to integer type and taking a product.\n- Square roots of area features. This would convert units of square feet to just feet.\n- Logarithms of numeric features. If a feature has a skewed distribution, applying a logarithm can help normalize it.\n- Interactions between numeric and categorical features that describe the same thing. You could look at interactions between `BsmtQual` and `TotalBsmtSF`, for instance.\n- Other group statistics in `Neighboorhood`. We did the median of `GrLivArea`. Looking at `mean`, `std`, or `count` could be interesting. You could also try combining the group statistics with other features. Maybe the *difference* of `GrLivArea` and the median is important?\n\n## k-Means Clustering ##\n\nThe first unsupervised algorithm we used to create features was k-means clustering. We saw that you could either use the cluster labels as a feature (a column with `0, 1, 2, ...`) or you could use the *distance* of the observations to each cluster. We saw how these features can sometimes be effective at untangling complicated spatial relationships.","d1566f45":"These are only a couple ways you could use the principal components. You could also try clustering using one or more components. One thing to note is that PCA doesn't change the distance between points -- it's just like a rotation. So clustering with the full set of components is the same as clustering with the original features. Instead, pick some subset of components, maybe those with the most variance or the highest MI scores.\n\nFor further analysis, you might want to look at a correlation matrix for the dataset:","ffc2f04a":"Let's look at our feature scores again:","573607f6":"Now, I think `CatBoost` is overperforming `XGBoost`","d6b979ab":"### Handle Missing Values ###\n\nHandling missing values now will make the feature engineering go more smoothly. We'll impute `0` for missing numeric values and `\"None\"` for missing categorical values. You might like to experiment with other imputation strategies. In particular, you could try creating \"missing value\" indicators: `1` whenever a value was imputed and `0` otherwise.","b29d9d58":"## Data Preprocessing ##\n\nBefore we can do any feature engineering, we need to *preprocess* the data to get it in a form suitable for analysis. The data we used in the course was a bit simpler than the competition data. For the *Ames* competition dataset, we'll need to:\n- **Load** the data from CSV files\n- **Clean** the data to fix any errors or inconsistencies\n- **Encode** the statistical data type (numeric, categorical)\n- **Impute** any missing values\n\nWe'll wrap all these steps up in a function, which will make easy for you to get a fresh dataframe whenever you need. After reading the CSV file, we'll apply three preprocessing steps, `clean`, `encode`, and `impute`, and then create the data splits: one (`df_train`) for training the model, and one (`df_test`) for making the predictions that you'll submit to the competition for scoring on the leaderboard.","d6e61d91":"A label encoding is okay for any kind of categorical feature when you're using a tree-ensemble like XGBoost, even for unordered categories. If you wanted to try a linear regression model (also popular in this competition), you would instead want to use a one-hot encoding, especially for the features with unordered categories.\n\n## Create Features with Pandas ##\n\nThis cell reproduces the work you did in Exercise 3, where you applied strategies for creating features in Pandas. Modify or add to these functions to try out other feature combinations."}}
