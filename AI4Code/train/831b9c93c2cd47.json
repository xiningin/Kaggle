It would be nice to know what the stars are for non-NULL values and their continent distribution. we can impute the 2 NULL values in the style columns by analysing the surrounding data.","12a6345e":"Lets analyze this data to judge the performnace of different ramen products","27e7d3fa":"There are some garbage entries \"\\n\" here as well, we will filter them out","1a82d399":"# EDA","677a59f6":"One important mistake done here is that USA and united states are referred to as separate entities, we will merge them","17d9f469":"Only 38 countries, yet 355 Brands and 2413 varieties. Instead of comparing Individual performnace of Brand, we will compare the country performance and see which brands operate there.","41e9d598":"Lets see which country these Brands operate in.","4a3d330d":"1. There are 37 Countries (not 38), with 355 Brands and 2413 varities.  \n2. Japan, S.Korea, USA re the largest ramen hubs.\n3. There are 3 Unrated products, likely just registered for launch. 2 from S.Korea and 1 from Malaysia.  \n4. \"Pack\" style is very much likely to feature in top 10.  \n5. The Brand which has the largest instance count of featuring in Top 10 is \"Prima Taste\".  \n6. Several Pacific-Asian countries feature in Top 10.  \n7. Some Countries that feature in Top 10 don't haave overall good Stars, means aside from some products rest are below average.  \n8. Countries like Brazil don't show up in Top 10 yet their average stars are the highest.  \n9. Countries with most number of varities feature in Top 10. We can see that Brazil and Sarawak don't have a huge variety, perhaps they serve generalized ramen which isnt special enough to feature in Top 10 (even though these countries have high average stars).","b95e9392":"As we can see, only 3 ramen products are unrated, all of them belong to countries with a significant product count.  \nAlso, all are on Asia continent. All values in the \"Stars\" column are of type string, we will change that to float to analyse the data better.","1dd8ea3b":"Now, its quite difficult to analyse a country's performance by judging all products, instead lets consider the top ten rankings.","e9b922bb":"Most of the countries here are very very close geographically, its a fair assumption that ramen circulated here extensively. USA is an exception but its a type of country that supports a multi-cultural ethnic population, so perhaps some immigrants must belong to fore-mentioned countries.  \nThats enough about the top-ten, lets go back to the analyzing individual countries, starting by their average Stars."}}
