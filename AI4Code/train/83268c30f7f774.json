The older the car is, the larger the total claims amount would be (cars that are older would need to have significant repairs or entirely replaced depending on the damages).","f740c0ff":"## Conclusion - Region vs Charges\n\nBased on the bar plot data, my hypothesis was inaccurate. Southeast regions (such as Flordia, Georgia, and South Carolina) had higher costs for medical insurance. Lower income areas could play a factor in the higher medical insurance. Perhaps the number of individuals who are of older age could also play a factor in the high medical insurance rate.","0a55a82c":"When comparing age to the total claims amount for auto insurance, I hypothesize that age does in fact have a large impact on total claims amount.

The eldest vehicles made in 1995 had the largest amount of auto insurance claims than the more recent year (2015). This could be for numerous reasons. Damages to older cars could be significant or even dangerous, so the insurance would need to reimburse their customers.","0d79d859":"# Author: Brandon Mizutani\n## Version 1.6.0 [Kaggle URL](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/brandonmizutani\/insurance-data-stats)\n\n### Problem Domain: \nChoose two datasets and visualize them as effectively as you can. \n\n### Lab 13\n\n- [x]Select 2 Kaggle data sets.{:target=\u201d_blank\u201d} that are suitable for the story you want to tell.\n- [x]Note make sure the data set has csv file\/s to download.\n- [x]Optionally use dataset from another source.\n- [x]Load the data you receive into a Pandas DataFrame.\n- [x]Analyze dataset.\n- [x]Verbalize your insights in Markdown cells.\n- [x]Visualize your insights in several ways.\n- [x]Have at least two visualizations per data set.\n    - Use Seaborn Example Gallery for inspiration.\n- [x]Notebook should have professional polish.\n    - In other words, imagine you are presenting it on the job.\n\n### Resource Links\n\n[Source 1](https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/auto-insurance\/discounts\/senior-citizen-discount\/#:~:text=Senior%20drivers%20pay%2C%20on%20average,only%20those%20in%20their%2050s.&text=Saving%20money%20is%20important%20at%20any%20age.)\n\n### Summary\n\nThis Kaggle notebook was created to display insurance data sets. The first data set compares medical insurance costs to age, gender, and region. The second data set compares auto insurance claims to age, customer loyalty, and age of the car. I first formulated a hypothesis for each comparison, displayed the data with either a bar plot or reg plot, and drew a conclusion.","e151ac9d":"## Conclusion\n\nBased on the bar plot data, the highest auto insurance claim amount was at 22 years of age. However, looking closely at the age demographic between 54 - 60, it would seem that my hypothesis was somewhat incorrect. According to this [article](https:\/\/www.thezebra.com\/auto-insurance\/discounts\/senior-citizen-discount\/#:~:text=Senior%20drivers%20pay%2C%20on%20average,only%20those%20in%20their%2050s.&text=Saving%20money%20is%20important%20at%20any%20age.) , individuals between the age of 60- 69 have second-cheapest car insurance rates, behind only those in their 50s. From this information, I can surmise that other than the age of 22, the older you are, the higher the auto insurance claim amount is.","28daf7a1":"## Hypothesis - Sex vs Cost\n\nIn terms of the comparision between the gender and charges, my hypothesis would assume that one's sex does have an impact on cost for health insurance. I would assume that females would have to spend more on insurance than males.","5725ef0a":"# Auto Insurance Claims Data","15c4f333":"## Conclusion - Age vs Cost\n\nFrom the bar plot data, I can conclude that age does indeed have an impact on the cost of health insurance in the United States. However, it is quite interesting that the data does increment and decrement very sporadically between the ages of 18 to 64. The outliers could be the cost to check one's health (checkups); as one checks their health, the cost decreases for a few years until the next checkup.\n\n","8be122aa":"## Hypothesis - Region vs Cost\n\nIn terms of the comparision between the region and charges, my hypothesis would assume that region does have a large impact on cost for health insurance; regions areas with intense high\/low weather conditions factor in insurance costs.","34b1fb29":"## Hypothesis Loyal Customers vs Total Claims Amount\n\nWhen comparing the longevity of customer membership to the total claims amount for auto insurance, I hypothesize that it would affect the amount. Customer loyalty is important, so benefits for being  a customer for a long duration of time would have an effect to how much money you would get back","b8ea909c":"## Conclusion\n\nDrawing from the regplot, it would seem that there is a significant amount of individuals who are loyal customers ranging from 100 -300 months. The data suggests that the amount of loyal customers drops after 300 months. However, one of the highest total claims amount was a customer who has had a membership for 450 months.\n\nIn conclusion, the majority of individuals are customers up to around 300 months. However, in terms of my hypothesis, it is incorrect to assume that customer longevity has a significant impact on total claims amount due to the fact that the plot is very scattered."}}
