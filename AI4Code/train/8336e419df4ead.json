","494d7c95":"# Is the curve flattening!\n\n\nAs is with most of the other countries of the world, the number of Corvid-19 cases and the resulting deaths are increasing day by day in our country. Since the infection of the virus spreads through human contact, the growth of cummulative cases over time is expected to be exponential. As the number cases increase, the potential number of new infections come down as the virus can only infect a certain number of people, the worst case of which is the entire population being infected. So after a certain point the curve of infections would plateau. Correspondingly if we take a look at the trend of daily new cases, the graph would increase upto a point before starting to dip, emulating a bell shaped curve. The peak point of the bell curve corresponds to the starting point of the plateau of the cummulative curve. If the cummulative curve reachs it's plateau very rapidly, then the bell curve would reach a larger peaker which inturn would mean that a large number of people would be under treatment at that point in time, which would strain our health systems beyond it's capacity. This could have devestating effects on the death rate during this epidemic. So to improve our chances of surviving this pandemic without a huge loss, we need to flatten the bell curve, that is bring down it's peak by widening it. The government has declared a lockout in the country with the objective of reducing human contact and thus flatten the curve. The entire country is under lockdown for close to 8 weeks now and it is time ask the question, have we achieved what it was meant to achieve, flatten the curve?","cab368bf":"# Predicting the curves","3c585a1b":"Above is the plot of cummulative cases since 31st Jan 2020. As expected the curve is growing exponentially and it hasn't peaked yet."}}
