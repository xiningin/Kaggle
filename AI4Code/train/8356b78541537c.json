The first few questions are more Python-specific, and then we have a bunch of general data structures and algorithms questions in Python.\n\nInterview Cake is not just another question database\u2014we walk you through the question step-by-step, giving hints and explanations as you need them, just like a real interviewer.","fd8da79e":"So how do we fix this code?\nSince daily_balances is just a regular list, the fix is simple\u2014use positive indices instead:","f830a592":"The logic is too long\nOne of the main benefits of list comprehensions is that they make your code shorter and clearer. Once you start packing too much into a single statement, it becomes harder to follow than a regular for loop.","8e87021e":"  [team.set_location(HOME) for team in league_teams if team in home_teams_today]","d2f96206":"Two common cases where you shouldn't use a list comprehension are:\n\nYou don't actually want a list\nThe logic is too long\nCase 1: You don't actually want a list\nList comprehensions build lists, but that's not the only reason we use for loops. Sometimes we have functions or methods whose main purpose is their side effect, and they don't return anything meaningful.","17895742":"We just hired a new intern, Dan, to help us with this but something doesn't seem to be working quite right.

Interviewers want to see that you can do more than just memorize facts!"}}
