One of the goals of the project was to explore the various models (classifiers) that could be trained to predict the purpose of the darknet traffic based on a set of features and subsets of those features.  The dataset was modified from what was available on the UNB\/CIC website ( link: https:\/\/www.unb.ca\/cic\/datasets\/darknet2020.html ).  The changes are discussed in the \"Changes to the Original Dataset\" section below.\n\n## Goals of this Notebook\n1. Show some feature selection methods that can be used to identify the best features to use when attempting to determine the *Purpose* of the internet traffic\n1. Show how various types of models\/classifiers can be used to see which is the most accurate at predicting the *Purpose* of the internet traffic\n\n## Changes to the Original Dataset\n\n### Column Names\nThe orginal name of the target column was *Label*, which was the same as a feature column.  Both columns were renamed as follows:\n* The feature column was renamed to *Conn Type* since it defines what type of connection was used to transfer the data (e.g. VPN, non VPN, etc.)\n* The target column was renamed to *Purpose* because it defines what the purpose of the internet traffic was (e.g. email, audio streaming, etc.)\n\n### Column Values\n* \"Timestamp\" - all values in the \"Timestamp\" column have been convery to seconds since epoch\n* \"Src IP\" and \"Dst IP\" - all IP addresses have been converted to integers representing a country code for the country associated with that IP.  If that IP was not designated for any one country, then the value was 0.\n* \"Conn Type\" - all values were converted to integers\n* \"Purpose\" - all names were replaced with integers\n","611a52b2":"# Train\/Test with Models\nNow that we have the dataset versions based on various feature sets, we can start evaluating the models.  However, we should first choose a metric by which to compare the models.  For this project, the 3 primary metrics were *accuracy*, *precision*, and *recall*.  There were also to additional metrics, *mean-squared error* and *F1 score*.\n\nSeveral functions were defined to help ease the training and testing of the models.","3d174422":"## [FUNCTION] calculateMetrics\nThe **calculateMetrics** function is a helper function that will print out all the metrics we are interested in and some extra ones too.","50059de8":"# Feature Selection\nTo choose which features are the best to use, we will select the top N features from a group of classifiers and aggregate the results to get 1 set of features.  One of the function parameters is the train percentage split used when training the models\n\n### Why were those model settings chosen?\nThese are just a few of the many available classifiers available to be used.  Furthermore, there are many settings for each classifier, and some parameters are similar, sometimes even the same.  Adding\/changing the classifier settings *could* affect which features are selected.","92de508b":"# Feature Selection & Evaluation\nWe will examine four different festure sets\n1. All Features\n1. Selected Features (from \"All Features\")\n1. All Features, except *Src Port* and *Dst Port*\n1. Selected Features (from \"All Features, except *Src Port* and *Dst Port*\")\n\nWe use \"all features\" and \"selected features\" to compare the time and accuracy between both the two approaches.  We also remove the ports because some literature indicates that the ports often becomes important features.  It will be interesting to see which features are selected when the ports are and are not available and compare the performance of the models.\n\nAfter we select which features will be used, we will train and test several individual models (as opposed to ensemble models) and compare the results.","3a1907c6":"## [FUNCTION] **evaluateIndividualClassifiers**\nThe **evaluateIndividualClassifiers** is responsible for evaluating the dataset using several individual classifiers"}}
