In practice, you can uses these rules more as rules of thumb when using Ordinary Least Squares Regression, the most common implementation of linear regression.\n\n> Try different preparations of your data using these heuristics and see what works best for your problem.\n- **Linear Assumption.** Linear regression assumes that the relationship between your input and output is linear. It does not support anything else. This may be obvious, but it is good to remember when you have a lot of attributes. You may need to transform data to make the relationship linear (e.g. log transform for an exponential relationship).\n- **Remove Noise.** Linear regression assumes that your input and output variables are not noisy. Consider using data cleaning operations that let you better expose and clarify the signal in your data. This is most important for the output variable and you want to remove outliers in the output variable (y) if possible.\n- **Remove Collinearity.** Linear regression will over-fit your data when you have highly correlated input variables. Consider calculating pairwise correlations for your input data and removing the most correlated.\n- **Gaussian Distributions.** Linear regression will make more reliable predictions if your input and output variables have a Gaussian distribution. You may get some benefit using transforms (e.g. log or BoxCox) on you variables to make their distribution more Gaussian looking.\n- **Rescale Inputs:** Linear regression will often make more reliable predictions if you rescale input variables using standardization or normalization.","6af4977b":"> Interpreting the coefficients:\n- Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in **Avg.

This approach maintains the generally fast performance of linear methods, while allowing them to fit a much wider range of data.\n\n> For example, a simple linear regression can be extended by constructing polynomial features from the coefficients. In the standard linear regression case, you might have a model that looks like this for two-dimensional data:\n\n$$\\hat{y}(w, x) = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2$$\n\n> If we want to fit a paraboloid to the data instead of a plane, we can combine the features in second-order polynomials, so that the model looks like this:\n\n$$\\hat{y}(w, x) = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_1 x_2 + w_4 x_1^2 + w_5 x_2^2$$\n\n> The (sometimes surprising) observation is that this is still a linear model: to see this, imagine creating a new variable\n\n$$z = [x_1, x_2, x_1 x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2]$$\n\n> With this re-labeling of the data, our problem can be written\n\n$$\\hat{y}(w, x) = w_0 + w_1 z_1 + w_2 z_2 + w_3 z_3 + w_4 z_4 + w_5 z_5$$\n\n> We see that the resulting polynomial regression is in the same class of linear models we\u2019d considered above (i.e. the model is linear in w) and can be solved by the same techniques. By considering linear fits within a higher-dimensional space built with these basis functions, the model has the flexibility to fit a much broader range of data.\n***","4429674c":"# \u2714\ufe0f Elastic Net\n\n> A linear regression model trained with L1 and L2 prior as regularizer. \n\n> This combination allows for learning a sparse model where few of the weights are non-zero like Lasso, while still maintaining the regularization properties of Ridge. \n\n> Elastic-net is useful when there are multiple features which are correlated with one another.

Robust regression methods are designed to be not overly affected by violations of assumptions by the underlying data-generating process.\n\n> One instance in which robust estimation should be considered is when there is a strong suspicion of `heteroscedasticity`.\n\n> A common situation in which robust estimation is used occurs when the data contain outliers. In the presence of outliers that do not come from the same data-generating process as the rest of the data, least squares estimation is inefficient and can be biased. Because the least squares predictions are dragged towards the outliers, and because the variance of the estimates is artificially inflated, the result is that outliers can be masked. (In many situations, including some areas of geostatistics and medical statistics, it is precisely the outliers that are of interest.)","73f7ba70":"**Residual Histogram**","3ea0e1aa":"# \ud83d\udcdd Summary\nIn this notebook you discovered the linear regression algorithm for machine learning.\n\nYou covered a lot of ground including:\n> - The common linear regression models (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, ...).\n> - The representation used by the model.\n> - Learning algorithms used to estimate the coefficients in the model.\n> - Rules of thumb to consider when preparing data for use with linear regression.\n> - How to evaluate a linear regression model.\n\n\n# \ud83d\udd17 References:\n- [Scikit-learn library](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)\n- [Linear Regression for Machine Learning by Jason Brownlee PhD](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/linear-regression-for-machine-learning\/)"}}
