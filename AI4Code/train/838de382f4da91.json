In that situation, the batter is awarded all four bases, and any runners on base score as well. The batter can circle the bases at his leisure, as there is no threat of him being thrown out. (This also occurs when the ball hits the foul pole in left or right field, or when the ball hits an opposing defender on the fly and bounces directly over the wall in fair ground.)\"\n\n\"There are also instances of \"inside-the-park home runs.\" These occur when the batter hits the ball in play (not over the wall) and touches all four bases without being thrown out. These are extremely rare and typically only occur with a very fast runner at the plate and some sort of misplay by an outfielder that doesn't qualify as an error.\"\n\n\"The term \"home run\" comes from the basic act of a batter circling all the bases successfully. In the early days of the home run, running was typically a necessity as players weren't very powerful and outfields were much bigger, leading to a greater number of inside-the-park home runs. Now, however, most home runs feature players trotting around the bases after hitting the ball over the fence.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.mlb.com\/glossary\/standard-stats\/home-run","1c86f8f6":"#<font color=\"red\">Glossary of Baseball Jargon<\/font>\n\n<font color=\"red\">What is October called in baseball?<\/font>\n\n\"Fall Classic.

They are used in scoring the game, and so each position is designated with a 1-9 number. They go in order, starting with the pitcher as #1, however the shortstop is out of order\u2013he should be #5 if following the pattern, but instead is #6.\"\n\n\"This was because originally, the shortstop was the fourth outfielder. Later, the shortstop was moved permanently to the infield but his number stuck at #6. It\u2019s important to understand the positional numbers so that a proper scorebook can be kept and players understand the lineup and dugout card.\"\n\n<font color=\"red\">Pitchers (Position #1 on the field chart)<\/font>\n\n\"Pitchers have a LOT of influence on the outcome of a game. Pitchers have the #1 designation in the baseball scorebook, and they\u2019re in control of the ball and the speed of the game. The following are some of the skills a pitcher needs: Strong arm, Mentally tough, Able to handle high-pressure situations, High dexterity and \u201cfeel\u201d for throwing a baseball, Good body control for repeatability of mechanics, Strong focus and baseball intelligence.\nVery competitive.\"\n\n<font color=\"red\">Catcher (Position #2 on the field chart)<\/font>\n\n\"Catchers have an extremely demanding role on the team \u2013 both physically and mentally. Because the catcher must control and corral the pitcher, he has to be physically and mentally quick. Foul tips and long days squatting and blocking in the heat make for very long, draining days.\"\n\n<font color=\"red\">First Baseman (Position #3 on the field chart)<\/font>\n\n\"First baseman are the biggest power hitters on a team, and they are typically very big and relatively slow because of this. First baseman can often \u201chide\u201d at first because they don\u2019t often have to make long throws or move around too much. But, that doesn\u2019t mean first base is not a difficult position \u2013 it\u2019s easy to play an average first base, but it\u2019s NOT easy to be great at it.Good reflexes and instincts are important, as line drives scream to first base.\"\n\n<font color=\"red\">Second Baseman (Position #4 on the field chart)<\/font>\n\n\"Second baseman are typically great defensive players with the worst bat on the team. Though there are some great-hitting second baseman, it\u2019s typically a less offensive player who excels at 2nd. Dustin Pedroia was an amazing player and a great example.\"\n\n\"Very agile and quick. Great IQ for the game. Excellent glove and defensive skills\nNeeds an adequate arm, but it doesn\u2019t need to be a cannon. Should be fast and a skilled contact hitter. Typically a \u201cspark plug\u201d type player who gets on base and makes things happen on the basepaths.\"\n\n<font color=\"red\">Shortstop (Position #6 on the field chart)<\/font>\n\n\"Andrelton Simmons is one of the best defensive shortstops ever, and shows off the athleticism and skill needed to play the position at the highest level.\"Shortstops are usually the best athletes on the field at all levels of baseball.\"\n\n\"Must have excellent glove skills. Excellent range and agility. Excellent arm strength\nExcellent field vision and understanding of where to go and other players\u2019 movement.\nHitting skills are secondary to defensive ability, however at the MLB level there is a growing importance on being threat at the plate \u2013 it\u2019s not enough any more to hit .250 as an MLB shortstop. Must be mentally tough and have strong leadership skills.\"\n\n<font color=\"red\">Third Baseman (Position #5 on the field chart)<\/font>\n\n\"Third baseman have a similar skillset to shortstops, but they\u2019re typically bigger, stronger and more capable of hitting for power. Nolan Arenado is a great example of a third baseman who is a threat at the plate and yet also an excellent defender.\"\n\n\"VERY strong arm to make long throws across the diamond. Excellent reflexes and is NOT afraid of the ball (they call it the hot corner for a reason). Great defender, but lacks the range of a shortstop typically because of bigger physical size. One of the top power-hitters on the team, typically. Many high school shortstops who don\u2019t have quite the defensive skills to play SS in college move to third base and pack on some extra muscle.\"\n\n<font color=\"red\">Left Fielder (Position #7 on the field chart)<\/font>\n\"\n\"Left fielders typically have an OK arm with a decent glove and a solid bat. Because more throws from left field aren\u2019t THAT long, they don\u2019t need to have a cannon for an arm.\"\n\n\"Left fielders need to play excellent outfield defense and thus must be fast and have a great glove.\"\n\n<font color=\"red\">Center Fielder (Position #8 on the field chart)<\/font>\n\n\"Mike Trout is perhaps a stronger hitter than most center fielders (he\u2019s a stronger hitter than everyone, but that\u2019s another story\u2026), but he\u2019s still a great example of what a center fielder should be.\"\n\n\"Must be an excellent fielder \u2013 the best defensive outfielder on the team. Must be exceptionally fast. Must get great reads and jumps on fly balls. Arm must be strong\nMust be a solid hitter at the plate and a great base runner to utilize speed.\"\n\n<font color=\"red\">Right Fielder (Position #9 on the field chart)<\/font>\n\n\"Right fielders are most commonly known for having rocket launcher arms.\"\n\n\"At youth levels, the right fielder is one of the lesser players on the team because fewer fly balls are hit that way. At college and pro levels, the right fielder has one of the strongest arms on the team because of the long throw to third base Must hit for power\nMust be an excellent fielder but does not have to be as fast or as amazing in the outfield as the center fielder.\" \n\n<font color=\"red\">Other Positions: DH + Roles of Pinch Runner, Pinch Hitter<\/font>\n\n\"What is the DH in baseball? The Designated Hitter is a player who only hits, and this position exists only in the American League. The DH hits in place of the pitcher, who does not bat in the American League.\"\n\n\"Pinch Runners enter the game to run the bases in place of another player, but this is not really a position \u2013 more just a role. Same goes for pinch hitters, who replace a hitter already in the game to bat for them.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/danblewett.com\/baseball-positions-fielders-body-type\/","3030e26c":"![](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/EbYHtmSU8AATCTa.jpg)itwperformancepolymers.com","bf090c89":"<iframe width=\"642\" height=\"361\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MpczNpVk0k4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>"}}
