The discovery of applications of rare-earths has been one of the most ground breaking events in the history of mankind. It is not just crude, but the mining and production of rare earth that has played a significant role in the world politics today. A lot of countries have good reserves of this treasure but have not been able to beat the competitive pricing of the leader in this business which is China. Carrying out research in this field is essential to develop optimum techniques for profitable mass production of rare- earths. The purpose of this study is to explore the scientific progress made in the field of rare earths. I will also include Uranium in this study as it is closely related to the rare-earths. ","bb92f9c4":"The research activities for uranium although has been on an increase, the number of scientific publications seem to fluctuate.\n\nThe story of rare earths is completly different. There seems to be a lot of scientific progress. In the last decade, an average of more than 150 papers have been published. The trend is much similar to the worldwide production trends of rare earths. This can be seen in link below:<br>\nhttps:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/fs\/2002\/fs087-02\/ <br>\nTherefore, it can be inferred that as the production and demand increased, so did the funds for research projects in this field.","d30099a0":"### Step 3 Author with maximum publications","e68bb1bd":"We will select three journals which have possibility of containing articles on elements of our interest.","26f7a1f8":"## SUMMARY<br>\nAs technology advances the use of rare earths will also increase.
