Why? Because our model first needs to understand the structure of English, before we can expect it to recognize positive vs negative sentiment.\n\nSo our plan of attack is the same as we used for Dogs v Cats: pretrain a model to do one thing (predict the next word), and fine tune it to do something else (classify sentiment).\n\nUnfortunately, there are no good pretrained language models available to download, so we need to create our own.
