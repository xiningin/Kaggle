The dataset collected is clean and requires no other changes.\n2. There are very few outliers which can be removed while training the model.\n3. GRE Score,TOEFL Score, CGPA show positive correlation to chance of admit. And these three are normally distributed so model can learn effectively from these features.\n4. LOR and SOP also show a tiny bit of positive correlation so these might incerase the accuracy of the model a bit.","6c017c64":"from the boxplots we can find the outliers. outliers are those which seem not in range. outlier will be those who have value which are different from normal values in that feature.","ce9dfcd2":"Let us have a look at the summary over the dataset","26bca64d":"### if you like it please upvote","4f11d010":"It seems there are no duplicate values in the dataset"}}
