A random variable can take on a set of possible different values (similarly to other mathematical variables), each with an associated probability [wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Random_variable)\n\n**Types**\n\n1. Discrete Random Variables <br>\n    Eg: Genders of the buyers buying shoe\n2. Continuous Random Variables <br>\n    Eg: Shoe Sales in a quarter\n    \n### Probability Distribution\n> Assigns a probability to each measurable subset of the possible outcomes of a random experiment, survey, or procedure of statistical inference. [wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Probability_distribution)\n\n#### Probability Mass Function\nprobability mass function (pmf) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value\n\n#### Discrete probability distribution(Cumulative Mass Function)\nprobability distribution characterized by a probability mass function.\nThe cumulative mass function is the probability that a certain random variable can take a value up to a certain constant.\n\n#### Probability Density Function\nfunction that describes the relative likelihood for this random variable to take on a given value\n\n#### Continuous probability distribution(Cumulative Density function)\nprobability that the variable takes a value less than or equal to `x`\n\n### Central Limit Theorem\nGiven certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables, each with a well-defined expected value and well-defined variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution. [wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Central_limit_theorem)\n\n#### Normal Distribution\nA bell shaped distribution. It is also called Gaussian distribution\n\n\n#### Skewness\nMeasure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. [wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Skewness)\n\n#### Kurtosis\nMeasure of the \"peakedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable [wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kurtosis)\n\n#### Binomial Distribution\n\nBinomial distribution with parameters `n` and `p` is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent yes\/no experiments, each of which yields success with probability p. A success\/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli experiment or Bernoulli trial; when n = 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution  [wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Binomial_distribution)\n\n#### Exponential Distribution\nProbability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process, i.e. a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It has the key property of being memoryless. [wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exponential_distribution)\n\n#### Uniform distribution\nAll values have the same frequency [wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uniform_distribution_(continuous))\n","baa9e736":"Hey Everyone !!","f0a80b0b":"### Histograms\n\nMost commonly used representation of a distribution.\n\nLet's plot distribution of weed prices for 2014"}}
