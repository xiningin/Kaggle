Does the patient gender has a realation with the atendance?\n2. Does the neighborhood play a role in making patients don't show up? \"Location of the hospital\"\n3. Which pateints show up more?

The gender and age are the most important factor as we saw earlier that female and youth show up for their appointment more than male and old people. Neighbohood and hypertension come after gender and age as there are some neighborhoods that the diseases are spread and patients with hypertension tend to show up if they have it or not. So we need to search for more factors to help patient remmenber their appointments and show up. \n\n","a8a40f6c":"> We see that the Handcap has values other than 0 and 1 and that doesn't make sence so we drop these\n","485b28a1":"> We don't need patient id or appointment id for analysis, so we will drop them","8f78449f":"> The number of females show up is greater than the males.\nMay be because we have more data of females but that also show that they vist hospitals more in general.","b1c17796":"> We see that most of them don't have a disease and show up for appointment but we notice that patients of hypertension show up either when they are infected or not which is a mark that hypertension will probably show up more.
