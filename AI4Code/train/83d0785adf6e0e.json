Here's your coding interview problem for today.\n\nThis problem was recently asked by Google.\n\nGiven a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.\n\nFor example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.\n\nBonus: Can you do this in one pass?"}}
