I have modifed the code regarding the one I submitted in Udacity due some limitation on Kaggle\u00b4s Notebook:\n\n* This dataset on Kaggle do not allow to work with the \"flow_from_directory\" method of keras, as the images need to be on different folders depending the target and type of data (train, validation, test). For this I am working with the \"flow\" method.\n* Memory limitation, so I am using a reduced amount of images to train and validate.\n\n### Now let\u00b4s start\n\nImage recognition is one of the many applications of Machine Learning, it can solve problems for security purposes, object detection, face detection, healthcare, entertainment, among others. This application has an enormous potential to help our society, so it is important to find new uses for this tool, improve the current methods and get more accurate and useful insights from it. A good example of these applications, is the work done by research of The Chinese University of Hong Kong for face detection using deep learning (https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1509.06451).\n\nIn this project, we will build a Machine Learning Algorithm using CNN to predict from a giving picture if the celebrity is male or female.\n\n\n---\n\n## Dataset\n\nFor this project we will use the CelebA dataset (http:\/\/mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk\/projects\/CelebA.html), which is available on Kaggle.\n\nDescription of the CelebA dataset from kaggle (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jessicali9530\/celeba-dataset): \n\n### Context\n\nA popular component of computer vision and deep learning revolves around identifying faces for various applications from logging into your phone with your face or searching through surveillance images for a particular suspect. This dataset is great for training and testing models for face detection, particularly for recognising facial attributes such as finding people with brown hair, are smiling, or wearing glasses. Images cover large pose variations, background clutter, diverse people, supported by a large quantity of images and rich annotations. This data was originally collected by researchers at MMLAB, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (specific reference in Acknowledgment section).\n\n### Content\n\n#### Overall\n\n202,599 number of face images of various celebrities\n10,177 unique identities, but names of identities are not given\n40 binary attribute annotations per image\n5 landmark locations\n\n#### Data Files\n\n- <b>img_align_celeba.zip<\/b>: All the face images, cropped and aligned\n- <b>list_eval_partition.csv<\/b>: Recommended partitioning of images into training, validation, testing sets.

Conclusion\n\nThe built model using transfer learning from the InceptionV3 and adding custom layers successfully recognize the gender giving certain picture with <b>94.8% of accuracy over the test data<\/b>. Nevertheless, there are some limitations detected and opportunities for improvements:\n\n* Train the algorithms with the entire data set of images. Due computational resource limitation, the model was train with a subset of images. Having an appropriate machine, the model can be trained including all the images. This will make the algorithm to learn from different context of the picture giving it more experience in order to predict better never seen images.\n\n* Use difference structures for the CNNs. This approach could give better performance to the model, is an expensive task anyway, as the model can be measure on the test data set after is trained, and this takes time and computational resources.\n\n* Watching the pictures of the CelebA Data Set, most of the pictures are almost a close-up to the face of the subject, this leads to the model to learn from this type of pictures, and in situation where the subjects is just a small portion of a picture, the model could not perform well. To deal with this, more sophisticated preprocessing data can be added or complement the data set with pictures that are not entirely based in close-up to the face of the subject.\n\n* Environments where there are more than one subject in the picture was not part of the scope of this Notebook, but it is a good improvement in order to develop a better application. OpenCV is a good candidate to help with this development, as it very accurate to detect feces and its position in the pictures, then that portion of the picture (the faces) can be classified separately using the developed models on this project. \n\n","cc89d7dd":"#### Join the partition and the attributes in the same data frame","7bc42fc5":"<h2>Inception-V3 model structure<\/h2>\nThis is the structure of the Inception-V3 model, developed over the imagenet dataset.\n\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kdXUzu1.png\" width=\"1000px\"\/>\nsource: https:\/\/hackathonprojects.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/74911-image03.png\n\nThe top layers (including classification) are not included.
