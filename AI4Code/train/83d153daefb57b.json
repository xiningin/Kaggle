Lot is a basic unit of owned real estate. (column: *LotArea*)\n2. Lot's shape are various. (column: *LotShape* )\n3. The feet line that connected to street or road is called **Frontage**. (column: *LotFrontage*)\n4. The terrian is a crucial characteristic of a lot. (columns: *LandSlope*, *LandContour*, *LandSlope*)\n5. The area of the lot, however, is measured as if the land is flat.\n\nSome advanced description about Lot (column: *LotConfig*) are:\n1.
