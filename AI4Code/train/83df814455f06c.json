This further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.\n\n\n## **Splitting**\n\n- It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.\n\n\n## Decision Node\n\n- When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called a decision node.\n\n\n## Leaf\/Terminal Node\n\n- Nodes that do not split are called Leaf or Terminal nodes.\n\n\n## Pruning\n\n- When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. It is the opposite process of splitting.\n\n\n## Branch\/Sub-Tree\n\n- A sub-section of an entire tree is called a branch or sub-tree.\n\n\n## Parent and Child Node\n\n- A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called the parent node of sub-nodes where sub-nodes are the children of a parent node. \n\n\nThe above terminology is represented clearly in the following diagram:-","6c6bcf9a":"### Check for overfitting and underfitting","2d26f51f":"### Visualize decision-trees","6ab4c6a7":"# **15.

It belongs to the class of supervised learning algorithms where it can be used for both classification and regression purposes. \n\n\nA decision tree is a structure that includes a root node, branches, and leaf nodes. Each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch denotes the outcome of a test, and each leaf node holds a class label. The topmost node in the tree is the root node. \n\n\nWe make some assumptions while implementing the Decision-Tree algorithm. These are listed below:-\n\n1. At the beginning, the whole training set is considered as the root.\n2. Feature values need to be categorical. If the values are continuous then they are discretized prior to building the model.\n3. Records are distributed recursively on the basis of attribute values.\n4. Order to placing attributes as root or internal node of the tree is done by using some statistical approach.\n\n\nI will describe Decision Tree terminology in later section.\n","248b4fb6":"### Check for overfitting and underfitting","30457034":"# **5.

Overfitting in Decision Tree algorithm** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"6\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nOverfitting is a practical problem while building a Decision-Tree model. The problem of overfitting is considered when the algorithm continues to go deeper and deeper to reduce the training-set error but results with an increased test-set error. So, accuracy of prediction for our model goes down. It generally happens when we build many branches due to outliers and irregularities in data.\n\nTwo approaches which can be used to avoid overfitting are as follows:-\n\n- Pre-Pruning\n\n- Post-Pruning\n\n\n## **Pre-Pruning**\n\nIn pre-pruning, we stop the tree construction a bit early. We prefer not to split a node if its goodness measure is below a threshold value. But it is difficult to choose an appropriate stopping point.\n\n\n## **Post-Pruning**\n\nIn post-pruning, we go deeper and deeper in the tree to build a complete tree. If the tree shows the overfitting problem then pruning is done as a post-pruning step. We use the cross-validation data to check the effect of our pruning. Using cross-validation data, we test whether expanding a node will result in improve or not. If it shows an improvement, then we can continue by expanding that node. But if it shows a reduction in accuracy then it should not be expanded. So, the node should be converted to a leaf node.","0a54b28f":"# **4.

The intuition behind the Decision-Tree algorithm is very simple to understand.\n\n\nThe Decision Tree algorithm intuition is as follows:-\n\n\n1.\tFor each attribute in the dataset, the Decision-Tree algorithm forms a node. The most important attribute is placed at the root node. \n\n2.\tFor evaluating the task in hand, we start at the root node and we work our way down the tree by following the corresponding node that meets our condition or decision.\n\n3.\tThis process continues until a leaf node is reached. It contains the prediction or the outcome of the Decision Tree.\n","ee013399":"### Check accuracy score with criterion gini index","090ceddb":"### Visualize decision-trees with graphviz","c70ded37":"We now have training and test set ready for model building.

I build two models, one with criterion `gini index` and another one with criterion `entropy`. The model yields a very good performance as indicated by the model accuracy in both the cases which was found to be 0.8021.\n2.\tIn the model with criterion `gini index`, the training-set accuracy score is 0.7865 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8021. These two values are quite comparable. So, there is no sign of overfitting.\n3.\tSimilarly, in the model with criterion `entropy`, the training-set accuracy score is 0.7865 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8021.We get the same values as in the case with criterion `gini`. So, there is no sign of overfitting.\n4.\tIn both the cases, the training-set and test-set accuracy score is the same. It may happen because of small dataset.\n5.\tThe confusion matrix and classification report yields very good model performance.","31174a73":"### Predict the Test set results with criterion gini index"}}
