Conclusion\n\nIn this analysis, I've focused on calculating the yearly average EF for each of the power plants that run primaraly on oil in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe first step was to attribute the NO$_2$ measured in satelite images to a power plant, based on their distance to each pixel. This is something that can be improved (see above).\n\nThen I used a hierarquical bayesian model to calculate the EF. The advantage of this method is that i) one could incorporate smart priors, for example the previously measured EF through the more manual methods or some EF measured in other regions, to improve the results, ii) it gives more detailled information than just calculating an average EF for oil power plants, but still combines the information of all power plants to calculate the individual EFs, which makes the method more robust of noisy data for one particular power plant.","0ed9b9a7":"Check priors and posterioris again","0ecc8f98":"### 2.1 Some boring pre-processing\n\nSince the GFS is the data set with the lowest resolution (0.25 arc degrees), I'll regrid all the other images to this one, to avoid interpolations.

Why is is hard to measure and how could it be easier?\n\nFrom the challenge description says:\n\n> Current emissions factors methodologies are based on time-consuming data collection and may include errors derived from a lack of access to granular datasets, inability to refresh data on a frequent basis, overly general modeling assumptions, and inaccurate reporting of emissions sources like fuel consumption.\n\nIf we could use satelitte images, particularly of some pollutants, and 'trace them back' to what produced them (for example a power plant), then we could have a handy measurement of the emission factors, for some properties of the power plant (fuel type, energy capacity).\n\n\n\n### 3. Summary of this analysis\n\nHere I'm using the satelite images of NO$_2$ column density and 'distribute' that NO$_2$ amongst the power plants of Puerto Rico, using a (rather naive) assumption that the closest a pixel is of a power plant, the more the NO$_2$ on that pixel should have been produced by that power plant, but some of it might have still be produced by some closer by power plant. More on this lower down.\n\nI'll also add some other data sets privided in the challenge, that should try to account for either other sources of NO$_2$ production (such as people travelling around) or the fact that the NO$_2$ may move around due to winds, rain, etc.\n\nAlthough the actual electricity produced by a power plant should be a more precise way of measuring the EF, I'll use the electrical generating capacity in megawatts in the provided data set, that is more easily available.\n\nI'll also focus on power plants that use **Oil** as their primary fuel, although in principle I could have used the same analysis for other kinds of power plants.\n\nWhen calculating the EF, I'll use a **Hierarchical Bayesian** simple model, which has the advatage of using all the data of all Oil power plants to calculate an yearly average EF for these power plants, while still accounting for the fact that each oil power plant will have a slightly different EF due to other properties (year of construction, average use) that may even not be known.\n\n\n\n### 4.

Several options for this:\n\n0. (The power plant data set is not correct. That seems to be the case for the electrical generation, from a couple of posts, not sure about the electrical capacity) \n1.

I can't do much about number 0, so I'll focus on the other two.","d956ece8":"Great!\n\nWe can see that the highest NO$_2$ densities -- the bright yellow cloud on the top -- are found close (although not exctly on top of) the biggest city in Puerto Rico - San Juan.\n\nLet's move to some analysis.","7007c7b7":"<div id=\"intLink_wmaps\">\n# 3. Splitting the NO$_2$ between power plants\n\nAs we see in the images above, one annoying thing about this problem is that power plants are tiny and the NO$_2$ each of them is producing can be spread over many kilometers. And we need to connect the two to calculate the emission factors.\n\nOne way to do this would be to measure the NO$_2$ density in a radius around each power plant and assume that that power plant is responsible for producing that NO$_2$. This is fine, but a bit of a problem when you have two or more power plants close by, since you'd count the NO$_2$ twice or more. \n\nThe idea I'm using here is to split the NO$_2$ between power plants when they are close. If we have two power plants and we are 1 meter away from power plant A, probably 99.99% of the NO$_2$ comes from that plant, but if we are in between the two power plants then maybe it will closer to 50% of the NO$_2$. A caviat of this is that if we know that power plant A generates 10% more energy than the other, probably it will be responsible by more than 50% of the NO$_2$ that we can find at the mid-point of the two power plants, so that is something that needs to be improved in this analysis. One could also factor in the differente electric capacities of these power plants, but since this is a factor in the calculation of the EF (NO$_2$\/electric capacity), the problem would be degenerate, so I dropped that idea. In short, I'm splitting equaly the NO$_2$ between power plants only based on distance, which is a strong assumption. \n\nSo, the simple approach I'm using where is to say that the **NO$_2$ in each pixel is to be divided between *all* power plants weighted by the inverse of their distance to that point.**\n\n(On a side note, the convolution I used above for plotting the 'average electical power' in the maps, might be a nicer alternative to the distance maps I used down below on this notebook, but the kernel size has to be set smartly, probably depending on how much the NO$_2$ dilutes on average and some knowledge on how the atmosphere works -- which I don't have... --  is needed here.)","5149ae85":"<div id=\"intLink_bayes\">\n# 4. Calculate the EF using a Bayesian approach\n  \nI'll use a very simple, linear model:\n\n> NO$_2$ = EF $\\times$ electrical_capacity + noise\n\nAnd then try to 'unfold' that noise component by doing something like\n\n> NO$_2$ = EF $\\times$ electrical_capacity + K$_0$ $\\times$ population + K$_1$ $\\times$ temperature + K$_2$ $\\times$ temperature ... + noise\n\nIt is very simple model, but very easy to intrepret as well.","c193e4ef":"Hopefully this is a bit clerer in these plots bellow.\n\nOn the left I'm plotting the distance (top) and the NO$_2$ *weighted* NO$_2$ density map for one power plant, and on the right for other power plant.","c51d6844":"### 4.2. Model\n\nSo, the naive model we're working with is:\n\n> NO$_2$ = EF $\\times$ energy_created + noise\n\nAnd I've restricted myself to look at power plants primary fueled by oil, because the the amount of NO$_2$ generated per megawatt of power plants with different primary fuels is likely to be very different, since the way electricity is produced is very different.\n\nHowever, even within the oil power plants, there might be quite big differences on how they operate (due to year of construction, owner, etc). So we expect the NO$_2$ per energy produced within these power plants to be similar, but not exactly the same. And this is where a [hierarchical bayesian model](https:\/\/twiecki.io\/blog\/2014\/03\/17\/bayesian-glms-3\/) could potentially be useful (I also took a lot from this very nice [post](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/hands-on-bayesian-statistics-with-python-pymc3-arviz-499db9a59501)) .\n\n\nThe model will be:\n\n>NO$_2$[power plant i] = EF[power plant i] $\\times$ capacity[power plant i]\n\nwhere the NO$_2$[power plant i] is the NO$_2$ associated with power plant number i, EF[power plant i] is the emission efficiency for that power plant, and capacity[power plant i] the energy generation capacity.\n\nNow the bayes part comes from saying:\n\n>EF[power plant i] $\\propto$ $Normal$($\\mu_{pp}$,$\\sigma_{pp}$) \n\nmeaning (more or less) that we cannot really measure the real value of the EF for that power plant (which would be $\\mu_{pp_i}$ in this case), because the world is noisy, so what we measure from the data is *a* value of EF, that is related to $\\mu_{pp_i}$ (I choose by a Normal distribution, given the amount of data we have >20 points, hopefully the [CLT](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Central_limit_theorem) justifies this).\n\nThe hierarchy part comes from saying that all these $\\mu_{pp_i}$ should be related, since they all concern oil power plants, so:\n\n$\\mu_{pp}$ $\\propto$ $Normal$($\\mu_{oil}$,$\\sigma_{oil}$) \n\n$\\sigma_{pp}$ $\\propto$ HalfNormal($\\beta_{oil}$) \n\nNeither $\\sigma_{pp_i}$ or $\\mu_{pp_i}$ can be negative, so I'm choosing a half normal for the first, but still allow $\\mu_{pp}$ to be negative (so that the mean can be different from zero). There's might be other better choices of priors, such as the Student-t or the Cauchy distribution that would perhaps deal better with outliers, but this is sort of a base model.\n\nI'll use pymc3 to model this.","1ed26634":"Extract longigute and latitute from .geo column","083564b4":"Althought the mean value of global EF for oil power plant ($\\mu_{pp}$) doesn't dramatically change when adding the other variables, the 'noise' is quite lower, which might be a good sign.","c54629fc":"<div id=\"intLink_2d\">\n## 2.

Not sure if NO$_2$ is used when calculating the index, in that case it should not be used to predict NO$_2$ density. However it might also just flag places where *general stuff in the air* gets trapped, like valleys or cities, and the NO$_2$ migh also concentrate there, even if it is produced elsewhere.\n\nCloud fraction also seems to have some correlation with NO$_2$ density, although the rest of the properties seem to be mapped at much lower resolution, so it's hard to tell. \n\nI'm calculating the [spearman correlation rank](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) of each pixel of these maps and see how the correlate with NO$_2$ density.","54815c53":"Now, I'll add the NO$_2$ associated with every power plant for all the days we have available, converting the units from mol\/m$^2$ to mass using NO$_2$ molecular mass (46.006 g\/mol) and the spatial resolution of the gfs images:\n \nmass NO$_2$ in tonnes = $\\sum_{pixels}$ sentinel image [mol\/m]$^2$ $\\times$ 0.0046[kg\/mol] $\\times$ 7000^2 [m^2\/pixel] \/1000\n \n*(Note: I am a bit in doubt about the spatial resolution of these images.
