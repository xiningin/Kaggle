Make decision tree\n\nWe try to make a decision tree to classify the food into these seven classes by using the following nine features; Calories (kcal), Carbohydrates (g), Total Sugar (g), Protein (g), Total Fat (g), Saturated Fat (g), Monounsaturated Fat (g), Polyunsaturated Fat (g), Total Fiber (g)                 ","c8c7f3b3":"## Example of food classification based on diet nutrition using decision tree.\n\nThis is an example of decision tree classfication of food based on diet nutrition data.\n\n#### Reference\n\n- Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili, Python Machine Learning: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition.

Add labels\n\nSince the data has no labels for classification, we add the following labels to each row.\n\n- 0 (fruits): grapes, melon, watermelon, tangerine, lemon, banana, pineapple, red apple, green apple, pear, peach, cherries, strawberry, kiwifruit, avocado\n- 1 (vegitables): tomato, eggplant, potato, carrot, corn, hot pepper, cucumber, mushroom, peanuts, chestnut\n- 2 (grain crops): bread, croissant, french bread, pancakes, rice crackers, rice, spaghetti\n- 3 (animals\/fishes): cheese, beef, chicken, bakon, fried shrimp\n- 4 (junk foods): hamburger, french fries, pizza, hotdog, taco, burrito, popcorn\n- 5 (desserts): ice cream, doughnut, cookie, cake, chocolate bar, candy, custard flan, honey\n- 6 (drinks): milk, black tea, sake, champagne, red wine, beer","782540e9":"## 5. Result summary\n\nFrom the decision tree, we can see the following patterns.\n\n- Most of drinks are low calory (<=1.13) and low sugar (<=0.013), except for sake which is made from rice and has nutrition similar to grain crops category.\n- Fruits and vegetables have similar nutrition. The main difference is the amount of sugar. Most of foods have total sugar > 0.055.\n- Most of desserts have high calories (> 1.13) and high sugar (> 0.162).\n- Junk foods and animals\/fishes have high saturated fat (>0.021)."}}
