Although it is not necessary to perform EDA to build models, but it is definitely recommended as it helps to know the data better. If performed correctly, it gives us insights which are not easy to witness directly. \n\nIn this notebook, I have performed a detailed analysis on Indian Restaurants Dataset from Zomato(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rabhar\/zomato-restaurants-in-india\">link<\/a>). This notebook can be used as a manual to perform basic to intermediate EDA on any dataset. Following are the things that you will learn from this project :-\n1. Knowing basic composition of data\n2. Removing duplicates\n3. Dealing with missing values\n4. Understanding features\n5. Plotting horizontal bar charts (multicolor)\n6. Using groupby, apply, and unique functions \n7. Scatter plot\n8. Word Cloud\n9. Box plot\n10. Density plot\n11. Bar Charts\n12.

Approx. 35% of restaurants in India are part of some chain\n2. Domino's Pizza, Cafe Coffee Day, KFC are the biggest fast food chains in the country with most number of outlets\n3. Barbecues and Grill food chains have highest average ratings than other type of restaurants \n4. Quick bites and casual dining type of establishment have most number of outlets\n5. Establishments with alcohol availability have highest average ratings, votes and photo uploads\n6. Banglore has most number of restaurants \n7. Gurgaon has highest rated restaurants (average 3.83) whereas Hyderabad has more number of critics (votes). Mumbai and New Delhi dominates for most photo uploads per outlet\n8. After North Indian, Chinese is the most prefered cuisine in India\n9. International cuisines are better rated than local cuisines\n10. Gastro pub, Romantic Dining and Craft Beer features are well rated by customers\n11. Most restaurants are rated between 3 and 4\n12. Majority of restaurants are budget friendly with average cost of two between Rs.250 to Rs.800\n13. There are less number of restaurants at higher price ranges\n14.
