The next layer is the LSTM layer with 30 memory units (smart neurons)and dropout layer(0.2).

The efficient ADAM optimization algorithm is used. The model is fit for only 2 epochs because it quickly overfits the problem.

Each movie review is a variable sequence of words and the sentiment of each movie review must be classified. The Large Movie Review Dataset (often referred to as the IMDB dataset) contains 25,000 highly-polar movie reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given movie review has a positive or negative sentiment. Use LSTM for sequence classification in the IMDB dataset. Perform the following.\na) Load dataset but keep only top 5000 words.\nb) Build LSTM model.\nc) Train the network and perform hyper parameter tuning.\nd) Evaluate the model."}}
