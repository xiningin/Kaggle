When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.\n\nIs it clear what `least_difference()` does from the source code?

Python functions are allowed much more flexibility. The `print` function is a good example of this:","813ca34d":"...though what it shows isn't super useful.\n\nNotice that the code cells above have examples of functions (`type`, and `print`) taking *another function* as input. This opens up some interesting possibilities - we can *call* the function we receive as an argument.","d7d14565":"## Default arguments\n\nWhen we called `help(print)`, we saw that the `print` function has several optional arguments. For example, we can specify a value for `sep` to put some special string in between our printed arguments:","dddffd0c":"Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:","c0ea2529":"Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of \"null\" in other languages.)\n\nWithout a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.","8d6e6d25":"## \"What does this function do again?\"\n\nI showed the `abs` function in the previous tutorial, but what if you've forgotten what it does?\n\nThe `help()` function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn.
