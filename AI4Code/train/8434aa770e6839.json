conversion error of different units, or missing value place holder.\n\nAlso, we can see mean is less than the median so again a left skewness is observed in the distribution.","80dafc00":"As we expected, rings have really weak correlation monotonic increasing relationship with whole weight, the shape of loess line somewhat represents logarithmic curve.","a7947ab7":"One thing that stands out in both, length and diameter plot is, it becomes increasing hard to predict for higher ring values above 15, so it seems sweet spot of predicting ring is between 5 and 15.","d05aedaf":"From Boxplot 1, which is IQR * 1.5 tells us, outliers exist between ranges of 20 to 40 which presumably is due to Infants presence or particular small species of abalone. \n\nFrom Boxplot 2 we can see the distribution is indeed left skewed, and values are centered around 100-140 range.\n\nLet's do a histogram to visualize the shape of the distribution, we can stick with default bin size for now.","ce8c154c":"We can see most of the rings are within 8 and 10, while mean is around 10, and since mean is greater than median, the distribution would be right skewed. Sample variance is smaller, so distribution would be narrower, we can plot a density histogram to verify it.","8c3ea2ae":"Now, it matches exact data type as described in the data description from UCI ML repository.","3d5cb5bb":"We can see the plot kind of looks like exponential function with monotonically increasing relationship, and as expected as the weight increase we expect the length of shell to increase as abalone adds new growth rings to it's shell.","5976ec1b":"Indeed, length closely follows a normal shape, and while we see deviation at the lowest value and highest length value, the difference would be better visualized with CDF, let's visualize the difference by contrasting CDF with the Difference plot.","c27922a6":"So, their is significant more males than other two categories, let's visualize since Female and Infant are really close by using relative density to get a sense of their differences.","f2de52bc":"## [Data Pre-Processing](#Contents)\n\nFrom the data dictionary description above, we have good sense about what data dictionary is, and range of values we can expect, type of variable and the measurement units. \n\nWe also know the target variable is `Rings`, which is predictor of age, now let's first explore the data after importing it into data frame.","7f5f604b":"We can see the mean is around -9, and median lies around -2, it's harder to infer the reasons we see above anomaly, as we don't know how the observations were collected or if their is error associated with shucking process or simply data entry error.\n\nLet's visualize it with density plot to see the spread of the negative weight differences vs. positive differences, and get overall sense of weight differences.","61b4f87b":"#### Height vs. Whole weight\n\nBefore we compare Height vs. Whole weight, let's not forget that height has few anomalies that we expect to see if we plot a chart. We should expect to see those values around 0 and 226, another thing we should expect is somewhat linear monotonic relationship between them. \n\nLet's do a scatter plot to visualize it, we expect as height increase the whole weight should also add up, albeit we don't know if plot is linear or exponential. ","fa23d817":"There are about equal proportions of Females and Infants, with slightly more Males, than either Females or Infants. \n\nOne thing we can notice, is presumably sex is much harder to recognize in infants and this is evident based on we have slightly higher infants than females.","b6175c23":"Clearly, there is a significant difference in dimensions depending on `sex`, we can see `infants < female <= male`, which tells us we can even classify between `infants` and `adult` abalones.

","e6352fce":"We can see values almost fit perfect and can be modeled with normal, but we need to be aware of the difference plot where we can see big difference near middle, beginning and tail regions.","32a87448":"#### Diameter vs. Whole weight\n\nSimilar to length, since length and diameter are perpendicular to each other we expect diameter to also show exponential like curve and grow as abalone adds new growth rings.","d5cc5708":"### [Length](#Contents)\n\nLet's do a summary statistic to see how length is distributed, we expect it should follow normal distribution, with some skewness to it considering we have infants in the dataset. ","06a84da3":"#### Length vs. Rings\n\nWe expect length, along with diameter and height to have high slightly higher correlation as increasing the ring size regardless of species increases their length, diameter and height as they add new growth rings to their shell. We can visualize it with LOESS line through a scatter plot.","9beced30":"Note that many of the variables are highly correlated with one another with r > 0.7, we can expect the weights to be related to each other as we saw in univariate analysis, but it was unexpected to see the height to be also related with weights, and length and diameter.\n\nWe can ignore the other weight variables as they don't give us any new information that we know, we also expect know length, height and diameter to be linearly related, let's focus on:\n* height vs. whole weight\n* length vs. whole weight\n* diameter vs. whole weight.\n\nWhile there seems to be somewhat a weak correlation between rings and other variables.","ba60740c":"#### PairPlots\n\nNow let's do a pairplots to understand how `sex` affects the abalone features, and see if we can find that `infant` are overall smaller in dimension than `female` and `male` or not.","4f2fa8d0":"We can see it's a female abalone and other variables like length, diameter, weights, lie below Q3, so height is indeed an anomaly in this data set and would skew our distribution. Again we can do missing value imputation if needed.\n\nLet's check the IQR to see how rest of the data lies within.","20ce567c":"So, there are total of 153 observations that have weight difference in negative, we can ignore the values around 0 so $\\pm 2$, but we can't ignore values that are range from -10 to -89.\n\nAnother thing to note is in above observations we can see each feature has distinct row, and values for weight differ mostly. \n\nNow let's see summary statistics of negative weight difference values, to see why combined weight is more than whole weight.","6a5ed62c":"## [Pairwise Analysis](#Contents)\n\nBefore we do pairwise let's see visualize the correlation coefficient matrix as a heat map to understand which pairwise analysis to check.","b992f034":"From above plot we can see somewhat a kind of exponential monotonic increasing relationship, so as height increases the whole weight increases for abalone which makes sense, while it doesn't make sense for 0 height to not increase when their weights are really high, or height is really large like 226 but weight is lower than we might expect. Another thing to notice is another outlier near 100 height, has also fairly large weight with it, unlike other outliers at height 0 and 226.\n","dcc1ef3f":"## [Summary](#Contents)\n\n* We can now be fairly certain that shell weight, and height are good predictors of age between 6.5 and 16.5, which we can model using linear regression.\n\n* Also we need to be aware of `multicolinearity` within weight based features. \n\n* Another thing we noticed were anomalies in `height` and `weight-diff` variables, which we can remove as it would affect the model accuracy. \n","ea1196e1":"From above summary statistics we can see, each weight features have mean greater than the median, so we can expect a right skewness in the distribution unlike length, and diameter.\n\nFor all the whole weight, we can see the weight ranges from the lowest of around 0 grams to max being weighing around roughly 570 grams. \n\nSimilar trend should be expected, and looks like weights have high variance, and this again goes back to what we stated before, as to how abalone are collection of small and large sizes, so we should expect varying weights between abalones. \n\nNow let's visualize the spread with a density histogram to see if it looks normal and has right skewness with adjusted bin size.","aadd2d26":"We can confirm, sex only has 3 categories, mainly - Male, Female and Infant, with Male being the most frequent of them. Let's see their density, to understand by how much is Male greater than Female and Infant in this dataset.","7fb92256":"We can see the max 226 giving right skewness, we would need to investigate the provenance of the data to understand where min and max anomaly come from.","a6370b4a":"Indeed, it is as we expected, distribution is right skewed and has less spread, with mean around 10, so the age of abalone would be around 11.5 years. ","ee1f13da":"Indeed, we see an exponential curve, similar to length vs. whole weight. \n\nNow, we need to explore the relationship between the predictor variable `rings vs. height, length, diameter and whole weight`, which we deem important as we expect as length, height, diameter and whole weight increase so should the rings as abalone grows in size, which also reflects its age. ","9eca0f6b":"Using `info` we can see total records are 4177, and counts of variables equals to total counts so we don't expect any missing values, or NA's, in addition we can see the data type was imported as we expected, with sex as categorical type, length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, and rings as numerical. \n\nOne thing we can notice is `rings` is float type instead of integer, and length, diameter, and height should be  imported as float type not integer.","83e6d689":"As we expected there is indeed presence of weak monotonically linear relation ship of rings with length. ","ba8c87a0":"Wow!, surprising weight difference is in negative for the min, does that mean it's an error in the process or measurement, we need to look at the values and see how many rows were negative in weight difference.","e4ae1d64":"#### Rings vs. Shell weight\n\nNow let's see why Shell weight has much higher correlation than height as we saw in the correlation coefficient matrix. We suspect that dried shell weight is much better indicator of abalone age since after drying we can approximate weight per ring.","79d6a02a":"## [Introduction](#Contents)\n\nIt is important to know Abalone is a common name for any group of small sea snails to very large sea snails, as such we should expect diversity in their sizes and weights, unlike looking at single species of Abalone. \n\nThe need is to predict the age of abalone accurately as telling the age by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope is inefficient process [1], so to predicting age using other factors like weight or height that can be easily measured would expedite the process. \n\nWe know as abalone grows it adds rings, and as it add new layers to shell it increases the shell weight, and shell diameter.

We should be able to use common knowledge (aka no complex domain knowledge required) to work with the data in this problem to find features that are important predictors for linear regression or other regression learning techniques.\n\n\n### Data Dictionary\n```\nDescription of fields in abalone data.\n\nName            Data Type    Meas.

Statistical and Mathematical Modeling.\n\nOur focus is on properly doing EDA and with proper visualization techniques.\n\n**Let's Begin**","6ffd0302":"Indeed we can see height is better suited to predict age of abalone vs. other measured variable, so far height is also one of the candidate we should look out for.","dc06d781":"Now we need to check for data types and see if data type matches with what we expect ?","e9160ce2":"Let's look at without outliers:","cb8b320a":"#### Diameter vs. Rings\n\nAs we stated above, we also expect diameter to also have weak linear monotonically increasing relationship with rings, which we can visualize it with scatter plot and loess line through it.","8318ca1c":"As you can see most values are positive while we can also observe anomalies of negative weight differences.","d450d1e0":"#### Whole weight vs. Rings\nWe don't expect to have a strong correlation with whole weights, as we know difference species of abalone have different sizes, so total weight won't tells us any thing much about rings. ","40cb31c4":"#### Height vs. Rings\n\nWe suspect height is also strongly correlated with rings as it did with whole weight, let's visualize it again with a scatter plot to see if that is so. ","ed84e921":"First we notice is other variables have valid values, while whole weight and length tell us height shouldn't be 0. Another thing we notice is length and diameter are both smaller than their Q1, so height should also be around Q1, which is supported by the fact that sex is Infant. \n\nOverall we know it's not a data or measurement error as other values are valid, it might just be missing value, so we can either handle it by substituting mean or median if needed, but using kNN regression we can find similar infant abalones that match features close to this.\n\nNow, let's explore the max 226 and see if it's corresponding variables lie above Q3, or it's also an anomaly in data.","849949c1":"### [Sex](#Contents)\n\nFrom the initial data description fields we know sex is categorized into Male, Female which makes sense, while Infant seems misclassified or was classified may be due to it's was hard to tell the sex at the time of observation since Abalone was Infant. \n\nLet's first confirm the categories of `Sex`, we know it is 3, and which is the most frequent `Sex` found in this data set.","43fbc44c":"We can see a somewhat weak linear relationship but much better than preceding variables we explored. Another thing to notice is rings range between 5 to 15 would have better prediction accuracy which we saw applied to preceding distribution as well. ","59313868":"We can see a left skewed normal like shape, let's see if the distribution is good match with normal with QQ-plots.","a4d0ede7":"Indeed distribution is right skewed, and as we expected the histogram of shucked weight, shell weight and viscera weight are similar to whole weight and each other. \n\nWe can now expect whole weight to be highly correlated with other weight variables, which doesn't help us much in predicting age.\n\nNow we add new feature `weight-diff` to further understand if that is how whole weight is calculated, and see if their is anomaly in weight values, we expect weight diff to be vary between positive and zero as it was the mass that was lost during shucking process.","adbef693":"## [Single Variable Analysis](#Contents)","ec23b1a6":"#### Length vs. Whole weight\n\nWe expect the weight of abalone to increase monotonically as it eats and adds new growth rings the shell length will increase so will weight due to increased shell size. Let's plot a loess line with a scatter plot, as we don't know if it is a linear or exponential. \n\nWe can confirm based on this para from [Marinebio.net](https:\/\/www.marinebio.net\/marinescience\/06future\/abrepro.htm):\n> Abalone growth rings due to feeding are concentric rings laid down all along the edge of the shell. These circular banding patterns can be used as a clue to the types of food available to the abalone when it was young. As the abalone grows it adds new open holes in the area just to the left of its head, as needed. As a new hole is made the abalone will plug up an older hole, at the end of the line, that no longer is above the respiratory area. Each species of abalone has a range of open holes that can be found in each shell.\n\n\n","2029b982":"## Contents\n\n1. [Introduction](#Introduction)\n2.
