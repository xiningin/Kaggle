Almost everyone has it some point of time.  Pain that last for 3 months or more is considered chronic.\n\nTypical sources of low back pain include:\n\n* The large nerve roots in the low back that go to the legs may be irritated\n* The smaller nerves that supply the low back may be irritated\n* The large paired lower back muscles (erector spinae) may be strained\n* The bones, ligaments or joints may be damaged\n* An intervertebral disc may be degenerating\n\nAn irritation or problem with any of these structures can cause lower back pain and\/or pain that radiates or is referred to other parts of the body. Many lower back problems also cause back muscle spasms, which don't sound like much but can cause severe pain and disability.\n\nWhile lower back pain is extremely common, the symptoms and severity of lower back pain vary greatly. A simple lower back muscle strain might be excruciating enough to necessitate an emergency room visit, while a degenerating disc might cause only mild, intermittent discomfort.","6f668900":"## Exploratory Data Analysis","137e2bcd":"**Conclusion:**\nAfter normalization, we can see that the variance in the test and the training has been reduced significantly and provide pretty similar result with less noise.
