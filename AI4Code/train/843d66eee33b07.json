The most precise portion of the footage is the middle section, when the droplet location is very near the position of the tracker.\n\nWith this information, I should be able to get very accurate fits to my data and an idea of how precise my results are. ","28b43b68":"## Background velocity fluctuations\nI now want to find out what the impact of brownian motion and other small, local forces are on the motion of the droplets. I'll do this by comparing the fluctuations in the vertical direction (x direction of the footage) to the fluctuations in the horizontal direction (y direction of the footage). In theory there should be no net forces in the horizontal direction, so the droplets random motion in this direction should give us information on what kinds of variations in velocity are considered normal in our test conditions. \n\n### Second Droplet\nFirst, I'll get a simple idea of the time variation in the velocities and accelerations of the droplet in the horizontal direction by simply plotting their variations on a frame by frame basis over the course of the videos.

Then I will hopefully be able to measure the size of the droplet from this image data.\n\n### Second dataset\nOne thing to note is that my image set contains all of the frames from the footage we took, but the tracking data does not begin from the first frame. For the first set of data, the tracking does not begin until the 678th frame, so when retrieving the coordinates I must make sure to account for this shift.

I'll use a scatter plot to visualize all of my sampled datapoints, and then use a bar chart to show the average standard deviation in the vertical direction over 10 second intervals (each of which should have 30 data points because I collected one sample per second).","050aa9e7":"For each frame there is an x and y coordinate corresponding to the pixel value of the tracking marker for the given frame.

Then I can fit a line to each one of these segments to get the slope, and therefore the velocity. This should give me more accurate velocity measurements than simply looking at the individual turning points since it uses the entire dataset, rather than a small number of individual turning points. \n\nUsing some blackbelt Google-fu I managed to find a peak finding algorithm in the Scipy package, which I have already imported. I'll be using this to find the peaks and valleys of my vertical position. These are the points where we turned the field off or on. \n\nI'll begin with the first dataset, since it is the smallest, so I can figure out the method.

I'll begin by removing the obvious ones, and then after calculating the velocities I'll remove the velocities which are innacurate due to erratic tracker behaviour.","96969dda":"Now we're talking!

This 20x20 area is the marker 'pattern', or box which gets displayed in the UI to help find the tracker (the actual pattern box is 21x21 close enough). Since the droplet moves so slowly it never actual leaves this box for any given frame, so its a great area to limit my size calculations to.\n\nBy adjusting the above mask we can constrain the displayed values to ones above some lower limit. Changing the `frame` value displays the droplet for different frames. Experimenting with these two parameters, I found that a mask value of 60% of the maximum pixel value did the best job of isolating the droplet in the image. By measuring the standard deviation of these pixels away from the recorded tracking point I should be able to get a very good value for the uncertainty of my positional data.","5a79950f":"Once again we see values clustering around integer multiples of some constant $e$.

If we had had more time in this lab I think this would have been a fruitful pursuit. At the very least, I believe this detour has succeeded in showing that the error introduced in the tracking of the particle is small, and supports our unorthodox method in this lab as being effective.","ce8d0fc1":"# Converting to Real World Units\nNow that we have all of our data in place, it's time to change units so that our values are actually physically meaningful.\n\n## First trial\nLet's convert the velocity values for our first trial to S.I. units and see their distribution again.","de2a6d2b":"It looks like there are about four charge values which deviate from the average much more than is typical.

The measured value was very close the generally accepted value of $e$, $1.602\\times 10^{-19}$ C. However, the large standard deviation of the charge measurements from the values predicted by the quantized model indicates a lack of precision which hampers these findings to a degree. This uncertainty could be remedied through a larger sample size, since in this experiment only the motion of three droplets was analyzed. Other possible ways of reducing this uncertainty include monitoring other parameters, such as air viscosity and voltage, with greater precision, and measuring the mass of the oil droplets through a more direct means than Stokes' Law.","eef3031f":"Once again, we see that the vertical has a higher average standard deviation from the tracker position than the horizontal direction.

Millikan and Harvey Fletcher to measure the elementary electric charge $e$. The experiment consists of measuring the rise and fall velocities of tiny droplets of oil in an electric field. These droplets are so small that in the absence of an external force they reach their terminal fall velocity almost instantly. By ionizing these droplets with an alpha radiation source we can give them a small positive charge, so that when we switch on an electric field we can cause them to rise with a velocity proportional to their charge. \n\nStoke's Law gives the frictional force exerted on spherical objects with very small Reynolds numbers in a viscous fluid \u2013 like our oil droplet moving through air. At terminal velocity the force of gravity is balanced against the frictional force of the air, and since we know both the gravitational constant $g$ and the coefficient of friction for air $k$ (as a function of air pressure and temperature), by measuring the terminal velocity $v_f$ of the droplet we can use Stoke's Law to solve for its mass. With its mass known, we can measure the total charge of the droplet by observing its motion in an applied electric field of a known strength. We can even change the charge of a single droplet by reionizing it and observing its change in velocity. Once we have collected enough data, **we expect to find that the measured charge values of the droplets are integer multiples of some elementary constant.**\n\nIn his original experiment Millikan obtained his velocity measurements by watching these oil droplets move up and down and measuring the time they took to move a known distance. This is no easy task. One must peer through a backlit microscope lens and keep their eye trained on a single microscopic droplet for as long as they can bear, or until it loses its charge and falls out of view. After attempting this classic method for about 20 minutes I decided it wasn't worth losing vision in my right eye over and opted to make use of some of the 21st century technology Millikan lacked access to. In our version of the experiment we used an iPhone 8 camera to record footage of the droplets moving up and down. Additionally, rather than timing these droplets by hand to get their velocity data, I had the idea to automate this as well by motion tracking the droplet footage using one of my all time favorite pieces of open source software, Blender. The tracking went beautifully, and this is primary dataset we will be using in this analysis. ","6ec07606":"From looking at this sample of pixel distrubion standard deviations it seems as though this trial had a lower and more consistent tracking precision than the last one. There are a few differences of note between this graph and the last one.\n- There are sampled values which have a stardard distribution of zero in the vertical direction, which was never the case for the second trial.\n- The results as a whole seem much more uniform, meaning that many samples seem to have the exact same value. For smaller droplets with fewer pixels on average this is somewhat expected. \n- There is a very clear peak in the middle section where the standard deviation is larger than normal, before returning to about where it was before. \n\nLet's see what happens at these two extremes: unusually high and unusually low standard deviations.","557a912d":"These frames are somewhat confusing to me, since most of them seem like they should have a standard x deviation of greater than zero. In any case though, it seems that their contribution to the uncertainty will be minimal, and I don't want to waste too much time focusing on this."}}
