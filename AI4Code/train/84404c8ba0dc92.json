There are a number of approaches I can take. I could go back and take the average for each country\/region\/area for these values. \n\nThey are all developing countries. I have forty rows of them, how is that going to impact the life expectancy and mortality calculations for those developing countries? When I weigh against polio, there's not a lot I can do about that. When I weigh against, say, population, HIV, etc, it could have a serious impact. Why don't we have polio information on these developing countries? Could it be because they didn't have access to the technology to test for polio? Were their systems down that year? Should I allow those possible interfering factors disallow their data to contribute to the other features that I'm observing? No.  \n\nAm I going to look at polio and diptheria? Is there any correlation on these items and life expectancy?\n\nI have a lot of features. I'm going to assign them to a different dataframe for the time being and remove the suspected null values from that dataframe. For the remainder of this project, I will omit these features. I might come back to them.\n\nRemember the country a person lives in could also impact the life expectancy. Do I want to just think about the time of year? I anticipate that the time of year would have a very real impact on the life expectancy of ESPECIALLY developing countries.\nYes. I could drop the nulls individually, but there's enough of a significance is the nulls for these features for me to go ahead and make the assumption. I just feel a little bad for Sedan - when I look at polio, etc.","e31b95c9":"### Filling in Data\nNow I have to understand what's going on with those columns who have a larger portion of the data missing.

","15b95290":"The distribution isn't normal, so it's difficult to get a good comparison between these two variables. When I think on whether or not they'll make a good feature in my model, I'm also thinking about the other features that I'm using. Measles and HIV\/AIDS seem to make more sense in another model that is looking at the impact of diseases on our overall life expectancy. Wheras this dataset, seems to be looking at how the the percent expenditures and infant deaths would relate to our overall life expentancy. At least that appears to be the direction I'm heading.\n\nA log transformation COULD fit this data to the model, but because of the features that I've started to eliminate with respect to my approach, I'm going to work without measles and HIV\/AIDS. They need to be investigated and handled separately - like all other diseases.

When there's too many outliers, the data needs to be compressed or transformed to make it easier to work with. \n\nThese outliers that we're seeing could be a result of bad data, they could just a few dozen falling outside of the norm, or they could be something more serious.\n\n","f44ebd56":"Explore the data using univariate and multivariate exploration techniques.
