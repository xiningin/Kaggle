Sample test cases follow:\n    Input\t                  Output\n    this is a sentence\t       4\n    this sentence is not true\t5","a201a47b":"##### Problem : Accept a sentence as input, print \"none\" if no vowel in it otherwise print all vowels in alphabetical series of vowels (if any vowel occurs more than once then print once)","e5bedcdc":"###### 5.Use code\n    x = int(input())\n    y = int(input())\n    z = int(input())\n\n    # Block-1 Start\n    if x > 0 or y > 0 or z > 0:\n         if (x > 0 and y > 0) or (y > 0 and z > 0) or (z > 0 and x > 0):\n            if x > 0 and y > 0 and z > 0:\n                print('P3')\n            else:\n                print('P2')\n        else:\n            print('P1')\n    # Block-1 End\n\n    # Block-2 Start\n    if x < 0 or y < 0 or z < 0:\n         if (x < 0 and y < 0) or (y < 0 and z < 0) or (z < 0 and x < 0):\n            if x < 0 and y < 0 and z < 0:\n                 print('N3')\n            else:\n                print('N2')\n        else:\n            print('N1')\n    # Block-2 End\n    Question 1.What will be the value of X & Y in the output for the given input?
