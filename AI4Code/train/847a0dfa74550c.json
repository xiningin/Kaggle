Now we have challenge of **accuracy**. we can't directly say if we have score of lets say 80% that model is perfect.\nAccuracy = TP + FP \/ TP + FP + TN + FN\nas TP = true posiitve, FP= false positive, TN=true negetive, FN= false negetive.\n**false negetive does not have much effect in model but FP has create a much effect**** in that point of time **precision** and **recall** comes into picture.\nPrecision = TP \/ predicted positive (TP + FP)\nRecall = TP \/ actual positive (TP + FN)\n\nNow as we have precision and recall we would not be able to decide which should be best. so to take both we need to take harmonic mean of both and get result as **F-Score**.\n\nF-score = 2 * (precision * recall)\/ (precision +  recall)\n\nSo for that we are splitting data set in training and test data set using sklearn.train_test_split\n","6dd64cb1":"You just wondering after seeing all this graphs how well data correlates, now it looks more easier to get analysis rather than just applying algorithm on raw data. Age was one of the important factor in survival lets check","4cd7e239":"You can see **C** class have mean fare around 80 which is same as our fare. so we get 1 point which prioritize C but we should not leave now. we have to check and confirm.","5961f6b5":"as we have divided data into two part training and test data this is also called as Cross-validation technique.\nthere are several like k-fold etc we will see at down of this kernel.","459d46a4":"These both tell that it is **C** class who opt for null values rather **S** class. so a small analysis will lead you to correct dataset.","836a65b4":"Above you can clearly see C =4 and so on is best in accuracy so we will choose lowest best value of C which is 4.\nF1-score and confusion matrix is much more reliable than logistic regression.","6b627f9d":"The above graph give glimpse of people who survived in pclass based on age. wow how well it is visualize by **seaborn** . that is power of seaborn. Below we are checking based on sex and fare and Embarked.","c5c3bc39":"**Info()** is one of the powerful method which will give you information about if any **missing values** and data type of each values. we will handle missing values in later in kernel. and as all algorithm support only numerical values we need to convert categorical variable into numerical data.\nBelow you can see **Age**, **Cabin** and **Embarked** in training dataset is having missing values , missing values in **Cabin** is very huge so it does not hold good to put any mean or random values thats why we will drop it without process it.\nsame explanation hold good for test data as well.\n","cf6c232c":"In above we can see Title with more frequent are have more number of people but as less frequent we are replacing to Rare as it will just add extra category in feature so we thought to just put in Rare category as it will not affect much our Survival status.","0549a3b2":"Above we can see ages in different band now our next task is to assign a proper value for each band range ex age 0 to 16 belong to 0 and so on. now you can see 1000 of age converted into just 1, 2, 3,4. which is very efficient for machine.","dba0f83f":"Many a times, the data is imbalanced, i.e there may be a high number of class1 instances but less number of other class instances. Thus we should train and test our algorithm on each and every instance of the dataset. Then we can take an average of all the noted accuracies over the dataset.\n\n1)The K-Fold Cross Validation works by first dividing the dataset into k-subsets.\n\n2)Let's say we divide the dataset into (k=5) parts. We reserve 1 part for testing and train the algorithm over the 4 parts.\n\n3)We continue the process by changing the testing part in each iteration and training the algorithm over the other parts. The accuracies and errors are then averaged to get a average accuracy of the algorithm.\n\nThis is called K-Fold Cross Validation.\n\n4)An algorithm may underfit over a dataset for some training data and sometimes also overfit the data for other training set. Thus with cross-validation, we can achieve a generalised model.","8d4e2f32":"Some must say Enough of graphs lets play with data which technically called as **Data Wrangling**.  as Ticket column has not any relation with survival and has missing value so we are dropping ticket column.\nNote: we could have combined training and testing data and then perform all operations  but for easy understanding of training and test data we are maintaing seperately.","279a3552":"In very first step first we will import all the library and data from csv file. data can be loaded from various source like cloud or local. it could be in any format like csv, xls or txt. \nplain data might be diffcult to handle therefore we are using pandas dataframe which is very easy to operate and understand. we are using some of important library like numpy for maths operation , seaborn & matplotlib for visualization and sklearn is a scientific library which provides all kinds of classifier, preprocessor etc. we will discuss more about it later in code.","97ffc54d":"Ahh!!, now we reached more than half of way but still way to go.. we see **Cabin** has large missing dataset. so it is not proper if we fill frequent or mean data values. it is better to remove from our dataset.","ec49e920":"Once done we can see age is now properly filled, but we have challenges. lets discuss about difference between **categorical**, **Nominal** and **Ordinal** ,**Numerical** values\n**Categorical** :- These values classify the samples into sets of similar samples. Within categorical features are the values nominal, ordinal, ratio, or interval based.\n**Nominal** :- which does not occur in order or range.we cannot sort or give any ordering to such variables.    \n**Ordinal** :- An ordinal variable is similar to categorical values, but the difference between them is that we can have relative ordering or sorting between the values. For eg: If we have a feature like Height with values Tall, Medium, Short, then Height is a ordinal variable. Here we can have a relative sort in the variable.    \n**Continous** :- A feature is said to be continous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the features column. Ex: **Age**\n\nas Age is continous feature we would have of 1000 of age but it is not easy to maintain and prediction based on that so  we need to classify based on **age band**.  we need to seprate age in 4 or 5 any number of part.","0edb9261":"After Feature correction and feature generation next step is to remove unwanted features from dataset so our data will look proper. here we are removing Name,Sibsp, Parch as we have got Title, and IsAlone.
