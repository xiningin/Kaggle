Use LMWH or UFH in hospitalized critically ill patients because of the shorter half-life and fewer drug-drug interactions compared with direct oral anticoagulants. Regular warfarin users who are unable to get INR monitoring during isolation may be candidates for direct oral anticoagulant therapy.

Lisa Baumann Kreuziger, Agnes Lee, David Garcia, Adam Cuker, Mary Cushman, Maria DeSancho, and Jean M. Connors\n\nThe incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients is not well established. Reports have ranged between 1.1% in non-ICU hospital wards to 69% in ICU patients screened with lower extremity ultrasound. Small sample sizes, differences in patient characteristics, co-morbidities, hospital and ICU admission criteria, criteria for diagnostic imaging, and COVID-19 therapies likely contribute to this wide range of estimates. Like other medical patients, those with more severe disease, especially if they have additional risk factors (e.g. older, male, obesity, cancer, history of VTE, comorbid diseases, ICU care), have a higher risk of VTE than those with mild or asymptomatic disease. VTE rate in outpatients has not been reported.https:\/\/www.hematology.org\/covid-19\/covid-19-and-vte-anticoagulation","ff0f5881":"#How should we manage COVID-19 patients who experience recurrent clotting of access devices (e.g., central venous catheters, arterial lines) or extracorporeal circuits (e.g., CRRT, ECMO) despite prophylactic anticoagulation?\n\nAny decision to increase the intensity of anticoagulation should take into account the individual patient\u2019s bleeding risk.\n\n#Should COVID-19 patients receive post-discharge thromboprophylaxis?\n\nPatients hospitalized for acute medical illness are at increased risk for VTE for up to 90 days after discharge. This finding should apply to COVID-19 patients, though data on incidence are not yet available. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider extended thromboprophylaxis after discharge using a regulatory-approved regimen.\n\nAspirin has been studied for VTE prophylaxis in low-risk patients after orthopedic surgery and could be considered for COVID-19 VTE prophylaxis if criteria for post-discharge thromboprophylaxis are met4. Patients should be educated on the signs and symptoms of VTE at hospital discharge.https:\/\/www.hematology.org\/covid-19\/covid-19-and-vte-anticoagulation"}}
