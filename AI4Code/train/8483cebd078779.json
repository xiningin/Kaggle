Any other score is 1 star.\n\nAlso, the Canadian Vintners Association bought a lot of ads on the site, so any wines from Canada should automatically get 3 stars, regardless of points.\n\nCreate a series `star_ratings` with the number of stars corresponding to each review in the dataset.","1343d082":"## 3.\nHow often does each country appear in the dataset?
