Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. \n \nLike most other lending companies, lending loans to \u2018risky\u2019 applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. \n\nTherefore, we will be working on exploring and crunching out the driving factors behind the loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
