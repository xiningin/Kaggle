However, the R-squared value is quite a bit lower knocking it from the weak correlation range (about 0.3 - 0.5) into the very weak range (0 - 0.3).","2bc2078c":"This is better than just population and area, but still in the very weak range. However, the p-value shot back down to near-zero (or as I've seen in my classes this can be denoted as 0+, i.e a value so small it may as well be zero). I think from this we can conclude that there is some very weak but statistically significant correlation between population density and the living wage of a city for a single adult with no kids. Next I will see how this relationship plays out for the other living wage columns.","7bc1da04":"Again we see an R-squared of 0.28 and a p-value of 0+. I will now try this with the two-adult columns","0e5e5e14":"Conclusion:\nThe living wage of one adult with no kids has a positive relationship with the city area and density, alongside a negative relationship with city population. While this relationship is statistically significant (the p-value is extremely small), it is a fairly weak correlation (as seen by the R-squared of 0.315). This tells me that as population goes up, living wage goes down. However, density increases the living wage. Although it should be kept in mind that this relationship is quite weak and small.","6d7ec834":"While the correlation is still considered statistically significant, for two adults, both working, and no kids we see an even weaker relationship. I'm not entirely sure what accounts for this difference, but it is interesting to note."}}
