","291d4b9b":"Air quality index (AQI) is a numerical scale used for reporting day to day air quality with regard to human health and the environment. The daily results of the index are used to convey to the public an estimate of air pollution level. An increase in air quality index signifies increased air pollution and severe threats to human health. In most cases, AQI indicates how clear or polluted the air in our surrounding is, and the associated health risks it might present. The AQI centers on the health effects that may be experienced within a few days or hours after breathing polluted air.\n\nAQI calculations focus on major air pollutants including: particulate matter, ground-level ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Particulate matter and ozone pollutants pose the highest risks to human health and the environment. For each of these air pollutant categories, different countries have their own established air quality indices in relation to other nationally set air quality standards for public health protection.\nBut in our data, we have data about PM10, NO, NOx, NH3, Benzene, Toluene and Xylene also, which are also considered equally hazardous to our health.\nNow we will start our analysis.","94895890":"For the year 2019","ffa907f6":"**Now we will try to see the correlation of variables PM2.5, NO2, SO2, PM10, NOx and O3 with AQI with the help of scatter plot, and we will do it for all the different cities.**","776e02d8":"The below plot is for the variable AQI and NOx","bce506e8":"In the below plot, we are trying to see the frequencies of the different categories of the variable AQI_Bucket.","e5755684":"Now we will check how many missing values are there in each column.","28795ddb":"The below is scatter plot between AQI and PM2.5 for different cities.","ba0c6e3e":"For the year 2018","eb362e98":"The below heatmap is showing the mean value of different air pollutants in different cities, it is for comparison purpose for different cities, and it is for all the years.
