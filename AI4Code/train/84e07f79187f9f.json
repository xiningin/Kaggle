Determining Least Significant Variable by P-Value\n\nIf the base model gives 0.7 R2 score and the model without a feature gives 0.75 R2 score, we cannot conclude that feature makes the difference, as the score may vary in another trial; in 10 trials the R2 score might change in +\/- 0.05. However, if model only varies in +\/- 0.01, we can then say that removing a feature made the model better.\n\nOur null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two samples of R2 scores.\n\nP-value is the probability that you would arrive at the same results as the null hypothesis. One of the most commonly used p-value is 0.05. If the calculated p-value turns out to be less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is considered to be false, or nullified (hence the name null hypothesis). And if the value is greater than 0.05, the null hypothesis is considered to be true.\n\nFor a feature, a small p-value indicates that it is unlikely we will observe a relationship between the predictor (feature) and response (salary in our case) variables due to chance.\n\nThus, we start with all features. We compute the P-values. We eliminate frature with highest p-value until p-values of all features reach below threshold: 0.05. \n\n![Determining Least Significant Variable by P-Value](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*Jub_nEYtN0htxFpTRzRtBQ.png)\n\n","43adc8e1":"* High overlap -> It does not affect placement status much\n* More \"Not Placed\" on percentage 50-70 range and more placed on 80% percentage range","84a7214d":"**This feature surprisingly does not affect placements and salary much**","fbb99e4d":"* Percentage does not seem to affect salary.\n* Commerce&Mgmt students occasionally get dream placements with high salary","be9ca587":"### Feature: workex (Work Experience)\n#### Does Work Experience affect placements?"}}
