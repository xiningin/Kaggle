We'll use the heuristic of picking all characters that have at least 100 dialog lines.","f5ceac4b":"So let's go ahead and tag those lines accordingly.","929dabe5":"The dataset agrees.\n\nNow let's look at how the lines are spread across the seasons. ","a574924e":"### Meta features\n\nWe'll look at a couple of typical meta features used in NLP: `word_count` and `mean_word_length`.\nBoth of these will be calculated per Dialog line, so for each record in our dataset.","5d9f7781":"### Distribution of character lines\n\nFirst, let's look at the characters involved in the show, according to this dataset.","36ec4733":"Interestingly, the dataset shows only 4 episodes for Season 1, although there should be 5, including the pilot (which we already saw marked as S01E01).\nSure enough, there are only 4 distinct SEIDs in Season 1.","11bbd508":"## NLP\n\nNext, let's try to do some more classical NLP.","a1cb861d":"### Let's look at some simple stats","893e5900":"Now we're seeing quite a lot of episodinc characters. This really shows how much the show pretty much just revolved around the 4 main characters throughout.","de2cf6ed":"In this kernel, I want to explore the Seinfeld scripts dataset.\nLet's have a look at the data we're dealing with here.","6a2b6067":"So the scripts consist of character lines, one line per CSV record, in order. The episode information is present in the **SEID** and **Season** columns, but if you have a look at more lines than I display here, there seems to be no indication of when the scenes change.","77942162":"There are a handfull of records with null dialogues and odd words\/sentences in the **Character** column. It is probably safe to just go ahead and delete those.","ce157e91":"This distribution is not so surprising given that the first seasons had a smaller number of episodes. Let's see the exact numbers.","01b5be87":"We've already seen that the dataset consists of 54606 character lines. Let's try to break those down a bit and learn a few basic facts about our dataset. The **Seinfeld** series ran for 9 seasons.","7c53372d":"So that gives us on average this many lines per episode (broken down per season):","9f53c39c":"So what's happening here? Well, as it turns out, both the pilot and the first episode after it are marked as S01E01. Here's some evidence:","fe4445bb":"Clearly, this is not the cleanest of data columns. This is something we'll have to keep in mind and look at Character entries that have multiple appearences when doing further analysis.\n\nNext, let's have a look at the distribution of lines across different characters. We will make use of this helper function:","c2dcf28e":"We can fix this by finding the end of the pilot and marking the first entries in the dataset as belonging to it. After some reading around, it looks like the pilot ends at line 210 (right after Jerry's monologue about not understanding women).\n","f8ed4f2e":"### Dealing with missing data\nAs a next step, let's check if the dataset contains any null values.","a9c25ab6":"And now we are left with 54606 lines across all seasons.","a1a532de":"Nothing too surprising here, but worth noting the `[Setting`, which is a bit of a special \"character\" that makes a lot of appearences.\n\nLet's see some examples of this kind of lines.","b35084c0":"Got the idea.\n\nNext, let's try breaking down the character lines per season."}}
