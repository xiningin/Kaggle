It contains a large amount of information about the biological function of proteins derived from the research literature.[source: Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/UniProt)\n\n**Why is this protein list important to current COVID-19 Dataset?**\n\nInorder to gather the information about the biomolecular mechanism from the scientific literature (COVID-19 Dataset), one need to have the list of associated Proteins, Genes, Pathways, Drugs etc. This notebook presents the steps to gather Corona Virus associated proteins, Gene names and associated Pathways from Uniprot database. These lits could be useful to look at the textual documents for further NLP processing and to present the entity relationship.","baf10ab0":"### 1.
