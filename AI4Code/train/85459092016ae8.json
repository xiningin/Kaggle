They suffered from the worldwide great depression before WW2, at this time, the income, profit, taxes are decreased seriously, so this generation experienced economic and social turmoil.\n\nDid this kind of social impact affect the suicide rate of G.I. generation? Compare to the Silent generation after 2000, the suicide rate is not that high. \n\nInterestingly, the suicide rate of Generation X and Millenials increase step by step. Besides, the suicide rate increases rapidly once the average age of generation is over 20. Does it mean that the suicide rate of young persons rise when they are independent of their parents? In other words, healthy family is helpful to the suicide rate. Let's take a look.","6407f9f3":"Then we replace the keys of dictionary with alpha3 country code.","115964d6":"Lots of countries' suicide rate are negatively high related to gdp_per_capita, but there are some countries have opposite outcome.

The suicide rate is highly correlated to the gdp_per_capita of top10 countries. Let's find out whether others have the same trend. \n","94256d28":"What's going on with old people in Korea!? After 2000, the suicide rate of people over 75 years old is almost double. Was Korea society not friendly to the old people or the enviroment depressed the old people? As we mentioned early, age is a factor of high suicide rate. A country should setup social welfare to take care of old people just in case.\n\nOn the other hand, the rate of people whose age is over 24 are growing after 1992. This phenomenon reflects the increasing burden on society, like salary,  academic pressure, family and so on.","3001f9ef":"From this image we can see that the gdp_per_capita has no differece during 1990 to 2000. In other words, the economic situation were remain stagnant and  some countries got worse until 2002, after 2005, all countries' gdp start growing. \n\nWe also know that the whole gdp_per_capita dropped within 2008 because of the financial crisis.  However, these ratio were still better than that before 2000. To see the relationship between suicide rate and gdp_per_capita, we plot the regression plot of two parameters. ","f4bda3bc":"Merge two dataframe together.","fff7a842":"## Conclusion\nIn general, the suicide rate is related to several factors. First, national GDP per person. We have seen that the suicide rate in many countries is highly correlated with the gdp of the whole country, which shows that the degree of national wealth has a certain degree of reduction in suicide rate.\n\nSecond, the age. According to the suicide rate of each level of age, the rate of elderly is higher, so young people should care more about the elderly. Moreover, the country welfare of the elderly may also impact the rate.\n\nThird, the social pressure. A healthy society can make citizens feel safe and satisfied, so how to relieve the social pressure becomes a significant topic for every country. Our purpose is not only reduce the suicide rate but also to build a better world.","5c9690ee":"Double check country name if the name in country list are not the same.

In addition, the rate in others are still high during 1990 to 2000. The transition to the economy and democracy in former Soviet Union countries may be the main reasons. Although there have been numerous studies of the increase in mortality, such as alcoholism, economic hardship, despression and so on, but there is still no one accepted as the most significant factor of the mortality crisis. Let's find out."}}
