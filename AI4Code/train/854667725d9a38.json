It is because the whole dataset with label is available online (one copy available [on Kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jannesklaas\/disasters-on-social-media)). You can find the correct label of our test set so you can achieve perfect score.\n\nIn such case, the ranking on public leaderboard is meaningless. The good news is, you can now focus on learning NLP and modelling skills with this dataset, instead of fighting for higher position on the leaderboard!\n\n(Reference: [szelee's notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/szelee\/a-real-disaster-leaked-label\/notebook))"}}
