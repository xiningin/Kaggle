MiddleHighHigh and policy = 3 combo. Should we be worried?\n\nWhen it comes to sample size estimation we need to tread carefully. The effect size is small here, which means we need decent samples in both sets of data. And by decent I mean we can calculate how many observations should be in each group.\n\nLet us say that we hypothesize that there is a higher fatality rate in countries who never had a universal BCG policy than their counterparts who do have a universal one. A test of hypothesis will be conducted to compare fatality rates of the countries who never had a universal BCG policy with the countries who did. If we deem that a 3 fold increase would be clinically meaningful(from 3% (the average in those countries with universal policy and who are IncomeLevel = 3 or 4)  to 9% (Italy for instance)) then how many countries should be enrolled in the study to ensure that the power of the test is 80% to detect this difference in the groups? A two sided test will be used with a 5% level of significance.  \n\nWe first compute the effect size by substituting the proportions of cases in each group who are expected to pass away from the disease, p1=0.09 (i.e., 0.03*3.0=0.09) and p2=0.03 and the overall proportion, p=0.06 (i.e., (0.09+0.03)\/2):","e0c73a09":"What we can also do is run the same graph by IncomeLevel.

Countries were divided in three categories: low income (L) with an annual income of 1,025 dollars or less, lower middle income with an income between 1,026 and 3,995 dollars, and middle high and high income countries, which included countries with annual incomes over 3,996 dollars.\"","698da7e4":"And so now we can calculate the column:\n\nCaseFatalityRate (cfr, in %) = TotalFatalities \/ TotalConfirmedCases","e2fba698":"Right off the bat BCG policy = 3 (which translates to never having had a universal one) is visibly higher ito case fatality rate.
