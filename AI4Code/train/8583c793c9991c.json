To flesh out the different steps of what happens in a ResNet's identity block, here is an alternative diagram showing the individual steps:\n\n<img src=\"images\/idblock2_kiank.png\" style=\"width:650px;height:150px;\">\n<caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> **Figure 3** <\/u><font color='purple'>  : **Identity block.** Skip connection \"skips over\" 2 layers. <\/center><\/caption>\n\nThe upper path is the \"shortcut path.\" The lower path is the \"main path.\" In this diagram, we have also made explicit the CONV2D and ReLU steps in each layer.

You will learn how to build very deep convolutional networks, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by [He et al.](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1512.03385.pdf), allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.\n\n**In this assignment, you will:**\n- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets. \n- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.

Please go ahead and submit your assignment; to check correctness, the online grader will run your code only for a small number of epochs as well.","b6feb8ad":"## 2.2 - The convolutional block\n\nThe ResNet \"convolutional block\" is the second block type. You can use this type of block when the input and output dimensions don't match up. The difference with the identity block is that there is a CONV2D layer in the shortcut path: \n\n<img src=\"images\/convblock_kiank.png\" style=\"width:650px;height:150px;\">\n<caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> **Figure 4** <\/u><font color='purple'>  : **Convolutional block** <\/center><\/caption>\n\n* The CONV2D layer in the shortcut path is used to resize the input $x$ to a different dimension, so that the dimensions match up in the final addition needed to add the shortcut value back to the main path. (This plays a similar role as the matrix $W_s$ discussed in lecture.) \n* For example, to reduce the activation dimensions's height and width by a factor of 2, you can use a 1x1 convolution with a stride of 2. \n* The CONV2D layer on the shortcut path does not use any non-linear activation function. Its main role is to just apply a (learned) linear function that reduces the dimension of the input, so that the dimensions match up for the later addition step. \n\nThe details of the convolutional block are as follows. \n\nFirst component of main path:\n- The first CONV2D has $F_1$ filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (s,s). Its padding is \"valid\" and its name should be `conv_name_base + '2a'`. Use 0 as the `glorot_uniform` seed.\n- The first BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '2a'`.\n- Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters. \n\nSecond component of main path:\n- The second CONV2D has $F_2$ filters of shape (f,f) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is \"same\" and it's name should be `conv_name_base + '2b'`.  Use 0 as the `glorot_uniform` seed.\n- The second BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '2b'`.\n- Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters. \n\nThird component of main path:\n- The third CONV2D has $F_3$ filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is \"valid\" and it's name should be `conv_name_base + '2c'`.  Use 0 as the `glorot_uniform` seed.\n- The third BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '2c'`. Note that there is no ReLU activation function in this component. \n\nShortcut path:\n- The CONV2D has $F_3$ filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (s,s). Its padding is \"valid\" and its name should be `conv_name_base + '1'`.  Use 0 as the `glorot_uniform` seed.\n- The BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis.  Its name should be `bn_name_base + '1'`. \n\nFinal step: \n- The shortcut and the main path values are added together.\n- Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters. \n    \n**Exercise**: Implement the convolutional block. We have implemented the first component of the main path; you should implement the rest.

In recent years, neural networks have become deeper, with state-of-the-art networks going from just a few layers (e.g., AlexNet) to over a hundred layers.\n\n* The main benefit of a very deep network is that it can represent very complex functions. It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the shallower layers, closer to the input) to very complex features (at the deeper layers, closer to the output). \n* However, using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively slow. \n* More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backprop from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and \"explode\" to take very large values). \n* During training, you might therefore see the magnitude (or norm) of the gradient for the shallower layers decrease to zero very rapidly as training proceeds: ","db2316e6":"Run the following cell to train your model on 2 epochs with a batch size of 32.
