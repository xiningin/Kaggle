To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **scatter plots** to understand patterns in the data.\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou work for a major candy producer, and your goal is to write a report that your company can use to guide the design of its next product.  Soon after starting your research, you stumble across this [very interesting dataset](https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking\/) containing results from a fun survey to crowdsource favorite candies.\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.","9f6eae31":"## Keep going\n\nExplore **[histograms and density plots](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/distributions)**.","69faf1db":"The questions below will give you feedback on your work. Run the following cell to set up our feedback system.","5260034c":"The dataset contains 83 rows, where each corresponds to a different candy bar.  There are 13 columns:\n- `'competitorname'` contains the name of the candy bar. \n- the next **9** columns (from `'chocolate'` to `'pluribus'`) describe the candy.  For instance, rows with chocolate candies have `\"Yes\"` in the `'chocolate'` column (and candies without chocolate have `\"No\"` in the same column).\n- `'sugarpercent'` provides some indication of the amount of sugar, where higher values signify higher sugar content.\n- `'pricepercent'` shows the price per unit, relative to the other candies in the dataset.\n- `'winpercent'` is calculated from the survey results; higher values indicate that the candy was more popular with survey respondents.\n\nUse the first five rows of the data to answer the questions below.","282cc265":"## Step 1: Load the Data\n\nRead the candy data file into `candy_data`.  Use the `\"id\"` column to label the rows.","09436a8c":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
