He wanted to serve burgers, buns, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama. To achieve this, he chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for McDonald\u2019s but for themselves, together with McDonald\u2019s. Many of McDonald\u2019s most famous menu items \u2013 like the Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and Egg McMuffin \u2013 were created by franchisees.\n\n##### Content\nThis dataset provides a nutrition analysis of every menu item on the US McDonald's menu, including breakfast, beef burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches, fries, salads, soda, coffee and tea, milkshakes, and desserts.\n\n##### Acknowledgement\nThe menu items and nutrition facts were scraped from the McDonald's website.\n\n##### Inspiration\nHow many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain? How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake? Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value?
