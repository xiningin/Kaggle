To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks.  The positional encodings have the same dimension $d_{\\text{model}}$ as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed.   There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [(cite)](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1705.03122.pdf). \n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n$$PE_{(pos,2i)} = sin(pos \/ 10000^{2i\/d_{\\text{model}}})$$\n\n$$PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = cos(pos \/ 10000^{2i\/d_{\\text{model}}})$$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \nwhere $pos$ is the position and $i$ is the dimension.  That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid.  The wavelengths form a geometric progression from $2\\pi$ to $10000 \\cdot 2\\pi$.  We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{pos+k}$ can be represented as a linear function of $PE_{pos}$. \n\nIn addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks.
