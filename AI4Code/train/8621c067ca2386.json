Innings pitched can be the same as the projected stats.","b1de9ba2":"The 2021 Giants baseball team was expected to finish in third place in the National League West division. Instead, they are in first place. The goal of this project is to take a look at the projected statistics for the hitters and pitchers on the team and compare them to the actual stats from the 2021 season. By looking at the numbers, some insight can possibly be found into why the team is better than expected.","9887c9f4":"OPS could be a good indicator of how well the Giants batters are playing. We can plot the projected OPS and the actual OPS for each player that appears in both the projected stats and the actual stats dataframes.","b38e11e3":"To get the stats for only the Giants hitters, use the Team column to select \"SFG\" as the team. Keep only hitters who have more than 100 projected at bats to try limit the analysis to only statisically significant players. Remove columns that are not of interest and players who did not actually play for the team in 2021.","667c5234":"For pitchers, ERA and WHIP may be good stats to look at to evaulate performance.","5181e145":"Based on domain knowledge, the players who are outperforming their projected OPS are the more veteran players.

We can also check the ages of the pitchers to see if pitchers that are certain ages are outperforming their projected stats better than others.","9fae25f1":"In conclusion, it seems like the reason the team is better than expected is a combination of veteran players playing better than expected combined with all of the pitchers regardless of age on the team outplaying their projected statistics.","b57bdb70":"There does not seem to be a connection between age and performance for the pitchers.
