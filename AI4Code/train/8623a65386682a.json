It means they don't need help as much as schools of group1.  \n2. For race\/ethnical distribution, based on the independent t-test, we found that there exists significant differences in \"Percent Black\" and \"Percent Hispanic\" between the two groups. Schools in group2 have a greater percentage of Black students and a smaller percentage of Hispanic students.  \n3. Schools in group2 have better performance on all of the 6 evaluation indexes on average, including Rigorous Instruction %, Collaborative Teachers %, Supportive Environment %, Effective School Leadership %, Strong Family-Community Ties % and Trust %. It means that they have better environment and facilities for studying.  \n4.
