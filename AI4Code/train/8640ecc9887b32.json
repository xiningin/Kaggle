Log Transform**\n\n*The best approach is using the log transform. But log transform cannot be used for data having negative or 0 values. Since, log of 0 and negative numbers are not defined. Let us check if the CRIM dataset contains such values.*","b8ecac21":"*The skewness of the new transformed variable is ~ 2.024 which is not better than what we obtained in the log transform. Let us plot the graph and observe the newly transformed variable.*","9a219585":"*As we can see the minimum value present in the 'CRIM' feature is 0.00632. So we can perform our log transformation.*\n\n*We will make use of the numpy library to perform log transform.*","24e9140b":"**3. Box Cox Transform**\n\n*Box Cox Transform is one of the powerful transformations that can be used when the dataset is skewed provided the values are positive real numbers.*\n\n*We will make use of the scipy library to transform the feature into a box cox transformation.*","ef28b5f0":"**2. Square Root Transform**\n\n*The square root transform isn't the best option but it has an advantage over the log transform that it can accept 0 values.
