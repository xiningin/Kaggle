The variables are: \n\n* species\n    * Defines Species of mammals\n    * dtype: string \n    \n\n* body_wt\n    * Total body weight of the mammal (in kg)\n    * dtype: float\n    \n\n* brain_wt\n    * Brain weight of the mammal (in kg)\n    * dtype: float\n    \n    \n* non_dreaming\n    * Number of hours of non dreaming sleep\n    * dtype: float\n    \n    \n* dreaming\n    * Number of hours of dreaming sleep\n    * dtype: float\n    \n    \n* total_sleep\n    * Total number of hours of sleep\n    * dtype: float\n    \n    \n* life_span\n    * Life span (in years)\n    * dtype: float\n    \n    \n* gestation\n    * Gestation time (in days)\n    * dtype: categorical\n    \n    \n* predation\n    * An index of how likely the mammal is to be preyed upon. \n    * 1 = least likely to be preyed upon and 5 = most likely to be preyed upon.\n    * dtype: categorical\n    \n    \n* exposure\n    * An index of the how exposed the mammal is during sleep. \n    * 1 = least exposed (e.g., sleeps in a well-protected den) abd  5 = most exposed.\n    * dtype: float\n    \n    \n* danger\n    * An index of how much danger the mammal faces from other animals.

It is really good to practice and make some EDA. I hope you will enjoy to do so. As remarks and findings:\n\n* In dangered animals sleep less.\n* Exposured animals sleep less.\n* There is no correlation between body weight or brain weight with sleeping hours directly.\n* Human kind has longest life span with less danger and a balanced sleeping time.\n* Sleeping more brings dreaming too.","457ce55e":"* There is no correlation between body weight and sleeping hours or brain weight and sleeping hours.","9244c210":"* Life is tough for the in danger animals.

If a mammal's danger category is high, which means in danger while sleeping to get attacked by preditors, the sleeping hours are less. The animals like Cow, Donkey , Goat, Horse, Roe deer, Sheep are most in danger and less sleeping ones. They sleep like one eye open. Elephants are in middle danger but has less sleep too, there must be another indicator to make this happen ( it is exposure, since they are enormous to hide while sleep ).\n\n* Exposure is another important parameter for sleeping hours. If a mammal is visible while it is sleeping, it means it is more likely open to attacks from preditors. Like elephants, they are so huge and live as familes thus they are an open target for preditors while they are sleeping. Furthermore, the mammals like goat, horse, cow, donkey, horse, sheep, roe deer are the most exposure ones. This leads to less sleep. Even  though the rabit is visible, it has a middle level sleeping.\n\n* Predition is seems like not really related to sleeping hours. Even some of the animals are sleeping much they do not predited. The reason behind that can be, they are sleeping in caves, under ground or in the trees etc.","d4f0a59a":"## $\\color{Pink}{\\text{Chapter 2. EDA}}$ <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter2\"><\/a>"}}
