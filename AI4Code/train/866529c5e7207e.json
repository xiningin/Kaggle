Here, we can tell that the seller can expect most of the orders to be small quantity with the rare occasion that a bulk order is made. ","c1aa7ffb":"A boxplot is a ay to visualize the distribution of the data. Here we can observe that most of the order quantity are rather skewed. Calculating the average quantity per order for each product type could be misleading and may lead the seller to overestimate the inventory needed for each order. Hence, the use of median would be more appropriate.","9f7eca24":"As you can see, the monthly total orders have been quite consistent in the first 10 months it averages about 100 orders per month. The total orders start to pick up October onwards and peak in December before declining signficantly back to the average level in January. Likewise, the gross and total sales averages about 8k-10k per month before picking up October onwards and peak in Nov\/Dec with an average of 15k. \n\nHowever, in 2019, the trend has changed a little. There are two peaks, one in March and another in December. In March, the gross and total sales is about 30% higher than the average sales of 10k and in November and December, the sales are about 100% and 130% higher than the average sales of 15k.\n\nThe average shipping cost per order has been steadily increasing. In 2019, the average shipping cost is between 15 to 20 as compared to the average ahipping cost of 10 to 15 in 2017. Despite that, the average returns and discount per order has been increasing and outweights the increase in shipping cost. That would explain why average sales per order has been at the all time low in 2019 especially in the second half of 2019. The The average gross and total sales per order have typically hover in the range 75-125 and 100-150 respectively.\n","da22739e":"Here we can see that discounts can go up to 25% and are usually between 0% to 10%. The discount rate is determined by the seller, so there is not much to study here. The more important thing to study is the returns rate.","c393bd6d":"There isn't an obvious relationship between returns and discounts rate for these product types. It seems to be totally random and the returns is not dependent on the discounts rate. The seller will need to deep dive and have a better look at the returned items to identify the reason. The sales could be much higher if the goods are not returned.","740db9c0":"# 4. What is the range of discounts and returns for each product type","0d295a62":"Basket, Art & Sculpture, Jewelry and Home Decor are the top 4 product type (out of 24) that contribute over 80% of your total net sales. Also, we can see that these 4 product types are some of the product types that generate the most sales per order as well.\n\nHowever, it is unknown whether the these 4 product types are the same products for each of the 3 years. Moreover, with the lack of data, I cannot determine whether these top 4 product types are due to the surge in sales in November and December. To do so, the timestamp of the orders are needed to enhance the analysis.\n\nIf these 4 product types are the same throughout the entire year, the seller should focus more effort on generating more orders and sales for these products.","7f8497af":"# 2.

Is there a relationship between discounts rate and returns rate?\n\nSuch relationships are investigated for Arts & Sculpture, Basket, Home Decor, Jewelry and Kitchen as these products have high returns rate","ed7322f1":"Here, we can observe that most orders for most product types are typically 0%. However, products that are often returned are the Arts & Sculpture, Basket, Home Decor, Jewelry and Kitchen. The rest of the product types are not typically returned. The seller will need to take a deeper look into these few product types to identify the reason these products are returned, especially the top 4 products that generate 80% of the total net sales.","b5d6f066":"Based on the two datasets, I could answer a few questions:\n\n1. What is the average value per order in terms of sales, disounts and returns for each month\n1. What product types contribute 80% of the sales\n1. What is the typical volume per order by product type\n1. What is the range of discounts and returns for each product type\n1. Is there a relationship between discounts rate and returns rate?\n\nHowever, there isn't a way to link both datasets together. Without that connection, I would not be able to answer a few questions:\n1. Without the order ID, I would not be able to identify what product type is typically ordered with another product type. This could help the seller to identify what product bundle could be created for sales.\n1. Without a timestamp, I would not be able to identify whether is there a trend to the monthly product profile.\n1. Without a timestamp, it is not possible to identify the expected sales for the year 2020 (if coronovirus is not around) and what level of inventory should be kept for each month."}}
