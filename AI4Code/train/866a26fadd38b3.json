At this point the savvy practitional will distinguish between calibration and cross-validation results. This is an important point, we'll make short digression to cover it.\n\n# Calibration and cross-validation\nIn teh example above, we build a linear regression between the variables Xreg and y. Loosely speaking we build a linear relation between principal components etracted from spectroscopic data and the corresponding Brix values of each sample. So we expect that, if we have done a good job, we should be able to predict th evlue of Brix in other samples not included in our calibration.\n\nFirst, how do we know if we've done a good job? The metrics we use are the coefficient of deterination (or R^2) and the mean squared error. The ideas goes like this. With the regr.fit(Xreg, y) command we genrate the coefficients fo the lienar fit (slop m and itnercept 1). With the `y_c = regr.predit(Xreg)` command we can thenuse these coefficiewnts to 'predict' the new values `yc = mXreg + q` of the Brix given the input spectroscopy data. %R^2% tells us how well $y_c$ correlate with y (Ideally we want $r^2$ to be as close as possible to 1). MSE is the meansquared deviation of the $yc$ with respect to $y$ in the units of y, so in our case MSE will be measured in Bx.\n\nOK, here's the issue. If we take the same data used for the fit and use it again for the prediction, we run the risk of reproducing magnificiently our calibration set, but not being able to preduct any future measurement. This is what data scientists call \"overfitting\".\n\nIn order to make predictions we want to be able to handle future (unknown) data with good accuracy. For that, we would ideally need an independent set of spectroscopy data, often referred to as valiation data. If we do not have an indepdnent validation set, th enext best thing is to split our input data into calibration and cross-validation sets. Only the calibration data are used to build the regression model. The corss-validation data are then used as (hopefully) independent set to verify the predictive value of our model.\n\n# Building the calibration model","34b8c87f":"The green line represents the ideal, 100%, correlation between measured and predicted values. The blue line is the actual correlation. With $R^2 = 0.43$ the result is obviously not great, and a number of other things are required to improve this figure. Things about multiplicative scatter correlation and feature selection are often used to improve the prediction. At the same time, the main limitation of the PCR approach (the fact the PCA is done without knowledge of the y values) also plays a big role in the final results.\n\nNote also that we added the information about the [Residual Predictive Deviation information (RPD)](https:\/\/rdrr.io\/cran\/chillR\/man\/RPD.html). RPD is defined as the standard deviation of the observed values (how varies the y values are) divided by the root means squared error prediction (RMSEP). The RDP takes both prediction error and the variation of the observed (actual) values into account, providign a metric of model validaity that is more objective than the RMSEP and more easily comparable across model validation studies. The greater the RPD, the better the model's predictive capacity.\n\nTypically better results can be obtained with Partial Least Squares (PLS).\n\n","dd1895e3":"# Principal Component Regression for NIR calibration\nLearned from: https:\/\/nirpyresearch.com\/principal-component-regression-python\/\nWe want to build calibration for Brix using NIR spectra from 50 fresh peaches. Each spectrum is composed of 601 data points. To build the calibration we are going to correlate somehow the spectrum of each peach (no pun intended) with its value of Brix measured independently with another method. As you can see already, we are going to reduce 601 data points to a single parameters! That means in practice one never needs this many points. Just a few would be sufficient.\n\nBut which variables are the one that are significant to describe Bri variation? Well, we don't know that in advance, and that is why we are going to use PCA to sort things out. PCA is going to reduce the dimensionality of our data space, getting rid of all the variables (data points) that are highly correlated with one another. In practice we will reduce 601 dimensions to a much lower number, often a few, or even just two, dimensions.\n\nWith PCA we can establish that different pieces of fruit may have different Brix value, but we won't be able to build a model that is able to predict Brix values from future measurements. The reason is that PCA makes no use whatsoever of the additional information we may have, namely the independent data of Brix measured with a different instrument. In order to use the additional information we need to go from a classification problem to a regression problem. Enters PCR.\n\n# Python implementation of Principal Component Regression\nTo put it very simply, PCR is a two-step process:\n1. Run PCA on our data to decompose the independent variables into 'principal components', corresponding to removing correlated components\n2. Select a subset of the principal components and run a regression against the calibration values\n\nIn the apparent simplicty of PCR lies also its . main limitataion.Using PCA to extract the principal components in step 1 is done disregarding whichever information we may have on the calibration values. PCA is 'plug and play' technique. It spits out some result regardless of the nature of the inptu data, or its underlying statistics. In other words, PCA is very simple, but sometimes may be wrong.\n\nThese limiataions are inherited by PCR, in the sense that principal components found by PCA may not be the optimal ones for the regression we want to run. This problem is alleviated by Partial Least Square Regression (PLS) which we will discuss in the future. For the moent, let's leverage the simplicty of PCR to understand the basic of the regressio problem, and hopefully enjoy builidng same simple calibration model of our own in Python.","33ec5bf7":"Note that in the last step, after running only `pc` number of components is selected. this will be clear in a bit, when we'll put the whole thing in a standalone function","fc2c7c87":"It seems in both $R^2$ and MSE that number of components as 6 is the best.","45763237":"These are the absorbance spectra of our 50 samples. As mentioned, we divide the PCR problem in two steps. The first is to run PCA on the input data. Before that, we have two processing steps. The first is quite commmon in NIR spectroscopy: take the first derivative of the absorbance data. The second is a staple of PCA: standardize the features to sbustract the mean and reduce to unit variance."}}
