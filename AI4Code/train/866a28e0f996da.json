This feature is positively correlated to Price as number of rooms increase , the price of the house will obviously increase.\n\n2) LSTAT - % of lower status of the population. This feature is negatively correlated to Price. The greater the value of LSTAT, the lesser the value of 'MEDV'. The reasoning is with the increase in the percentage of \"lower class\" homeowners in the neighbourhood, there can be a rise in the the crime rate in the neighbourhood hence the housing prices can become low. Also, Elite real estate owners may not build homes in that region as the people in and around would not be able to buy them. Hence houses in such a region will be cheaper.\n\n3) PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town.The lesser the value of PTRATIO, the more will be the value of 'MEDV'. This feature is negatively co-related to price. Regions with a low PTRATIO will have higher prices for houses as this is more desirable for students to get better attention from teachers and impacts the education of the students.","23ec386c":"# Decision Tree Regressor","0e464a44":"# Motivation - Keep Learning Until you get it Right :)","bb9f7b19":"# Lets start to split the data for Training and Testing purposes ","c31a9766":"# Correlation Matrix","20f657b1":"# Overview\nThe Boston housing dataset has been widely used in regression analysis since the 1970\u2019s..!!
