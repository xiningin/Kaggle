machine learning: training an algorithm to predict the target from the features. We'll start off with a basic model - Linear Regression - only using a few features and then move on to a more complex models and more features. There is reason to believe that for this problem, even a simple linear model will perform well because of the strong linear correlation of the distances with the fare. We generally want to use the simplest - and hence most interpretable - model that is above an accuracy threshold (dependent on the application) so if a linear model does the job, there's no need to use a highly complex ensemble model. It's a best practice to start out with a simple model for just this reason! \n\n\n## First Model: Linear Regression\n\nThe first model we'll make is a simple linear regression using 3 features: the `abs_lat_diff`, `abs_lon_diff`, and `passenger_count`. This is meant to serve as a baseline for us to beat.\n\nIt's good to start with a simple model because it will give you a baseline. Also, if a simple model works well enough, then there may be no need for more complex models. If a linear regression will get the job done, then you don't need a neural network!","ef7cf414":"This time we don't see any extreme predictions as we saw with the first linear regression. The random forest tends to not produce outlying predictions because the voting of the trees means that any single tree that estimates an extreme value will be balanced by the other predictions. \n\nLet's look at the 3 predictions the original simple linear regression estimated as over \\$100.","dd321cf7":"# Data Exploration and Data Cleaning\n\nI often do data exploration and cleaning simulataneously. As I explore the data and find outlying values or errors, I correct them or make a note to follow up later. Data cleaning usually involves domain knowledge (if applicable), statistical descriptions, as well as intuition from working on similar problems. A good place for learning about a problem is the Kaggle discussions boards and other kernels for a competition. \n\n\n### Examine the Target Variable\n\nFor a first graphical exploration, we can look at the distribution of the `fare_amount`, the target variable we want to train a model to predict. We'll use seaborn's `distplot` which shows both a kernel density estimate plot and a histogram.","afbf19ca":"The random forest does considerably better once we use the time features! As with the distance features, this should give us confidence that the new predictor variables we built are useful.\n\nJust for comparison, we can go back to the linear regression and look at the performance.","cd6ea25e":"None of these graphs are very decisive. One interesting thing to note is the horizontal bars at different fare amounts. This suggests there may be certain routes that always have the same fare amount. We explored the fare distribution earlier, but it might be a good idea to revisit the abnormalities in the fares.","8d6e55c0":"There is a very clearly relationship between the fare bin and the average distance of the trip! This should give us confidence that this feature will be useful to a model.","41fa5705":"Most of the rides are concentrated in Manhattan and it looks like there are more rides ending outside Manhattan than inside. I'm not sure we'll be able to use this for modeling though.\n\nTo see if there is a difference in locations based on the fare, we map each fare bin to a different color and then plot.","3c8a59c9":"## Explore Time Variables\n\nWe now have a ton of time-variables to explore! First, let's ask the question if fares have increased over time. To do this, we can plot the `time_elapsed` versus the fare.","1ac83d55":"# Upgraded Model\n\nWhen we want to improve performance, we generally have a few options:\n\n1. Get more data - either more observations or more variables\n2. Engineer more \/ better features\n3. Perform feature selection to remove irrelevant features\n4. Try a more complex model\n5. Perform hyperparameter tuning of the selected model\n\nWe already saw that including another feature could improve perfomance. For now let's move past the features and focus on the model (we'll come back to features later).\n\nThe simple linear regression has no hyperparameters to optimize (no settings to tune) so we'll try approach 4. If the more complex model does well, we can use it for testing additional features or performing feature selection\n\n## Non-Linear Model: Random Forest\n\nFor a first non-linear model, we'll use the [Random Forest](https:\/\/medium.com\/p\/77bf308a9b76?source=user_profile---------3------------------) regressor. This is a powerful ensemble of regression trees that has good performance and generalization ability because of its low variance. We'll use most of the default hyperparameters but change the `n_estimators` and the `max_depth` of each tree in the forest. For the features, we'll use the four features which delivered good performance in the linear regression.","291d32dc":"Wow! The random forest and the linear regression significantly disagree. This brings up another point: one option we have for modeling is to combine the predictions of multiple models. Oftentimes, averaging the predictions of multiple models will result in better performance than either model by itself. Just for fun, let's try averaging the validation predictions of both models.","a05167a5":"Based on these values, we can remove outliers. This is somewhat based on intuition and there might be a more accurate process for carrying out this operation! Here is another potential point for improvement:\n\n* __Potential improvement 2: experiment with different methods to remove outliers.__ This could be through domain knowledge (such as using a map) or it could be using more rigorous statistical methods (such as z-scores).","01daca62":"### Naive Baseline\n\nTo make sure that machine learning is even applicable to the task, we should compare these predictions to a naive guess. For a regression task, this can be as simple as the average value of the target in the training data.","9b788f93":"## Use More Features\n\nWhile the first model scored well relative to the baseline, there is much room for improvement. As a first step, let's use one of the other features we created, the `haversine` distance.","2849a74f":"No fare information here! It's our job to predict the fare for each test ride.","45c10093":"At this point, our model is probably overfitting because we are using all the features, some of which are highly correlated with one another. One option for feature selection is to use only the most important features from the model. ","934fe750":"# Additional Feature Engineering\n\nWe saw that adding more features improves the performance of the model. A natural progression is therefore to use even more features! We have not made any use of the `pickup_datetime` which provides the precise moment of pickup and that's where we'll turn our attention to next. \n\n## Extract Datetime Information\n\nWe can write a simple function that extracts as much date and time information from a datetime as possible. This is adapted from the excellent fast.ai library, in particular, the structured module (available at https:\/\/github.com\/fastai\/fastai\/blob\/master\/fastai\/structured.py). I have made a few changes based on what's worked best for me in the past on time-series problems.","983f2017":"It appears that using more features helps the model! We can look at the feature importances to see which the model considers \"most relevant\".\n\n#### Feature Importances","977cb4ff":"We'll plot the pickup and dropoff separately to see the difference.","a53a6ca8":"The random forest does much better than the simple linear regression. This indicates that the problem is not completely linear, or at least is not linear in terms of the features we have constructed. From here going forward, we'll use the same random forest model because of the increased performance. \n\n#### Overfitting\n\nGiven the gap between the training and the validation score, we can see that our model is __overfitting__ to the training data.

This leads to another recommendation for improvement:\n\n* __Potential Improvement 4: Try searching for better random forest model hyperparameters__.

To capture both differences in a single variable, we can add up the two differences in latitude and longitude and also find the square root of the sum of differences squared. The former feature would be called the Manhattan distance - or l1 norm - and the latter is called the Euclidean distance - or l2 norm. Both of these distances are specific examples of the general Minkowski distance.\n\n## Manhattan and Euclidean Distance\n\nThe [Minkowski Distance](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minkowski_distance) between two points is expressed as:\n\n$${\\displaystyle D\\left(X,Y\\right)=\\left(\\sum _{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|^{p}\\right)^{1\/p}}$$\n\nif p = 1, then this is the Manhattan distance and if p = 2 this is the Euclidean distance. You may also see these referred to as the l1 or l2 norm where the number indicates p in the equation. \n\nI should point out that these equations are only valid for actual distances in a [cartesian coordinate system](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cartesian_coordinate_system) and here we only use them to find relative distances. To find the actual distances in terms of kilometers, we have to work with the latitude and longitude [geographical coordinate system](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geographic_coordinate_system). This will be done later using the Haversine formula.","1b04ff0f":"## Read in 5 million rows and examine data\n\nThroughout this notebook, we will work with only 5 million rows (out of 55 million).

However, there might be diminishing returns, and I sample the data here in order to train faster. The data file is randomly sorted by date, so taking the first 5 million rows is a random sample in terms of time. \n\nWhen we read in the data, we tell pandas to treat the `pickup_datetime` as a date. We will also drop the `key` since it is a unique identifier and does not tell us anything about the taxi trip. After reading in the data we'll remove any rows with `nan`  (observations with missing entries).

This appears to be the minimum fare, so any values in the training set less than this amount must be errors in data collection or entry.\n\nIll also remove any fares greater than $100. I'll justify this based on the limited number of fares outside this bounds, but it might be possible that including these values helps the model! I'd encourage you to try different values and see which works best.","111cb86c":"This function calculates a number of expected attributes:\n\n* Year\n* Month\n* Day\n* Day of Year\n* Day of Week\n\nWhen we have a time, additional variables can be calculated:\n\n* Hour \n* Minute \n* Second\n\nPandas also offers options for some more complex attributes like:\n\n* Is_month_end  \n* Is_month_start\n* Is_quarter_end\n* Is_quarter_start\n* Is_year_end\n* Is_year_start\n\nThese are more intended for financial analysis, but they may come in handy in other problems.

For more information on datetimes in Pandas, refer to [the documentation](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/timeseries.html).\n\n### Fractional Time Variables\n\nFinally, I add a number of other calculations that combine existing measures to create fractional variables:\n\n* Fractional time of day\n* Fractional time of week\n* Fractional time of month\n* Fractional time of year\n\nThese are all measured from 0 - 1 in units of whichever time period we are measuring on. The idea behind these variables is that they can take the place of several other time indicators. For example, instead of using the `Dayof week`, `Hour`, `Minute`, and `Second`, we can use the fractional time of the week to find out precisely when the observation takes place in the week.\n\nI have found that the fractional time variables work well in practice especially with non-linear models. When we use linear models, a good approach is [cyclical variable encoding](https:\/\/ianlondon.github.io\/blog\/encoding-cyclical-features-24hour-time\/) of time features, but I haven't found this to be necessary with non-linear models.

Feel free to use, adapt, and build on other's work! \n\n### Relative Distances in Latitude and Longitude\n\nAs a simple first step of feature engineering, we can find the absolute value of the difference in latitude and longitude between the `pickup` and `dropoff`. While this does not represent an actual distance (we would have to convert coordinate systems), it can be used as a relative comparison of the distances of taxi rides. As the cost of a taxi ride is proportional to duration or distance, we would expect the relative distances to be a useful measure for estimating the fare.

In this contest, the aim is to predict the fare of a taxi ride given the starting time, the starting and ending latitude \/ longitude, and the number of passengers. This is a __supervised regression__ machine learning task.\n\nIn this notebook, I'll provide you with a solid foundation and leave you with the challenge to better the score. Although the dataset is large, this is an approachable problem and as usual with Kaggle competitions, provides realistic practice for building a machine learning solution. The best way to learn is by doing, so let's work through a complete machine learning problem!\n\nGreat resources for Kaggle competitions are the [discussion forums](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction\/discussion) and the [kernels](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction\/kernels) completed by other data scientists.

Let's look at the average fare amount by the hour of day.","4f5a56f9":"# Calculate Distance between points using Haversine distance\n\nTo calculate a more realistic distance between the pickup and dropoff, we can use the [Haversine distance](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Haversine_formula). This is the Great Circle distance, representing the shortest distance along the surface of the Earth connecting two points taking into account the fact that the Earth is a sphere (or so I'm told). It's not the best measure because the taxis do not travel along lines, but it's more accurate in terms of an absolute distance than the Manhattan and Euclidean distances made from the absolute latitude and longitude difference. The Manhattan and Euclidean distances are relative and do not take into account the spherical shape of the Earth. \n\n(We could convert the latitude and longitude into cartesian coordinates after establishing an origin. One option would be to use the center of the Earth and another would be to use the average of all coordinates in the data as an origin. Then, once we converted the points in this coordinate system, we could use the Manhattan and Euclidean formulas to find distances between points in kilometers. These are all approximations because we can't find the actual street distance.)\n\nThe formula for Haversine distance is:\n\n$${\\displaystyle =2r\\arcsin \\left({\\sqrt {\\sin ^{2}\\left({\\frac {\\varphi _{2}-\\varphi _{1}}{2}}\\right)+\\cos(\\varphi _{1})\\cos(\\varphi _{2})\\sin ^{2}\\left({\\frac {\\lambda _{2}-\\lambda _{1}}{2}}\\right)}}\\right)}$$\n\nwhere r is the radius of the Earth.

I like to think of hyperparameter optimization as finding the best settings for a machine learning model.\n\n### Random Search\n\nWe'll use a basic form of hyperparameter tuning, random search. This means constructing a parameter grid and then randomly selecting combinations of values, evaluating them in cross validation, and determining which combination performs the best. This is quickly done using the `RandomizedSearchCV` in Scikit-Learn.\n\nThe following code sets up the search.

This ensures that the training and validation set have the same distribution of fare bins. This is important for imbalanced classification problems, but it can also be useful for regression problems so we don't end up with a lot of outliers in terms of the target in either the validation or training set.

You can build additional features by looking at others' work or researching the problem.\n\n#### Collinear Features\n\nOne thing we do want to be careful about is highly correlated, known as [collinear](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Multicollinearity), features.
