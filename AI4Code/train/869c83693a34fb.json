Mental disorders\u2014including depression, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders, physical disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome, and substance abuse\u2014including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines\u2014are risk factors. Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress, such as from financial difficulties, relationship problems such as breakups, or bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts. Effective suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide\u2014such as firearms, drugs, and poisons; treating mental disorders and substance misuse; careful media reporting about suicide; and improving economic conditions. Even though crisis hotlines are common, they have not been well studied.\n\n**Approximately** 1.5% of people die by suicide. In a given year this is roughly 12 per 100,000 people. Rates of completed suicides are generally ***higher among men than among women***, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those ***over the age of 70***; however, in certain countries, those aged between 15 and 30 are at the highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the ***Western world, attempts are more common among young people and among females***.","06154c25":"## Differentiating by gender","bdcacb02":"## Top 10 countries with highest number of suicides per 100k population","1e09f6a6":"## Adding the gender hue","bdb1ff09":"## Male : Female ratio","1ac2a21c":"# Like my work?\n\n#### Do upvote and leave a comment ","a2f51df3":"## Importing Essentials","8f188fbc":"#### Conclusion:\n\n1.
