Hence, it is quite relieving.\n\nFor instance take the pedestrians:\n> the injured people average is in terms of e-02 while \n> killed people average is in terms of e-04. Hence, when we would sum up this data, the overall no. of people killed will also be very less than the average no. of people injured.\n\nLet's try to represent it graphically as no. of people killed and no. of people injured per **BOROUGH**","44b8b4ca":"* It can be verified through above *head()* and *tail()* data  that the dataset is given in the order of latest to earliest incidents.
