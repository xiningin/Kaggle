To determine whether both types of measurement tools are equally predictive at all stages of disease, the authors compared questionnaire\u2010based ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) scores to the examination\u2010based Appel ALS (AALS) scores at different stages of disease.\"\n\n\"Same\u2010day scores were obtained during 174 visits in 62 patients with definite or probable ALS. Using normalized scores, correlation between the scales and predictability were best in mildly affected patients. Predictions of ALSFRS based on AALS scores were less than half as precise in the later stages of disease. Both scales showed significant change with disease progression, but ALSFRS consistently underestimated disease severity defined by AALS (P < 0.001). Questionnaire\u2010based measurements should be compared against objective scales at all stages of disease severity before they are accepted as primary endpoint measures.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1002\/mus.20977","aea453f3":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">ALS Functional Rating Scale<\/h1>\n\nThe Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS)\n\nOverview: \n\n\"The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) is an instrument for \nevaluating the functional status of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

A minor limitation of the scale is that it has a floor effect in terms of measuring disease progression in quadriparetic, ventilator-dependent patients.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.medscape.com\/answers\/1170097-81928\/how-are-als-functional-rating-scale-alsfrs-scores-interpreted-in-the-assessment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als","8716fa3c":"\"Ordinal classification of ALS state is superior to conventional classification.

Since disease progression is not linear, and the accuracy measurement cannot tell large from small prediction errors, the authors dispense with the linearity assumption and apply ordinal classification that accounts for error severity. In addition, they identify the most influential variables in predicting and explaining the disease.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, in contrast to conventional modeling of the patient\u2019s total functionality, they also model separate patient functionalities (e.g., in walking or speaking). Methods: Using data from 3772 patients from the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database, they introduce and train ordinal classifiers to predict patients\u2019 disease state in their last clinic visit, while accounting differently for different error severities.\"\n\n\"The authors used feature-selection methods and the classifiers themselves to determine the most influential variables in predicting the disease from demographic, clinical, and laboratory data collected in either the first, last, or both clinic visits, and the Bayesian network classifier to identify interrelations among these variables and their relations with the disease state. They apply these methods to model each of the patient functionalities. Results: They show the error distribution in ALS state prediction and demonstrate that ordinal classifiers outperform classifiers that do not account for error severity. They identify clinical and lab test variables influential to prediction of different ALS functionalities and their interrelations, and specific value combinations of these variables that occur more frequently in patients with severe deterioration than in patients with mild deterioration and vice versa.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/336206153_Insights_into_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis_from_a_Machine_Learning_Perspective","24cc8d94":"**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Columns Names:<\/span>**\n\n\nalsfdn = Status: Collected 1, Not Collected 2\n\nalsfdnsp = Reason not collected\n\nalsfrs1 = ALSFRS-R 1.Speech: 0 = Loss of useful speech, 1 = Speech combined with nonvocal communication, 2 = Intelligible with repeating, 3 = Detectable speech disturbances, 4 = Normal speech processes.\n\n\nalsfrs2 = ALSFRS-R 2.Salivation: 0 = Marked drooling requires constant tissue or handkerchief, 1 = Marked excess of saliva with some drooling, 2 = Moderately excessive saliva may have minimal drooling, 3 = Slight but definite excess of saliva in mouth may have nighttime drooling, 4 = Normal.\n\nalsfrs3 = ALSFRS-R 3.Swallowing: 0 = NPO (exclusively parenteral or enteral feeding), 1 = Needs supplemental tube feeding, 2 = Dietary consistency changes, 3 = Early eating problems - occasional choking, 4 = Normal eating habits.\n\n\nalsfrs4 = ALSFRS-R 4.Handwriting: 0 = Unable to grip pen, 1 = Able to grip pen but unable to write, 2 = Not all words are legible, 3 = Slow or sloppy all words are legible, 4 = Normal.\n\nalsfrs5 = Gastrostomy Status: Yes 1, No 2.\n\nalsfrs5a = ALSFRS-R 5.a Cutting Without Gastrostomy: 0 = Needs to be fed, 1 = Food must be cut by someone, but can still feed slowly, 2 = Can cut most foods, although clumsy and slow some help needed, 3 = Somewhat slow and clumsy, but no help needed, 4 = Normal.\n\nalsfrs5b = ALSFRS-R 5.b Cutting With Gastrostomy: 0 = Unable to perform any aspect of task, 1 = Provides minimal assistance to caregivers, 2 = Some help needed with closures and fasteners, 3 = Clumsy but able to perform all manipulations independently, 4 = Normal.\n\nalsfrs6 = ALSFRS-R 6.Dressing and Hygiene, 0 = Total dependence, 1 = Needs attendant for self-care, 2 = Intermittent assistance or substitute methods, 3 = Independent and complete self-care with effort or decreased efficiency, 4 = Normal function.\n\nalsfrs7 = ALSFRS-R 7.Turning in Bed, 0 = Helpless, 1 = Can initiate, but not turn or adjust sheets alone, 2 = Can turn alone or adjust sheets, but with great difficulty, \n3 = Somewhat slow and clumsy, but no help needed, 4 = Normal.\n\nalsfrs8 = ALSFRS-R 8.Walking, 0 = No purposeful leg movement, 1 = Nonambulatory functional movement only, 2 = Walks with assistance, 3 = Early ambulation difficulties, \n4 = Normal.\n\nalsfrs9 = ALSFRS-R 9.Climbing Stairs, 0 = Cannot do, 1 = Needs assistance, 2 = Mild unsteadiness or fatigue, 3 = Slow, 4 = Normal.\n\nalsfrsdt = ALSFRS-R Date Performed\n\nalsfrsmd = ALSFRS-R Mode of administration: In Person 1, Telephone 2, Self-administered 3, Other 99.\n\nalsfrsr1 = ALSFRS-R R-1.Dyspnea: 0 = Significant difficulty, considering using mechanical respiratory support, 1 = Occurs at rest, difficulty breathing when either sitting or lying, 2 = Occurs with one or more of the following: eating, bathing, dressing, 3 = Occurs when walking, 4 = None.\n\nalsfrsr2 = ALSFRS-R R-2 Orthopnea: 0 = Unable to sleep without mechanical assistance, 1 = Can only sleep sitting up, 2 = Needs extra pillow in order to sleep (more than two), \n3 = Some difficulty sleeping at night due to shortness of breath, does not routinely use more than t..., 4 = None.\n\nalsfrsr3 = ALSFRS-R R-3.Respiratory Insufficiency: 0 = Invasive mechanical ventilation by intubation or tracheostomy, 1 = Continuous use of NIPPV during the night and day, 2 = Continuous use of NIPPV during the night, 3 = Intermittent use of NIPPV, 4 = None.\n\nalsfrsrp = ALSFRS-R Responder: Patient 1, Patient via Caregiver.\n\nalsfrssp = Specify Other Mode.\n\nalsfrst = ALSFRS Total Score\n\nsource = Data Source: medical records 1, original collection 2, patient reported 3, unknown 90, other = 99.\n\nsourcesp = Specify other data source.","cd541e57":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Confusion matrices for each of the ALSFRS items<\/span>**\n\nConfusion matrices for each of the ALSFRS items when predicting disease state using only information from the first clinic visit.\n\nAuthors: Jonathan Gordon, Boaz Lerner.\n\n![](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/336206153\/figure\/fig3\/AS:809368148795399@1569979812441\/Confusion-matrices-for-each-of-the-ALSFRS-items-when-predicting-disease-state-using-only.png)https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/Confusion-matrices-for-each-of-the-ALSFRS-items-when-predicting-disease-state-using-only_fig3_336206153","aa7ed85d":"#Model Definition"}}
