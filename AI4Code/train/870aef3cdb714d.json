less-expensive Indians while Indians do the same job for less wage when they deserve more. Only Big Multi-National Companies get benefits from it but employees in both Nations suffer though they believe they are increasing employement but on the other hand they are exploiting their employees. \nIndians should shift their inclination from software engineering jobs to Data Science and analytics as it is a flourishing field with many opportunities.","d8db4b37":"As India has highest kaggle user so the number of male and female user are also more than USA. With both countries have approximately 22% of female user. ","e792473d":"This shows how Indian get more money in software Enginnering job than Data scientist position whereas in USA Data Scientist get more paid. This is one more point to validate how Indians are more inclined towards software Engineering than any field because of more opportunities in the SDE role and it's easy for foreign companies to find less expensive employees. With every second or third student in India an enginner it is perfect hub for outscourcing. ","01583e86":"In USA both male and female have sufficient experience in coding while in India most of them have only 1-2 years of expiernce. In USA females have more number of coding experience but in India very less number of females are in the field of STEM so they do not have much experience. While few females in India continue their job afterwards in life so experience of more than 20 years is even less in females.

","99790975":"# The rise of White-collar outsourcing\n\n#### What is white-collar outsourcing?\n\nWhite-collar outsourcing has grown rapidly since the early 21st century. The digital workforce of countries like India and China are only paid a fraction of what would be minimum wage in the US. On average, software engineers are getting paid between 250,000 and 1,500,000 rupees (4,000 to 23,000 US Dollars) in India as opposed to 40,000\u2013100,000 US Dollars in countries such as the US and Canada. Evidently, while there are thousands of highly skilled and competent Indians in the country\u2019s software sector, they are paid less relative to U.S. workers for the same work.\n\nCountry like India where every year on an average of 1.5 million students get degree in Engineering it is one of the most sought after place for Foreign companies to do white-collar outscourcing.\nThe outscourcing involve both USA and India but there is a lot of difference between both of them. Let's visualize these factors in depth.\n","7fcc4e9f":"##### OUTSCOURCING AND PAY GAP\nMaximum number of people in India have Annual income in the range of 0-999 dollar while maximum people in USA have annual income in the range of  100,000-124,999 dollar. The main reason behind this outscourcing when foreign companies pay less annual income to Indian for the same work that Americans do. The plot clearly depicts how no user's income is above $150,000 dollar while many American users are in the range of 150,000 dollar and above. While the work done by both Indian and American users are same but there is a wide pay gap between both due to white-collar outscourcing.","998c7906":"### SUGGESTION\n\nCompanies should pay equal wage to all the employees and not on the basis of Countries. They should create more work opportunities but not lay off workers when there are less-expensive employee is available from a different country. IT sector can evolve only when they stop doing outscourcing 'cause with that many people in India will think enginnering as engineering and not just a safety net to get job as of now Engineering is not just a profession for them but a mean to get a job no matter how low the wage is. ","cbccead5":"While most of the user in USA has a master's degree whilw most users in India has only bachelor's degree. As Data Science is still not a fully fledged field in India and it is still a budding area whereas in USA more people do masters in this area. One more reason is wide number of Software Engineering jobs available in India that people tend to focus on SDE role more with so many American Companies hiring SDE so people in India believe that Software Engineering degree will grant them a secure future with jobs acting as a safety net for them. ","08c30cba":"As Data Science is not a fully fledged field in India and there are many startups available in India for AI and Data Science so maximum Indian users work in a small size company with 0-49 employees whereas in USA maximum users work in a company with more than 10,000 employees.","8e9b184f":"kindly share your view.","1bed9bc8":"USA has highest number of Data Scientist as user while India has more number of students as it's user since Data Science and Artificial Intelligence is a budding field in India so more students are using and learning it."}}
