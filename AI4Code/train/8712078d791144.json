The three features Glucose, Blood pressure, and Skin thickness have minimum values of 0. However, these features cannot be equal to zero because humans can't survive with zero glucose, blood pressure, or skin thickness. So to solve this issue all values equal to zero in each of those three features were turned into null values and they were just ignored for simplicity.","b01aed96":"Now that the SVM model has been applied we can check the accuracy of the model using the accuracy score and confusion matrix."}}
