These are already recorded for us in fi (from the original data).","0753d30e":"### Assessing Usefulness of New Variable with r value\n\nTo determine if the new variable is useful, we can calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r-value) between this variable and the target. This measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables and ranges from -1 (perfectly negatively linear) to +1 (perfectly positively linear). The r-value is not best measure of the \"usefulness\" of a new variable, but it can give a first approximation of whether a variable will be helpful to a machine learning model. The larger the r-value of a variable with respect to the target, the more a change in this variable is likely to affect the value of the target. Therefore, we look for the variables with the greatest absolute value r-value relative to the target.\n\nWe can also visually inspect a relationship with the target using the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot.\n\n##### Kernel Density Estimate Plots\n\nThe kernel density estimate plot shows the distribution of a single variable (think of it as a smoothed histogram). To see the different in distributions dependent on the value of a categorical variable, we can color the distributions differently according to the category. For example, we can show the kernel density estimate of the previous_loan_count colored by whether the TARGET = 1 or 0. The resulting KDE will show any significant differences in the distribution of the variable between people who did not repay their loan (TARGET == 1) and the people who did (TARGET == 0). This can serve as an indicator of whether a variable will be 'relevant' to a machine learning model.\n\nWe will put this plotting functionality in a function to re-use for any variable","3e8873e7":"#### Aggregated Stats of Bureau Dataframe","f86c59dc":"In the code below, we sort the correlations by the magnitude (absolute value) using the sorted Python function.

This will allow us to see if there are highly collinear variables that should perhaps be removed from the data.\n\nLet's look for any variables that have a greather than 0.8 correlation with other variables.","34bc1a37":"### Applying Operations to another dataframe\nWe will now turn to the bureau balance dataframe. This dataframe has monthly information about each client's previous loan(s) with other financial institutions. Instead of grouping this dataframe by the SK_ID_CURR which is the client id, we will first group the dataframe by the SK_ID_BUREAU which is the id of the previous loan. This will give us one row of the dataframe for each loan. Then, we can group by the SK_ID_CURR and calculate the aggregations across the loans of each client. The final result will be a dataframe with one row for each client, with stats calculated for their loans.","3d818fd2":"-------------------------------------\n#### Test Two\nThat was easy, so let's do another run! Same as before but with the highly collinear variables removed.","ab888c35":"### Example: Counts of a client's previous loans\n\nTo illustrate the general process of manual feature engineering, we will first simply get the count of a client's previous loans at other financial institutions. This requires a number of Pandas operations we will make heavy use of throughout the notebook:\n\n* groupby: group a dataframe by a column. In this case we will group by the unique client, the SK_ID_CURR column\n* agg: perform a calculation on the grouped data such as taking the mean of columns. We can either call the function directly (grouped_df.mean()) or use the agg function together with a list of transforms (grouped_df.agg([mean, max, min, sum]))\n* merge: match the aggregated statistics to the appropriate client. We need to merge the original training data with the calculated stats on the SK_ID_CURR column which will insert NaN in any cell for which the client does not have the corresponding statistic\nWe also use the (rename) function quite a bit specifying the columns to be renamed as a dictionary. This is useful in order to keep track of the new variables we create.\n\nThis might seem like a lot, which is why we'll eventually write a function to do this process for us. Let's take a look at implementing this by hand first.","a7325545":"### Correlations of Aggregated Values with Target\n\nWe can calculate the correlation of all new values with the target. Again, we can use these as an approximation of the variables which may be important for modeling.","ddcd04a9":"To recap, for the bureau_balance dataframe we:\n\n1. Calculated numeric stats grouping by each loan\n2. Made value counts of each categorical variable grouping by loan\n3. Merged the stats and the value counts on the loans\n4. Calculated numeric stats for the resulting dataframe grouping by the client id\n\nThe final resulting dataframe has one row for each client, with statistics calculated for all of their loans with monthly balance information.\n\nSome of these variables are a little confusing, so let's try to explain a few:\n\n* client_bureau_balance_MONTHS_BALANCE_mean_mean: For each loan calculate the mean value of MONTHS_BALANCE. Then for each client, calculate the mean of this value for all of their loans.\n* client_bureau_balance_STATUS_X_count_norm_sum: For each loan, calculate the number of occurences of STATUS == X divided by the number of total STATUS values for the loan. Then, for each client, add up the values for each loan.\n\nWe will hold off on calculating the correlations until we have all the variables together in one dataframe.","673f2e5e":"### Introduction: Manual Feature Engineering\n\nIf you are new to this competition, I highly suggest checking out this notebook to get started.\n\nIn this notebook, we will explore making features by hand for the Home Credit Default Risk competition. In an earlier notebook, we used only the application data in order to build a model. The best model we made from this data achieved a score on the leaderboard around 0.74. In order to better this score, we will have to include more information from the other dataframes. Here, we will look at using information from the bureau and bureau_balance data. The definitions of these data files are:\n\n* bureau: information about client's previous loans with other financial institutions reported to Home Credit. Each previous loan has its own row.\n* bureau_balance: monthly information about the previous loans. Each month has its own row.\n\nManual feature engineering can be a tedious process (which is why we use automated feature engineering with featuretools!) and often relies on domain expertise. Since I have limited domain knowledge of loans and what makes a person likely to default, I will instead concentrate of getting as much info as possible into the final training dataframe. The idea is that the model will then pick up on which features are important rather than us having to decide that. Basically, our approach is to make as many features as possible and then give them all to the model to use! Later, we can perform feature reduction using the feature importances from the model or other techniques such as PCA.\n\nThe process of manual feature engineering will involve plenty of Pandas code, a little patience, and a lot of great practice manipulation data. Even though automated feature engineering tools are starting to be made available, feature engineering will still have to be done using plenty of data wrangling for a little while longer.","ed35ab43":"------------------------\n\n#### Test One\nLet's conduct the first test.

One-hot encoding makes the process of calculating these figures very easy!\n\nWe can use a similar function as before to rename the columns. Again, we have to deal with the multi-level index for the columns. We iterate through the first level (level 0) which is the name of the categorical variable appended with the value of the category (from one-hot encoding). Then we iterate stats we calculated for each client. We will rename the column with the level 0 name appended with the stat. As an example, the column with CREDIT_ACTIVE_Active as level 0 and sum as level 1 will become CREDIT_ACTIVE_Active_count.","d9720c6f":"Over half of the top 100 features were made by us!

Fortunately, we already have a function that does this for us","1a27e6f0":"Fortunately, once we have taken the time to write a function, using it is simple (if there's a central theme in this notebook, it's use functions to make things simpler and reproducible!). The function above returns a submission dataframe we can upload to the competition, a fi dataframe of feature importances, and a metrics dataframe with validation and test performance.","39f6ab63":"### Categorical Variables\n\nNow we move from the numeric columns to the categorical columns. These are discrete string variables, so we cannot just calculate statistics such as mean and max which only work with numeric variables. Instead, we will rely on calculating value counts of each category within each categorical variable.","7cc2e2fa":"#### Missing Values\nAn important consideration is the missing values in the dataframe. Columns with too many missing values might have to be dropped.","af27dfaf":"### Feature Engineering Outcomes\nAfter all that work, now we want to take a look at the variables we have created. We can look at the percentage of missing values, the correlations of variables with the target, and also the correlation of variables with the other variables. The correlations between variables can show if we have collinear varibles, that is, variables that are highly correlated with one another. Often, we want to remove one in a pair of collinear variables because having both variables would be redundant. We can also use the percentage of missing values to remove features with a substantial majority of values that are not present. Feature selection will be an important focus going forward, because reducing the number of features can help the model learn during training and also generalize better to the testing data. The \"curse of dimensionality\" is the name given to the issues caused by having too many features (too high of a dimension). As the number of variables increases, the number of datapoints needed to learn the relationship between these variables and the target value increases exponentially.\n\nFeature selection is the process of removing variables to help our model to learn and generalize better to the testing set. The objective is to remove useless\/redundant variables while preserving those that are useful. There are a number of tools we can use for this process, but in this notebook we will stick to removing columns with a high percentage of missing values and variables that have a high correlation with one another. Later we can look at using the feature importances returned from models such as the Gradient Boosting Machine or Random Forest to perform feature selection.","d57af233":"#### Aggregated stats of Bureau Balance dataframe by loan","dc4d10c0":"**Test one scores 0.759 when submitted to the competition.**","a6c11e1b":"At this point we will save both the training and testing data. I encourage anyone to try different percentages for dropping the missing columns and compare the outcomes.","91c87439":"#### Value counts of Bureau Balance dataframe by loan","2bed819c":"### Modeling\n\nTo actually test the performance of these new datasets, we will try using them for machine learning! Here we will use a function I developed in another notebook to compare the features (the raw version with the highly correlated variables removed). We can run this kind of like an experiment, and the control will be the performance of just the application data in this function when submitted to the competition. I've already recorded that performance, so we can list out our control and our two test conditions:\n\n**For all datasets, use the model shown below (with the exact hyperparameters).**\n\n* control: only the data in the application files.\n\n* test one: the data in the application files with all of the data recorded from the bureau and bureau_balance files\n\n* test two: the data in the application files with all of the data recorded from the bureau and bureau_balance files with highly correlated variables removed.","76d48d72":"The control slightly overfits because the training score is higher than the validation score. We can address this in later notebooks when we look at regularization (we already perform some regularization in this model by using reg_lambda and reg_alpha as well as early stopping).\n\nWe can visualize the feature importance with another function, plot_feature_importances. The feature importances may be useful when it's time for feature selection.","dbe47e68":"The above dataframes have the calculations done on each loan. Now we need to aggregate these for each client. We can do this by merging the dataframes together first and then since all the variables are numeric, we just need to aggregate the statistics again, this time grouping by the SK_ID_CURR.","0acf7363":"Now we can handle the one numeric column. The MONTHS_BALANCE column has the \"months of balance relative to application date.\" This might not necessarily be that important as a numeric variable, and in future work we might want to consider this as a time variable. For now, we can just calculate the same aggregation statistics as previously.","9baebd58":"### Aggregating Numeric Columns\n\nTo account for the numeric information in the bureau dataframe, we can compute statistics for all the numeric columns. To do so, we groupby the client id, agg the grouped dataframe, and merge the result back into the training data. The agg function will only calculate the values for the numeric columns where the operation is considered valid. We will stick to using 'mean', 'max', 'min', 'sum' but any function can be passed in here. We can even write our own function and use it in an agg call.","239e04d1":"Well this distribution is all over the place. This variable represents the number of previous loans with a CREDIT_ACTIVE value of Active divided by the total number of previous loans for a client. The correlation here is so weak that I do not think we should draw any conclusions!","0e189cf3":"Based on these numbers, the engineered features perform better than the control case. However, we will have to submit the predictions to the leaderboard before we can say if this better validation performance transfers to the testing data.","079b2bd1":"Before we remove the missing values, we will find the missing value percentages in the testing data. We'll then remove any columns with greater than 90% missing values in either the training or testing data. Let's now read in the testing data, perform the same operations, and look at the missing values in the testing data. We already have calculated all the counts and aggregation statistics, so we only need to merge the testing data with the appropriate data.","459036d4":"We see there are a number of columns with a high percentage of missing values. There is no well-established threshold for removing missing values, and the best course of action depends on the problem. Here, to reduce the number of features, we will remove any columns in either the training or the testing data that have greater than 90% missing values.","98ab741b":"The definition of this column is: \"How many days before current application did client apply for Credit Bureau credit\". My interpretation is this is the number of days that the previous loan was applied for before the application for a loan at Home Credit. Therefore, a larger negative number indicates the loan was further before the current loan application. We see an extremely weak positive relationship between the average of this variable and the target meaning that clients who applied for loans further in the past potentially are more likely to repay loans at Home Credit. With a correlation this weak though, it is just as likely to be noise as a signal.\n\n#### The Multiple Comparisons Problem\n\nWhen we have lots of variables, we expect some of them to be correlated just by pure chance, a problem known as multiple comparisons. We can make hundreds of features, and some will turn out to be corelated with the target simply because of random noise in the data. Then, when our model trains, it may overfit to these variables because it thinks they have a relationship with the target in the training set, but this does not necessarily generalize to the test set. There are many considerations that we have to take into account when making features!","4097964f":"### Correlations\nFirst let's look at the correlations of the variables with the target. We can see in any of the variables we created have a greater correlation than those already present in the training data (from application).","df48c3b0":"### Function for Numeric Aggregations\n\nLet's encapsulate all of the previous work into a function. This will allow us to compute aggregate stats for numeric columns across any dataframe. We will re-use this function when we want to apply the same operations for other dataframes.","8646deab":"#### Control\nThe first step in any experiment is establishing a control. For this we will use the function defined above (that implements a Gradient Boosting Machine model) and the single main data source (application).","72bc4700":"None of the new variables have a significant correlation with the TARGET. We can look at the KDE plot of the highest correlated variable, bureau_DAYS_CREDIT_mean, with the target in in terms of absolute magnitude correlation.","14ccb3a7":"We need to create new names for each of these columns. The following code makes new names by appending the stat to the name. Here we have to deal with the fact that the dataframe has a multi-level index. I find these confusing and hard to work with, so I try to reduce to a single level index as quickly as possible.","f95987a6":"We can remove these columns from both the training and the testing datasets. We will have to compare performance after removing these variables with performance keeping these variables (the raw csv files we saved earlier)."}}
