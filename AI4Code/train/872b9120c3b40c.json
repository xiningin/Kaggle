One such popular and immensely affective method that is mostly being adopted in the modern day is that of cash-backs (by giving back a certain proportion of the current transaction that was being done by a selected user). Adopted by most digital wallets of the modern day, the cash-back system is a very well-known method even amongst the masses of the current generation. In specific, this paper deals with the cash-back system offered by Google in its current and widely used Google-Pay app. Established in January 8, 2018 after being taken up from Android Pay (popularly known as \u201cTEZ\u201d) which was established in September 11, 2015. This widely popular and convenient app was platformed at Android Lollipop 5.0 and above and also on the iOS v7.0 or later. With much to its security system and people\u2019s trust on a global company such as Google, this app took off at a high-flying start in order to create a mark at the data wallet industry. The optimization on the company\u2019s front was fairly obvious as it was a choice between the maximization of profits against gaining new customers by introducing a cash-back on transactions done via the app.\n","a2b15643":"**Motivation**: After the demonetization of 2016, the Indian economy saw the rapid emergence of digital wallets in order to compensate the uneasy flow of liquid cash in the economy.
