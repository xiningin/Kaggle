For example, in this kernel, a core file gets outputted instead of the structures dataframe. However, if the line import openbabel as ob is commented out, the kernel runs fine. But, I have many kernels that import openbabel and they have worked fine in the past. I would like to know if other people are experiencing this same issue."}}
