Its interesting we see large booms in 'drawings and watercolors' in the early '90s as well as a massive uptick in Oct, 78. We also see 'photographs' boom in 82 then hold a rather high position though today. This is due to photography being a growing field of art that really only matured in the early '80s. This is a hard way to show true popularity because of the difference in the cost of these pieces. Let us look at sculptures for example. The most'popular' sculptures have been was in May of 2016 when 17 sculptures were acquired but these could have been great pieces outweighing the huge volume of photographs that came into the possession of the Museum ","8e5984a4":"After creating this notebook I know for a fact that this is barely a surface level evaluation of this dataset and I would love to see what all of you are able to do with it!
