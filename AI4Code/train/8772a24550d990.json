says), but it also has a lot of traffic. This particular recording has a steady drone of traffic in the background. The traffic shows up as low frequency sounds, below 2000 Hz. The intermittent horizontal lines between about 3000 and 4000 Hz are an actual bird, a singing Black-capped Chickadee. Like the chickadee, many birds vocalize at frequencies higher than the background traffic. However, background traffic would overlap the vocalization frequency range of certain low-pitched birds (Mourning Doves or Great Horned Owls, for example--both of which are part of this competition, but not this specific recording). \n\nThe downward diagnoal line at the 12 second mark on the image (2:32 of the original) is, I believe, a genuine bird, though very faint (and perhaps not definitively identifiable); it does not show up in the train_soundscape_labels.csv. ","7adcdae5":"## Honking (car, not geese)\n\nLocation: Costa Rica. Seems to be a car horn, activated repeatedly, showing up here between the 1 and 11 second marks, at frequencies below 4000 Hz. I'm not certain what the persistent sounds are at around 5000 Hz; insects would be my first guess.  ","b2d49bd3":"# Other possible sounds\nThat's just a brief survey of some examples I've found (so far) in the training soundscapes. It is not comprehensive. And considering more broadly about what non-target sounds might interfere with audio recordings, one can think of a long list of possibilities. For starters: \n\n* Engine sounds: car, motorcycle, train, plane, helicopter, lawn mower, chain saw, ATV, generator, etc.\n* Other loud artificial sounds: train whistle, tornado siren, emergency vehicle sirens, loud music (from passing vehicle or stationary source), gun shots\n* Weather sounds: wind, rain, thunder, hail \n* Frogs & toads \n* Insects \n* Mammals (human voice, chipmunks, squirrels, and plenty more; list expands in the tropics to include monkeys and more)\n* Domestic birds: chickens, geese, ducks, peafowl, for example\n* Falling trees: If a tree falls in the woods, and audio equipment records it, will people *please* stop aruging about whether it made a sound?\n* Sounds from interactions with the ground, such as footsteps of people or animals (good luck differentiating scratching sounds generated by a Wild Turkey or Eastern Towhee vs. a squirrel or raccoon)\n* Miscellaneous: Birders using playback (hopefully not, but possible!), snapping electric fences (mostly a problem I encounter when recording in my home habitat)\n\n\n## On the bright side...\nWe won't have to differentiate between chainsaws and chainsaw-mimicing birds in this competition. Check out the Superb Lyrebird from Australia in [my absolute favorite David Attenborough clip on YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mSB71jNq-yQ). \n","4a128595":"# Rooster and dogs and insects, oh my!\n\nCosta Rica: This is not a deep rainforest site, but rather a human-inhabited rural landscape. \n1. Rooster: Below 2000 Hz and between approximately the 2 & 4 second marks.\n2. Dog(s): Below 2000 Hz and between the 8 & 12 second marks. (Not shown on this spectorgram, but in the same recording, between 1:24 and 1:29, there are two different dogs, first one with a deeper voice, followed by a slightly higher pitched yappy one. )\n3. Insects: Two species, one at about 3000 Hz and one at about 4000 Hz.\n\nMystery: Some sounds are showing up just above 6000 Hz. My ear can't pick them out. Any ideas?

Mulitple recordings are from July 1, 2017, which seems to have been a wet day. The first example is a brief downpour that rapidly intensifies and fades off. Rain shows up on the spectrogram as a series of vertical streaks across a wide range of frequencies. This particular example happens not to have birds in it, but one should  not assume that birds simply go quiet during the rain; in fact, sometimes they are very active. See the next example for birds plus rain.","17f0fce3":"# Frogs (?)\n\nLocation: Costa Rica. This is out of my home turf, so I'm speculating that the dominant sound here (around 5000 Hz) could be frog calls. As stated earlier, I'm open to correction.

Many birders (at a range of skill levels) have been fooled by squirrels, and I'm sure computers can be thrown off by certain non-bird sounds, as well. Non-target sounds range from natural (insects, frogs, rain) to artificial (cars, planes). And they range from sounds that could readily be confused with birds (chipmunks, squirrels) to those that are more likely to simply obscure certain birds sounds (heavy traffic). Even birds themselves can cause confusion; for example, domestic birds such as *Gallus gallus domesticus* (the chicken) are generally considered non-target. See [eBird guidelines on domestic birds](https:\/\/support.ebird.org\/en\/support\/solutions\/articles\/48000795623-ebird-rules-and-best-practices). \n\nI've listened to many of the training soundscapes, and have heard a lot of non-target sounds. I thought it would be interesting to put together a visual tour to highlight what these look like in spectrogram view.\n\nThe training soundscapes are from two locations: \n* Ithaca, New York, USA (abbreviation SSW, for Sapsucker Woods at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology)\n* Alajuela, San Ram\u00f3n, Costa Rica (abbreviation COR)\n\nDisclaimer: These are my interpretations of what I'm hearing (and seeing) based on experience birding and listening,  primarily in the United States. Alternative interpretations are welcome; I'll update with corrections as needed.  \n\n## Notes on the spectrograms\nI'm using linear-scaled spectrograms here. Note that not all plots have the same y-axis scale; for situations without much going on in the high-frequency range, I've change the maximum y value. All of these show 15 second clips, and I've noted what part of the original they come from. ","00eb9174":"# Flowing water; human cough\n\nLocation: Costa Rica. This sounds like it's next to a gurgling stream, which I interpret as showing up as a jumble of sound below 2000 Hz. \n\nAt the 1 second mark in the view below, there's a human cough (showning up across a broad frequency range), followed shortly thereafter by a throat clearing. \n\nThere's also a genuine bird (a Rufous-breasted Wren, rubwre1, according to the metadata), one with a nice, loud whistle. Often, it seems that birds that make use of stream-side habitat are loud vocalists. (The Louisiana Waterthrush I hear as I'm writing this is another such example)\n\nI'm not sure about the bright line at 6000 Hz. Insects again? Thoughts, anyone? ","f7c8f538":"## Rain, with birds\nSapsucker Woods, again. Here's another example of rain, this time with bird sounds. Viewed this way, the streaks of the rain considerably degrade the quality of the parts of the spectrogram that actually represent bird vocalizations. "}}
