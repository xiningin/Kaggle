The field of data science is gradually proving its importance with many practical applications with the focus of Machine Leaning and Deep Learning. The low number and proportion of data scientist show a potential demand for this career in these two countries.\n\n(2) The age of data scientists in all three countries are relatively young. However, US shows the dominant of the number of experienced data scientist with wider age range of respondents.\n\n(3) The education of data scientist in US is considerably high with more than 80% of respondents having master and doctoral degree. These number drop considerably to about 70% and 45% in Japan and Vietnam, respectively.\n\n(4) The average salary for data scientist in US is very high (~100k USD), and ranks in a second place. Japan has lower salary for data scientist and it is relatively same to other IT careers. The salary of data scientist in Vietnam is generally high, and highly depends on the ability of the candidate.\n\n(5) The most popular platform to learn data science is Blog and Kaggle.

It makes sense because Data Scientist is called as the sexist job of 21st century by Harvard Business Review. I also think data science is very challenging job and it has very attractive salary. That maybe explain why many student joined in the Kaggle platform to lean data science.\n- There is about 8000 participants who actually reponse as data scientist.\n- It is also quite interesting that, there are about 6000 participants who are software engineer. Kaggle maybe a good platform not only for student but also for software engineer to learn about data science and machine learning.

The average salary of data scientist is equivalent to software engineer, and is about 40000 USD.\n- This average salary of data scientitst in Vietnam is quite surprising. The salary of data scientist is the highest, and is more than 20000 USD. This number is about 1.4 times higher than Chief Officier, and two times higher than that of software engineer.
