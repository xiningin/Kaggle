Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal, it is the biggest cultural, economic and educational centre of south India. According to the 2011 Indian census, it is the sixth-most populous city and fourth-most populous urban agglomeration in India. The city together with the adjoining regions constitute the Chennai Metropolitan Area, which is the 36th-largest urban area by population in the world. Chennai is among the most-visited Indian cities by foreign tourists. It was ranked the 43rd-most visited city in the world for the year 2015. The Quality of Living Survey rated Chennai as the safest city in India. Chennai attracts 45 percent of health tourists visiting India, and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists.As such, it is termed \"India's health capital\". As a growing metropolitan city in a developing country, Chennai confronts substantial pollution and other logistical and socio-economic problems.\n\n#### Geographic Value of the city:\nChennai is located on the south\u2013eastern coast of India in the north\u2013eastern part of Tamil Nadu on a flat coastal plain known as the Eastern Coastal Plains. Its average elevation is around 6.7 metres (22 ft),and its highest point is 60 m (200 ft).Chennai is 2,184 kilometres (1,357 mi) south of Delhi, 1,337 kilometres (831 mi) southeast of Mumbai, and 345 kilometres (214 mi) east of Bangalore by road. Two major rivers flow through Chennai, the Cooum River (or Koovam) through the centre and the Adyar River to the south. A third river, the Kortalaiyar, travels through the northern fringes of the city before draining into the Bay of Bengal, at Ennore. The estuary of this river is heavily polluted with effluents released by the industries in the region. Adyar and Cooum rivers are heavily polluted with effluents and waste from domestic and commercial sources, the Coumm being so heavily polluted it is regarded as the city's eyesore. A protected estuary on the Adyar forms a natural habitat for several species of birds and animals. The Buckingham Canal, 4 km (2.5 mi) inland, runs parallel to the coast, linking the two rivers. The Otteri Nullah, an east\u2013west stream, runs through north Chennai and meets the Buckingham Canal at Basin Bridge. Several lakes of varying size are located on the western fringes of the city. Some areas of the city have the problem of excess iron content in groundwater.\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tripsavvy.com\/thmb\/CpONGB1YCDzFpppjpyzDxqZN6qo=\/950x0\/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)\/GettyImages-1012312926-3b9511dfffd64078b246885b5c67af00.jpg\" style=\" width: 800px;\"\/>\n\n# Data Analysis\n\nThere are basically 4 major reservoirs in chennai that supply water to the entire population of the country. The analysis done below deals with finding out the trends in the water levels of these reservoirs. The reservoirs are drying up and the people are dying out of thirst, the farmers are committing sucides as they're failing to produce productive yields.
