It is designed to be used with NumPy arrays and functions. It optimizes array-oriented and math-heavy python code.\n\nNumba comes pre-installed in kaggle kernels. If not then we can install it by running \n> pip install numba","fbd71204":"Using numba is very simple. Just do the following steps:\n1. Import jit from numba.\n2. Add the jit annotation with nopython=True over the definition of cosine similarity.","2ff16807":"Python being an interpreter language speeds up the development. However, the same makes it slower during run time as it has to compile and execute each statement every time. This becomes a problem during scaling. So then what we can do to speed up the computations? What if we compile the python code; will that make it faster? **That is exactly what Numba does.**\n\nIn this kernel, we will see how we can speed up numerical computations in python using Numba. \n\nCosine Similarity computation is one of the common operations in NLP while using embeddings. Let us try improving the computation time for it.","fdba1a14":"### Results\n\n\n|No. of computations|Without Numba | With Numba\n|--|--|--|\n|1|83.6 \u00b5s|1.11 \u00b5s|\n|100|8.34 ms|70.9 \u00b5s|\n|1000|86.6 ms|706 \u00b5s|\n|10000|830 ms|7.09 ms|\n|100000|8.08 s|70.2 ms|\n|1000000|1min 27s|699 ms|","80f2fbe8":"We will start by defining two vectors,u and v, of 50 dimensions each.

There is a lot more we can do with Numba. I will leave that exploration to you.\n"}}
