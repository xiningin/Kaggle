Most of the time, spreading false news about a community\u2019s political and religious beliefs can lead to riots and violence as you must have seen in the country where you live. So, to detect fake news, we can find relationships between the fake news headlines so that we can train a machine learning model that can tell us whether a particular piece of information is fake or real by simply observing the headline in the news.","e9b52dd5":"**The dataset has 6335 rows and 4 columns.**"}}
