The work presented in that post only talks about a binary target, but our target has nine unique values which it can assume. We will therefore need to modify the method a bit.\n\nWhat seems like it would be most natural would be to take each feature and generate nine new features (the cardinality of our target), one applying the target encoding framework to each possible value that our target can assume.","daca2395":"There isn't much correlation between the features and classes directly, but interestingly the ones that do show some corelation seem to have roughly the same sign and magnitude of correlation with most of the features.","2728caf7":"# Exploring","2b0b006e":"We can see that there are much fewer unique values per feature than there are total observations, and the most frequent value of each feature is a sizeable fraction of the total number of observations for each feature. Because of this, it seems reasonable to assume all of these features are categorical, since we have no other information about them. This would suggest that any models we try to apply would do best if we treat them accordingly.","df97620d":"I've tried a few of the simpler models provided by Scikit Learn, and the didn't do so well. A random forest seemed to generalize well, however. We will use Optuna to tune our hyperparameters.","9c456ca8":"There is a lot of class imbalance, with half of the instances in the trianing set belonging to Classes 6 and 8, and only a few percent belonging to Classes 4 and 5.","1278d0fc":"# Target Encoding","02161942":"Taking the first 100 principal components seems to put us past the kinks in the cumulative explained PCA variance and hence seems like a reasonable number of features to take.

After target encoding, we have 675 features, which would be a burden to work with.

Better models such as gradient boosted trees may end up with a slightly better end result, but this is good enough for now. Doing more feature engineering may have more of an effect, such as possibly including a denoising autoencoder or finding a better way to encode the features.\n\nFor now, we re-load the best forest and generate our submission:","0d02e65f":"# Importing Data"}}
