In other words, people living in developed countries are more prone to getting the infection of COVID19 than people living in less developed countries. One may question logically how this might be the case, perhaps less developed countries do less testing, thus report less confirmed cases. This analysis also did not consider the impact of different countries\/regions' approaches in their anti-pandemic effort.
