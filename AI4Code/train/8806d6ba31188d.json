Visuals help to easily understand the complex problem. They help in identifying patterns, relationships, and outliers in data. It helps in understanding business problems better and quickly. It helps to build a compelling story based on visuals. Insights gathered from the visuals help in building strategies for businesses. It is also a precursor to many high-level data analysis for Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and Machine Learning(ML)."}}
