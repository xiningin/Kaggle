I calculated **all the beds** that Italy have and some limits thresholds. This doesn't count the difference between adult\/pediatric beds, number of real vacant beds (after all, before the virus spread these beds could already be used by other patients) and country states differences (each Italy state have your ICU beds %, so a state A could bankrupt before a state B for example). If you count those situations and keep infection\/recovery rate constant the health care system would bankrupt earlier than my prediction. As you can see, given a 25% free beds Italy would suffer a **ICU bankrupt** one week earlier than 100%.\n- The **critical period would be between 04\/15 and 05\/01**.

That dataset only shows:\n    - Brazil was at covid pandemic start due to the lack of hospitalization\n    - Subnotification can be a problem in this country given the higher % of missing data\n- Given my case study over Italy\/Spain, I didn't have enough information to say which patient will require an ICU beds. **But**, through SEIR analysis after 01\/may given a constant infection\/recovery\/exposed rate (no action is taken) the doctors would need to choose who lives or die and at this point technical factors doesn't matter so much (worst scenario).\n- This approach can be applied for any country, state or city and is very helpful to understand what is happening. Your implementation is documented here.\n- An important note is that SEIR and SIR assumes that a recovered person is **immune** to COVID. So, if later science discover that COVID can be caught again, this model is not recommended (or will require some changes in your equations).\n- My results shows that **Spain situation is worst than Italy** at march (most of the data come from this period), given the evidences:\n    - They have less ICUs beds and a higher Infection curve\n    - Through my ICU different scenarios analysis Spain ICUs health care system would bankrupt at least one\/two weeks earlier than Italy\n    - Spain showed a fast infected curve than Italy. Looking at SEIR parameters we can see why: infection rate goes from 3.11 in Italy to 76.8 in Spain. Recovery rate didn't show a better improvement to change this: 0.02 in Italy against 0.04 in Spain (still lower compared Spain infection rate magnitude).\n\nBasically, I hope that Spain took action after 01\/04 to avoid this scenario!\n\n## Real world application:\n- My optimization approach could be applied by any scientist\/analyst in any city:\n    - Given the initial curve, optimize your parameters and propose techniques as isolation\/lockdown to minimize infection rate\n    - Apply your solution\n    - After a period you evaluate the actual scenario to verify if your proposed solutions had impact\n    - When the model start to diverge from real curve it's time to optimize your parameters again based in your actual curve\n\nThis can be done in a loop.

Given the fact that SEIR can improve my pandemic dynamic studies I moved on with SEIR.\n\n## Model background\n\nSEIR is a set (system) of ODE (Ordinary Differencial Equations) which models the dynamics of four main dependent variables over time during a pandemic:\n- **S(t)**: Suscetible cases\n- **E(t)**: Exposed cases\n- **I(t)**: Infected cases\n- **R(t)**: Recovered cases\n\nThe mathematical equation is presented bellow:\n![seir](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/32513366\/80239696-101ed200-8637-11ea-8ace-918fb5d98076.PNG)\n\nThe dynamics between then are correlated and reminds SIR system (if you saw my first submission).

This is achieve by lockdown\/isolation techniques.\n\nA higher recovery rate is desired too, because the number of people in hospitals tends to decrease.\n\n\nThis ODE system present your dependent variables (s, i, e and r) in lowercase.

I said good because wasn't perfect for some reasons I think:\n- It's a epidemiological model, so will not be perfect.\n- I measure my residual value (error to minimize) as a LS (Least Square) over a residual for each point in both curves. This was made because I didn't found a better solution for this problem (minize two cost functions at the same time) using ```scipy``` module.\n\nBesides that, the model shows the same dynamic as the original curves which is a good sign.\n\n## SEIR predictions until July\nLet's see this model predictions until July.","1bcb1ebb":"### Change ```fit_seir_model``` to evaluate different recovered column","afc88d43":"## Missing Analysis\nGiven the fact that I know this dataset given a previous work in [Einstein Data Challenge](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaikewreis\/a-second-end-to-end-solution-for-covid-19), I need to visualize my missing samples through a briefly missing analysis.\n\n**PS**: To see a complete missing analysis over this dataset go to [my notebook here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kaikewreis\/a-second-end-to-end-solution-for-covid-19)\n\n### Missing % for each column","1feadcb6":"## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nThe state of missing data in the database in Brazil allows me to make only a brief analysis in relation to the age of patients who contracted COVID-19.
