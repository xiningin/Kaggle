It is not an alternative to actually taking the time to learn. What it aims to do is help someone get started fast and gain intuitive understanding of the typical steps early on.","b46b9700":"## Learn more\nIf you found this example interesting, you may also want to check out:\n\n* [Machine learning in minutes - very fast fundamental examples in Python](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jamiemorales\/machine-learning-in-minutes-very-fast-examples)\n* [List of machine learning methods & datasets](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jamiemorales\/list-of-machine-learning-methods-datasets)\n\nThanks for reading.

We also want to find interesting relationships or patterns that we can possibly leverage in solving the problem we specified.","d8cdacf4":"## Step 2: Preprocess data and understand some more\nThis step typically takes the most time in the cycle but for our purposes, most of the datasets chosen in this series are clean.\n\nReal-world datasets are noisy and incomplete. The choices we make in this step to address data issues can impact downstream steps and the result itself. For example, it can be tricky to address missing data when we don't know why it's missing. Is it missing completely at random or not? It can also be tricky to address outliers if we do not understand the domain and problem context enough."}}
