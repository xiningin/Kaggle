Please checkout [this](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/masumrumi\/a-stats-analysis-and-ml-workflow-of-house-pricing) kernel at Kaggle. \n\nWe will explain more on MSE later. For now, let's just say, the closer the value of MSE is to \"0\", the better. Of course, it makes sense since we are talking about an error(mean squared error). We want to minimize this error. How can we do that? \n\nIntroducing **Linear Regression**, one of the most basic and straightforward models. Many of us may have learned to show the relationship between two variable using something called \"y equals mX plus b.\" Let's refresh our memory and call upon on that equation.\n\n\n\n# $$ {y} = mX + b $$\n\n\n\nHere, \n* **m** = slope of the regression line. It represents the relationship between X and y. In another word, it gives weight as to for each x(horizontal space) how much y(vertical space) we have to cover. In machine learning, we call it **coefficient**. \n* **b** = y-intercept. \n* **x** and **y** are the data points located in x_axis and y_axis respectively. \n\n\n<br\/>\n\nIf you would like to know more about this equation, Please check out this [video](https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/math\/algebra\/two-var-linear-equations\/writing-slope-intercept-equations\/v\/graphs-using-slope-intercept-form). \n\nThis slope equation gives us an exact linear relationship between X and y. This relationship is \"exact\" because we are given X and y beforehand and based on the value of X and y, we come up with the slope and y-intercept, which in turns determine the relationship between X and y. However, in real life, data is not that simple. Often the relationship is unknown to us, and even if we know the relationship, it may not always be exact. To fit an exact slope equation in an inexact relationship of data we introduce the term error. Let's see how mathematicians express this error with the slope equation. \n\n## $$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon \\\\ $$\n\nAnd, this is the equation for a simple linear regression.\nHere,\n* y = Dependent variable. This is what we are trying to estimate\/solve\/understand. \n* $\\beta_0$ = the y-intercept, it is a constant and it represents the value of y when x is 0. \n* $\\beta_1$ = Slope, Weight, Coefficient of x. This metrics is the relationship between y and x. In simple terms, it shows 1 unit increase in y changes when 1 unit increases in x. \n* $x_1$ = Independent variable ( simple linear regression ) \/variables.\n* $ \\epsilon$ = error or residual. \n\n### $$ \\text{residual}_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i$$\nThis error is the only part that's different\/addition from the slope equation. This error exists because in real life we will never have a dataset where the regression line crosses exactly every single data point. There will be at least a good amount of points where the regression line will not be able to go through for the sake of model specifications and ** bias-variance tradeoff **(more on this later). This error term accounts for the difference of those points. So, simply speaking, an error is the difference between an original value( $y_i$ ) and a predicted value( $\\hat{y}_i$ ). \n\nWe use this function to predict the values of one dependent(target) variable based on one independent(predictor) variable. Therefore this regression is called **Simple linear regression(SLR).** If we were to write the equation regarding the sample example above it would simply look like the following equation, \n## $$ Sale Price= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (Area) + \\epsilon \\\\ $$\n\nThis equation gives us a line that fits the data and often performs better than the average line above. But,\n* How do we know that Linear regression line is actually performing better than the average line? \n* What metrics can we use to answer that? \n* How do we know if this line is even the best line(best-fit line) for the dataset? \n* If we want to get even more clear on this we may start with answering, How do we find the $\\beta_0$(intercept) and  $\\beta_1$(coefficient) of the equation?\n\n<b>Finding $\\beta_0$(intercept) and  $\\beta_1$(coefficient):<\/b>\n\nWe can use the following equation to find the $\\beta_0$(intercept) and  $\\beta_1$(coefficient)\n\n\n### $$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = r_{xy} \\frac{s_y}{s_x}$$\n### $$ \\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x} $$\n\nHere...\n- $\\bar{y}$ : the sample mean of observed values $Y$\n- $\\bar{x}$ : the sample mean of observed values $X$\n- $s_y$ : the sample standard deviation of observed values $Y$\n- $s_x$ : the sample standard deviation of observed values $X$\n\n    > There are two types of STD's. one is for sample population and one is for Total population.\n    > Check out [this](https:\/\/statistics.laerd.com\/statistical-guides\/measures-of-spread-standard-deviation.php) article for more. \n\n- $r_{xy}$ : the sample Pearson correlation coefficient between observed $X$ and $Y$\n\n\nI hope most of us know how to calculate all these components from the two equations above by hand. I am going to only mention the equation of the pearson correlation(r_xy) here as it may be unknown to some of the readers. \n\n### $$ r_{xy}= \\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2{\\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}}$$\n\nLet's get on with calculating the rest by coding.","f039e021":"### SalePrice vs OverallQual","ea739c4b":"# Fitting model(simple approach)\n\n## Train_test split\n \nWe have separated dependent and independent features; We have separated train and test data. So, why do we still have to split our training data? If you are curious about that, I have the answer. For this competition, when we train the machine learning algorithms, we use part of the training set, usually two-thirds of the train data. Once we train our algorithm using 2\/3 of the train data, we start to test our algorithms using the remaining data. If the model performs well, we dump our test data in the algorithms to predict and submit the competition.

Before building a multiple linear regression model, we need to check that these assumptions below are valid.\n## Assumptions of Regression\n\n* **Linearity ( Correct functional form )** \n* **Homoscedasticity ( Constant Error Variance )( vs Heteroscedasticity ). **\n* **Independence of Errors ( vs Autocorrelation ) **\n* **Multivariate Normality ( Normality of Errors ) **\n* **No or little Multicollinearity. ** \n\nSince we fit a linear model, we assume that the relationship is **linear** and the errors, or residuals, are pure random fluctuations around the true line. We assume that the variability in the response(dependent) variable doesn't increase as the value of the predictor(independent) increases, which is the assumptions of equal variance, also known as **Homoscedasticity**. We also assume that the observations are independent of one another(**No Multicollinearity**) and a correlation between sequential observations or auto-correlation are not there.\n\nNow, these assumptions are prone to happen altogether. In other words, if we see one of these assumptions in the dataset, it's more likely that we may come across with one of the different assumptions. Similarly, we can find and fix various assumptions with a few unique techniques.\n\nSo, **How do we check regression assumptions? We fit a regression line and look for the variability of the response data along the regression line.** Let's apply this for each one of them.\n\n**Linearity ( Correct functional form )** \nLinear regression needs the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable to be linear. The linearity assumption can be tested with scatter plots. The following two examples depict two cases, where no or little linearity is present. ","6dc5761c":"## Observation. \nAs we can see, the multicollinearity still exists in various features. However, we will keep them for now for the sake of learning and lets models(e.x.

The residual will look like an unstructured cloud of points centered around zero. However, our residual plot is anything but an unstructured cloud of points. Even though it seems like there is a linear relationship between the response variable and predictor variable, the residual plot looks more like a funnel. The error plot shows that as **GrLivArea** value increases the variance also increases, which is the characteristics known as **Heteroscedasticity**; another assumption of linear regression. Let's break this down. \n\n**Homoscedasticity ( Constant Variance ):** \nThe assumption of Homoscedasticity is crucial to linear regression models. Homoscedasticity describes a situation in which the error term or variance or the \"noise\" or random disturbance in the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is same across all values of the independent variable. In other words, there is a constant variance present in the response variable as the predictor variable increases. If the \"noise\" is not the same across the values of an independent variable like the residual plot above, we call that **Heteroscedasticity**. As you can tell, it is the opposite of **Homoscedasticity.**\n\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.dummies.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/415147.image1.jpg\" style=\"float:center\"><\/img><\/p>\n\nThis plot above is an excellent example of Homoscedasticity. As you can see, the residual variance is the same as the value of the predictor variable increases. One way to fix this Heteroscedasticity is by using a transformation method like log-transformation or box-cox transformation. We will do that later.\n\n**Multivariate Normality ( Normality of Errors):**\nThe linear regression analysis requires the dependent variable to be multivariate normally distributed. A histogram or a Q-Q-Plot can check whether the target variable is normally distributed or not. The goodness of fit test, e.g., the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or can check for normality in the dependent variable. We already know that our target variable does not follow a normal distribution. Let's bring back the three charts to show our target variable.","a7572ffd":"## Dealing with Missing Values\n> **Missing data in train and test data(all_data)**","301a964d":"\n\nThe evaluation metrics often named in such a way that I find it confusing to remember. So, this is a guide for me and everyone else who is reading it. There are many evaluation metrics. Let's name a few of them. \n\nIt may seem confusing with multiple similar abbreviations, but once we focus on what they each do, things will become much more intuitive. For now, I am going to dive right into the $R^2$.\n\n# $R^2$(The \"Coefficient of determination\"): \n> $R^2$ describes the proportion of variance of the dependent variable explained by the regression model. Let's write the equation for $R^2$. \n\n# $$ \\operatorname{R^2} = \\frac{SSR}{SST} $$\n\nHere,\n\n* SST(Sum of the Total Squared Error) is the total residual. It is also known as TSS(Total Sum of the Squared Error)\n* SSR(Sum of the Squared Regression) is the residual explained by the regression line. SSR is also known as ESS(Explained Sum of the Squared Error)\n\nand\n\n* SSE(Sum of the Squared Error)\/RSS(Residual Sum of the Squared Error)\nLet's break these down. \n\n## SST\/TSS:\nSST is the sum of the squared distance from all points to average line ( $\\bar{y}$ ). We call this the **total variation** in the Y's of the **Total Sum of the Squares(SST).** Let's see it in the function. \n### $$ \\operatorname{SST} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\bar{y}\\right)^2 $$\n\nHere\n* $y_i$ = Each observed data point. \n* $\\bar{y}$ = Mean of y value.\n* $\\hat{y_i}$ = Predicted data point for each $x_i$ depending on i. \n\nA visualization would make things much more clear.\n![](http:\/\/blog.hackerearth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/anat.png)\n \nIn this visualization above, the light green line is the <font color=\"green\"><b>average line<\/b><\/font> and the black dot is the observed value. So, SST describes the distance between the black dot and the <font color=\"green\"><b>average line<\/b><\/font>.\n\n\n## SSR\/ESS:\nSSR is the sum of the squared residual between each predicted value and the average line. In statistics language we say that, SSR is the squared residual explained by the regression line. In the visualization above SSR is the distance from <font color='green'><b>baseline model<\/b><\/font> to the <font color = 'blue'><b>regression line.<\/b><\/font> \n### $$ SSR = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\hat{y_i} - \\bar{y}\\right)^2 $$\n\n## SSE\/RSS: \nRSS is calculated by squaring each residual of the data points and then adding them together. This residual is the difference between the predicted line and the observed value. In statistics language, we say, SSE is the squared residual that was not explained by the regression line, and this is the quantity least-square minimizes. In the chart above SSE is the distance of the actual data point from the <font color = 'blue'><b>regression line<\/b><\/font>. \n\n### $$ SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2 $$\n\nAnd the relation between all three of these metrics is\n## $$SST = SSR + SSE$$\n\n\nFrom the equation above and the $R^2$ equation from the top we can modify the $R^2$ equation as the following\n# $$ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SST} $$\n\n## More on $R^2$: \n* $R^2$ is matric with a value between 0 and 1. \n* If the points are perfectly linear, then error sum of squares is 0, In that case, SSR = SST. Which means the variation in the Y's is completely explained by the regression line causing the value of $R^2$ to be close to 1. \n* In other extreme cases, when there is no relation between x and y, hence SSR = 0 and therefore SSE = SST, The regression line explains none of the variances in Y causing $R^2$ to be close to 0.\n* $R^2$ measures the explanatory power of the model; The more of the variance in the dependent variable(Y) the model can explain, the more powerful it is.\n* $R^2$ can be infinitely negative as well. Having a negative indicates that the predictive equation has a greater error than the baseline model.\n* The value of $R^2$ increases as more feature gets added despite the effectiveness of those features in the model.\n* This is a problem, since we may think that having a greater $R^2$ means a better model, even though the model didnot actually improved. In order to get around this we use Adjusted R-Squared($R^2_{adj}$)\n\n**Adjusted R-Squared($R^2_{adj}$)**: \n\n$R^2_{adj}$ is similar to $R^2$. However, the value of$R^2_{adj}$ decreases if we use a feature that doesn't improve the model significantly. Let's write the equation for $R^2_{adj}$. \n\n## $$ {R^2_{adj}} = 1 - [\\frac{(1 - R^2)(n-1)}{(n-k-1)}]$$\n\nhere, \n* n = # of datapoints. \n* k = # of feature used. \n\nAs you can see from the equation, the increase of k(feature) in the denumerator penilizes the adjusted $R^2$ value if there is not a significant improvement of $R^2$ in the numerator.

However, Let's dive deep into some more complex regression. \n\n### Regularization Models\nWhat makes regression model more effective is its ability of *regularizing*. The term \"regularizing\" stands for models ability **to structurally prevent overfitting by imposing a penalty on the coefficients.** \n\n\nThere are three types of regularizations. \n* **Ridge**\n* **Lasso**\n* **Elastic Net**\n\nThese regularization methods work by penalizing **the magnitude of the coefficients of features** and at the same time **minimizing the error between the predicted value and actual observed values**.  This minimization becomes a balance between the error (the difference between the predicted value and observed value) and the size of the coefficients. The only difference between Ridge and Lasso is **the way they penalize the coefficients.** Elastic Net is the combination of these two. **Elastic Net** adds both the sum of the squares errors and the absolute value of the squared error. To get more in-depth of it, let us review the least squared loss function. \n\n**Ordinary least squared** loss function minimizes the residual sum of the square(RSS) to fit the data:\n\n### $$ \\text{minimize:}\\; RSS = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta_j x_j\\right)\\right)^2 $$\n\nLet's review this equation once again, Here: \n* $y_i$ is the observed value. \n* $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value. \n* The error = $y_i$ - $\\hat{y}_i$\n* The square of the error = $(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$\n* The sum of the square of the error = $\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$, that's the equation on the left. \n* The only difference between left sides equation vs. the right sides one above is the replacement of $\\hat{y}_i$, it is replaced by $\\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta_j x_j\\right)$, which simply follow's the slope equation, y = mx+b, where, \n* $\\beta_0$ is the intercept. \n* **$\\beta_j$ is the coefficient of the feature($x_j$).**\n\nLet's describe the effect of regularization and then we will learn how we can use loss function in Ridge.\n* One of the benefits of regularization is that it deals with **multicollinearity**(high correlation between predictor variables) well, especially Ridge method. Lasso deals with **multicollinearity** more brutally by penalizing related coefficients and force them to become zero, hence removing them. However, **Lasso** is well suited for redundant variables. \n \n***\n<div>\n    \n ### Ridge:\nRidge regression adds penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. This penalty is added to the least square loss function above and looks like this...\n\n### $$ \\text{minimize:}\\; RSS+Ridge = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta_j x_j\\right)\\right)^2 + \\lambda_2\\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2$$\n\nHere, \n* $\\lambda_2$ is constant; a regularization parameter. It is also known as $\\alpha$. The higher the value of this constant the more the impact in the loss function. \n    * When $\\lambda_2$ is 0, the loss funciton becomes same as simple linear regression. \n    * When $\\lambda_2$ is $\\infty$, the coefficients become 0\n    * When $\\lambda_2$ is between  0 and $\\infty$(0<$\\lambda_2$<$\\infty$), The $\\lambda_2$ parameter will decide the miagnitude given to the coefficients. The coefficients will be somewhere between 0 and ones for simple linear regression. \n* $\\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2$, is the squared sum of all coefficients. \n\nNow that we know every nitty-gritty details about this equation, let's use it for science, but before that a couple of things to remember. \n* It is essential to standardize the predictor variables before constructing the models. \n* It is important to check for multicollinearity,","d8ae3d96":"Here we are plotting our target variable with two independent variables **GrLivArea** and **MasVnrArea**.

One thing to take note here, there are some outliers in the dataset. It is imperative to check for outliers since linear regression is sensitive to outlier effects. Sometimes we may be trying to fit a linear regression model when the data might not be so linear, or the function may need another degree of freedom to fit the data. In that case, we may need to change our function depending on the data to get the best possible fit. In addition to that, we can also check the residual plot, which tells us how is the error variance across the true line. Let's look at the residual plot for independent variable **GrLivArea** and our target variable **SalePrice **. ","2a2c4f99":"Here, we can see that the pre-transformed chart on the left has heteroscedasticity, and the post-transformed chart on the right has almost an equal amount of variance across the zero lines.\n\n**No or Little multicollinearity:** \nMulticollinearity is when there is a strong correlation between independent variables. Linear regression or multilinear regression requires independent variables to have little or no similar features. Multicollinearity can lead to a variety of problems, including:\n* The effect of predictor variables estimated by our regression will depend on what other variables are included in our model. \n* Predictors can have wildly different results depending on the observations in our sample, and small changes in samples can result in very different estimated effects. \n* With very high multicollinearity, the inverse matrix, the computer calculates may not be accurate. \n* We can no longer interpret a coefficient on a variable as the effect on the target of a one-unit increase in that variable holding the other variables constant. The reason behind that is, when predictors are strongly correlated, there is not a scenario in which one variable can change without a conditional change in another variable.\n\nHeatmap is an excellent way to identify whether there is multicollinearity or not. The best way to solve multicollinearity is to use regularization methods like Ridge or Lasso.","e0b27d50":"### Missing Train values","028ad646":"> ** Sample Test Dataset**","e6a6c0b0":"Now that we have our predicted y values let's see how the predicted regression line looks in the graph.","d3bd1a87":"On the two charts above, the left one is the average line, and the right one is the regression line. <font color=\"blue\"><b>Blue<\/b><\/font> dots are observed data points and <font color=\"red\"><b>red<\/b><\/font> lines are error distance from each observed data points to model-predicted line.

Let's look at another scatter plot with a different feature.\n\n### SalePrice vs GarageArea","80123260":"# A Glimpse of the datasets.\n> **Sample Train Dataset**","a40ae1d7":"Now, let's make sure that the target variable follows a normal distribution.

The equation is as follows.\n\n## $$ \\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_n x_n $$\n\nHere, We already know parts of the equation, and from there we can keep adding new features and their coefficients with the equations. Quite simple, isn't it. \n\nWe can have a target variable predicted by multiple independent variables using this equation. Therefore this equation is called **Multiple Linear Regression.** Let's try this regression in the housing dataset.\n"}}
