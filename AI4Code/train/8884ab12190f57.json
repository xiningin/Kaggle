As lymph fluid leaves the breast and eventually goes back into the bloodstream, the lymph nodes try to catch and trap cancer cells before they reach other parts of the body. Having cancer cells in the lymph nodes under your arm suggests an increased risk of the cancer spreading. \n**When lymph nodes are free, or clear, of cancer, the test results are negative. If lymph nodes have some cancer cells in them, they are called positive.** Your pathology report will tell you how many lymph nodes were removed, and of those, how many tested positive for the presence of cancer cells. \n**For example, 0\/3 means 3 nodes were removed and 0 were positive, while 2\/5 means 5 were removed and 2 were positive.**","25ce8745":"# Assignment 1 : Perform EDA on Haberman's Cancer Survival Dataset","8ee55c95":"**CONCLUSION**","fc0672fd":"**_Observation(s) :_**\n1. The Violin plot between the axillary nodes and the survival status shows that the probability of the patients surviving after the operations is high when the number of positive axillary nodes are less than ~5.","f69a98ee":"**_Observation(s) :_**\n1. The Patient's who are having age between 30 to 34 have survived. Also, the patients who are having age more than 77 have unfortunately died. However, the mean of both the survival status according to the patient's age is the same.\n2. It is quite evident from the whisker's plot between survival status and patient's year of operation that patient who was undergoing an operation before 1960 and after 1965 had higher chances of survival. However, we cannot confirm the reason why! Confidently trying to infer from such graph is quite difficult.\n3. The patients who are having less than 3 positive axillary nodes had higher chances for survival. Also, the patients who are having more than 10 positive Axillary nodes had very fewer chances of survival.\n4. Thus, just by the overall conclusion, we can infer that the year of operation does not add any luck towards the classification.","837607ce":"**_Observation(s) :_**\n1. The total number of observations\/data points are 306.\n2. We can now confirm that all the columns in the dataset are numeric.\n3. There are no missing values in the dataset.\n4. Since the SurvivalStatus column is the class attribute, it's data-type need to be changed from numeric to categorical datatype.\n5. The Survival Status can be mapped as 'Survived' for those patients who survived after surgery and 'Died' for those patients who unfortunately died within 5 years after surgery.
