Drop Irrelevant Columns\n\nIn this section, we will delete the columns that will not work for us from the dataset. Here is the only one we will not use the column is \"_region_\", so we just need to delete it:","cfba4311":"<a id=\"43\"><\/a> <br>\n### 4.3. Split Data and Target\n\nWe can't give the whole dataset to the model as it is. First we need to set the data and target part of it. Here, the data part is called X, while the target part is called Y. Now split the data and target partitions and assign each of them to variables named X and Y:","06fdd9ba":"Since the value we will examine as an output here is \"_charges_\", we need to examine the relationship of the other columns with it. To do this, let's draw Scatter Plots between the numeric columns and the \"_charges_\" column:","d36e363a":"<a id=\"32\"><\/a> <br>\n### 3.2. Correlation of Columns(Attributes)\n\nIn this section, we'll find the correlation matrix between the columns and we'll visualize it into a Heatmap. In this way, we will be able to see the relationship between the attributes more clearly and visualize them in the future.","afc3bd19":"<a id=\"42\"><\/a> <br>\n### 4.2. Correction of Column(Attribute) Names\n\nIn this section we will use more readable column names instead existing column names if there are spaces and unwanted characters. There is no problem with column names in the dataset we use. But in order to show how the process is done, I'll change them all to the name I want and all to be capitalized:","8ad17e1e":"<a id=\"7\"><\/a> <br>\n## 7. EXPLORATION OF RESULTS\n\nIn general, let's put all the results of the models into the table:","944571d2":"<a id=\"44\"><\/a> <br>\n### 4.4. Handling Missing Values\n\nThere is no missing value in this dataset. Therefore, we do not have any action here.","b856723b":"<a id=\"53\"><\/a> <br>\n### 5.3. Decision Tree Regression\n\nCreate a Decision Tree Regression model and fit the data (we use 13 for randomness seed value):","aeb674cd":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a> <br>\n## 6. EVALUATING MODELS\n\nIn this section we will do some measurements to evaluate the performance on the models we fit. In addition, 10-Fold Cross Validation method will perform the validation process. R Squared Score method will be used for calculating the accuracy of the models. Mean Squared Error (MSE) method will be used for error measurement. As the MSE result can be very large, its square root will be taken and converted into RMSE. The error and accuracy calculation shall be performed on both the test and training dataset. Let's first perform evaluation for each model by importing the necessary functions:"}}
