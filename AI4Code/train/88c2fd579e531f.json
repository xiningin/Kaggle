This will be a simpler procedure than the lecture, since we will utilize the pipeline methods for more complex tasks.\n\nWe will use the [Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/yelp-recsys-2013).\n\nEach observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.\n\nThe \"stars\" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.\n\nThe \"cool\" column is the number of \"cool\" votes this review received from other Yelp users. \n\nAll reviews start with 0 \"cool\" votes, and there is no limit to how many \"cool\" votes a review can receive. In other words, it is a rating of the review itself, not a rating of the business.\n\nThe \"useful\" and \"funny\" columns are similar to the \"cool\" column.","e17a3610":"**Create a new column called \"text length\" which is the number of words in the text column.**"}}
