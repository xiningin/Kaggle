years old to 83 years old.

Out of all of the people that were unarmed and were not fleeing there were 24 with signs of mental illness and 14 total were killed while the officer had a body camera. For our analytical purposes we are worried about the last two columns which come to the same conclusion. There were 29 black citizens, 19 hispanic citizens, and 39 white citizens that were killed by police while they were unarmed and not fleeing. A total of the 90 out of almost 2000 killings were done to people who were unarmed and not fleeing.

So we do not sway the analysis of race we are just going to take out all the observations that do not have a race associated and for the sake of a consistent dataset we will just make a new dataset that also take out missing values in the columns, \"armed\", \"age\", and \"flee\".","b0addb02":"It is  apparent that the rate that Black citizens are being killed at is much higher than any other race in the United States. From the graph the rate of Black citizens being killed is almost twice the rate of the next highest rate. In terms of rate the White citizens are second to last. Now we will dig a little deeper and look at the numbers for race vs. age and seeing if there is any correlation.","4966c560":"This shows how many people by each race were killed by police while unarmed. The Black population in this two year span had 59 unarmed people killed by police and the White population had 60 unarmed people killed by police. It is interesting to see that the Asian population had 0 unarmed people killed by police. Now that we have general information on citizens killed while unarmed we will start calculating the rates.","37f8782c":"Taking a further look at race I now want to make a simple graph and see if there are any trends, and then decide whether there are any leads to explore.","a817a32d":"By taking a thorough look through the race column it can be seen that there is a consistent trend going on. In all of the sections we looked at the rate was almost twice as high for the black population.","2b15fb38":"To introduce the column of race more we will look at an overview of the deaths by race. The focus of this section however, is to look at the rate at which each race is being killed by police. This is more valuable information than just counting how many people from each race have been killed because we are able to weigh our information by comparing deaths by population.","3181c7bd":"Again we will look at this in terms of a big population since these decimals dont illustrate a whole lot. To better visualize the rate of unarmed killings we will just make projections for the White population in 2016 like we did in the above section.","de568928":"We will start by just visualizing how many people separated by race were killed by police in the two year span we are analyzing. Another important bit of information is what each letter represents in our outputs.

It can be shown from above that the numbers are fairly close together except that the rate of deaths of Black citizens seem to be higher than the other races, and the Asian citizens seem to be lower than the other races. It does not have the same effect looking just at numbers, so we will look at graphs illustrating these numbers.","483ed720":"Statistically the most deaths came from the White population, almost twice as much as the next race which is the Black population. Like mentioned above what has not factored in yet, are the rates based on the population of each race. For this part I'll take information from Statista that will give me the population of each race in the United States. The link will be inserted below:\n[https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/183489\/population-of-the-us-by-ethnicity-since-2000\/](http:\/\/)","89b005e7":"What this boxplot is illustrating is the information that was previously looked at earlier only this time separated by race. Above this graph we can see the mean for each race. All of the races are consistently in there 30's and all of them being in the early 30's with the exception of the White population that had there mean centered around late 30's. From the graph it looks like the race with the most range of killings is the White population who looks to have the min and max values of our dataset. The Asian, Hispanic and Black population look very close together. The Native American population seems to have the least amount of range having the people killed by police being between late teens and late 40's. ","6a9b4cc5":"# Not Fleeing Suspects Killed by Race","c870ae44":"This means by proportion of the population the amount of people killed from law enforcement by race is:\n\n* White                 (.0004%)\n* Black                 (.0012%)\n* Hispanic              (.0006%)\n* Asian                 (.0002%)\n* Native American       (.0006%)","92ec970c":"Unarmed Black citizens are being killed twice as much as the Hispanic or Native American population and four times as much as the White population. The Hispanic and Native American population also have a fairly high rate of unarmed citizens being killed.","0b8e6cb9":"By the looks of it we have 2142 observations. There seems to be a decent amount of missing data in our set so we will want to work through cleaning up the data.","f81dc072":"# Analysis of Police Shootings by Race","424df86b":"# Not Fleeing and Unarmed Killed by Race","c376a869":"This data has a lot of insightful information that we can analyze. We will be looking in detail mainly at race and it's relation to other columns like armed, age, and flee. ","1117bbf3":"Now that we have taken a general look at the killings by race we will now analyze killings based off some different columns. More specifically in this section we will be looking at unarmed killings by race. Again the races are as follows:\n\n* A -- Asian population\n* B -- Black population\n* H -- Hispanic population\n* N -- Native American population\n* O -- Other population\n* W -- White Population","83b424ba":"We have 89 females that were killed in this dataset and 2052 males that were killed, so for analysis we will just go ahead and keep the genders grouped together.","488d612c":"Again we are able to see a constant trend that the black population rate is two times that of the hispanic population and four times the rate of the white population. Consistently, the more and more we break columns down the more we see similar trends.","349476a8":"From here we are able to get totals for the amount of people that were killed not fleeing the police by race. From the numbers above the amount of White citizens that were killed while not fleeing accounted for over half of all those killed. The Black population also has a high number as well as the Hispanic population. Like above we determined that the amount of people not fleeing accounted for a little over 68% of the whole dataset, so in the next section we will be looking at how this factors in to those who were also unarmed. For now another chart was made below to illustrate fleeing vs. non-fleeing deaths. After we will continue looking at trends by looking at the rates at which each race is being killed at.","2c35ae6b":"Right now these percentages don't mean a whole lot by looking at it for a couple seconds, but if looked at closely it can be seen that the rate at which the Black population is being killed is 3 times higher than the White population, and 2 times higher than the next races which are the Native American population and the Hispanic population. It seems like the lowest rate of killings is the Asian population, but besides the Black population the rates seem to be fairly close together. An easier way to visualize the rates is if we create a population of 1,000,000 people for each race and using the rates see the projected numbers of how many people would be killed by police. Also, just to look at the numbers in another way we will also set the population of the other races to the population of the White race which again was made up of 248,410,000 people in 2016.\n","1965e84f":"# Washington Post Police Shooting Analysis\n","352e6259":"This graph gives us a better visual of what is going on, and we are starting to see a similar trend throughout the whole dataset. The Black population has constantly been getting killed at a much higher rate than any other race.","6bd6e82a":"It looks like the Black population has the highest rate for those killed while not fleeing. The Asian population has the lowest rate and the other rates are close together in between the black and asian population rates.","58574f43":"This project will take a look at killings that took place at the hands of police officers in the United States from the beginning of 2015 to into February 2017. The main goal is to just take a look at the data and see if there are any trends going on. The main variable I will be looking at is race.\n\nDetails about data content:\n[https:\/\/github.com\/washingtonpost\/data-police-shootings\/](http:\/\/)","12911500":"In conclusion, by taking a thorough look through the race column it can be seen that there is a consistent trend going on. In all of the sections we looked at the rate was almost twice as high for the black population. If the numbers were closer it could maybe be interpreted that it is just random chance differences, but when all of the rates are consistently that high for the black population then questions need to start being asked.","bf6dfdd9":"From above we can see that there are four different classifications in the 'flee' category. These are Not fleeing, Car, Foot, and Other. We can see that the Not fleeing classification occurred 1358 times which makes up for 68% of the dataset. To make our analysis easier to do we will make a new column called 'fleeornot' that has two unique values, \"Not Fleeing\" or \"Flee\".","6061f29e":"Each race looks to be getting killed more by fleeing than by not fleeing. The distance between fleeing and not fleeing seem especially distant in the black population, hispanic population and the white population, but this could also just be because there are more murders in each of those races in general. Lets obtain the valuable data within this section which is the rate."}}
