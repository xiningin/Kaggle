A trade deficit is not necessarily detrimental, because it often corrects itself over time. An increase in imported goods from other countries decreases the price of consumer goods in the nation, as foreign competition increases. The lower price tags help reduce the threat of inflation in the local economy, and an increase in imports also increases the variety of goods and services available to a nation\u2019s residents. A fast-growing economy might import more, as it expands, so its residents may consume more than the country can produce. Consequently, a trade deficit may indicate a growing economy.\n## Problems of Trade deficit\nIn the long run, however, a trade deficit may lead to fewer jobs. If the country is importing more goods from foreign companies, prices will decline, and domestic companies may be unable to produce items that compete with lower costs. Manufacturing companies are usually hit the hardest when a country imports more than it exports. This impact results in fewer jobs or lower incomes for employees, due to the competition from imports. Fewer jobs mean fewer products are produced in the economy which, in turn, leads to even more imports and a greater deficit.\n\n## Real World Example\nThe U.S. holds the distinction of owning the world's largest trade deficit since 1975. In 2013, the deficit in goods and services was more than $472 billion, mainly because the country imported and consumed significantly more electronics, raw materials, oil, and other items than it sold to foreign countries. \n\n\n\n[source](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/t\/trade_deficit.asp)","c229da38":"**DATA LOADING**","00a51330":"We found that **UNSPECIFIED** country in the list of countries of above ","3e68165a":"To check which country does not import anything to **India**","859436f0":"**DATA SNEAKPEAK**","2088e29f":"In both the File we have 5 columns each.\n\n* HSCode - HS stands for Harmonized System.
