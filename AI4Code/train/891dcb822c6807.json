There is no **customer_id** in NewCustomerList.\n- Number of columns are inconsistent because in NewCustomerList there are **4 columns which are Unnamed** and they contain some values as well, however

I was provided data sets of an organization targeting a client who wants a feedback from us on their dataset quality and how this can be improved.\n\n### Purpose \nPrimarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. \n\n\u201cthe importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.\u201d \n\nPerform the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd\u2019s data.\n\n### Datasets\nThe client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:\n- Customer Demographic \n- Customer Addresses\n- Transactions data in the past 3 months\n\n### Data Quality Framework Table\nUsing the dimensions included in the Data Quality Framework, I will assess the quality of these datasets. Followings are the dimesnions provided by the Data Quality Framework: \n- Completeness : How much information all entities have. Number of missing values.\n- Consistency : How conistent is your Data. Number of inconsistencies in your data.\n- Accuarcy : How accurate is your Data. Number of errors in you data.\n- Relevancy\/Auditability : Relevanct data in your entities. Number of irrelavant values.\n- Validity : Validated data with allowable values.\n- Uniqueness: How much uniques is your data. Number of duplicated values.\n- Timeliness: Updated data. Current data.\n","f321a32e":"## Highlights of Consistency and Validity in Transactions\nTransactions dataset has 20000 records with 13 columns. \n- Out of which, 3 are of datatype **int64** which are keys. \n- One is the date **datetime64** in format **MM\/DD\/YYYY**. The date format used to capture DOB of customers is **YYYY-MM-DD**. It would be better if it is kept consistent.\n- Another one is Online Order which is captured in a column of **float64** datatype, however the values are **boolean**, that is true and false. \n- 5 columns are of datatype **object** which are order_status, brand, product_line, product_class, product_size. \n- Last 3 columns are of datatype **float64** again from which one of them is a date and should be **datetime64** and must be in the standard format."}}
