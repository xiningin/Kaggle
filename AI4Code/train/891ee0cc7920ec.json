Let's explain them:\n> POC is a code used to distinguish between different monitors at one site that are measuring a parameter. For example, the first monitor established to measure CO at a site would have POC = \"1\". If an additional monitor were established at the same site to measure CO, that monitor would have POC = \"2\". However, if a new instrument were installed to replace the original instrument used as the first monitor, that would be the same monitor and it would have POC = \"1\". For criteria pollutants, data from different sampling methods should only be stored under the same POC if the sampling intervals are the same and the methods or references are equivalent. For sites where duplicate sampling is being conducted by multiple agencies or one agency with multiple samplers, multiple POC's must be utilized to store all samples. For non-criteria pollutants, data from multiple sampling methods can be stored under the same POC if the sampling intervals are the same. <br><br>\n> The AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air. \\[...\\] An AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to the national air quality standard for the pollutant, which is the level EPA has set to protect public health. AQI values below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is considered to be unhealthy-at first for certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher. \n<br>https:\/\/cfpub.epa.gov\/airnow\/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi","a0020dc3":"Now I will narrow it down to the site of interest and add data for 2018 and 2019.","e8c2a288":"The subset I will consider is daily measures of SO2 concentration in the air in Philadelphia county, PA.
