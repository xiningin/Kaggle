I would love to see what the community comes up with using these data.","7b1d67ff":"We can see here that on days in which the track was not considered fast (i.e. optimal), the starting odds of the top 3 tend to be higher. On a muddy day at the track, the top three finishers tend to have **much** higher odds, meaning they were rated as less likely to win. So, there is some evidence that the track conditions may level the playing field a bit.","0370cab5":"# Plotting the Data\nFirst, we can take a look at the distribution of the betting odds.","f9c3fc15":"Now, we can see how the payout for a win bet varies according to a horses odds. Only horses who actually win have information on their payout for a win.","5da2bf79":"# Introduction\n![](https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8453\/8054927083_e503602d8b_b.jpg)This is a brief starter kernel looking at the Triple Crown dataset.
