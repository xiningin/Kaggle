However classification has two other targets, if a team won the spread bet and if the team went over or under the total. So in total there are potentially 2 different regression models and 3 different classification models. Below are the 5 number summaries for the regression targets (again based on away team). ","fc42b286":"## O\/U\nNext we look at the average O\/U. It is worth northing that there has been a three point revolution in recent years and that the average O\/U has been increasing year by year as offensive basketball has become more efficient, through a more analytical modernization of offenses. This trend is very clear when looking at boxplots of the year by year O\/U, there is a clear uptrend from around a 195 O\/U average in the 2012-2013 season to around 220 in 2018-19.","1029b016":"## Money Line\nFinally we take a look at the money line which is the odds a team will win the game. We can see that home teams are favored as road teams have a higher ML meaning they get paid out more if they win. Remeber that ML is quoted in 100 dollars. ","61c1760d":"## Spreads\nLets explore some of this betting data. I have included almost 10 years of betting data and scores and we shall chain them up in a large frame and look at some statistics. We will use the average lines from the 5 betting books. Below we see the distribution of spreads from 2012-2019 from the perspective of the away team. Values above 0 indicate the home team is favored while values below 0 indicate the away team is favored. Taking the average of these values, we can see that the value playing at home is roughly 3 points.","9adddb61":"Here we can see that the spread and over\/under models do not suffer from class imbalance, but money line model does.","ea640e98":"# **NBA Betting Primer**\n\nThere are three major bets made on NBA games (and most sporting events for that matter)\n\n1. Spread\n2. Over\/Under\n3. Money Line\n\nMoney Line is the easiest to understand is based out of 100. When a money line is negative for a given tea, that team is favored to win. If the Orlando Magic play the Atlanta Hawks and the Magic have a money line of -200, that means if you bet on the Magic, you need to bet 200 dollars to make 100 dollars. Inherentely one can also back out that this means the market believes that the Magic have a 66% chance of beating the Hawks. (200\/300=.66)\n\nSpread was created by bookies to get more action on both sides of the market and create a more balanced book. It is a metric of how much better the market believes one team is over another. In our same example lets say that the spread is -4 for the Magic in their game versus the Hawks. This means that the Magic are expected to win by more than four points and if you bet on the Magic they must win by more than 4 points for your bet to cash in. If you bet on the Magic at -4 and they win by exactly 4 points, money is returned to bettors.\n\nO\/U also called Over\/Under is the sum of the total points combined in the game. So for this particular game say the O\/U is 230, which means the Magic and the Hawks are expected to score 230 points. If you bet the over, you win if the sum of both teams is more than 230 and lose if the sum is less. A tie again returns money back to bettors. \n\nThis notebook is intended to serve as an introduciton to sports betting in the NBA. I will explore some aspects of the betting data as well as simulate a betting strategy. Further notebooks may be added for additional betting strategies."}}
