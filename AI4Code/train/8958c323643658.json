Out of 200 fights it sees 142 of them as having a positive expected value.  It wins 81 of these 142 bets.  It wins 38 out of 84 underdog bets.  A good number.  Anything close to 50% will be profitable for that part of it.  For favorites it wins 39\/52 bets.  For even fights it is 4\/6.  \n\nFor 142 bets of 100 units each this model sees a total return of 1162.21 units.

Now I will show a way to evaluate how this model is performing.  It isn't as simple as seeing how many winning fighters it predicts.  It comes down to how much profit it sees from its predicted bets.\n\nYou may find you train models that predict a lot of favorites to win that has a much higher accuracy than models that predict a lot of underdogs to win.  But it could still be possible that the less accurate model is the more profitable one.  I will walk through how to set up an evaluation that will give a model a score based off it its profit.","ebf1a475":"# 1. Prep the Train and Test Set"}}
