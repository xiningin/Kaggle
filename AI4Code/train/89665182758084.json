Introduction \nThis notebook makes use of NetworkX to engineer three new features which, used by themselves in a simple DecisionTree, result in a Kaggle prediction in the top 4% (0.81818). \n\nWith limited lifeboat seats, the Captain of the Titanic ordered that Women and Children board life boats first. However, these chivalrous actions were not always followed and this model will predict when that behavior occurs. For example, passengers traveling with family members may have made different life or death decisions than those traveling alone. \n\nUsing the initial hypothesis that women and children will generally survive, while men will perish results in a Kaggle score of 0.76076. To improve upon this score we need to predict when the exception occurs, specifically when women\/children die or when men live. We can speculate that women and children may be more likely to die if other women or children that they are traveling with die, and likewise, adult men may be more likely to live if other adult men that they are traveling with live.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we must first determine which passengers are traveling together. This model utilizes NetworkX to assign passengers together into social networks. Passengers are assigned to the graph as nodes. A four step process then adds edges to the graph to connect the passenger nodes to each other using shared ticket numbers and family names. This results in 53% of the passengers being joined together in connected component subgraphs (passenger groups\/networks). \n\nNext, we need to determine the known survival rates of women\/children and adult men traveling in these networks. Because we don't know everyones survival status, we need to create a new field that is slightly different from the existing Survival field. Passengers that we know lived are assigned a status of +1 and those that died are assigned a status of -1. We assign a status of 0 for passenger where we don't know their fate.  This system allows us to engineer an average known survival rate feature for each passenger network using a value falling somewhere between -1 (all died) and +1 (all lived). This feature is individually calculated for each passenger so that we don't incur data leakage from the current passenger (similar to how Parch and SibSp fields don't include the current passenger in their calculation). \n\nThat's it! Three features: Ptype_AdultM (Adult Men), Nstatus_F_Ch (known survival status of Women\/Children in a network), and Nstatus_AdultM (known survival status of Adult Men in a network). Feel free to fork this Kernel and incorporate these features in your model. I'd love to hear how you have improved upon this prediction. Best of luck!","245fd240":"We see that after assigning passengers to networks based on shared ticket numbers, there are 84 passengers that appear to be in a network that does not yet include all of their family members (Parch + SibSp).\n\nInspecting the data shows that some passengers share a family name and have ticket numbers that are in close proxiity to each other. These passengers are likely traveling together with extended family or are adult siblings, but they have purchase their tickets seperately. This scenario would occur if these passengers were in a ticket purchase line together. These passengers will be assigned to the same network in steps 2-4.","c1dedf40":"## 4.

The plot below shows that the known survival of young adults also appears consistent with this definition with almost all young adult males with the title of 'Mr' not surviving.\n    \nTherefore, I will categorize Adult Males as those that do not have 'Master' as their title and all other passengers will be\n    classified as Females\/Children.","de3a2a49":"### 3.1 Extract Title from the Name field","93d8d12a":"#### 4.1.2 HyphenName -  picks up the first part of a hyphenated LastName","d5c55936":"### 5.

Likewise, adult men may live of other adult men that they are traveling with live. To test this, we will create fields to measure the survival rates of other women\/children in each passengers network. The same will be done of the survival rates of adult men.\n\n- The known survival status for an individual passenger is defined as: survived=1, perished=-1, unknown=0\n- The network status for each passenger represents the average survival status of the other passengers they are traveling with in their network.\n- **Nstatus_F_Ch** is the average known survival status of the Women and Children in their network\n- **Nstatus_AdultM** is the average known survival status of men in their network.\n- Data leakage is avoided by not including the passenger in the calculation of their networks's overall survival status.\n- The network status features (Nstatus_F_Ch & Nstatus_AdultM) are defined on a continuum from -1 (all perished) to +1 (all survived). \n- Non-networked passengers who are traveling alone will have network status values of zero.","e6e46557":"If you found this notebook helpful or you just liked it , some upvotes would be very much appreciated ","acb779b7":"### 3.3 Create Features Ptype_AdultM (Adult Male) & Ptype_F_Ch (Female & Childern)"}}
