Our guide will walk you through the ins-and-outs of the ever-expanding field, including how it works and examples of how it\u2019s being used today. \n\nWe have approx 44 zettabytes.\n\nWhat do we do with all of this data? How do we make it useful to us? What are it's real-world applications? These questions are the domain of data science.   \n\nEvery company will say they\u2019re doing a form of data science, but what exactly does that mean? The field is growing so rapidly, and revolutionizing so many industries, it's difficult to fence in its capabilities with a formal definition, but generally data science is devoted to the extraction of clean information from raw data for the formulation of actionable insights. \n\nSifting through massive lakes of data, looking for connections and patterns, data science is responsible for bringing us new products, delivering breakthrough insights and making our lives more convenient. \n\nBig data,decision making,internet commerce\n\n\nExample companies:\n**Numerator** is a market intelligence firm that analyzes merchandising and sales data from retail locations, e-commerce sites and big box stores so companies know what their consumers are buying and why. The information that Numerator provides can help companies improve brand strategy, advertising, distribution and pricing decisions.\n\nhttps:\/\/builtin.com\/data-science\/data-science-companies\n\nData science generally has a five-stage lifecycle that consists of1:\n\n* 1. Capture: Data acquisition, data entry, signal reception, data extraction\n* 1. Maintain: Data warehousing, data cleansing, data staging, data processing, data architecture\n* 1. Process: Data mining, clustering\/classification, data modeling, data summarization\n* 1. Communicate: Data reporting, data visualization, business intelligence, decision making\n* 1. Analyze: Exploratory\/confirmatory, predictive analysis, regression, text mining, qualitative analysis \n\nUSES:\nAnomaly detection (fraud, disease, crime, etc.)\nAutomation and decision-making (background checks, credit worthiness, etc.)\nClassifications (in an email server, this could mean classifying emails as \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d)\nForecasting (sales, revenue and customer retention)\nPattern detection (weather patterns, financial market patterns, etc.)\nRecognition (facial, voice, text, etc.)\nRecommendations (based on learned preferences, recommendation engines can refer you to movies, restaurants and books you may like)\n\nhttps:\/\/builtin.com\/data-science\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)"}}
