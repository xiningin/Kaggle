Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.\nThe file ex1data1.txt (available under week 2's assignment material) contains the dataset for our linear regression exercise.

A negative value for profit indicates a loss.\n\nFirst, as with doing any machine learning task, we need to import certain libraries.","dd15563c":"Lets extend the idea of linear regression to work with multiple independent variables.\n\n# Linear Regression with multiple variables\n\nIn this section, we will implement linear regression with multiple variables (also called Multivariate Linear Regression).","b824bf80":"You should expect to see a cost of 32.07.\n\n# Finding the optimal parameters using Gradient Descent"}}
