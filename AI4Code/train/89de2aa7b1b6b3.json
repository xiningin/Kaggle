Pixelspacing\n\n* The pixelspacing attribute you can find in the dicom files is an important one.

The CT-scan captures information about the radiodensity of an object or tissue exposed to x-rays. A transversal slice of a scan is reconstructed after taking measurements from several different directions.\n2. We need to transform to Hounsfield units as the spectral composition of the x-rays depends on the measurement settings like acquisition parameters and tube voltage. By normalizing to values of water and air (water has HU 0 and air -1000) the images of different measurements are becoming comparable.\n3. A ct-scanner yields roughly 4000 grey values that can't be captured by our eyes. This is why windowing is performed.
