Well, there are a plethora of tuning parameters for tree-based learners in XGBoost and you can read all about them here. But the most common ones that you should know are:\n\n#### learning_rate: step size shrinkage used to prevent overfitting. Range is [0,1]\n#### max_depth: determines how deeply each tree is allowed to grow during any boosting round.\n#### subsample: percentage of samples used per tree. Low value can lead to underfitting.\n#### colsample_bytree: percentage of features used per tree. High value can lead to overfitting.\n#### n_estimators: number of trees you want to build.\n#### objective: determines the loss function to be used like reg:linear for regression problems, reg:logistic for classification problems with only decision, binary:logistic for classification problems with probability.\n#### XGBoost also supports regularization parameters to penalize models as they become more complex and reduce them to simple (parsimonious) models.\n\n#### gamma: controls whether a given node will split based on the expected reduction in loss after the split. A higher value leads to fewer splits. Supported only for tree-based learners.\n#### alpha: L1 regularization on leaf weights. A large value leads to more regularization.\n#### lambda: L2 regularization on leaf weights and is smoother than L1 regularization.\n#### It's also worth mentioning that though you are using trees as your base learners, you can also use XGBoost's relatively less popular linear base learners and one other tree learner known as dart. All you have to do is set the booster parameter to either gbtree (default),gblinear or dart.\n","a97ecfeb":"## Pandas get_dummies() :\n### Pandas has a function which can turn a categorical variable into a series of zeros and ones, which makes them a lot easier to quantify and compare.","a3065ca3":"## Check out if any nulls:","8a1da6cf":"# XGBoost is one of the most popular machine learning algorithm these days.
