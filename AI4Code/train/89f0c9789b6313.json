Therefore, we can say that the training and test data sets are similar in terms of feature distributions. In other words, no big shake-up expected at the end of the competition. :)","959b864d":"## Introduction to Adversarial Validation\n\nAdversarial validation is an approach to measure the difference in feature distributions between the training and test data sets. We train a binary classifier with a new target variable indicating whether a sample belongs to the test data set (1) or not (0). \n\nIf the adversarial validation classifier performs well (e.g. AUC score >> 50%), the feature distributions are different between the training and test data sets. In this case, good performances on the training data set might not guarantee the same on the test data set. \n\nIf the adversarial validation classifier performs poorly (e.g. AUC score ~ 50%), the feature distirubtions are similar between the training and test data sets, and we may not worry much about overfitting to the training data set during model training.\n\nLet's see what we have."}}
