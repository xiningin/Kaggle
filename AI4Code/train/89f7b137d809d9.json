We can create a **two-dimensional (2D) KDE plot** with the `sns.jointplot` command.\n\nIn the plot below, the color-coding shows us how likely we are to see different combinations of sepal width and petal length, where darker parts of the figure are more likely. ","dcf19a0f":"Note that in addition to the 2D KDE plot in the center,\n- the curve at the top of the figure is a KDE plot for the data on the x-axis (in this case, `iris_data['Petal Length (cm)']`), and\n- the curve on the right of the figure is a KDE plot for the data on the y-axis (in this case, `iris_data['Sepal Width (cm)']`).","d29a4ca3":"In this tutorial you'll learn all about **histograms** and **density plots**.\n\n# Set up the notebook\n\nAs always, we begin by setting up the coding environment.  (_This code is hidden, but you can un-hide it by clicking on the \"Code\" button immediately below this text, on the right._)","ae373229":"# What's next?\n\nPut your new skills to work in a **[coding exercise](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/2951534)**!","8dcdedfd":"In this case, the legend does not automatically appear on the plot. To force it to show (for any plot type), we can always use `plt.legend()`.\n\nWe can also create a KDE plot for each species by using `sns.kdeplot` (_as above_).  Again, `label=` is used to set the values in the legend.","d2db3ee5":"# Color-coded plots\n\nFor the next part of the tutorial, we'll create plots to understand differences between the species.  To accomplish this, we begin by breaking the dataset into three separate files, with one for each species.","9d8456c8":"We customize the behavior of the command with two additional pieces of information:\n- `a=` chooses the column we'd like to plot (_in this case, we chose `'Petal Length (cm)'`_).\n- `kde=False` is something we'll always provide when creating a histogram, as leaving it out will create a slightly different plot.\n\n# Density plots\n\nThe next type of plot is a **kernel density estimate (KDE)** plot.  In case you're not familiar with KDE plots, you can think of it as a smoothed histogram.   \n\nTo make a KDE plot, we use the `sns.kdeplot` command.  Setting `shade=True` colors the area below the curve (_and `data=` has identical functionality as when we made the histogram above_).","672b1d39":"One interesting pattern that can be seen in plots is that the plants seem to belong to one of two groups, where _Iris versicolor_ and _Iris virginica_ seem to have similar values for petal length, while _Iris setosa_ belongs in a category all by itself. \n\nIn fact, according to this dataset, we might even be able to classify any iris plant as *Iris setosa* (as opposed to *Iris versicolor* or *Iris virginica*) just by looking at the petal length: if the petal length of an iris flower is less than 2 cm, it's most likely to be *Iris setosa*!","2d7e7fbd":"# Histograms\n\nSay we would like to create a **histogram** to see how petal length varies in iris flowers.  We can do this with the `sns.distplot` command.  ","ba3989d5":"In the code cell below, we create a different histogram for each species by using the `sns.distplot` command (_as above_) three times.  We use `label=` to set how each histogram will appear in the legend.","7eba61ed":"# Select a dataset\n\nWe'll work with a dataset of 150 different flowers, or 50 each from three different species of iris (*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*).\n\n![tut4_iris](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/RcxYYBA.png)\n\n# Load and examine the data\n\nEach row in the dataset corresponds to a different flower.  There are four measurements: the sepal length and width, along with the petal length and width.  We also keep track of the corresponding species. "}}
