There might be a case of having only one clustered index in each table, as it can enable the user to store data in a single order. Gathered index store data in a sorted manner and therefore, whenever data is contained in the table in a sorted way means it is arranged with a clustered index.\n\nWhen a table contains a clustered index, it is termed as a clustered table. A clustered index is preferred to use when modification of enormous data is required in any database. If the data stored in a table or database are not arranged in ascending or descending order, then the data table is termed as a heap.\n\n - Non-Clustered Index\nNon-clustered index poses a structure, which is separated from data rows. This type of index in SQL covers the non-clustered key values, and each value pair has a pointer to the data row that consists of crucial importance. In the non-clustered index, the arrow from an index row to a data row is termed as a row locator. The structure of the row locator enables in identifying whether the data pages are in the form of a clustered table or a heap. In the clustered chart, the row locator is termed as the clustered index key.\n\nIn the non-clustered index, the user can easily add non-key columns to the leaf level, as it bypasses the existing index key limits and performs fully covered indexed queries. A non-clustered index is created to improve the overall performance of frequently asked questions, which are not covered by clustered items.\n\n- Unique Index\nThe unique index in SQL guarantees and confirms that the index key does not contain any duplicate values and therefore, enables the users to analyze that every row in the table is unique in one or the other way. Unique index of specially used when the user wants to have a unique characteristic of each data. Unique indexes allow individuals to ensure data integrity of each defined column of the table in the database. This index also provides additional information about the data table, which is helpful to query optimizer.\n\n - Filtered Index\nA filtered index is created when a column has only a small number of relevant values for queries on the subset of values. In case, when a table consists of heterogeneous data rows, a filtered index is created in SQL for one or more types of data. Even when the query optimizer does not cover any query, still it indicates a filtered index for the question.\n\nA filtered index is a new feature in SQL and is used to index a portion of rows in a table, which means it applies a filter on Index and therefore, improves the overall performance of the query. Filtered index results in a deduction for the maintenance cost of the index and reduces the index storage costs compared to full-table indexes. The overall impact of data modification is less with a filtered index, as it is updated only when a new record is inserted or when the data of the index is impacted.\n\n- Column store Index\nA column store index is a standard form of the index when it comes to storing and querying large data warehousing fact tables. The column store index is an index of SQL, which was designed for improvement in the performance of query in case of workloads with vast amounts of data. This type of index stores data in a column-based format. The column store index reduces the overall storage costs and provides a very high level of compressions of massive data. Due to the compression of stored data, the user can efficiently perform input-output functions and thereby, result in high performance.\n\nThe column-store index enables storing data within small footprints, which helps in increasing the processing speed. Usage of this index allows for the user to get IO with 10 times higher query performance when compared to traditional row-oriented storage. For analytics, Columnstore Index provides an order of magnitude to have a better performance than other indexes in SQL. Column store index values from the same domain have similar values, which increases the overall rate of data compressions.\n\n- Hash Index\nHash Index in SQL is simply an array of N buckets or slots containing a pointer and a row on each bucket or slot. Hash index uses Hash function F(K, N), where K is critical and the number of buckets as N. The function maps out the key corresponding to the bucket of the hash index. Each bucket of the Hash Index consists of 8 bytes, which is used to stock the memory address of the linked list of critical entries.","92a7c4c4":"- ## **Q42B** : ALIAS name can be given to a table or column.

Some relational databases such as SQL Server have some debugging capabilities.\n  - Versioning \u2013\nVersion control is not supported by the stored procedure.\n  - Cost \u2013\nAn extra developer in the form of DBA is required to access the SQL and write a better stored procedure.

This is not so much a design guideline as a matter of definition. Relational database theory doesn't deal with records having a variable number of fields.\n- 2NF\n - Under second and third normal forms, a non-key field must provide a fact about the key, us the whole key, and nothing but the key. In addition, the record must satisfy first normal form.We deal now only with \"single-valued\" facts. The fact could be a one-to-many relationship, such as the department of an employee, or a one-to-one relationship, such as the spouse of an employee. Thus the phrase \"Y is a fact about X\" signifies a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship between Y and X. In the general case, Y might consist of one or more fields, and so might X. In the following example, QUANTITY is a fact about the combination of PART and WAREHOUSE.\n\n- 3NF\n - Third normal form is violated when a non-key field is a fact about another non-key field, as in\n------------------------------------\n| EMPLOYEE | DEPARTMENT | LOCATION |\n============------------------------\n The EMPLOYEE field is the key. If each department is located in one place, then the LOCATION field is a fact about the DEPARTMENT -- in addition to being a fact about the EMPLOYEE. The problems with this design are the same as those caused by violations of second normal form:\n\nThe department's location is repeated in the record of every employee assigned to that department.\nIf the location of the department changes, every such record must be updated.\nBecause of the redundancy, the data might become inconsistent, with different records showing different locations for the same department.\nIf a department has no employees, there may be no record in which to keep the department's location.\nTo satisfy third normal form, the record shown above should be decomposed into the two records:\n- 4NF\n  -Under fourth normal form, a record type should not contain two or more independent multi-valued facts about an entity. In addition, the record must satisfy third normal form.\n\nThe term \"independent\" will be discussed after considering an example.\n\nConsider employees, skills, and languages, where an employee may have several skills and several languages. We have here two many-to-many relationships, one between employees and skills, and one between employees and languages. Under fourth normal form, these two relationships should not be represented in a single record such as\n\n-------------------------------\n| EMPLOYEE | SKILL | LANGUAGE |\n===============================\nInstead, they should be represented in the two records\n\n--------------------  -----------------------\n| EMPLOYEE | SKILL |  | EMPLOYEE | LANGUAGE |\n====================  =======================\nNote that other fields, not involving multi-valued facts, are permitted to occur in the record, as in the case of the QUANTITY field in the earlier PART\/WAREHOUSE example.\n - 5NF\n   = Fifth normal form deals with cases where information can be reconstructed from smaller pieces of information that can be maintained with less redundancy. Second, third, and fourth normal forms also serve this purpose, but fifth normal form generalizes to cases not covered by the others.\n\nWe will not attempt a comprehensive exposition of fifth normal form, but illustrate the central concept with a commonly used example, namely one involving agents, companies, and products. If agents represent companies, companies make products, and agents sell products, then we might want to keep a record of which agent sells which product for which company. This information could be kept in one record type with three fields:","4dc6f438":"- ## **Q43** :What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DROP statements\nThe main difference between Drop and Truncate is that Drop is a DDL command that helps to delete all records of the table, remove the table structure and to remove the database from the system, while truncate is a DDL command that helps to remove the records from the table.","bfb20e8a":"- ## **Q39** :What is CLAUSE?\nIn general terms,**a clause**is just a logical chunk of a SQL statement - and, usually, is a chunk that is (theoretically) optional.
