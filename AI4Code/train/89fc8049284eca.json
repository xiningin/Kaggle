The chapters or surahs are of unequal length; the shortest chapter (Al-Kawthar) has only three verses while the longest (Al-Baqara) contains 286 verses. Of the 114 chapters in the Quran, 86 are classified as Meccan, while 28 are Medinan. This classification is only approximate in regard to the location of revelation; any chapter revealed after migration of Muhammad to Medina (Hijrah) is termed Medinan and any revealed before that event is termed Meccan.\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Surah","6c1db7ab":"#Codes by Sohier Dane https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sohier\/function-for-formatting-the-text-reading-the-files","bb6133e4":"#Codes by Haseeb Elahi https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/helahi\/word-cloud-for-each-surah-of-quran\/notebook"}}
