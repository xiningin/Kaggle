Creating our own Convolutional Neural Network model\n\nTo create our own CNN in PyTorch, we need to define our own class as a subclass of __Module__. If you feel the need to read more about this procedure, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/beginner\/examples_nn\/two_layer_net_module.html\">Custom nn Modules examples in the official PyTorch documentation<\/a>.\n\n## 3.1 The structure of a CNN\n\nRegular NN models would conain fully connected layers with flat inputs (1 dimensional).  \nLet's a little talk about what is specific to CNN and not found in regular NNs in general.\nCNNs use:\n- convolutional layers made up of image filters which are based on image kernels \n    - to see image kernels in action, check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/setosa.io\/ev\/image-kernels\/\">visual explanation of image kernels <\/a>\n- pooling layers, which are used to reduce the dimensionality of convolutional layers outputs.\n\n## 3.2 Defining our CNN model\n\nIn our CNN model, we will implement this architecture:\n1. convolutional layer 1 (1,6,3,1) -> \n2. pooling layer 1 (2, 2) -> \n3. convolutional  layer 2 (6,16,3,1) -> \n4. pooling layer 2 (2,2) -> \n5. fully connected layer 1 or fc1 (5x5x16, 120) -> \n6. fully connected layer 2 or fc2 (120,84) -> \n7. fully connected layer 3 or fc3 (84,10), which is our output layer.\n\nThe data in parathesis represent the parameters of each layer and here is an explanation:\n1. convolutional layer 1 has parameters set to (1,6,3,1) because it has: \n    - 1 input channel (because our data is greyscale, so we only have one color channel)\n    - 6 output channels (these are esentially the number of filters I arbitrarily chose for this layer)\n    - 3 is the kernel size (in effect, this means a 3x3 kernel)\n    - 1 is the step size\n2. pooling layer 1 has a kernel of size 2 (2x2) and a step of 2 (also referred to as 'stride')\n3. convolutional layer 2 will have: 6 input channels (because conv1 was outputting 6 channels and we pull them into conv2), 16 output channels (16 filters), a kernel size of 3 (again, this means 3x3) and a step size of 1\n4. pooling layer 2 also has a 2x2 kernel and a stride of 2\n5. fc1 has:\n    - an input of size 5x5x16. The 16 comes from the number of channels we chose for the previous layer, conv2. The 5x5 comes from the dimensionality reduction that is created through the use of the previous layers. By using 2 convolutional layers and 2 pooling layers, we go from 28x28 input data to 5x5 matrices. \n    - and the layer has 100 neurons (I arbitrarily chose this number)\n6. I bet you know by now why fc2 is (120,84)\n7. and you also know why fc3 has these settings\n\n*if in doubt whether I selected 120 and 84 numbers of neurons in the 1st and 2nd fully connected layers for some reason, know that I did not. These are just numbers I picked out. How to decide on the dimensions of neural networks layers is beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n","7786deae":"A few observations on the code above:\n- It might not be necessary now, but it's a good practice to always shuffle the training data. Some datasets may have all the exemplars of a class grouped together (e.g. all the t-shirt images, then all the shoes images etc). We don't want our CNN to train on a single class, then on another class etc. \n- I use batch size 10 just because it seems to be fashionable, no other reasons for this particular number for me.","975ce224":"# 1. Introduction\n\n# What is PyTorch\n\n\nPyTorch is an open source machine learning library. It's mainly used for **computer vision** and **natural language** processing. PyTorch was developed by Facebook and initially released in 2016. If this sparks your interest to learn more about its past and present, I invite you to explore <a href='https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PyTorch'>PyTorch's Wikipedia page<\/a>. \n\nOne more thing you might like to know is that Tesla Autopilot is built on top of PyTorch. And if you are a fan of Tesla, you might enjoy this talk where <a href='https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PyTorch'>Andrej Karpathy discusses how Tesla is using PyTorch<\/a>. \n\n## How do I learn PyTorch\n\nThe answer is, of course, through building something. <a href='https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brohrer'>Brandon Rohrer<\/a> has a nice introductory blog post on <a href='https:\/\/e2eml.school\/one_step_program_become_data_scientist.html'>becoming a Data Scientist<\/a> and his \"how to\" recipe is exactly this: \"build stuff\". He even has a guide for <a href='https:\/\/e2eml.school\/choosing_project.html'>choosing a data science project to build.<\/a>\n\n## Where do I learn PyTorch from\n\nFrom my experience - and I also found this <a href='https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/9rvxj6\/d_best_bookcourse_to_get_started_with_pytorch\/'>Reddit discussion<\/a> to confirm my beliefs (confirmation bias), the official PyTorch tutorials on https:\/\/pytorch.org\/ are a great learning resource. If the official website is not to your liking, explore the Reddit discussion and you will find more resources. \n\n## PyTorch or TensorFlow\n\nYou probably heard about TensorFlow. Even if you don't know exactly what it is, it probably rings a bell. Well, it looks like PyTorch and TensorFlow do the same job. \n\nTensorFlow was developed by Google and it was publicly released one year before PyTorch. But since PyTorch appeared, TensorFlow started to decrease in popularity. \n\nPyTorch has the reputation of being used predominantly in the academic environment, in research, while TensorFlow was known to be used in production. Things have been changing though, with companies like Tesla and Uber adopting PyTorch.\n\nCheck out this article for an ample discussion on <a href='https:\/\/realpython.com\/pytorch-vs-tensorflow\/#pytorch-vs-tensorflow-decision-guide'>PyTorch versus TensorFlow.<\/a>\n\n# Neural Networks\n\nEverybody is talking about neural networks (NN) these days. And about Deep Learning, which is a particular type of NN.\nIf you've heard these terms many times, don't feel like you know exactly what they refer to and don't want to read one whole book just to clarify the concepts, here is a quick overview:\n\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Neural Networks (NN) are the same thing. People use NN because it's shorter than ANN.\n\nI got a good introduction to the topic through the course of Jose Portilla on Udemy - \"Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp\". Section 25 is dedicated to NN. It has a little bit of theory and a lot of practice (though it uses TensorFlow for the practical work). The whole section takes about 5 hours of videos (theory and code along short videos).\n\nIf you want to go deeper and understand the Math behind NNs, I used <a href='https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/andriyburkov\/?originalSubdomain=ca'>Andriy Burkov's<\/a> the <a href='https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/uh48e6wjs4w13t5\/Chapter6.pdf?dl=0'>Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book<\/a>. Chapter 6 takes you through 17 pages of Neural Networks quick overview. \/\/The author makes the book available on a read first pay later principle. So, if you enjoy the book, you can purchase at the end using any of <a href='http:\/\/themlbook.com\/'>the methods here.<\/a>\n\nAnd if you want to understand exactly how neural nets work and work your way through the backpropagation with pen and paper, read <a href='https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michael_Nielsen'>Michael Nielsen's<\/a> <a href='http:\/\/neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com\/index.html'>Neural Networks and Deep Learning: Introduction to the core principles.<\/a> \n\n## Convolutional Neural Networks\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a subclass of Neural Networks that solve some of the shortcomings of the usual NNs. One main advantage is the reduction of parameters that need to be set through training the model. \n\nFor a full explanation of the benefits of CNN over NN, I recommend section 8 of the course \"Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp\" (by Jose Portilla, on Udemy). This section takes around 5 hours to complete, contains theoetical and code along videos and takes you through examples where you use NN and CNN for the same data. ","175ef04a":"## 3.3 Parameters downsize with CNN\n\nI mentioned earlier that one advantage of CNN over regular NN is the decrease in the number of parameters that need to be trained. \n\nLet's see if it's true.

If you flatten one image out (collapse into one dimension instead of two), it gives us one row of length 784.      \nAnd the first column represents the label of that image (one digit, from 0 to 9, for each of the 10 clothing item types we have in this dataset).  \nThese add up to the 785 which is our row's length.","d22b29c3":"That's it.

The time has come.\n\n### Loading data in batches\nUsually, Data Scientists handle huge amounts of data. You may think that 60.000 training examples is not that much and you're right. But this is just our playground now. And we are preparing for real world data analysis, so it's good to create good habits from the start. Besides having huge amounts of data to read, we also have a large number of parameters to train in our CNN model. We will compute the exact number of parameter later. For the time being, keep in mind that we will be training around 60.000 network parameters.   \n\nThe bottom line is that we want to save memory space. For this purpose, PyTorch offers <a href=\"https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader\">DataLoader<\/a>, which allows us to load data in batches. That is, instead of loading all 60.000 examples in memory at the same time, we will load {batch_size} examples at a time. I will use a batch_size of 10 just because I've seen it used so many times, but feel free to experiment. \n\n### Custom Dataset\nThe common way to use DataLoader is like this:\n\n> from torchvision import datasets, transforms   \n> from torch.utils.data import DataLoader  \n> transform = transforms.ToTensor()   \n> train_data = datasets.FashionMNIST(root='\/kaggle\/input\/', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)  \n> train_loader = DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)\n\nThis method uses <a href='https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/torchvision\/index.html'><tt><strong>torchvision<\/strong><\/tt><\/a> to download an MNIST dataset. On the first call, the dataset is downloaded in the indicated folder. Subsequent calls will check if the data is already downloaded and will use the local version.   \n\nWe need to transform our dataset (the csv files) into the kind of data that DataLoader expects.\n\nCheck what kind of data DataLoader expects:\n- <a href=\"https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader\">official Python documentation for DataLoader.<\/a>\n- looks like we need to convert our data to a 'Dataset'. Check <a href=\"https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset\">PyTorch documentation for Dataset<\/a>. \n- Dataset is an abstract class (more appropriately called an \"interface\") --> we need to implement our own class to extend it. \n- According to the documentation, our class must overwrite __getitem__() and it should (optionally) overwrite __getlen__()\n\n\n","cfcf7f5a":"## 2.1 Reading and examining our data  \nWe will first use the easy way to read our data: we know we have the data in csv files. The easiest way I know for reading a CSV is to use the read_csv function from pandas. This will read the contents of each file into a pandas DataFrame.  \n\nLater we will see that we're better off using the <a href='https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html'>DataLoader<\/a> class from the PyTorch library. And I will explain why. But, for now, let us stick to the familiar pandas DataFrame just to see what kind of data we are dealing with a how it is organised.","d2525580":"Some clarifications on the code above:\n- the output of the convolutional layers is passed through a Rectified Linear Unit activation function.
