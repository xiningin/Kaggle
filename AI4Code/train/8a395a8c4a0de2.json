Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.\nReducing the number of variables of a data set naturally comes at the expense of accuracy, but the trick in dimensionality reduction is to trade a little accuracy for simplicity. Because smaller data sets are easier to explore and visualize and make analyzing data much easier and faster for machine learning algorithms without extraneous variables to process.\nSo to sum up, the idea of PCA is simple \u2014 reduce the number of variables of a data set, while preserving as much information as possible.","57413452":"**Ensemble Methods**<br>\nEnsemble methods are algorithms that combine multiple algorithms into a single predictive model in order to decrease variance, decrease bias, or improve predictions.<br>\n\nEnsemble methods are usually broken into two categories:<br>\n\nParallel: An ensemble method where the models that make up the building blocks of the larger methods are generated independent of each other (i.e., they can be trained\/generated as trivially parallel problems applied to the dataset).<br>\nSequential: An ensemble methods where the learners are generated in a sequential order and are dependent on each other (i.e., they can only be trained one at a time, as the next model will require information from the training upstream of it).<br>\nThe random forest algorithm relies on a parallel ensemble method called \"bagging\" to generate its weak classifiers.<br>\n\n**Bagging**<br>\nBagging is a colloquial term for bootstrap aggregation. Bootstrap aggregation is a method that allows us to decrease the variance of an estimate by averaging multiple estimates that are measured from random subsamples of a population.<br>\n\n**Bootstrap Sampling**<br>\nThe first portion of bagging is the application of bootstrap sampling to obtain subsets of the data. These subsets are then fed into one model that will comprise the final ensemble method. This is a straightforward process, given a set of observation data, n observations are selected at random and with replacement to form the subsample. This subsample is what is then fed into the machine learning algorithm of choice to train the model.<br>\n\n**Aggregation**<br>\nAfter all of the models have been built, their outputs must be aggregated into a single coherent prediction for the larger model. In the case of a classifier model, this is usually just a winners take all strategy\u2014whichever category receives the most votes is the final outcome predicted. In the case of a regression problem, a simple average of predicted outcome values is used.<br>\n\n**Feature Bagging**<br>\nFeature bagging (or the random subspace method) is a type of ensemble method that is applied to the features (columns) of a dataset instead of to the observations (rows). It is used as a method of reducing the correlation between features by training base predictors on random subsets of features instead of the complete feature space each time.<br>\n\n**The Random Forest** <br>\nBased on what was previously covered in decision trees and ensemble methods, it should come as little surprise as to where the random forest gets its name or how they\u2019re constructed at a high-level, but let\u2019s go over it anyways.\n\nA random forest is comprised of a set of decision trees, each of which is trained on a random subset of the training data. These trees predictions can then be aggregated to provide a single prediction from a series of predictions.\n\n","14f35d17":"<h1 style=\"color:purple;\" id=\"kmeans\"> 6.

In general, there is no method for determining exact value of K, but an accurate estimate can be obtained using the following techniques.<br>\n\nOne of the metrics that is commonly used to compare results across different values of K is the mean distance between data points and their cluster centroid. Since increasing the number of clusters will always reduce the distance to data points, increasing K will always decrease this metric, to the extreme of reaching zero when K is the same as the number of data points.
