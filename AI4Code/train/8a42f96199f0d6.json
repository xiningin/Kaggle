There are 13 columns:\n- `'competitorname'` contains the name of the candy bar. \n- the next **9** columns (from `'chocolate'` to `'pluribus'`) describe the candy.  For instance, rows with chocolate candies have `\"Yes\"` in the `'chocolate'` column (and candies without chocolate have `\"No\"` in the same column).\n- `'sugarpercent'` provides some indication of the amount of sugar, where higher values signify higher sugar content.\n- `'pricepercent'` shows the price per unit, relative to the other candies in the dataset.\n- `'winpercent'` is calculated from the survey results; higher values indicate that the candy was more popular with survey respondents.\n\nUse the first five rows of the data to answer the questions below."}}
