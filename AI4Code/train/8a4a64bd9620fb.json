You can either think of \n* a buyer how either get's more \"value\" for his money from the seller, e.g. because the bottle of vine is sold under it's value (or vice versa) or \n* a guest in a casino with a starting budget. In that case the wallet size of one player should be set to several times of the initial wallet size of all agent's\n\nConditions & Limitations:\n* buyer or seller can't loose more unit's then they have in the wallet\n* if a buyer has no unit's in his wallet, he can't gamble any more\n* the amount of units an agent wins or loose is a given percentage of the smaller wallet of both players","cad49a0c":"# Summary\nEven in a fair gambling\/trading environment statistics always wins = the bigger your wallet, you always win on the long run","70963731":"Now let's start the simulation rounds. \n* Left side you see the world populated with agents.
