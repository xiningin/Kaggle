There are two main reasons:\n\n1. **Autograd**: The ability to automatically compute gradients for tensor operations is essential for training deep learning models.\n2. **GPU support**: While working with massive datasets and large models, PyTorch tensor operations can be performed efficiently using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Computations that might typically take hours can be completed within minutes using GPUs.\n\nWe'll leverage both these features of PyTorch extensively in this tutorial series.","fe90da61":"## Tensor functions\n\nApart from arithmetic operations, the `torch` module also contains many functions for creating and manipulating tensors.

This feature of PyTorch is called _autograd_ (automatic gradients).\n\nTo compute the derivatives, we can invoke the `.backward` method on our result `y`.","d9173d0f":"The derivatives of `y` with respect to the input tensors are stored in the `.grad` property of the respective tensors.","fab800d6":"Tensors can have any number of dimensions and different lengths along each dimension.

You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n\n#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Colab**. [Google Colab](https:\/\/colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab.\n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https:\/\/www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https:\/\/docs.conda.io\/projects\/conda\/en\/latest\/user-guide\/install\/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n\n>  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https:\/\/jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" or \"Edit > Clear Outputs\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.","8064f0a0":"## Save and upload your notebook\n\nWhether you're running this Jupyter notebook online or on your computer, it's essential to save your work from time to time. You can continue working on a saved notebook later or share it with friends and colleagues to let them execute your code.
