Both the sector and stocks should confirm the reversal.\n\nAs an investor, it is important to understand that there is a correlation between the economic cycle, stock market cycle and the performance of various sectors of the economy. \n\nDuring the early cycle, it is better to invest in interest-rate sensitive stocks like consumer discretionary, financials, real estate, industrial and transportation. You should avoid, communications, utilities, and energy sector stocks. \n\nDuring the middle of the cycle, you can invest in IT and capital goods stocks. Whereas you should avoid, metals and utilities during this phase. \n\nDuring the late cycle, you can invest in energy, metals, health care and the utilities and you can skip the IT and consumer discretionary stocks. \n\nBest sectors for investment during Economic Slowdown are FMCG, utilities and health care. Investment in Industrials, IT and Real Estate should be avoided during this time.  \n\n![Business cycle and relative stock performance](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/00\/5c\/bc\/005cbc511e93c97318c4bfc95df4c38d.jpg)","16656d33":"# Identify sectors expected to perform well in near future\n> Find out beaten down sectors that are showing signs of reversal. \n\nHere I find out the sectors that are delivering diminishing returns i.e. returns are decreasing on lower time frames compared to higher time frames.
