Introducing a Surface Area Data Analysis by the first and the last history maker\nHi There~ \nThis is a great step to learn Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence. Some may not feel good enough to see difference b\/t Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. So here I'm. Let's say you have obserbance in numbers just feel any characters you want to describe or analyze in a numerical data that can have computers understood. The numberical data just is needed in matrix. That matrix from, you can start to add characters on your data by vectorizing. You might not seem to know what's going on or what the hack is it? In a few chapters along, you will see a spectrometer signal - how to be undertaken into data visualizaiton. And you will teach the machine to get better from what they don't figure out on the way. We will learn functions and create\/develop algorithm to let them figure out faster and be predicted itself. This is how we stand for AI beyond Machine Learning. If this storytelling explanation is not comfortable, just add a comment you would like to approach in a little differet way. We are all different~! Absolutley \\ ^^ \/"}}
