You can of course use `! pip install pretrainedmodels` to install it. As most of Kaggle's Code Competitions do not support internet connection while submitting, adding this dataset alleviates the problem, and you can use this library and all of its functionalities without internet access.","16199934":"*NOTE: This Notebook has been run without internet.*","a8e792b6":"# Step 4: Import and Use Library","5783d0de":"Now the module is ready to be used.","1991cb37":"# Step 2: Check the Files","c0eab404":"Many Kaggle competitions allow the use of external publicly available data, but does not allow the use of internet while submitting. All libraries available on PyPI are not installed on Kaggle Notebook environment by default. You cannot manually install packages with pip in the ususal way because that will require internet. This Notebook shows how to use available datasets containing libraries inside your Notebook with a particular example.","cc5da482":"When the code of the previous cell has run without error, you can import the module like you normally would, and it would be ready to use.","0017dd95":"# Step 1: Add the Dataset from Your Notebook","23e01ef0":"Use the below code to install the module without internet."}}
