Another point to be noted from the prediction table is that most of the wrong predictions aren't off by much (i.e. a 6 might be predicted as a 5, not as a 3) which indicates that the predictions are still pretty close to the true data. We can note that though the KNN model is 'decent'in performance, there are other algorithms that can be used and improvements that can be made.**\n# Please upvote if you found it helpful\/insightful","a35cc2eb":"# **1)EDA**"}}
