Furthermore, we will use a 80\/20 split for validation.","dd8430b9":"## Introduction\n\nThis dataset is a fashion dataset, where thousands of small images are collected and labeled. Therefore it is a supervised problem. There are multiple ways to conquer this task, but my approach was to use a CNN to predict the fashion images.\n\nThere are two main files. The \"fashion-mnist_train.csv\" and the \"fasion-mnist_test.csv\" file. Both are csv files and they do have in the first column the label corresponding to the correct output. Then we have a lot of pixel values in each single other column.","51ce6526":"### Plotting the test data\n\nIn this small section we will use some test data and predict the output of this image. We will use the predict function to get the predictions of this image, that the model has made.","c45a55ea":"With those two lines we can see the data and how it is structured. We see that the first column is the label column, so the correct output, which are integers from 0 to 9. Then we have the pixel values in each other column. We see that these values are some weird rgb values. So we need to normalize this data and divide it by 255 to get the actually pixel value between 0 and 1.","f153219b":"Now we are creating the model by using keras in tensorflow. We do have a input layer of 28x28. For representing every single pixel.\n\nWe do have a conv 2d layer of 32 neurons and with a scanning size of 3x3. We are using the relu activation function.\n\nThen we have a max pooling of a 2x2 grid and again a layer of 64 convolutional neurons with the relu activation function. After that we have the pooling layer again.\n\nFurthermore, we are flattening the whole thing and then we will connect 128 neurons with this flattened layer. We will use the relu activation function again.\n\nIn the end, we will use 10 output neurons (because we do have 10 output possibilities) with the softmax activation function to get a prober probability value for each output neuron.","681b4c1b":"### Plotting the model\n\nIn this section we will plot the accuracy and the loss of the model. This is good for seeing, if we have a overfit\/underfit or a good model.","1757dace":"## Training the CNN\n\nWe are reshaping the values, because we just want a representation of the image in the size of 28x28.","ffc920ac":"## Conclusion\n\nThere are many ways to classify those images, but my personal favourite is the CNN way. CNN's are good for classification problems and therefore it is a good thing to test your knowledge with it.\n\nFurthermore you can test this notebook and maybe built a better solution by optimizing the hyperparameters.","d68d051a":"Now we are plotting some test data, to get a feeling how the data looks like. We are setting the corresponding label as the plot title.\n\nAs I said before we need to divide the values of this feature by 255 because we need to get the rgb value between 0 and 1. Then it is easier for the CNN to learn and to visualize it.","eae7a064":"Here we have a given array and a function which returns the actual class of the image. For example, we have a image showing a pullover. Therefore, we need to select 'class_names[2]' to get the corresponding name. We are doing this, because the labels are only numbers and we need a way to output everything for a actual human.","538c73d9":"## Testing the model\n\nIn this section we will test the model by using the 'fashion-mnist_test.csv' file.","59c8fe71":"Here we are seperating the labels and the features again. The structure of the data is the same as in the training file.","f0acc382":"Now we will evaluate the model by reshaping the test features values again to the corresponding 28x28 size.","1ad3b302":"We will use the adam optimizer and the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function, because the adam optimizer is the best for this problem and the loss function is pretty default for a classical cnn.","3e198285":"## Seperating the data\nNow, we need to seperate the features and the labels. There are many ways you can seperate the data, but I've used iloc to seperate it."}}
