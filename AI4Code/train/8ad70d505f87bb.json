At first, we will see how to use pandas to extract tables from a website.\n\nPython provides a powerful library BeautifulSoup for web scraping. As a second method, we will learn how to use BeautifulSoup to extract tables from a website. Apart from tables, we can extract list, texts, paragraphs, headers and all sort of things present on the website using BrautifulSoup.","b0f5e6de":"#### Understanding the output\nThe above response is in html format which is rendered by browsers to create the content on the website. Beautiful Soup gives us similar functionality of extracting useful informattion from the above content.
