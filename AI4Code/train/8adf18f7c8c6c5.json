I will restrict to Priority 1 crimes. The numbers shown under \"Incident Type Id\" are the total number of crimes reported in that particular beat. ","2f5c1831":"**Hello!**\n\nIn this study, I will demonstrate my approach to combining datasets from multiple files, conducting some exploratory data analysis, and finally using time-series analysis with ARIMA modelling to forecast crime rates in Oakland, CA. \nI drew inspriation from Daniel Herman (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/syncush\/where-not-to-live-in-oakland-eda) who had a great idea of taking the difference in time to make some interesting conclusions. \n\nLet's start from the beginning and import the tools we need. Pandas is extremely useful here as well as the necessary sklearn and stats packages. ","a9f64ece":"Once again, I believe there is a problem with Kaggle's interpretation of \"weird_addrss\" because it isn't correctly finding the right lines. It works perfectly on my machine. Either way, it doesn't actually impact the analysis, it is just useful for future work which may depend on clean locations. \n\nLet's now begin to work with time series data as Daniel did before, but I will take a somewhat different approach. ","6568b069":"Wow! The longest case to solve took almost one and half years. This case was a vehicle collision which started in July of 2015 and was closed in December of 2016. I wonder what took so long? Le'ts see what icidents take the longest  to close, on average. You can interactively choose the top range. I wioll drop the top three overall because they will heavily influence the mean closing times. ","78e2196c":"The \"Beat\" of the city is an area where an officer may be assigned on patrol.

Unfortunately, some of the files have columns with different names (\"Location  \" vs \"Location\" vs \"Location 1\", and the order of the columns changes slightly as well. Pandas can handle the order changing, but I need to make sure all the columns are describing the same data. Also I couldn't see any evidence of data in a \"Location \" column, so I dropped it. ","d8d954ed":"**Thank you!**\n\nPlease leave me a comment with any constructive criticism and feedback.","158be282":"After more inspection, there a only 24 rows with \"Priority\" as zero which isn't documented. Priority 1 is very urgent, and priority 2 is not as urgent. These rows will be excluded, and Area Id & Agency will be dropped. Agency is the same value in every row, \"OP\", presumably for Oakland Police. We must now remember to reset the index. For some reason, Kaggle doesn't like Area Id or Agency and gives an error, so I can't drop them here, but the rest of the project works unaffected. ","c029e854":"The first step I took is to load and inspect the first file to check the columns. ","ee5a1a97":"Let's take another step in data cleansing, and from the original data, I noticed that some of the interesection from the 2012 data and others have broken formats. I cleaned them up by finding the ones with these strange formats, removing the formatting, and replacing the \"&amp;\" with just &. \n\nI'd like to point out now that some locations are just AV & Something with nothing before AV. This is likely just a truncation error from the original dataset when uploading to Kaggle. I kept it as-is.","578ca369":"I will now begin to forecase future crimes in Oakland by conducting a time-series analysis using an ARIMA model. In raw form, the crimes committed will seem to occur at random frequency, so I will resample the data into weekly reportings.  Although the dataset is large enough to break into different crime types, I will aggregate by total number of crimes committed for now. \n\nARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, and is a model which can cpature temporal imformation about the system. The \"AR\" in ARIMA  represents how far back to look for a correlative feature, the \"I\" represents the differnce between the current observation, and the Ith one before it, and the \"MA\" represents the moving average of a window of time, which takes in to account the residual of an observation with it's lagged observation.\n\nARIMA models are specified by p,d,q, (AR,I,MA) and if there is seasonality, another 3-set of components to describe the seasonality. \n\nOriginally, I was going to just focus on predicting murders. However, there is not enough temporal structure for any meaningful predictions (which is great for Oakland!) So I will continue to aggregate for all crimes reported","ce2c6b70":"In the final figure, the red lines are the predicted weekly crime reports, and the blue are the actual values. I shifted the  predictions up by about 40 which improved the RMSE overall by about 11.1%.\n\nAlthough there is some seasonaility in the predictions, using a SARIMA model will better capture the aunnual rise in crime during the summers. ","c0e2b135":"Now we have beautiful time-stamped data to work with. Let's explore by finding the maximum time it took to close a case.","26f28349":"Now we have a fully comprehensive dataframe which can be used in analysis. Several null values are present in \"Area Id\", so let's address them now. Ideally, I would the street address locations to pinpoint the Area ID, and replace all the Area Id's using the convention of the newest data. Unfortunately after I did this, I noticed the same intersections correspond to different IDs. Furthermore, after 2014, Oakland started classifiying Area Id with a P in the front, and Area P1 doesn't necessarily correspond to Area 1, even though they had the same street intersection. This error could be due to discrepant data, or perhaps a re-zoning of Area IDs. Either way, I decided that Area ID was very broad, and \"Beat\" is more specific and consistant, so I dropped Area Id altogether. Also, it would take my machine over nine hours to replace each Area Id with a different one. "}}
