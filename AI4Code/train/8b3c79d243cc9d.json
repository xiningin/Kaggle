The traffic signs occupy most of the area of each image, which is going to make our job easier: we don't have to look for the sign in the image. And we have a variety of angles and lighting conditions, which will help our model generalize.","132d7451":"# Objective: Traffic Sign Classification\n\nI'll start with a simple goal: classifiction. Given an image of a traffic sign, our model should be able to tell it's type (e.g. Stop sign, speed limit, yield sign, ...etc.). We'll work with images that are properly cropped such that the traffic sign takes most of the image.\n","bebad2b7":"Interesting! It looks like our dataset considers all speeding limit signs to be of the same class regardless of the numbers on them. That's fine, as long as we know about it beforehand and don't let it confuse us later when the output doesn't match our expectation.","de053c7c":"## Handling images of different sizes?\n\nMost neural networks expect a fixed-size input, and our network is no exception. But as we've seen above, our images are not all the same size. A common approach is to crop and pad the images to a selected apect ratio, but then we have to make sure that we don't cut-off parts of the traffic signs in the process. That seems like it might require manual work! Let's do a simpler solution instead : We'll just resize the images to a fixed size and ignore the distortions caused by the different aspect ratios. A person can easily recognize a traffic sign even if it's compressed or stretched a bit, so we hope that our model can as well.\n\n\n### What are the sizes of our image anyway?\n","a649e456":"\n\nThe sizes are correct. But check the min and max values! They now range from 0 to 1.0, which is different from the 0-255 range we saw above. The resizing function did that transformation for us. Normalizing values to the range 0.0-1.0 is very common so we'll keep it. But remember to multiply by 255 if you later want to convert the images back to the normal 0-255 range.\n","331c26fc":"# Traffic Sign Recognition with Tensorflow","7b4527fc":"\n\nThe sizes seem to hover around 128x128. If we resize them to, say, 32x32, we'll have reduced the data and the model size by a factor of 16. And 32x32 is probably still big enough to recognize the signs, so let's go with that.","133233a5":"# Training","ecc4765e":"## Parse and Load the Training Data\n\nThe Training directory contains sub-directories with sequental numerical names from 00000 to 00061. The name of the directory represents the labels from 0 to 61, and the images in each directory represent the traffic signs that belong to that label.","97ce8cf4":"The 32x32 images are not as sharp but still recognizable.  Let's print the sizes of a few images to verify that we got it right.\n","ad77ae54":"## Evaluation\n\nIt's fun to visualize the results, but we need a more precise way to measure the accuracy of our model.
