Usually, when we create a plot, we follow these steps:\n- Create the figure\n- Adjust geometry of the figure\n- Adjust aesthetics of the figure\n\nThis can make things really confusing from developer point of view. As developer it's difficult to know when one should an object, when to use a particular function.\n\nGrammar of graphics is a concept which breaks this flow in multiple parts, with each part being handled by a function. As we add more and more function with help of simple + operator, more and more complex plots can be generated.","96326e16":"### KDE plot\n\nKDE is short for Kernel Density Estimate. It is based on a statistical technique of the same name which works on smoothning out the data. KDE plot addresses a very important problem with the line plot.

Five different types of wine is a good number because it keeps the result interpretable; eight is sometimes mentioned as a suggested upper bound. Many dataset fields will not fit this critereon naturally, so you have to \"make do\", as here, by selecting a group of interest.\n\nThe second limitation is one of interpretability. As easy as they are to make, and as pretty as they look, stacked plots make it really hard to distinguish concrete values. For example, looking at the plots above, can you tell which wine got a score of 87 more often: Red Blends (in purple), Pinot Noir (in red), or Chardonnay (in green)? It's actually really hard to tell!","36cdff04":"## SubPlots\n\nSubplots are used to combine information about multiple related things into one figure. \n\nWhen pandas works with matplotlib to create a figure, it follows following steps - \n- Make a matplotlib Figure object. \n-  Make matplotlib AxesSubplot object, assign it to Figure.\n- Use AxesSubplot methods to draw figure on screen\n- Return result to user.\n\nWe use the similar flow below to create subplots.","017eda7f":"## Time Series Plotting\n\nMost of the visualizations deal with interval variables, nominal categorical or ordinal categorical variables etc. There is another class of variables called as 'Time Series Variable' which needs special treatment.\n\nTime series variables are plotted by values which are specific to time. Time variable is linear and infinitely fine grained, so it can be considered a special case of interval variable.\n\nThere are two ways in which time information may be included in the data. \nIn the 'Strong' Case - Example of stock prices, data is collected according to various dates. Changing any date causes a huge change in data. \n\nIn the 'Weak' Case - Example of shelter outcomes, dates act merely as descriptions of records. They are less intertwined with the data compared to the 'Strong' Case.\n\nTime is generally measured in periods, which can be of varying length. Pandas has in built data type called period.","114e6b6e":"### Histogram\n\nHistomgrams are basically continuous bar charts.

The first variable is on x axis, for which we want to plot ( for eg. kdeplot). \nThe second variable is the category based on which we want to split the facets. \n\nAt the end note that, our use case is: Plot our usual graphs for some categorical variable on x axis, but split these plots into multiple facets based on another \nCategorical variable. This can be exceptionally helpful so many times. \n\nThe core seaborn utility for faceting is the FacetGrid. A FacetGrid is an object which stores some information on how you want to break up your data visualization.\n\nFor example, suppose that we're interested in (as in the previous notebook) comparing strikers and goalkeepers in some way. To do this, we can create a FacetGrid with our data, telling it that we want to break the Position variable down by col (column).","c0dca5f1":"### Dist Plot\n\nDist plot is basically pandas histogram.","b831418a":"### Pairplot\n\nPairplot is generated by taking as input some columns as a dataframe, and seaborn outputs subplots for each combination of those columns.
