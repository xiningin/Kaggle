Extracting platform type of tweets\n\nApart from cleaning text data, regex can be used effectively to extract information from given text data. For example, we extracted dates from text in the video module. But, Regex can be used creatively to make new features.\n\nTake an example of the statusSource column in the dataset. If you look closely, you will find that you can find out more about the platform(android\/iphone\/web\/windows phone) used for the given tweet. Information like this can be very useful for our machine learning model.","d3bfc624":"Fixing the & and &\n\nIf you explore the tweets further, you'll see that there is & present in many tweets for example, RT @kanimozhi:","dd1abf52":"# Applications of Regular Expressions\n\n- Segmentation of words from Sentences\n\n- Segmentation of sentence from Paragraph\n\n- Text Cleaning - ( Noise Removal )\n\n- Information retrival from text ( ex: -Chatot, News Dataset etc. )\n","072d4eb4":"# Implementation of Regular Expression ","52fd2900":"# Consider an Upvote if you like it !","29b34b57":"# Regex for Cleaning Text Data\n\na) Removing RT\n\nRT means that the given tweet is a retweet of another which is useful information, but fortunately it is already present in the isRetweet column of our dataset so we can get rid of it.","16f31387":"# Regular Expression Function\n\n- Match : Find the first occurance of pattern in the string\n- Search : Locates the pattern in the string\n- Findall : Find all occurance of the string\n- sub : Search and replace of the string\n- split : Split the text by the given regular expression pattern","277f9cd8":"**b.
