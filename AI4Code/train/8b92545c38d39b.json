Internally, SQL databases all operate very differently. Externally, however, they all provide the same API, the \"Structured Query Language\" (or...SQL...for short).\n\nFor the purposes of analysis however we can usually just think of a SQL database as a set of tables with names, and SQL as a minor inconvenience in getting that data out of said tables.\n\nTo get the data out of `SQLite` and into `pandas`:","9bd9d333":"## Naive Accessors","255045dd":"## Maps\nA \"map\" is a term, borrowed from mathematics, for a function that takes one set of values and \"maps\" them to another set of values. In data science we often have a need for creating new representations from existing data, or for transforming data from the format it is in now to the format that we want it to be in later.\n\nThere are two mapping method that you will use often. [`Series.map`](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.Series.map.html) is the first, and slightly simpler one. For example, suppose that we wanted to remean the scores the wines recieved to 0. We can do this as follows:","048e7e33":"These operators are faster than the `map` or `apply` because they uses speed ups built into `pandas`.

For example, we may transform the `points` column from its existing `int64` data type into a `float64` data type:","1053f29b":"`rename` lets us rename index or column values by specifying a index or column keyword parameter.","e836715a":"## Sorting\nwhen outputting the result of a `groupby`, the order of the rows is dependent on the values in the index, not in the data.\n\nTo get data in the order want it in we can sort it ourselves.

They also require two levels of labels to retrieve a value, an operation that looks something like this. Dealing with multi-index output is a common \"gotcha\" for users new to `pandas`.\n\nHowever, in general the `MultiIndex` method you will use most often is the one for converting back to a regular index, the reset_index method:","4647a90b":"- SQL Files\n\nSQL databases are where most of the data on the web ultimately gets stored.\n\nConnecting to a SQL database requires a connector, something that will handle siphoning data from the database.\n\n`pandas` won't do this for you automatically because there are many, many different types of SQL databases out there, each with its own connector.

In order of increasing complexity, these are `concat`, `join`, and `merge`. Most of what `merge` can do can also be done more simply with `join`.\n\nThe simplest combining method is `concat`. This function works just like the `list.concat` method in core Python: given a list of elements, it will smush those elements together along an axis.\n\nThis is useful when we have data in different `DataFrame` or `Series` objects but having the same fields (columns). One example: the [YouTube Videos](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasnaek\/youtube-new) dataset, which splits the data up based on country of origin (e.g. Canada and the UK, in this example). If we want to study multiple countries simultaneously, we can use `concat` to smush them together:","0c76e8d7":"Here there are lot of values on LHS of `-` and single value on RHS. `pandas` automatically substract single value from every value on LHS. **Broadcasting**.\n\nIt works equally well if we have equal number of values on both sides.

This `DataFrame` is accessible to us directly using the `apply` method, and we can then manipulate the data in any way we see fit. For example, here's one way of selecting the name of the first wine reviewed from each winery in the dataset:","9c4392cb":"`fillna` supports a few strategies for imputing missing values explained in [the official function documentation](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html).","aebd94b8":"**[Pandas Micro-Course Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/pandas)**\n\n---\n","824a801f":"## Index-based selection\n`pandas` has its own accessor operators, `loc` and `iloc`.\n\n`pandas` indexing works in one of two paradigms. The first is index-based selection: selecting data based on its numerical position in the data. `iloc` follows this paradigm.\n\nBoth `loc` and `iloc` are row-first, column-second. This is the opposite of what we do in native Python, which is column-first, row-second.","02dea11d":"A `Series` is a sequence of data values. If a `DataFrame` is a table, a `Series` is a list.
