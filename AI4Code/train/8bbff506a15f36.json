What is balanced data distribution? Let me explain using this example. If in our data set we have male samples which are approximately the same as female samples, then we can say our dataset is balanced. On the other hand, if there is a very high difference between the male samples and female samples, then we can say our dataset is imbalanced.\n\n\"Imbalanced classifications pose a challenge for predictive modeling as most of the machine learning algorithms used for classification were designed around the assumption of an equal number of examples for each class. This results in models that have poor predictive performance, specifically for the minority class. This is a problem because typically, the minority class is more important and therefore the problem is more sensitive to classification errors for the minority class than the majority class.\" (Brownlee, 2019).\n\nHandling imbalanced data is whole another story. Therefore, I'm not going to discuss it here. However, I would like to attach some articles here for your reference. \n\n* https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/what-is-imbalanced-classification\/\n* https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/failure-of-accuracy-for-imbalanced-class-distributions\/\n* https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/handling-imbalanced-datasets-in-machine-learning-7a0e84220f28\n\nOk, Now we have some idea about the target variable.

Among them, the Naive Bayes model is able to provide the highest accuracy 58.8% with a standard deviation of 27%. The standard deviation shows us, how precise the estimates are. This means in our case that the accuracy of our model can differ +-27%. I think the reason for the low accuracy is the size of the dataset. Therefore, if we need to achieve better results, I believe that we have to provide enough data.\n\nHope you've enjoyed my work, if you like my work and need to share something with me leave a comment :)","7e607a7a":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\"><strong>The Data<\/strong><\/div>","26552e05":"Let's store model name, mean accuracy, and standard deviation in new datafram.","5fcc09ee":"The 10-fold cross-validation technique is used to evaluate each algorithm, importantly configured with the same random seed to ensure that the same splits to the training data are performed and that each algorithms is evaluated in precisely the same way.\n\n* https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/compare-machine-learning-algorithms-python-scikit-learn\/","7c08d6f8":"Variable \"Favorite Color\" contains three values: \n* Cool - 56%\n* Warm - 33.3%\n* Netural - 10.6% \n\nAccording to data, we can see that more males like Cool and Natural colors when compared to females.
