I just plotted the global sales against years in a line chart because it is a trend over time. I also expected the graph to be pretty simple by mostly linearly increasing over time because I figured video games had become more popular over the years so the sales had probably gone up as well. However, the graph surprised me and was shaped more like a bell curve. The unsurprising aspect of this was the graph was very similar to the graph for games released by year so the explanation seems to be that less games are being made. \n\nPotential reasons for less games being made include more mobile games (which aren't in this dataset) or mobile devices, and the increase of microtransactions (spending in a game) or multiplayer making it so that develpers have more incentive to work on a game after finishing it and players have more incentive to keep playing it. Also, the highpoint in the graph seems to correspond the the release of the Nintendo Wii.","6fc0403b":"# Questions\n<ol>\n    <li> How has the sales of games changed over time? Has it increased? Is it linear? Is it correlated to the number of games released?<\/li>   \n    <li> Which publishers had the most sales? Which games sold the most?<\/li>\n    <li> How has the popularity of different genres changed over the years? <\/li>\n<\/ol>","f608d485":"# Most Successful Publishers and Games\n\nThis question is also very simple which publishers and games were the best in this timeframe. I decided this by sales for both the publishers and the games. Sales seems like a good measure of both money the game made and how well liked it was. A rating also would've been good but this dataset doesnt have one. I then created a bar chart for both the top 10 publishers and the top 20 games. I chose a bar chart because it had categorical data. \n\nNintendo does very well in both of these graphs, they're the top publisher and are the publisher of many of the top 10 games in particular and with Wii Sports especially selling way more than any other game (it was included with Wii). The other publishers that do well are mostly big publishers and the games are mostly well known and popular franchises. Nintendo have so many well known and popular franchises is probably the biggest reason why they do so well in sales.","02955382":"# Data Dictionary\n\n### Items\n\n| Field | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Rank | Ranking ordered by Global Sales |\n| Name | The name of each game |\n| Platform | The platform or system this game was released on on (i.e. Wii, PS3, etc)|\n| Year | The year the game was released in |\n| Genre | The type of game the game is |\n| Publisher | The publisher who published this game |\n| NA_Sales | The number of copies of this game that were sold in North America (in millions)|\n| EU_Sales | The number of copies of this game that were sold in Europe (in millions)|\n| JP_Sales | The number of copies of this game that were sold in Japan (in millions)|\n| Other_Sales | The number of copies of this game that were sold in places other than North America, Europe or Japan (in millions)|\n| Global_Sales | The number of copies of this game that were sold in the world (in millions)|","423c9e3b":"# Data Cleaning\nOnly the year and publisher columns had null values and those null values were only a small fraction of the entire data set, so I just dropped them. There were also some outlier year values that seemed off so one of them I edited to a value I found online and 3 I just dropped since I couldn't find a value online and it seemed like the data in the table might not be right. The only data type I changed was year from a float to an int, because it was a discrete value and also wasn't a complete date. The only column I dropped was the rank column because it was redundent when you could just group or sort by global sales anyway. The sales were all already divided so they were in millions in the dataset.","cdfa2d9a":"# Genre Popularity over Time\nHere we see how popular different genres were from 1980-2016. I used line charts for this question because it involves trends over a span of time. I used both global sales and just games released because I thought global sales would represent how much consumers liked the genre and games released would represent how confident publishers and developers felt in a genre being popular and\/or profitable. For both of the graphs, I plotted the full graph, but then also two smaller halves so that it would be easier to read especially at the beginning. Since there are 12 unique genres I used 'tab20' as my colormap so that each genre would be a different color and therefore identifiable. \n\nThe differences between the two graphs seemed pretty minimal. The biggest difference seemed to be genres in the sales graph sometimes getting spikes from when a specific game was extremely popular. The sales graph also seemed like it might be a little more volatile with lines that were oscilating more than its games released counterpart. Sports games being such a popular genre surprised me but Wii Sports definetely gave a boost in 2006 and Wii Sports Resort gave another one in 2009 but even before 2006 sports games had the most games being released of any genre for around 8 years (from 1995-2003). More recently, sports games have had relatively less games being released but is still doing well in sales most likely because of a few very popular sports game franchises like Madden and Fifa for example. Shooter games from 2010 onward have a similar trend where their sales seems to do better than games released again likely due to a few popular franchises like Call of Duty and Battlefield for example. One final interesting part of the graph is that miscellaneous had its biggest sales spike starting when the Wii released, which had motion controls. I would be interested in if that genre has also gone up since 2017 when the Nintendo Switch was relased which also has motion controls or in the future as more virtual reality games get released. From 2000 onwards, action games do very well in both graphs.","4801cac8":"<h1> Video Game Sales Analysis <\/h1> \nAn analysis video game sales between 1980 and 2016.
