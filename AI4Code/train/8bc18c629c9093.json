This will help us in understanding the challenges and difficulties in conducting a study on the seasons\/climate that are observed in the country Brazil.\n\nFollowing are the different types of climatic conditions that can experienced in different states or parts of the country Brazil in a day or across months of an year.\n\n- **Desert** - is a climate in which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation.\n- **Equatorial** - climate is typically hot, very humid and wet. Can expect at least 60mm of rain fall every month of the year.\n- **Tropical** -  the temperature remains relatively constant (hot) throughout the year. Sunlight is intense.\n- **Semiarid** - receives precipitation below potential evapotranspiration (evaporation from Earth's land + Ocean + Plant transpiration), but not as low as a desert climate.\n- **Oceanic** - Cool summers and cool but not cold winters, with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature. Lacks dry season.\n- **Subtropical** - climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and cold to mild winters.\n\nIf we look at the **\"Koppen's climate classification map for Brazil\"** article an outcome of extensive research done by **Clayton Alcarde Alvares, Jose\u00b4 Luiz Stape, Paulo Cesar Sentelhas, Jose\u00b4 Leonardo de Moraes Gonc\u00b8alves & Gerd Sparovek** (link : https:\/\/www.schweizerbart.de\/papers\/metz\/detail\/22\/82078\/Koppens_climate_classification_map_for_Brazil?af=search) published in Jan 2014 and per the Wikipedia (link : https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification), \n\nClimates are divided into five climate groups (based on **seasonal precipitation** and **temperature patterns**):\n- A (tropical): Af, Am, As and Aw\n- B (dry): BSh, BSk, BWh and BWk\n- C (temperate): Cfa, Cfb, Cfc, Cwa, Cwb, Cwc, Csa, Csb and Csc\n- D (continental): Dfa, Dfb, Dfc, Dfd, Dwa, Dwb, Dwc, Dwd, Dsa, Dsb, Dsc, Dsd\n- E (polar): ET and EF\n\nA, B, C, D and E are the climate **main groups**.\n\n2nd letter in these main groups **except E** represent seasonal precipitation.\n\n3rd letter in these main groups **except A** represent temperature subgroup.\n\nLet's divert from detailed discussion on each of these climate classifications and focus on the top-10 states (according to no. of forest fire requests registered).

Sao Paulo is the most populated city in Brazil. \n\n![title](.\/brazil_regions.JPG)\n\n(Courtesy : https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/States_of_Brazil)\n\nGeographically, country Brazil is divided into 5 regions. They are:<br>\n- North Region\n- North-east Region\n- Central-west Region\n- South-east Region\n- South Region\n\nThe 26 states and a federal district can be seen categorized among these 5 regions in the map above.\n\nSince, forest fires are either due to a drastic change in the climatic conditions around the forest regions or this trouble could be a man made. We cannot rule either of these. However, with the limited set of data and the information we have gathered till now we cannot prove either of the cases completely and for sure the man made angle cannot be proven with the given data set although we may prove partially that the forests are catching fire because of the sudden change in the climatic conditions.\n\nTo get a better understanding forest fires across the country, we need to understand the climatic changes experienced across different regions and in fact in every state of the country Brazil.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen system, Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes:<br>\n- **Desert** - is a climate in which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation.\n- **Equatorial** - climate is typically hot, very humid and wet. Can expect at least 60mm of rain fall every month of the year.\n- **Tropical** -  the temperature remains relatively constant (hot) throughout the year.
