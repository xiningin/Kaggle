This training is conducted by the Data Science Council of America (DASCA): Principal Data Science (PDS). This training is quite complete with fundamental learning to advanced data science concepts such as big data best practices, business strategies for data, building cross-organizational support, machine learning, natural language processing, scholastic modeling and more.\n\nThis means that we can conclude that **the cost of recruiting one new employee is around 1.37x higher than the cost of training one employee.**","54751e04":"## Major Discipline","9e37189e":"From the results above, we can conclude.
