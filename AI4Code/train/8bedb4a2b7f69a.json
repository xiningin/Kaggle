They are sometimes called Predictor Variable as well.\n\nIn our example, the input variables are: 'fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar', 'chlorides', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'density','pH', 'sulphates', and 'alcohol'. \n\nAll of these will help us predict the quality of the wine.\n","d2f684dd":"# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis\n#### Agenda\n\n\n*   **Loading Libraries**\n*   **Loading Data** \n*   **Data Analysis**\n*   **Data Visualization**\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn one of the important step of a Data Science pipeline i.e. Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In this step, we try to understand the data and the underlying interactions between different variables.\n\nThe dataset we will be using here is the wine quality data. Kaggle has provided only red wine quality dataset. The dataset I have used is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Both Red Wine and White Wine Data is used in this notebook.\n\n**Data Set Information:**\nThe two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. Quality is based on sensory scores (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).","d0c90fca":"We can check how each features are reated with others using corr() function.","835117a6":"Let's explore different statistical measures that we have got from desribe().\n\n\n*   **count:** total count of non-null values in the column\n*   **mean**: the average of all the values in that column\n*   **min:** the minimum value in the column\n*   **max:** the maximum value in the column\n*   **25%:** first quartile in the column after we arrange those values in ascending order\n*   **50%:** this is the median or the second quartile\n*   **75%:** the third quartile \n*   **std:** this is the standard deviation (i.e. measure of depreciation, you must have read in the basics of statistics study material)\n\n**Note:** 25%, 50%, and 75% are nothing but corresponding percentile values\n","ade1819b":"From the above correlation matrix, we can observe that there is a relatively high positive correlation between **fixed_acidity** and **citric_acid**, **fixed_acidity** and **density**. Similarly we can observe there is a relatively high negative correlation between **fixed_acidity** and **pH**. There is relatively high positive correlation between **alcohol** presence and quality of the wines.","ee07c153":"The correlation between **fixed_acidity** and **citric_acid** is 0.67 (you could find this value in the correlation matrix of red wines).

The attributes '**density**' and '**pH**' are quite normally distributed (you must have read about normal distribution in basic statistics study material). Now looking at the attribute **quality**, we can observe that the wines with average quality (i.e. quality rating 5 to 7) are more than bad and good quality of wines.","38156518":"Our brains are good at spotting patterns in pictures.
