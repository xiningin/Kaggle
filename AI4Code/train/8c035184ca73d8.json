Which YouTube channel have most viewers, subscribers, video uploads etc?\n2. Does more video upload gives out the more video views and more subscribers?\n3. Does more subscriber gives more video views?\n4. Is there a way to predict the number of subscribers based on the number of video uploaded by the channel and number of video views on it? \n\nThen, here I have tried to answer some of those questions using some visual tools and some analytical tools. ","e59c959e":"Here I am interested how all the channels in the list distribute in terms of subscribers, video uploads and subscribers going from maximum to minimum in each class. Interestingly there is huge peak at the top list and tend to gain a plateau for the other channels quickly. ","ef9fe627":"**Exploratory data analysis**\n\nHere I start with plotting some bar graphs showing top 20 in each kind of classification of the channels. First three are top 20 by their ranking, where their number of viewers, subscribers and video views are presented. The second three are top 20 based on each of the group themselves.

At least the positive correlation remains the positive and vice versa. \n\nBut if we look at the scatter plot below, visually the negative correlation between video uploads and subscribers seem to have gone. This is the effect of log transformation which is not to be confued thinking they have positive correlations.","e4c06378":"**Relation between variables**\n\nLooking at the plot below, it is seen that number of subscribers is positively correlated with the number of viewers. That is expected. But the number of subscribers is negativley correlated with the number of video uploaded by that channel. This might be surprising. The video channels attracting the larger number of viwers and subscribers are uploading smaller number of videos. \n\n","c9fb0875":"**Linear model**\n\nHere I tried to make a linear model based on the data. I am tring to predict the number of subscribers given the \nthe number of video uploaded and number of video viewed. First started with the linear relation between two variables.
