With LM training improvement (in terms of loss), at some point you'll notice some nice improvement in quality of the generated text.\n\nOne sample generated with my better-trained LM:\n\n> 'An italian man was found dead in his yard due to heat conditions on Sunday night , his spokeswoman said . The office manager of the Ultra retired man \u2019s office told buzzfeed News there being no sign of comfort . The man at his 911 home told guy , he had been in contact with his car \u2019s owner before asleep and then immediately responded to starting fire . The man named Guy made a news video at PARKING Station in which the Mississippi State Police shot multiple people with Tim Shepherd to get their son alive , Mark Morris , a family friend dangling near his wife \u2019s house , said . The teen told police he was winning inclusion in general . Police dragged him into the house \u2014 where the officer had been yards away \u2014 during his die - hard bid at a nearby snow salon . The family voted in favor of Appreciative and arrested more than three months later : They tried to detained him .
