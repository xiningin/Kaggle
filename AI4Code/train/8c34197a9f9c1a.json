Fortunately, Heads or Tails uploaded a dataset on the US that he updates daily: [COVID-19 US County JHU Data & Demographic](COVID-19 US County JHU Data & Demographic).\n\nThe dataset consists of two csv's and a shapefile of the US counties. In the next version, I will use the shapefile to make maps, but for now I will focus on extracting some key figures. The cases and deaths are cumulative. Therefore, I will only keep the most recent date for each county\/state combination.","b8b6d8fd":"As you can see, the state of New York has 1259 Deaths per Million.

As I want to use built-in geometries of plotly.express later on to plot numbers on a world map, I am also merging the three-letter ISO country code to the dataframe.\n\nThis enables me to add the population numbers and ISO codes to the dataframe with Corona figures by country, and calculate the 'Cases per million inhabitants' and 'Deaths per million inhabitants'. Below you can see a sample of the resulting dataframe.","b0bf0a09":"# Storytelling COVID-19\n\nInitially, I just wanted to know how bad the situation in my country, the Netherlands, was compared to other countries as we had high numbers of confirmed cases and only 17 million inhabitants. In order to do so, I used the [Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sudalairajkumar\/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) and I uploaded my own dataset: [Countries of the World; ISO codes and population](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/erikbruin\/countries-of-the-world-iso-codes-and-population), and made plotly world maps based on the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths per million inhabitants.\n\nAfter having done that, the pandemic unfortunately became worse and worse, and I wanted to investigate more. This version includes time series trends and also time series trends that start at the date of the first confirmed case\/death reported (\"Day Zero\"). On April 12th, I wanted to add more insight on the situation in the US, and therefore added dataset [COVID-19 US County JHU Data & Demographics](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/headsortails\/covid19-us-county-jhu-data-demographics).\n\n**Observations on May 5th**\n*(Please be aware that this may be different if you fork and run this kernel, as the dataset is updated daily)*\n\n- When looking at the number of death per million, Belgium is now the country with the highest number of Deaths per Million. However, if we would treat the US states as countries, the ranking would be as follows:\n    - 1. New York State, 2. New Jersey 3. Belgium, 4. Connecticut, 5. Massachusetts, 6. Spain, 7 Italy\n- The relative Death rates of New York are terrible. While countries such as Belgium, Italy and Spain have rates around 500-700 Death per Million, the state of New York has 1259 Deaths per Million , and New York City has 2242 Death per Million!\n\n- Qatar is the country with most confirmed cases per million inhabitants. Most other countries in the \"top\" 10  of countries with the highest numbers of cases per million inhabitants are Western European countries, with the US at 5th place.\n\n- The US is the country with the highest (absolute) number of confirmed cases and unfortunately the trend is steep upward. Over the past weeks the US has also passed Spain and Italy regarding the total number of Deaths.\n\n- When looking the the time series of the cumulative numbers of deaths while taking the day of the first reported death as \"Day Zero\", we can see that China managed to flatten the curve while in Italy and Spain the number of victims really exploded after 15-20 days after the first casualty. Although more \"delayed\", the trend is now looking very bad for especially the US.\n\n- Belarus, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are doing best when looking at the number of deadly victims relative to the number of confirmed cases.\n\n# Table of contents\n* [1.

In addition, although more \"delayed\", the trend is also looking bad for countries such as France, the UK, and especially the US.","78f0b606":"## 2.2 World map: Bubble chart showing Deaths by Province\/state","2b519621":"# 4. Deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases\n\nTables are filtered on countries with at least 100 Deaths. Italy has the highest ratio, and countries like Algeria and Mexico are somewhat surprisingly in the Top 10. I assume that this may be due to relatively low testing activity.","5ad1d4c6":"## 1.5 World map with Deaths per Million for each country\n\n**Hovering over the map below shows the info in a tooltip.

All I can do for now is what the total numbers for NYC look like. As you can see, the Deaths per Million is 2242, which is again way worse than the state of New York average.","a65b59b5":"## 1.3 World map with Cases per Million for each country\n\n**Hovering over the map below shows the info in a tooltip.
