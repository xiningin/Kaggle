It articulates a wide range of social phenomena that shapes the interaction between the poor and the non-poor, such as aversion, antipathy, contempt, disgust, disregard, fear and hate.\n\n\"Aporophobic speeches select their victims not for their personal features but for \u201cbeing poor\u201d (however one might measure their poverty). As such, aporophobia thrives on inequality and social asymmetric relations. Cortina argues that much of what is contemporaneously understood as xenophobia (in particular, but not only, in the European context) is in fact aporophobia, because while rich foreign tourists are welcome, poor immigrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea are despised. Current controversies, she argues, are not about immigrants but about poor immigrants.\"\n\nAfter Covid Pandemics the same is happening. People are rejection those that are living on the streets. And have no longer any opportunity since their jobs simply disappeared after the Pandemics. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.iqs.edu\/en\/aporophobia","c95027a9":"![](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Flavio-Comim\/publication\/344451055\/figure\/fig2\/AS:942122517680130@1601630920551\/The-3A-Micro-Measurement-Model-of-aporophobia-info-spaces_Q640.jpg)researchgate.net","9af103d7":"#Dataprep\n\n\nAcknowlegdements\n\nSFU Data Science Research Group - SIMON FRASER UNIVERSITY\n\nhttps:\/\/sfu-db.github.io\/dataprep\/user_guide\/eda\/plot.html\n\nhttps:\/\/dataprep.ai\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cs.sfu.ca\/~jnwang\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cs.sfu.ca\/~jnwang\/ppt\/DataPrep-Overview-Databricks.pdf","4c035840":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS8DS9KRuZ07bMQJwKQpunb-msJzpAUekZ2Xg&usqp=CAU)facebook.com"}}
