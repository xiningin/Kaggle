Then, we will preprocess the images by converting its type, resizing it and may be trying some data augmentation techniques.

Train the model\nSince there are only two possible labels for the image, we will be using the binary_crossentropy loss. When we fit the model, identify the class weights. Because we are using a TPU, training will be relatively quick.\n\nFor our metrics, we want to include precision and recall as they will provide use with a more informed picture of how good our model is. Accuracy tells us what fractions are the labels are correct. Since our data is not balanced, accuracy might give a skewed sense of a good model (i.e. a model that always predicts other will be 74% accurate but is not a good model).\n\nPrecision is the number of true positives (TP) over the sum of TP and false positives (FP). It shows what fraction of labeled positives are actually correct.\n\nRecall is the number of TP over the sum of TP and false negatves (FN). It shows what fraction of actual positives are correct.","4415be39":"The code below count the number of organic and recyclable waste in the trainset","a574daf4":"The code below will load the datasets only once and keep it in memory because it is small.
