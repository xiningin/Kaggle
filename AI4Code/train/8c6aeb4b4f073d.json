So, we import each and every library that we want to use.\n\nIn data science, numpy and pandas are most commonly used libraries. Numpy is required for calculations like means, medians, square roots, etc. Pandas is used for data processin and data frames. We chose alias names for our libraries for the sake of our convenience (numpy --> np and pandas --> pd).\n\n**We can import all the libraries that we think might be needed or can import as we go along.**","8a9a32bf":"There are two columns:\n\n*  age: The age of the customer\n*  bought_insurance: If the customer bought insurance (1) or not (0).

Input variables are those quantities whose values are changed naturally in an experiment, whereas output variable is the one whose values are dependent on the input variables. So, input variables are also known as independent variables as its values are not dependent on any other quantity, and output variable\/s are also known as dependent variables as its values are dependent on other variable i.e. input variables. Like here in this data, we can see that whether a person will buy insurance or not is dependent on the age of that person\n\nBy convention input variables are represented with 'X' and output variables are represented with 'y'.","d50d6188":"There is one person who had actually bought insurance but our model predicted that the person had not bought insurance.

As you can see the confusion matrix above, false positives (fp = 0) and false negatives (fn = 1) are almost same. So here accuracy score is the best measure.\n\nFurther reading: https:\/\/blog.exsilio.com\/all\/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures\/","1e3bed57":"## Loading Data\nPandas module is used for reading files.

For this purpose, we always split (both input and output data) the given data into training set  which will be used to train the model, and test set which will be used to check how accurately the model is predicting outcomes.\n\nFor this purpose we have a class called 'train_test_split' in the 'sklearn.model_selection' module.","50cdab09":"If you notice the above code cell, I have used two square brackets while taking input variables and only one square bracket while taking output variable. Why?\n\nAll machine learning algorithm accepts input variables as a 2D array and output variable as 1D array. Using two square brackets while selecting the input variables gives you the shape of input variable\/s as 2D, but if you use only one square bracket, the shape will be 1D as you can see in the case of y.\n\nLet's check the shapes of X and y.","14a1ae0b":"## Understanding Data\nLet's check how our data looks.

It is used to predict a binary outcome (1 \/ 0, Yes \/ No, True \/ False) given a set of independent variable\/s. You can also think of logistic regression as a special case of linear regression when the outcome variable is categorical. Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm\/model.\n\n## Agenda\n*  About Dataset\n*  Loading Libraries\n*  Loading Data\n*  Understanding Data\n*  Separating Input\/Independent and Output\/Dependent Variables\n*  Splitting the data\n*  Building Model\n*  Prediction\n*  Model Performance\n\n## About Dataset\nThe dataset has two columns - age (age of the person\/customer) and bought_insurance (whether the customer bought insurance or not).
