Please do not use this notebook for cheating.","cc444e41":"Now, you can use this new `test.csv` to know your leaderboard score without submitting to Kaggle. To illustrate this, I've made an article in R about a complete end-to-end analysis of the titanic dataset, including EDA, feature engineering, and modeling which results in above 80% accuracy. You can read the article **[HERE](https:\/\/medium.com\/analytics-vidhya\/would-you-survive-the-titanic-7a418625787e)**.\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude0a","cd73259a":"Unsurprisingly, the titanic dataset is available in the wild outside of Kaggle. In this notebook, we will read the dataset from [data.world](https:\/\/data.world\/nrippner\/titanic-disaster-dataset), which is basically a combination of `train.csv` and `test.csv` from Kaggle with additional features, complete with the survival of all passengers.","4b50d9d7":"Let's check whether there are any missing values on `survived`.","c097d4df":"Lastly, save the result. As you can see, this new dataframe is identical to `test.csv` from Kaggle, except there is an additional `Survived` column.","0f4b37e2":"Next, we change the column name of `survived` to `Survived`. This is only an optional minor change so that the column names have the same format. We can also check that there are in total 418 `Survived` values, same as the number of observations in the original `test.csv`.","ad3e36dd":"There are 4 of them. We can impute these manually.","e16a6bf1":"Next, we select only revelant columns in `result` to match those in `test.csv` and an additional `survived` feature.
