This seems odd.","68fa42c2":"## No per-meter models\nThe different types of meters are pretty much completely unrelated to each other, so it makes sense to split them up and better take advantage of true commonalities between similar meters. At 4% improvement, it's not mind-bogglingly impressive, but it's still a no-brainer.","0320598c":"## Keep bad site 0 readings\nThose bad readings for a single site really do drag everything else down -- by a full 17%. Without pre-emptively throwing them away, we'll never achieve greatness.","fa7e2cbd":"## Summary\nAll of the code and the raw results are included below, and are well worth reading for additional insights and coding tricks.

We still evaluate our performance on such readings.\n* drop_missing_site_0: drops all electical meter readings for the first 141 days for site 0. These are known to be bogus, so we neither train *nor* evaluate on them\n* log_target: convert the target variable to a logarithmic scale, and convert the predictions back.\n* LGBM_cataware: declare to LGBM the columns which are known to be categorical\n* add_time_features: add basic day of week and hour of day features.\n* per_meter_models: train separate models for each distinct meter type\n\nBy switching *off* one of these strategies at a time, we can get an indication of how much worse we are without them, and thus how much they helped out the baseline \"all strategies on\" evaluation.","1a38e414":"## All strategies enabled\nThis is the baseline against which we evaluate each individual strategy. All subsequent experiments will *disable* a single strategy and report how much *worse* we perform compared to this evaluation.","5865dae5":"## Drop potentially bad data\nThere are two different optional strategies here that can be used together. `_drop_electrical_zeros` removes every electrical meter reading with a value of 0; while `_drop_missing_site_0` gets rid of all electrical meter readings for site zero during the 141 days that its readings were mostly pegged to 0.","04a34436":"## No time features\nIt's hard to imagine *not* using these basic time features -- hour of day and day of week. We all know that power usage will be lower during non-peak hours. However, the actual effect is fairly small. Oh well, c'est la vie.","8fb01e0c":"## Utilities\n`input_file` is a simple wrapper that hides the input directory location and automatically handles compressed files.\n\n`compress_dataframe` uses Pandas' built-in capabilities to downcast data into its smallest practical form.","9a7f6c18":"# The experiments","8aebfb2c":"## Data loading and preprocessing\nCode to read and combine the standard input files, converting timestamps to number of hours since the beginning of 2016.\n\nOptionally, we perform cleanups on the weather data: adjusting timestamps to the appropriate time zone; using interpolation to fill missing values; and adding NaN presence indicators.","a577becb":"## Keep electrical meter zero readings\nThis is a misleading result. In fact, the point of dropping all readings of 0 for electrical meters is to provide an alternate method of dealing with the bad zeros in the first part of the site 0 data. However, unlike with the \"drop bad site 0 readings\" strategy, we dropped these values from training but not evaluation. The fact that we do better by dropping them than by keeping them indicates that zero-readings for electricity really are misleading outliers and that dropping all of them is a valid alternative to specially handling the ones from site 0.","74996a24":"## Per-meter models\nThe `CatSplitRegressor` wrapper class hides the process of splitting the training and validation data up by unique values of a specified column (i.e. \"meter\"), using a different sub-model for each value, and then re-integrating the resulting predictions. ","ff146aae":"## No NA indicators\nGiven the interpolation that we did, there isn't likely to be much difference between an imputed value and the true value. Thus, flagging the imputed values doesn't really give the model much useful information. We can probably just drop the indicators to save a bit of memory.","dfc923f4":"## No adjusted weather timestamps\nThis is a surprising result. We know that the timestamps for the weather data aren't aligned with the timestamps for the meter readings, and can be off by up to 8 hours. However, it seems that we lose less than half a percent in performance if we simply ignore this appalling condition.","03944b38":"## Cross-validation\nWe use a time-oriented split which deals in 12 equal time slices (which are almost, but not quite, months). Each fold includes a two adjacent slices for validation, 8 adjacent slices for training, and a 1 slice buffer on each side of the validation set. We use modulo arithmetic to wrap-around the year-end boundary. We thus have slices 4-11 vs 1-2; 6-12&1 vs 3-4; 8-12&1-3 vs 5-6; etc.\n\nWhile the CV score is always better than the LB score, relative differences between strategies tend to align well between CV and LB.\n\nBecause the data set is large, we use the `sample frac` parameter to train and evaluate on a specified fraction of the dataset. Again, this seems to track the full set fairly well with values of 0.05 and higher.","7eee2246":"## LGBM category awareness\nThe LGBM uses some very effective strategies to produce better splits when it knows that a feature is categorical. Since we have a reasonable number of integer-valued features that are, in fact, unordered or cyclical categoricals, we benefit from explicitly declaring them to LGBM.\n\nUnfortunately, the scikit wrapper from LGBM doesn't handle these declarations gracefully, and prints a warning that we've overridden its default guesses. We include extra code here to silence those warnings.","a4342461":"## Disable all strategies\nThis is another baseline, showing what would happen if we just used the raw data and didn't try to improve anything. Not surprisingly, it does *really* badly.","577d9664":"## Add basic time features\nWe add columns for \"hour of day\" and \"day of week\". Note that the source \"timestamp\" columns will be removed before training, so these are the only time-oriented features that will remain.","a0fecec8":"## No log-scaled target\nGiven that we are evaluated on log-error, it's not surprising that we do better when operating in log-space. The naive linear-space approach is our biggest loser at 45% worse.","f2263e22":"# Strategy Evaluation\nThis competition provides an interesting grab-bag of sub-problems to solve: the data is messy and needs cleaned (site 0); the data sources are inconsistent (meter timestamps vs. weather timestamps); it asks you to predict several different vaguely related sets of values (meter type); it has hugely important categorical features (building_id); and we can find lots of external data to supplement the provided data. This makes it hard to know where to start and what areas are most important to tackle.\n\nLike everyone, I've tried a bunch of strategies and techniques designed to tackle all of the above issues as well the usual machine-learning pitfalls. However, as I built up layers of approaches, it became hard to keep track of which ones were actually useful and which ones simply didn't hurt. Since I'm an experimentalist at heart, I decided to build a framework which let me evaluate the actual effect of a bunch of different strategies. Since this is Kaggle, I decided to share the insights with the rest of the community."}}
