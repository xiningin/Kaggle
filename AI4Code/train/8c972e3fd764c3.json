The documents are used as input for the IR algorithm and preprocessing is applied to the document. Please write a code to pre-process the document for the IR algorithm. \n\nThe results should compare in both cases tokenization (with pre-processing) and tokenization without vectors (without pre-processing) on given input documents. the comparative analysis must include the following parameters:\n1. Total no of tokens  generated  in each input documents  in both scenario, as tokenization with pre-processing and without pre-processing\n2. Overall-Time Value in both scenario, as tokenization with\/out pre-processing"}}
