If we do not have enough or healthy data, we have to use this method.\n\nIt focuses on product similarity rather than finding similarity among customers. With this algorithm, we can easily recommend similar items to a customer who buys any item. It requires less resources and time compared to user-user collaborative filtering.","02c22f9e":"This filtering method usually tries to collect and analyze information about the user's behavior, activities or preferences and make recommendations to target users based on their similarity with other users. One of its most important advantages is that it does not need the product's content for analysis and therefore can accurately suggest complex elements without requiring the object to understand itself. Collaborative Filtering is based on the assumption that individuals who have had similar preferences in the past will make the same choices in the future.","4fe93278":"# 3. Collaborative Filtering "}}
