Is this confidence feigned or is it pure detective work?","73fee994":"<h2> What Columns Can We Manipulate? <\/h2>","412e57c4":"Note, there are other csv files in this dataset titled ```crewmate_voting.csv```, ```game_feed.csv```, and ```player_record.csv```. I only focus on what I believe to be the most illustrating csv in this dataset, ```player_analysis.csv```.","c8e5196f":"# Essential Imports\n\nThis is my general template of imports I like to use. There may be some imports that are not used.","c5582380":"His statistics are crazy - 75% crewmate win rate, **100% immpostor win rate**, on top of an absurd 88.2% voting accuracy and average of 2.8 kills per impostor round. No wonder he's at the top of the top. Of course, we do have to take into consideration that he only plays 17 total games in this dataset, but still, averaging those types of numbers over 17 games is crazy. \n\nLet's take a look at the data to see if players with less games have higher scores.","aeaec75d":"# Who is the Best Overall Player?","3c380c95":"# Conclusion","da9e227f":"Thank you for reading through this notebook! If you found it particularly interesting or helpful, I would really appreciate it if you would give the notebook an <span style=\"color: green\"> upvote <\/span> or a <span style=\"color: blue\"> comment<\/span>!","d90913e0":"# What Defines a Winner?\n\nDoes a player who plays more games, on average, win or lose more of their games?","47b40236":"# Who is the Best Crewmate?\n\nWe calculate this by first converting our original DataFrame into z-scores (normalized units) and then using the formula ```Crew Win Percentage + Crew Bodies Found Per Life + Crew Voting Accuracy Per Life```. Of course, this formula is not 100% robust, but it provides a solid introductory foundation for future work.","6365edba":"Indeed, the top 5 players in the dataset all have ```< 40``` total games played, which may not be enough data to absolutely conclude anything meaningful. However, what **is** for certain is that, in all of the games recorded in this dataset, ```5up``` is by far the highest overall performing player. So, that answers our question, and we are now done!","d2471a68":"# Who is the Best Among Us Player? \ud83d\udd0e\ud83d\udd0e\ud83d\udd0e\n\nAmong Us, arguably the most popular online multiplayer social deduction game ever, has been one of my favorite games from September until it's gradual downfall in 2021. As a token for my love of Among Us, I've decided to analyze some data related to the game! In this notebook, I utilize one of the csv files in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mrisdal\/among-us-gameplay\"> this Among Us dataset <\/a> to ultimately answer the question: **Who is the best Among Us player**?","e1da3bcf":"# What Players are in the Dataset?\n\nAmong Us is defined by its players, and thus, so is this dataset. See if you recognize anyone!","bb4134a8":"Honestly, the only people I know in this dataset are 5up, Bloody, and Skadj, Whyin, jorbs, and hafu. Let me know if you know more of them!","ac67fe10":"So, according to my algorithm, the best crewmates are, in order: Stranjak, Colossus, julie, ScaldingHotSoup, Issac, Stunlock, 5up, synthe, Trotske, and Chosaucer. Let's see if any of these players also make it to the top of the best impostors list!","c07bc194":"As we can see by these two different rankings of overall players, ```5up``` is clearly the top Among Us player in this data, with an absolutely insane Average Rank of 2.5 and by far having the largest Z-score sum. ```ScaldingHotSoup``` is also a fantastic Among Us player, with the 3rd highest Average Rank and the 2nd highest Z-score sum.\n\nPlayers which are bolded appear on both top 10 lists.\n\nTop 10 average players by average rank: **5up**, **flutter**, **ScaldingHotSoup**, **Keaton**, **Chosaucer**, **Mani**, **TomM**, Pheylop, BK, jorbs.\n\nTop 10 overall players by Z-score sum: **5up**, **ScaldingHotSoup**, FoxBox, **flutter**, Corey, **Chosaucer**, **TomM**, **Keaton**, Naribly, **Mani**.","882720e8":"According to this algorithm, the top 10 impostors are: Corey, 5up, FoxBox, Kibler, flutter, LSV, Zyla, wrapter, BK, and Keaton. Now let's put these two pieces together to answer our ultimate questions: **Who is the Best Among Us Player**?","0468f91d":"From this graph, it's pretty clear that there's not a correlation between win percentage and the total number of games played. What is obvious is that there are many players in the dataset with less than 10 total games, which is just not enough data to make perform any conclusive analyses. Thus, I remove all players with less than 10 total games in the dataset.","1ebeb0f4":"# What Makes 5up so Good?\n\nLet's take a look at the specific stats pink man ```5up``` has to try and determine why his ranking is so much higher than everyone else's.","98ded899":"There is only a slight positive correlation of voting aggression to voting accuracy, but it is nothing significant.","cd59ac50":"# Who is the Best Impostor?\n\nSimilar to the algorithm used above to calculate who the best crewmate is, we will normalize the data into Z-scores and then use the formula: ```2*Impostor Win Percentage + Impostor Kills Per Life - Voted Off As Impostor```.","955cd525":"# Bonus: Who is the Most Aggressively Voting Player?"}}
