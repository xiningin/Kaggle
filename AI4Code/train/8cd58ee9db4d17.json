The final embeddings turned out well even without this step, but it might make sense to do in the future. \n\nI'm not sure why the same link is represented as two different names (I extracted the title of the link to try and alleviate this issue), but it occurs many times, even for the same book!

Reducing the dimensions to 2 may distort the distances between similar books in the 50 dimensional space.","74ac0e2a":"## Note about Training \/ Testing Set\n\nTo compute the embeddings, we are not going to create a separate validation or testing set. While this is a __must__ for a normal supervised machine learning task, in this case, our primary objective is not to make the most accurate model, but to generate the best embeddings. The prediction task is just the method through which we train our network to make the embeddings. At the end of training, we are not going to be testing our model on new data, so we don't need to evaluate the performance. Instead of testing on new data, we'll look at the embeddings themselves to see if books that we think are similar have embeddings that are close to each other. \n\nIf we kept a separate validation \/ testing set, then we would be limiting the amount of data that our network can use to train. This would result in less accurate embeddings. Normally with any supervised model, we need to be concerned about overfitting, but again, because we do not need our model to generalize to new data and our goal is the embeddings, we will make our model as effective as possible by using all the data for training. In general, always have a separate validation and testing set (or use cross validation) and make sure to regularize your model to prevent overfitting. ","2c94906c":"The best clumpings are probably by genre although the countries also appear to be separated.

We can take a similar approach to extract these and find the most similar to a query page. \n\nLet's write a quick function to extract weights from a model given the name of the layer.","f7896b4e":"# Neural Network Embedding Model\n\nWith our dataset and a supervised machine learning task, we're almost there. The next step is the most technically complicated but thankfully fairly simple with Keras. We are going to construct the neural network that learns the entity embeddings. The input to this network is the (book, link) (either positive or negative) as integers, and the output will be a prediction of whether or not the link was present in the book article. However, we're not actually interested in the prediction except as the device used to train the network by comparison to the label. What we are after is at the heart of the network: the embedding layers, one for the book and one for the link each of which maps the input entity to a 50 dimensional vector. The layers of our network are as follows:\n\n1. Input: parallel inputs for the book and link\n2. Embedding: parallel embeddings for the book and link\n3. Dot: computes the dot product between the embeddings to merge them together\n4. Reshape: utility layer needed to correct the shape of the dot product\n5. [Optional] Dense: fully connected layer with sigmoid activation to generate output for classification\n\nAfter converting the inputs to an embedding, we need a way to combine the embeddings into a single number. For this we can use the dot product which does element-wise multiplication of numbers in the vectors and then sums the result to a single number. This raw number (after reshaping) is then the ouput of the model for the case of regression. In regression, our labels are either -1 or 1, and so the model loss function will be mean squared error in order to minimize the distance between the prediction and the output. Using the dot product with normalization means that the `Dot` layer is finding the cosine similarity between the embedding for the book and the link. Using this method for combining the embeddings means we are trying to make the network learn similar embeddings for books that link to similar pages. \n\n### Classification vs Regression\n\nFor classification, we add an extra fully connected `Dense` layer with a `sigmoid` activation to squash the outputs between 0 and 1 because the labels are either 0 or 1. The loss function for classification is `binary_crossentropy` which measures the [error of the neural network predictions in a binary classification problem](https:\/\/ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/loss_functions.html), and is a measure of the similarity between two distributions. We can train with either classification or regression, and in practice, I found that both approaches produced similar embeddings. I'm not sure about the technical merits of these methods, and I'd be interested to hear if one is better than the other. \n\nThe optimizer - the algorithm used to update the parameters (also called weights) of the neural network after calculating the gradients through backpropagation - is Adam in both cases ([Adam is a modification to Stochastic Gradient Descent](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning\/)). We use the default parameters for this optimizer. The nice thing about modern neural network frameworks is we don't have to worry about backpropagation or updating the model parameters because that is done for us. It's nice to have an idea of what is occuring behind the scenes, but it's not entirely necessary to use a neural network effectively.

","b10ab497":"# Conclusions\n\nIn this notebook, we built an effective book recommendation system using the principle that books with similar outgoing links are similar and all of the book articles on Wikipedia. We embedded both the wikilinks and the books using a neural networ. To train the neural network, we developed a supervised machine learning problem of classifying if a given link was present on the page for a book.\n\nMore than just training the neural network, we saw how to thoroughly inspect the embeddings in order to find the closest books to a given book in embedding space. We also saw how to visualize the embeddings which sometimes can show us interesting clusterings. In the process, we took the original 37,000 dimensions of the books and reduced it first to 50 using the neural network and then to 2 using a manifold learning method. The neural network embedding was useful for making recommendations based on closest entities while the TSNE embedding is useful primarily for visualization.\n\nWe covered a number of topics that may be useful in a data science position:\n\n1. How to clean data for a machine learning project\n2. How to set up a supervised learning task from a raw dataset\n3. How to train a neural network to learn entity embeddings\n4. How to inspect entity embeddings to find closest entities to a query\n5. How to reduce the dimension of a dataset for visualization\n6. How to format a plot to try and make sense of the data (we'll work a little more on this)\n\nThe next step that I'll work on is to visualize these embeddings in an interactive tool. Interactivity adds another element of insightto data analysis and I enjoy the exploratory nature of plots that let you move through the data. \n\n## Potential Other Projects\n\nThere are several ways you can take this and build on it:\n\n1. Train the embeddings using not the internal links, but the external links\n2. Train the embeddings using the infobox information. This would require framing a different machine learning problem\n3.

We are going to treat this as a supervised learning problem: given a pair (book, link), we want the neural network to learn to predict whether this is a legitimate pair - present in the data - or not.\n\nTo create a training set, for each book, we'll iterate through the wikilinks on the book page and record the book title and each link as a tuple.

In order to create this representation of similar books, we'll use the concept of neural network entity embeddings, mapping each book and each Wikipedia link (Wikilink) to a 50-number vector. \n\nThe idea of entity embeddings is to map high-dimensional categorical variables to a low-dimensional _learned_ representation that _places similar entities closer together in the embedding space_. If we were to one-hot-encode the books (another representation of categorical data) we would have a 37,000 dimension vector for each book, with a single 1 indicating the book. In a one-hot encoding, similar books would not be \"closer\" to one another. By  training a neural network to learn entity embeddings, we not only get a reduced dimension representation of the books, we also get a representation that _keeps similar books closer to each other_. Therefore, the basic approach for a recommendation system is to create entity embeddings of all the books, and then for any book, find the closest other books in the embedding space. [Fortunately, thanks to a previous notebook](https:\/\/github.com\/WillKoehrsen\/wikipedia-data-science\/blob\/master\/Downloading%20and%20Parsing%20Wikipedia%20Articles.ipynb), we have access to every single book article on Wikipedia, which will let us create an effective recommendation system.\n\n## Approach\n\nTo create entity embeddings, we need to build an embedding neural network and train it on a supervised machine learning task that will result in similar books (and similar links) having closer representations in embedding space. The parameters of the neural network - the weights - are the embeddings, and so during training, these numbers are adjusted to minimize the loss on the prediction problem. In other words, the network tries to accurately complete the task by changing the representations of the books and the links. \n\nOnce we have the embeddings for the books and the links, we can find the most similar book to a given book by computing the distance between the embedded vector for that book and all the other book embeddings. We'll use the cosine distance which measures the angle between two vectors as a measure of similarity (another valid option is the Euclidean distance). We can also do the same with the links, finding the most similar page to a given page. (I use links and wikilinks interchangeably in this notebook). The steps we will follow are:\n\n1. Load in data and clean\n2. Prepare data for supervised machine learning task\n3. Build the entity embedding neural network\n4. Train the neural network on prediction task\n5. Extract embeddings and find most similar books and wikilinks\n6. Visualize the embeddings using dimension reduction techniques \n\n### Supervised Machine Learning Task: Map Books to Links\n\nFor our machine learning task, we'll set up the problem as identifying whether or not a particular link was present in a book article. The training examples will consist of (book, link) pairs, with some pairs true examples - actually  in the data - and others negative examples - do not occur in the data. It will be the network's job to adjust the entity embeddings of the books and the links in order to accurately make this classification. Although we are training for a supervised machine learning task, our end objective is not to make accurate predictions on new data, but learn the best entitiy embeddings, so we do not use a validation or testing set. We use the prediction problem as a means to an end rather than the final outcome. \n\n## Neural Network Embeddings\n\nNeural Network embeddings have proven to be very powerful concepts both for modeling language and for representing categorical variables. For example, the [Word2Vec word embeddings](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/representation\/word2vec) map a word to a vector based on training a neural network on millions of words. These embeddings can be used in any supervised model because they are just numerical representations of categorical variables. Much as we one-hot-encode categorical variables to use them in a random forest for a supervised task, we can also use entity embeddings to include categorical variables in a model. The embeddings are also useful because we can find entities that are close to one another in embedding space which might - as in a book recommendation system - allow us to find the most similar categories among tens of thousands of choices. \n\nWe can also use the Entity Embeddings to visualize words or categorical variables, such as creating a map of all books on Wikipedia. The entity embeddings typically are still high-dimensional - we'll use 50 numbers for each entity - so we need to use a dimension reduction technique such as TSNE or UMAP to visualize the embeddings in lower dimensions. (These are both manifold embedding methods so in effect we will embed the embeddings for visualization!) We'll take a look at doing this at the end of the notebook and later will upload the embeddings into a application custom-built for this purpose ([projector.tensorflow.org](https:\/\/projector.tensorflow.org)). Entity embeddings are becoming more widespread thanks to the ease of development of neural networks in Keras and are a useful approach when we want to represent categorical variables with vectors that place similar categories close to one another. Other approaches for encoding categorical variables do not represent similar entities as being closer to one another, and entity embedding is a _learning-based method_ for this important task.\n\nOverall, this project is a great look at the potential for neural networks to create meaningful embeddings of high dimensional data and a practical application of deep learning. The code itself is relatively simple, and the Keras library makes developing deep learning models enjoyable!\n\nThe code here is adapted from the excellent [Deep Learning Cookbook](http:\/\/shop.oreilly.com\/product\/0636920097471.do), the [notebooks for which can be found on GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/DOsinga\/deep_learning_cookbook).

When we feed books into the embedding neural network, we will have to represent them as numbers, and this mapping will let us keep track of the books.

Now that we have the embeddings, we can use them to recommend books that our model has learned are most similar to a given book.\n\n\n### Function to Find Most Similar Entities\n\nThe function below takes in either a book or a link, a set of embeddings, and returns the `n` most similar items to the query. It does this by computing the dot product between the query and embeddings. Because we normalized the embeddings, the dot product represents the [cosine similarity](http:\/\/blog.christianperone.com\/2013\/09\/machine-learning-cosine-similarity-for-vector-space-models-part-iii\/) between two vectors. This is a measure of similarity that does not depend on the magnitude of the vector in contrast to the Euclidean distance. (The Euclidean distance would be another valid metric of similary to use to compare the embeddings.)\n\nOnce we have the dot products, we can sort the results to find the closest entities in the embedding space.

The resulting embeddings can then be used as a representation of books and links. \n\nThere are a few parameters to adjust for training. The batch size should generally be as large as possible given the memory constraints of your machine. The negative ratio can be adjusted based on results. I tried 2 and it seemed to work well.

The positive samples are simple: pick a pair from `pairs` and assign it a 1. The negative samples are also fairly easy: pick one random link and one random book, make sure they are not in `pairs`, and assign them a -1 or a 0. (We'll use either a -1 or 0 for the negative labels depending on whether we want to make this a regression or a classification problem. Either approach is valid, and we'll try out both methods.)\n\nThe code below creates a generator that yields batches of samples each time it is called. Neural networks are trained incrementally - a batch at a time - which means that a generator is a useful function for returning examples on which to train.

","cc185d23":"# Visualizations\n\nOne of the most interesting parts about embeddings is that we can use them to visualize concepts such as _War and Peace_ or _biography_. First we have to take the embeddings from 50 dimensions down to either 3 or 2. We can do this using `pca`, `tsne`, or `umap`. We'll try both tsne and umap for comparison. TSNE takes much longer and is designed to retain local structure within the data. UMAP is generally quicker and is designed for a balance between local and global structure in the embedding.\n\n## Manifold Embeddings\n\n[TSNE: t-Stochastic Distributed Neighbors Embedding](https:\/\/lvdmaaten.github.io\/tsne\/), and [UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection](https:\/\/github.com\/lmcinnes\/umap), are both methods that use the idea of a manifold to map vecotrs to a lower dimensional embedded space. Therefore, we are taking the 37,000 dimensions in the case of books, embedding them to 50 dimensions with the neural network, and then embedding them down to 2 dimensions with a manifold. The primary idea behind dimension reduction with a manifold is that there is a lower dimensional representation of the vectors that can still capture the variation between different groups. We want the embeddings to represent similar entities close to one another but in fewer dimensions that allow us to visualize the entities. ","b4cfcff1":"Based on my knowledge, it appears the neural network embeddings are also a good representation of the pages!

Knowing whether a book is hardcover or paperback is not that important to the content.
