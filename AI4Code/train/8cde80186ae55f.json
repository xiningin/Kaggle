Let us look at how many values are missing.","ee532502":"A lot of titles were released in the years 2016-2020. 2021 has very less amount of titles released and I think the reason is because the dataset was created in early 2021 so an update on the dataset could give us more insights.","27723afe":"Let's first see the distribution of content between movies and TV shows.","fda8c341":"Let us now look at the amount of titles by the year they were released.","50521cfa":"Next I would like to see if there is any relation between the rating and genre of the titles on Netflix.","b7fb7ae9":"The TV show that has the most seasons in Grey's Anatomy with 16 Seasons.","368a0b3d":"I'm beginning my Data Science journey on Kaggle and this is my first project on this platform.

United States is the leader of production of both movies and TV shows by a huge margin compared to other countries\n2. India produces a lot more movies compared TV shows.\n3. Japan,South Korea, Taiwan and Australia produces more TV shows than movies\n\nNote: 507 values for country are missing in the dataset. All the analysis has been done without any imputation. Though I still believe that even if the missing values United States will be the leader in terms of titles produced, still by a huge margin considering the global market for shows and movies coming out of the United States and the Hollywood industry, I personally think this may affect the distribution of titles between India and United Kingdom.","bb586b2d":"There are no duplicate values in the dataset.","024b3852":"For TV shows, we can see that TV-MA and TV-14 rated shows are very similar in the genres they are listed in and also that TV-Y7 and TV-Y are mostly listed in Kids TV as they are meant for kids.","cc6f41ee":"From here on I want to focus on the type of content on Netflix.
