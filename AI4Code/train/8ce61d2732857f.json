You can include documentation below the function definition statement as a multi-line string. Documentation typically includes a short description of what the function does, a summary of the arguments and a description of the value the function returns:","e2a09eba":"In the function above, the keyword \"lambda\" is similar to \"def\" in that it signals the definition of a new lambda function.

Set a default value with the argument_name = argument_value syntax:","2208e6b8":"Although you can assign a name to lambda function, their main purpose is for use in situations where you need to create an unnamed function on the fly, such as when using functions that take other functions as input. For example, consider the Python built in function map(). map() takes a function and an iterable like a list as arguments and applies the function to each item in the iterable. Instead of defining a function and then passing that function to map(), we can define a lambda function right in the call to map():","967c8d6d":"A function can be set up to accept any number of named or unnamed arguments.
