What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n#### I will produce a report with the following deliverables:\n1. A clear summary of the business task\n2. A description of all data sources uses\n3.Documentation of of any cleaning or manipulaition of data.\n4. A summary of my analysis\n5. Supporting visualizations and key findings\n6.My top high-level content recommendations based on my analysis\n","23b75a8f":"# Introduction and background\n\n#### This analysis is intended to serve as my capstone for the Google Data Analytics specialization. \n* The company in focus is called Bellabeat, a smart device manufacturer. The stakeholders request insight into how their products are being utilized and would like to see how trends in the data can help inform their marketing strategy. The data set is from a similar product line called Fitbit. The Google Data Analytics course provided some starter code and a general framework to aide in this project. \n* Analysis will follow Google Data Analytic framework and will have excessive notes to illustrate workflow and provide a good foundation for myself in future projects. ","a91848be":"**Observations:**\nThere are 15 columns.  Distance is not given a label of miles or kilometers. There is not a specification for differences in \"Very active distance, moderatley active distance, light active distance and sedentary distance.\" The same can be said about \"Very active minutes, fairly active minutes, lightly active minutes and sedentary minutes.\" When cleaning, I will address further. ","4522fe7c":"The data set was accessed from https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arashnic\/fitbit as instructed by the course. Their descritpion of the data is as follows: \"These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors \/ preferences.\"\n\nData was downloaded from the above dataset to my personal computer. The data has wide, long and merged formats. \n\n\n\n**ROCCC**:\nThe data can be considered \"Reliable\" because the Google Data Analytics coursework directed me here for educational purposes. Upon reviewing the comments in Kaggle, I have noticed some issues with the cleanliness of the data and some labeling issues, which will be addressed in detail while cleaning. \n\nThe data appears to be \"Original\" from FitBit users and can be further sourced from https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/53894#.X9oeh3Uzaao\n\nIt is considered mostly \"Comprehensive\" as it has all the information needed to answer our questions, however, some further research will be needed to clean odd lablels and confirm measurements while cleaning, such as kg to pounds, etc. \n\nThe data being \"Current\" is subjective as data was collected in 2016.  While not incredibly old, the data could be considered outdated, but will still hold general truths about health. \n\nThe data is \"Cited\" and is considered public domain. \n\n"}}
