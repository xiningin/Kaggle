If you're unsure how to do this or would like to work with your own data, please revisit the instructions in the previous tutorial.\n\nOnce you have selected a dataset, click on the **[+ Add Data]** option in the top right corner.  This will generate a pop-up window that you can use to search for your chosen dataset.  \n\n![ex6_search_dataset](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cIIWPUS.png)\n\nOnce you have found the dataset, click on the **[Add]** button to attach it to the notebook.  You can check that it was successful by looking at the **Data** dropdown menu to the right of the notebook -- look for an **input** folder containing a subfolder that matches the name of the dataset.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nMYc1Nu.png\" width=30%><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nYou can click on the carat to the left of the name of the dataset to double-check that it contains a CSV file.  For instance, the image below shows that the example dataset contains two CSV files: (1) **dc-wikia-data.csv**, and (2) **marvel-wikia-data.csv**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/B4sJkVA.png\" width=30%><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nOnce you've uploaded a dataset with a CSV file, run the code cell below **without changes** to receive credit for your work!","c0306221":"**This notebook is an exercise in the [Data Visualization](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/data-visualization) course.

To do this, begin by clicking on the CSV file you'd like to use.  This will open the CSV file in a tab below the notebook.  You can find the filepath towards the top of this new tab.  \n\n![ex6_filepath](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fgXQV47.png)\n\nAfter you find the filepath corresponding to your dataset, fill it in as the value for `my_filepath` in the code cell below, and run the code cell to check that you've provided a valid filepath.  For instance, in the case of this example dataset, we would set\n```\nmy_filepath = \"..\/input\/fivethirtyeight-comic-characters-dataset\/dc-wikia-data.csv\"\n```  \nNote that **you must enclose the filepath in quotation marks**; otherwise, the code will return an error.\n\nOnce you've entered the filepath, you can close the tab below the notebook by clicking on the **[X]** at the top of the tab.","a6612b5c":"Now it's time for you to demonstrate your new skills with a project of your own!\n\nIn this exercise, you will work with a dataset of your choosing.
