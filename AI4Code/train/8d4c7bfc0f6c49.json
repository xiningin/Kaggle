So we are viewing the important errors done by our model for perspection.","4bcbf698":"### Train and Validation Data Split\nWe are segmenting the input data for training into two exclusive data namely, Train and Validation data sets. Train data is used to train the model whereas the validation data is used for cross verification of the model's accuracy and how well the model is generalized for the data other than training data. Validation accuracy and loss will tell us the performance of the model for new data and it will show if there is overfitting or underfitting situation while model training. \n","24b00d0c":"### Optimizers and Annealers\n* Optimizer is the crucial part in a neural network. Optimizer ensure the model reaches the optimium faster. RMSProp optimizer makes the model converge more effectively and faster. It also stricts the model to coverge at global minimum therefore the accuracy of the model will be higher.  \n* Setting the learning rate is very important in a Deep Learning algorithm. Though choosing a good learning rate may yield its goodness, scheduling a reduction in learning rate while training has a great advantage in convergence at global minimum. ReduceLRonPlateau makes the Learning Rate to reduce at a rate by monitoring the learning rate and epoch. It will greatly help the model to achieve maximum accuracy.","740db97a":"Deep Convolutional Neural Network is a network of artificial neural networks. A model archiecture is the design of the neural networks with which we train the parameters in training process. Here we used LeNet-5 Architecture, it was proposed by Yann LeCun in 1998.

The pixel value ranges from 0 to 255 which specify gradient of gray. The CNN will converge more faster on values 0 to 1 than 0 to 255. So we divide every value by 255 to scale the data from [0..255] to [0..1].
