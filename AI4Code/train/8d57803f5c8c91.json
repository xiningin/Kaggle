It is a field of artificial intelligence and its importance is increasing day by day. \n\n* In this project, a classification model will be made using the Pima Indians Diabetes data set. Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders in which long-term high blood sugar levels are seen. High blood sugar symptoms include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications may include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcer, and eye damage. \n\n* This dataset was originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The purpose of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on the specific diagnostic measures included in the data set. Various restrictions have been imposed on the selection of these samples from a larger database. \n\n* In particular, all the patients here are women who are at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The data set consists of 768 observation units and 9 variables. These variables are; pregnancy, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, body mass index, diabetes pedigree, age and outcome. After the exploratory data analysis on the data set is completed, the machine learning model will be set up. For this, supervised learning algorithms will be used.
