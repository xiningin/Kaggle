Each of them can be considered as a dimension in the space of data points. Consequently, more often than not, we deal with high-dimensional datasets, where entire visualization is quite hard.\n\nTo look at a dataset as a whole, we need to decrease the number of dimensions used in visualization without losing much information about data. This task is called dimensionality reduction and is an example of an unsupervised learning problem because we need to derive new, low-dimensional features from the data itself, without any supervised input.\n\nOne of the well-known dimensionality reduction methods is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Its limitation is that it is a linear algorithm that implies certain restrictions on the data.\n\nThere are also many non-linear methods, collectively called Manifold Learning. One of the best-known of them is t-SNE","e531fe41":"As we saw earlier in this article, the variable Customer service calls has few unique values and, thus, can be considered either numerical or ordinal.

Histograms are best suited for looking at the distribution of numerical variables while bar plots are used for categorical features.\n2. The values on the X-axis in the histogram are numerical; a bar plot can have any type of values on the X-axis: numbers, strings, booleans\n3. The histogram's X-axis is a Cartesian coordinate axis along which values cannot be changed; the ordering of the bars is not predefined. Still, it is useful to note that the bars are often sorted by height, that is, the frequency of the values. Also, we we consider ordinal varibles ( like cusotmer service calls in our data), the bars are usually ordered by variable value.\n\nThe left chart above vividly illustrates the imbalance in our target variable. The bar plot for Customer service calls on the right gives a hint that the majority of customers resolve their problems in maximum 2\u20133 calls. But, as we want to be able to predict the minority class, we may be more interested in how the fewer dissatisfied customers behave. It may well be that the tail of that bar plot contains most of our churn. These are just hypotheses for now, so let's move on to some more interesting and powerful visual techniques","7977dc6d":"A histogram groups values into bins of equal value range.

The vertical line inside the box marks the median (50%) of the distribution.\n\nThe whiskers are the lines extending from the box. They represent the entire scatter of data points, specifically the points that fall within the interval (Q1\u22121.5\u22c5IQR,Q3+1.5\u22c5IQR), where IQR=Q3\u2212Q1 is the interquartile range.\n\nOutliers that fall out of the range bounded by the whiskers are plotted individually as black points along the central axis.\n\nWe can see that a large number of international calls is quite rare in our data.","0bf4d452":"Let\u2019s color this t-SNE representation according to the churn (blue for loyal customers, and orange for those who churned).","c1aa1437":"### 4.3 t-SNE ","66efe352":"### 3.2 Quantitative - Categorical","10401f00":"Let us build t-SNE representation:","45eb7aaa":"It seems that our small proportion of disloyal customers lean towards the top-right corner; that is, such customers tend to spend more time on the phone during both day and night.

Perhaps they are unhappy with the tariffs, so a possible measure to prevent churn could be a reduction in call rates. The company will need to undertake additional economic analysis to find out whether such measures would be beneficial.\n\nWhen we want to analyze a quantitative variable in two categorical dimensions at once, there is a suitable function for this in the seaborn library called catplot(). For example, let's visualize the interaction between total day minutes and two categorical variables in the same plot:","0e561008":"From the above plots, we can notice that, starting with 4 calls, total day minutes may no longer be the main factor for customer churn.
