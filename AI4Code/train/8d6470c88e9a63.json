There is no simple way known (yet!) to find the best values of the dropout parameters below - you just have to experiment...\n\nHowever, the other parameters (`alpha`, `beta`, and `clip`) shouldn't generally need tuning.","9497ba22":"### Data","0fe025fd":"fastai can create a ModelData object directly from torchtext splits.","9811bf47":"The [large movie view dataset](http:\/\/ai.stanford.edu\/~amaas\/data\/sentiment\/) contains a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB. The dataset contains an even number of positive and negative reviews. The authors considered only highly polarized reviews. A negative review has a score \u2264 4 out of 10, and a positive review has a score \u2265 7 out of 10. Neutral reviews are not included in the dataset. The dataset is divided into training and test sets. The training set is the same 25,000 labeled reviews.\n\nThe **sentiment classification task** consists of predicting the polarity (positive or negative) of a given text.\n\nHowever, before we try to classify *sentiment*, we will simply try to create a *language model*; that is, a model that can predict the next word in a sentence. Why? Because our model first needs to understand the structure of English, before we can expect it to recognize positive vs negative sentiment.\n\nSo our plan of attack is the same as we used for Dogs v Cats: pretrain a model to do one thing (predict the next word), and fine tune it to do something else (classify sentiment).\n\nUnfortunately, there are no good pretrained language models available to download, so we need to create our own. To follow along with this notebook, we suggest downloading the dataset from [this location](http:\/\/files.fast.ai\/data\/aclImdb.tgz) on files.fast.ai.","483905aa":"Language modeling accuracy is generally measured using the metric *perplexity*, which is simply `exp()` of the loss function we used.","abebf8fc":"### Train","fe3af0d3":"Researchers have found that large amounts of *momentum* (which we'll learn about later) don't work well with these kinds of *RNN* models, so we create a version of the *Adam* optimizer with less momentum than it's default of `0.9`.","b28f93a3":"Before we can analyze text, we must first *tokenize* it.

In this case, we don't have a separate test set, so we'll just use `VAL_PATH` for that too.\n\nAs well as the usual `bs` (batch size) parameter, we also now have `bptt`; this define how many words are processing at a time in each row of the mini-batch. More importantly, it defines how many 'layers' we will backprop through. Making this number higher will increase time and memory requirements, but will improve the model's ability to handle long sentences.","ad2c6562":"Sounds like I'd really enjoy **Back To The Future**...\n\nNow we'll check how many words are in the dataset.","5a2e0c1e":"## Language modeling","c70aa7ea":"As you can see below, I gradually tuned the language model in a few stages.
