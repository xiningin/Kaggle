On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. That's why the name DieTanic. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget.\n\nIt took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.\n\nThe Objective of this notebook is to give an idea how is the workflow in any predictive modeling problem. How do we check features, how do we add new features and some Machine Learning Concepts. I have tried to keep the notebook as basic as possible so that even newbies can understand every phase of it.\n\nIf You Like the notebook and think that it helped you **PLEASE UPVOTE**. It will keep me motivated.","73180dff":"### Load the DataSet","46fc2d59":"## Random Forest Classifier ","165bba7d":"By looking at all the matrices, we can say that Random Forest & SVM  classifier has a higher chance in correctly predicting dead passengers.","026162f3":"those are  work for buliding ML model which gives best result  i have done please vote for me which help my movitvation to increase to do a lot of work if there any imporvment can be done means please say in comments References This notebook has been created based on great work done solving the Titanic competition and other sources.","b284b426":"## Linear Discriminant Analysis","ebc20244":"## AdaBoost","26fffdfb":"### Both the test and train Age features contains more the 15% of missing Data so we are fill with the median","12d70354":"### Identifying Missing Value ","fd31fc06":"## KNN Classifier","f2bd353e":"## Gaussian Naive Bayes","3fa19649":"## LogisticRegression","be8db584":"### Correlation Between The Features","b4cf90d1":"Interpreting The Heatmap\nThe first thing to note is that only the numeric features are compared as it is obvious that we cannot correlate between alphabets or strings. Before understanding the plot, let us see what exactly correlation is.\n\nPOSITIVE CORRELATION: If an increase in feature A leads to increase in feature B, then they are positively correlated. A value 1 means perfect positive correlation.\n\nNEGATIVE CORRELATION: If an increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated. A value -1 means perfect negative correlation.\n\nNow lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as MultiColinearity as both of them contains almost the same information.\n\nSo do you think we should use both of them as one of them is redundant. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n\nNow from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated. The highest correlation is between SibSp and Parch i.e 0.41. So we can carry on with all features.","a02a2230":"### now every thing almost ready only one step we converted the catergical features in numerical by using dummy variable","5e3bc821":"### Cabin Featueres has more than 75% of missing data in both Test and train data so we are remove the Cabin ","2d619536":"## Hyper-Parameters Tuning\n\nThe machine learning models are like a Black-Box. There are some default parameter values for this Black-Box, which we can tune or change the learning rate of the algorithm and get a better model.

If set to -1, all cores are used.\n\nn_estimators : Number of classification trees in your learning model ( set to 10 per default)\n\nmax_depth : Maximum depth of tree, or how much a node should be expanded. Beware if set to too high a number would run the risk of overfitting as one would be growing the tree too deep\n\nverbose : Controls whether you want to output any text during the learning process. A value of 0 suppresses all text while a value of 3 outputs the tree learning process at every iteration.\n\nPlease check out the full description via the official Sklearn website. There you will find that there are a whole host of other useful parameters that you can play around with.","c498c2b2":"### Pairplots\nFinally let us generate some pairplots to observe the distribution of data from one feature to the other.

There are lot of predictive modelling algorithms to choose from. We must understand the type of problem and solution requirement to narrow down to a select few models which we can evaluate. Our problem is a classification and regression problem. We want to identify relationship between output (Survived or not) with other variables or features (Gender, Age, Port...). We are also perfoming a category of machine learning which is called supervised learning as we are training our model with a given dataset. With these two criteria - Supervised Learning plus Classification and Regression, we can narrow down our choice of models to a few. These include:\n\nLogistic Regression\n\nKNN\n\nSupport Vector Machines\n\nNaive Bayes classifier\n\nDecision Tree\n\nRandom Forrest\n\nLinear Discriminant Analysis\n\nAda Boost Classifier \n\nGradient Boosting Classifier\n\nAnd also compared above given classifiers and evaluate the mean accuracy of each of them by a stratified kfold cross validation procedure and plot accuracy based confusion matrix","0bcbc0e6":"### Filling missing Values","e290a569":"The data has been split into two groups:\n\ntraining set (train.csv)\ntest set (test.csv)\nThe training set should be used to build your machine learning models.

You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n\n### Data Dictionary\nVariable\tDefinition\tKey\n\nsurvival\tSurvival\t0 = No, 1 = Yes\n\npclass\tTicket class\t1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd\n\nsex\tMale or Female\n\nAge\tAge in years\t\n\nsibsp\t# of siblings \/ spouses aboard the Titanic\t\n\nparch\t# of parents \/ children aboard the Titanic\t\n\nticket\tTicket number\t\n\nfare\tPassenger fare\t\n\ncabin\tCabin number\t\n\nembarked\tPort of Embarkation\tC = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton\n\nVariable Notes\npclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n1st = Upper\n2nd = Middle\n3rd = Lower\n\nage: Age is fractional if less than 1.
