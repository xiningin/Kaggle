Some psychologists prefer to call neuroticism by the term emotional stability to differentiate it from the term neurotic in a career test","75b666ae":"### Agreeableness\n\nA person with a high level of agreeableness in a personality test is usually warm, friendly, and tactful. They generally have an optimistic view of human nature and get along well with others. \n\nA person who scores low on agreeableness may put their own interests above those of others.
