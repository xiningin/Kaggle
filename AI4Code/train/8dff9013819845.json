All these systems consist of nodes, some of which are connected by edges. In mathematics, this is called a fork.\nA graph is a collection of vertices connected by edges\u00b9, and Graph theory studies graphs and their properties. \u00b2\n\nWe can sketch the layout of simple graphs using circles and lines. The position of the circles and the length of the lines are irrelevant \u2014 we care about how they are connected. The lines can even intersect and don't have to be straight.\nIn some graphs, edges follow only one direction. These are called directed graphs. Every edge has an \"arrow,\" a start vertex in a directed graph, and an end vertex.\nSome graphs consist of several distinct segments that are not connected by edges, while other graphs may have numerous edges between the same vertices or vertices connected to themselves (loops).\n\n## What is the Graph Theory?\nGraph Theory, a branch of mathematics and computing, serves as the basis for Network Science, so it is essential to understand a little of this theory to know the main terms used in this area, such as nodes, links, paths, distance, etc.\n\nIf you are currently studying or have studied for a bachelor's degree in the area of \u200b\u200binformatics\/computing, you have undoubtedly already had a formal introduction to the subject, and these concepts below will be familiar to you. However, if you've never heard of it, I hope this introduction helps you. You only need to know discrete mathematical structures like sets and tuples to understand them.\n\nDo you think that talking about networks using mathematics is unnecessary rigor? If so, consider mathematics as a language, similar to Portuguese or English, but with a particular property: it is free from ambiguity. In other words, the language of mathematics allows us to communicate ideas clearly (and concisely) as long as we know its vocabulary.\n\nIn the context of Network Science, a network will be like a graph, with nodes and edges interconnecting them, but with the difference that the network is dynamic, that is, the network changes over time, adding and removing nodes. And edges. In this way, graphs become like a quick view of a network at a given instant in time.\n\nGraph formalism is used to model complex networks in different contexts such as social sciences, physics, mathematics, etc. What makes them so versatile is the generality for representation between objects and their relationships. Therefore, graph theory gives us the necessary tools for modeling complex networks.\n\n## What is a Graph?\nIn general, a graph is more than a picture with an x- and y-axis in computer science circles for those unfamiliar with graphs.\n\nIt is a mathematical artifact used to represent networks, collections of objects linked somehow. Graph analysis is, at its core, a study of relationships.\n\nThis is significant because the value in data comes from discovering and comprehending the relationship between the various data points. In our industry, Facebook is the most frequently cited example when explaining the value of graphs, and while we intuitively understand this value (I can see whom my kids are hanging out with), let's break this value down in more detail.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of graphs is that they can be displayed visually.\n\nA graph can be represented simply as a group of dots connected by lines. The dots can designate anything from people to pets, proteins, molecules, planets, data, strings, or others, and lines between the dots indicate how they are related.\n\nGraphs are optimal structures to represent a set of items and their relationship. For example, a graph G(V, E) is composed of vertices (also known as nodes) that connect via edges (also known as links or pairs of nodes).\n\nGraphs are not a new component of data science, yet it is not the usual \"applying\" data scientists apply today.\n\nHowever, there are some crazy things that graphics can do.\n\nThe most common use cases range from fraud detection to recommendations or social media analytics. A non-classical use case in NLP deals with extracting topics (word graphs).\n\n## The Business Value of Graph Networks\nGraph data can be made human-friendly, but it can also be made machine-friendly in its raw form.\nMachines can process data much faster than traditional relational databases when data and relationships are modeled and stored in graph databases.\n\nThis enables organizations to rapidly analyze large amounts of transactional data to detect patterns in real-time.\n\nOrganizations, for example, can analyze patterns in data in real-time to find fraudulent accounts that can invalidate their marketing strategy.\n\nQueries that track these types of fraud can run in real-time and provide users with a visual representation of the results that shows the data relationships.\n\nGraphs are convenient to represent relationships between objects. Therefore, we can gain valuable insights by visually displaying these graphs and crunching the data in real-time.\n\nGraph theory is becoming popular in business to simplify and interpret complex data. As our data volumes increase, graphs enable the visualization of that data and its patterns, allowing businesses to make more informed decisions.\n\n## Applications of Graph Theory in Business \nGraph theory is frequently overlooked when defining business intelligence systems, primarily because data analysts do not think their data is networked or similar to a social network.\n\nIn reality, any data with relationships can build a graph or networked graph model. Here are some examples of business:\n\nAll flights to and from airports can be organized and optimized as a graph. Airports are the nodes in this case, and flights are the edges between them. These graphs can be used to optimize plane efficiency, reduce fuel costs, and shorten flight operations time. The Graph could be expanded to include optimizing pilots and flight crews, scheduling optimal maintenance crew availability, and optimizing gate use.\u2075\n\nFor both local and national analysis, all of the products carried by a retailer can be graphed based on which products are purchased together and by which buyer profiles. The graphs aid retail customer analysis by determining trends such as what products are frequently purchased together and by what type of customer. The outcomes provide critical information. When constrained optimization is used, the results provide the best possible options for maximizing product sales at the set margin to the most likely to purchase customers.\u2075\n\nUsing graph theory, all patients with a specific physical condition can be analyzed to determine which other physical conditions co-exist for medical analysis. Graph theory is a component of community detection computations used in drug discovery and Covid transmission analysis.\u2075\n\nThese graphs can become highly complex. As a result, the graph data must be submitted to powerful computers for the analytics calculations required to identify meaningful relationships and the impacts of those relationships to be performed.\u2075\n\nGraph theory is emerging as a high-potential tool for boosting business intelligence through robust computational analysis.\n\nTo date, the challenge has been that graph analysis has become so complex that it is difficult to submit and solve models.\u2075\n\n## Graph Analytics Use-Cases\nGraph analytics use cases for telecom, journalism, social networks, finance, and operations. The website Xenonstack \u2076 compiled the following list of use-cases for Graph Analytics:\n\n### Compliance\n\nGraph analytics help to spot frauds and unlawful actions such as money laundering and payments to sanctioned entities. Analysts use the data of social media to detect criminals. They use texting, phone calls, and emails to create a graph that shows how these data are related to criminals\u2019 records. \n\nGovernment agencies can identify the threats from non-obvious patterns of relationships from those graphs.\n\nGraphs can be formed from financial transactions and can be used to analyze compliance reasons. For example, now banks have to ensure that their customers are not connected to the sanctioned entities.\n\nUsing social or financial networks formed over these graphs for loan decisions.\n### Journalism\nGraph analytics is being used to identify networks of relationships in the ICIJ ( International Consortium of Investigative Journalists) research on Panama Papers. The research emphasizes how authoritarian leaders and politicians used complex sets of shell companies to obscure their wealth from the public. Using graph analytics and document extraction tools to structure the data from thousands of documents on companies in off-shore jurisdictions. They used graph analytics to navigate the documents\u2019 structured data to identify those companies\u2019 real owners.\n### National Security\nThough considered a controversial topic, national intelligence agencies detect unlawful activity using graph analytics. Online activity of both suspected and not suspected individuals are collected and analyzed to identify non-obvious relationships and identify potential crimes.\n### Operations\n1. Supply Chain Optimization\nIn transportation networks, supply chain networks and airline companies use graph analytics algorithms such as shortest path and partitioning as tools to optimize routes.\n2. Fraud detection\nGraph Analytics is used to detect fraud detection in businesses that work with networks involving e-commerce marketplaces, financial institutions, and telecom companies.\nHealthcare\n1. Pandemic Search\n2020 was a pandemic year in the hands of coronavirus. Being a highly infectious virus, using a graph database helped governments track the spread of this virus. A Chinese company named We-Yun allows Chinese citizens to check if they can contact a known carrier of the virus.\n### Marketing\n1. Recommendation Engines\n\u201cPeople you may know\u201d or \u201cSongs you may like\u201d are some common phrases you hear these days on your social media profiles. Recommendations rely on collaborative filtering, which is a commonly recommended engine. Graph Analytics helps to identify similar users and enables personalized recommendations when using this collaborative filtering.\n2. Social Network Analysis\nSocial media networks such as Instagram, Linked In, and Spotify are relationships and connection-driven applications. Graph analytics has an application in identifying influencers and communities on social media.\n## Two examples of applications of Network Graphs in Business\nGraph Theory and the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nLet's explore an example that's top of mind for many of us: Covid and how it is transmitted.\u2075\n\nThe Graph below represents Covid spread in Hong Kong between January and April 2020. 1,038 Covid cases were analyzed using network graphs and algorithmic computations to define the related clusters, which were then analyzed to discover the most likely sources of transmission.\u2075 The analysis results include:\n\nAn investigation of 137 recognized clusters (median cluster size = 2) found that 7 probable super spreader events (SSEs) accounted for 58% of all clustered cases. The largest cluster of 106 cases, as depicted in the Graph, was associated with four bars in Hong Kong.\u2075\n\nAn estimated 19% (95% CI: 15% \u2014 24%) of cases caused 80% of all local transmission. Transmission in social settings was associated with more secondary cases than transmission in households (p = 0.002).\u2075\n\nEven this small variable graph, as you can see, becomes complicated. However, the visualization significantly improves the efficiency of the analysis.\n\nAround 1000 variables are highlighted in this Graph. Consider applying graph theory to the analysis of hundreds of thousands of data points. That is where graph theory excels.\n\n## Explaining how complex multicultural communication is in my family with a graph!\nRaw data formats can be challenging for human brains to process. We better detect patterns when presented in specific visual formats, such as a graph visualization. For example, humans can easily spot unexpected connections, hidden patterns, and outliers when viewing data relationships as a graph visualization.\n\nEven people who have never worked with graphs before or have no experience with data analysis can follow the connections and identify some interesting patterns. This means that your analysis tools will be accessible to the broadest possible audience.\n\nI will use a simple graph network to visualize how difficult it can be for my family to communicate correctly.\n\nIn my family, we were born in three different countries (Brazil, Poland, and Italy), and we speak four different languages natively (Portuguese, English, Polish and Italian).\n\nIn a more complex analysis, I could graph other multicultural aspects of my family, such as the countries where we were born and the countries where we currently live, the time we spend talking in each different language during a specific period, and the average number of communication mismatches during that period.\n\nOn the Graph above, I created a simple graph that explains how each family member communicates with each other from a linguistic standpoint.\n\nMy family member and I are referred to as Vertices or Nodes. And the Edges represent the lines that connect the Nodes.\n\nIn those lines, I wrote the languages they can use to communicate with each other; it could also represent, for example, the number of languages they speak, in which case it could be referred to as Weights.\n\n### Me and my family\nI often speak with myself in 4 languages -ITA, ENG, POL, and PT, so the weight is = 4\nI and my wife we can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\nStella and I can speak in 3 languages \u2014 PT, ITA, and ENG, so weight is = 3\nSofia and I can speak in 2 languages \u2014 POL and ENG, so weight is = 2\nEmily and I can speak in 2 languages \u2014 POL and ENG, so weight is = 2\n### My wife and the family\nMy wife and I can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\nMy wife often speak with herself in 1 language \u2014 POL, so the weight is = 1\nMy wife and Stella can speak in 1 language \u2014 ENG, so the weight is = 1\nMy wife and Sofia can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\nMy wife and Emily can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\n### Stella and the family\nStella and I can speak in 3 languages \u2014 PT, ENG, and ITA, so the weight is = 3\nStella and my wife can speak in 1 language \u2014 ENG, so the weight is = 1\nStella often speak with herself in 1 language \u2014 ITA, so the weight is = 1\nStella and Sofia they can speak in 1 language \u2014 ENG, so the weight is = 1\nStella and Emily they can speak in 1 language \u2014 ENG, so the weight is = 1\n### Sofia and the family\nSofia and I can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\nSofia and my wife can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\nSofia and Stella can speak in 1 language \u2014 ENG, so the weight is = 1\nSofia often speak with herself in 1 language \u2014 POL, so the weight is = 1\nSofia and Emily can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\n### Emily and the family\nEmily and I can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\nEmily and my wife can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\nEmily and Stella they can speak in 1 language \u2014 ENG, so the weight is = 1\nEmily and Sofia they can speak in 2 languages \u2014 ENG and POL, so the weight is = 2\nEmily often speak with herself in 1 language \u2014 POL, so the weight is = 1\n\nThe combination of Nodes and Edges that visually depicts the relationships, including the Weights of the various relationships, is referred to as a graph.\nIn my oversimplified example, my weight could be 3 because I am fluent in Portuguese, English, and Polish.\n\nTo help you to visualize my family composition, I've created a graph:","ff417fc9":"## Adding attributes to graphs, nodes, and edges\nAttributes such as weights, labels, colors, or whatever Python object you like, can be attached to graphs, nodes, or edges.\n\nEach graph, node, and edge can hold key\/value attribute pairs in an associated attribute dictionary (the keys must be hashable).

In other words, it takes, on average, only \u201c6 people\u201d to get to a completely unknown individual.\n\nSo, let's visualize the structure of a small world chart:","7d5f13ba":"# INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL NETWORKS USING NETWORKX IN PYTHON\n\nEver wondered how the most popular social networking site, Facebook, works? How do we connect with friends using just Facebook? Therefore, Facebook and other social networking sites work on a methodology called social networking. Social network is mostly used on all social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn etc. It has a significant effect on marketers to engage customers. \n\nSocial networks use graphics to create a network. Its nodes are people and the edges are their connections to each other. Two nodes with connected edges are friends. Now let's see an example to understand what social networks are. \n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Social network analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It characterizes networked structures in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the ties, edges, or links (relationships or interactions) that connect them. \n\nExamples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks, memes spread,information circulation, friendship and acquaintance networks, business networks, knowledge networks, difficult working relationships, social networks, collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission, and sexual relationships. \n\nThese networks are often visualized through sociograms in which nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. These visualizations provide a means of qualitatively assessing networks by varying the visual representation of their nodes and edges to reflect attributes of interest.\n\nSocial network analysis has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology. It has also gained significant popularity in the following - anthropology, biology, demography, communication studies,economics, geography, history, information science, organizational studies, political science, public health, social psychology, development studies, sociolinguistics, and computer science and is now commonly available as a consumer tool (see the list of SNA software).\n\nThe advantages of SNA are twofold. Firstly, it can process a large amount of relational data and describe the overall relational network structure. tem and parameter selection to confirm the influential nodes in the network, such as in-degree and out-degree centrality. SNA context and choose which parameters to define the \u201ccenter\u201d according to the characteristics of the network. Through analyzing nodes, clusters and relations, the communication structure and position of individuals can be clearly described.\n\nNetworks (a.k.a graphs) are one of the most interesting areas of data science and have been subject to an explosion of interest in recent years. The ability to model the relationship between data points is powerful. This article introduces some basic concepts in network science and gives in python using networkx, the go-to python package for network related analysis. Keep your eyes peeled for my next article where I will explore network visualisations in more detail!","3df29dab":"## Random Graph\nAs the name suggests, a random graph is a set of nodes connected by links in a purely random way.","151c4fb2":"## Edge Colormap\nDraw a graph with matplotlib, color edges","a47e2944":"## Random Geometric Graph\n","1d17b481":"According to the official documentation, NetworkX is \u201ca package for creating, manipulating and studying the structure, dynamics and functions of complex networks\u201d. \n\n\n### The basic types of built-in graphics are:\n\n* Graph: this type of graph stores nodes and edges and edges are not directed.

This leaves you free to use meaningful items as nodes and edges. The most common choices are numbers or strings, but a node can be any hashable object (except None), and an edge can be associated with any object x using G.add_edge(n1,n2,object=x)\n\nAs an example, the nodes (n1,n2) could be protein objects from the RCSB Protein Data Bank, and x could refer to an XML record of publications detailing experimental observations of their interaction.\n\nWe have found this power quite useful, but its abuse can lead to unexpected surprises unless one is familiar with Python.

Look:","b6f5d1ad":"## Preferential Annex Chart\nThis category differs from the latter in the way links are generated. In fact, in the preferred attachment graph, when new nodes are added, they are more likely to be connected to a well-connected node than they are to be connected to a poorly connected node. In other words, if in a graph there is node A with degree = 5 and node B with degree = 2, when node C enters the graph, the probability of linking with A is greater than that of linking with B. As a result, the final graph will have few nodes with very high degrees, while many nodes with low degrees.\n\nLet's see how NetworkX can represent these graphs.
