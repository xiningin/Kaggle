Our most active collaborators are those who joined our community in years exceeding 2015, being the years 2015 and 2016 the most representative in terms of volunteers with high vocation of response to our users.\n\n\n2. Of the 10169 records of collaborators we have 23 that are above the 100 answers, indicating that they are our collaborator more active .\n\n\n3. In general terms we observed that our volunteers respond in less than a week, although we must pay special attention to the volunteers who respond to our users in a time exceeding one month because if we add this amount we obtain a figure higher than **`40%`** of responses registered after one month.\n\n\n4. Individually the groups of **`\"Cause\"`** have more users but if we analyze together the youth groups are the ones that in general have the largest community\n\n\n5. We can see that our volunteers with the most answers belong mostly to the **`technology industry`** but we must focus our attention on the volunteers who registered in the years 2016-2015 and 2018, who are our volunteers with the greatest tendency to respond to our users.\n\n\n6. We have around **`3053`** foreign students who belong mostly to **`India and Canada`**, which is a significant number of students, but we must not forget our most important sectors: California, Texas and the rest of the United States.\n\n\n7. At the time of making the analysis of the text **\"Question Title\"**, we can see a correct total correspondence between the frequent words in our students' questions and the labels registered in our database, our students are interested in asking about issues related to to ***`\"college, telecommunications, computer-software, information-technology-and-services, technology, business, etc.\"`***\n\n\n\n","3bd616fb":"# How many collaborator we have register ?","5dc305bd":"# 1) Answer By Year","89d9f9e4":"# 12) Students","b1ef64bb":"# Top 20 common words - Question Title"}}
