Quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts. The values that separate parts are called the first, second, and third quartiles.\n* **Variance\/Standard Deviance**: a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

While many scientific investigations make use of data, statistics is concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty.\n\n**Statistical Methods:**\n\nA. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information, while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics.\n\nB. **Inferential Statistics**: Process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.","da2c300a":"# **Descriptive Statistics**\nDescriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and about the observations that have been made. Such summaries may be either quantitative, i.e. summary statistics, or visual, i.e. simple-to-understand graphs. These summaries may either form the basis of the initial description of the data as part of a more extensive statistical analysis, or they may be sufficient in and of themselves for a particular investigation.\n\nIn the business world, descriptive statistics provides a useful summary of many types of data. For example, investors and brokers may use a historical account of return behaviour by performing empirical and analytical analyses on their investments in order to make better investing decisions in the future.","a7127f16":"* **Mean**: Average of the numbers.\n\n* **Median**: The middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data set.\n\n* **Mode**: The most frequent value in the data set.","3786a8e7":"Confidence intervals can be calculated using two different values: t-values or z-values. Both values are tabulated in tables, based on degrees of freedom and the tail of a probability distribution. More often, z-values are used. These are the critical values of the normal distribution with right tail probability. However, t-values are used when the sample size is below 30 and the standard deviation is unknown.","349bd67e":"# Inferential Statistics\nStatistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of sampling. Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (first) selecting a statistical model of the process that generates the data and (second) deducing propositions from the model.\n\nMain Areas of inferential statistics are:\n* Estimating parameters\n* Hypothesis Testing\n\nAny statistical inference requires some assumptions. A statistical model is a set of assumptions concerning the generation of the observed data and similar data. Descriptions of statistical models usually emphasize the role of population quantities of interest, about which we wish to draw inference. Descriptive statistics are typically used as a preliminary step before more formal inferences are drawn.\n\n","74102e39":"**Confidence interval (CI)** is a type of estimate computed from the statistics of the observed data. \n\nInterval estimation can be contrasted with point estimation. A point estimate is a single value given as the estimate of a population parameter that is of interest, for example, the mean of some quantity. An interval estimate specifies instead a range within which the parameter is estimated to lie. Confidence intervals are commonly reported in tables or graphs along with point estimates of the same parameters, to show the reliability of the estimates.\n\nFor example, we measures height of 50 people."}}
