Which super hero will he need to talk to ? ... Doctor X, Wolvering, Storm?... Well the answer \"Doctor Strange\" Because they were togeher in Doctor strange comic #4 .. Deadpool talks to Dr. strange and Dr. Strange to Tony and << Bam , Boom>>.. Done Dotor Strange is the Man \n\n* But in Our case We have to consider so many super heroes and find the one who can talk to most of them .....Yeah you might get surprised \n\n\n*the top 5** friend that any super heroe should have arer (appeared, help, fight along , etc) are:\n \n1.

Well It is simple \n* Tony Stark: Did you know?\n* Steve Rogers: I didn't know it was him.\n* Tony Stark: Don't bullshit me, Rogers!
