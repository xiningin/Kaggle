The predictors are described in detail in the dataset's description.  \n\nWhereas there has been much research into COVID19 as it affects nation states, this dataset focuses on individual states in the US, with the addition of the District of Columbia. The purpose of this notebook is to analyze the predictors themselves, not to create analytical models. This is due to the fact that COVID19 numbers (tests, infections, deaths) are updated constantly; thus, current models are preliminary and are trying to hit a moving target.","302303a9":"### QQ Plots of Selected Factors\nThe distribution of some factors looks to be normal while others are exponential. QQ plots can be used to confirm these assumptions and provide a different perspective on a factor's distribution.","85e5854a":"# Conclusion\nThe purpose of this notebook was to analyze the features of the COVID19 State dataset. It is clear from the results, especially in feature selection, that more qualitative analysis is necessary to attribute any sort of causation to the predictors. That work will be left to the actual scientists and those with much more domain knowledge than myself!   \n<br>\nFurthermore, this notebook is not exhaustive; there are a seemingly infinite number of insights that could come from this data. Please feel free to experiment and provide constructive feedback! ","31760e18":"## School Closures Predictor\nSchool Closures is the sole categorical predictor in the dataset. The following plot shows this data in (hopefully!) readable format.","b0c0214a":"## Correlations and Feature Reduction\nCorrelations of each numerical column including COVID19 tests, infections and deaths","8bf91acc":"Note that if one were to plot these variables without the log scale, outliers would clearly be shown on the Deaths axis. In this case, New York has many more deaths than other states, causing it to be an outlier. However, as COVID19 numbers continue to be reported, these models should adjust accordingly.","c79890c8":"## Grouping the Predictors\nAnother way to reduce the number of features is to qualitatively group them into categories. The predictors in this dataset could mostly be grouped into **Socioeconomic** and **Public Health** categories, with some overlap between the two. Furthermore, predictors such as Med-Large Airports and Temperature do not fit into the above categories, but would nevertheless be interesting to see in analytical models.","a0a1607b":"#### Random Forest Regressor","c8843c33":"It is clear from the above heat map that GDP is highly correlated with other factors such as Pop Density, and Gini is highly correlated with Sex Ratio. As a rule of thumb, highly correlated features should be removed.","81b06025":"The following QQ plots fit an exponential distribution to the Infected column.","b867c781":"The Smoking Rate column follows a normal distribution.","2347405c":"As shown in the heat map above, some predictors are highly correlated with others. For example, Population is highly positively correlated with Physicians, Hospitals, Med-Lar Airports and ICU beds.  ","2cfb9466":"## Outliers in COVID19 Numbers\nIt is vitally important to call out the imbalance of the COVID19 metrics (Infected, Tested and Deaths). These numbers are being constantly updated and the virus is still rather new in United States, comparatively speaking.","ffee764c":"### Correlations Revisited","e5a06602":"As shown above, each of the COVID19 metrics has a good deal of outliers. This should be taken into context when creating and interpreting models. These boxplots should expand as more data comes is made available and results are standardized.","50f6b9e6":"The log log plot shows a clear trend. This shows that there exists a relationship y=X<sup>n<\/sup>.  \n\nLooking back the heat map above, Physicians is also highly correlated with Hospitals and Med-Large Airports. According to US news articles about COVID19, the virus was transmitted from abroad and likely entered the US through airports. International airports with high throughput are also indicative of larger cities, where the virus spreads faster. Effectively, Physicians could be a proxy for other highly correlated variables relating to larger cities, where the virus is more pronounced. \n\nIn this situation, the heuristic of using a random forest regressor to judge feature importances did not work out well. However, feature reduction still needs to occur. The next portion of the notebook demonstrates a reduction of features through qualitative reasoning.","51f30d8a":"Qualitatively, this result make sense, population should be a good predictor of deaths. The next cell takes a closer look at the relationship between Population and Deaths.","9d9e7f63":"#### Socioeconomic Predictors","f793b32c":"Note how in the first QQ plot there are 2 major outliers from the data, further inspection showed that these were from New York and New Jersey. The outliers were removed and the second plot fits the exponential distribution nicely.","003931ff":"In this case, ICU Beds could be a proxy metric for large urban centers. The heat map at the top of the Correlations and Feature Reduction section shows that ICU Beds is highly correlated with Physicians, Hospitals and Med-Large Airports. Knowing that New York City is the hardest hit area, this result makes sense. However, note again that New York is an outlier in the Deaths column. As more COVID19 data comes in, these models will likely change.","4d0360ed":"## Statistical Distributions\nKernel Density Estimation and Histogram for numerical predictors across all 50 states and DC"}}
