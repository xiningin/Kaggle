The StackingCVRegressor extends the standard stacking algorithm (implemented as StackingRegressor) using out-of-fold predictions to prepare the input data for the level-2 regressor.\n\nIn the standard stacking procedure, the first-level regressors are fit to the same training set that is used prepare the inputs for the second-level regressor, which may lead to overfitting. The StackingCVRegressor, however, uses the concept of out-of-fold predictions: the dataset is split into k folds, and in k successive rounds, k-1 folds are used to fit the first level regressor. In each round, the first-level regressors are then applied to the remaining 1 subset that was not used for model fitting in each iteration. The resulting predictions are then stacked and provided -- as input data -- to the second-level regressor. After the training of the StackingCVRegressor, the first-level regressors are fit to the entire dataset for optimal predicitons.\n\n\nMore : http:\/\/rasbt.github.io\/mlxtend\/user_guide\/regressor\/StackingCVRegressor\/\nI encourage that you read more about stacking.\n\n![](http:\/\/rasbt.github.io\/mlxtend\/user_guide\/regressor\/StackingCVRegressor_files\/stacking_cv_regressor_overview.png)\n\n\n### In simple words , Stacking helps avoid fitting on the same data twice , and is effective in reducing overfitting.\n","e405f446":"# Blending Models \/ 'Ensambling'\n* Notice that we are using a few percent from different models to get our final answer , all decimals add up to 1","151e3aa7":"# Submission","fe2d047d":" ### Fill the remaining columns as **None**","f5888824":"## Here , we compare the various models that we just created..","19d60f3a":"GroupBy explained here : https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html\n\n### This code will filll the missing values with the mode (The frequently category appearing) By each MSsubclass:\n* Idea is that similar MSSubClasses will have similar MSZoning  ","643ab58f":"## Get_dummies converts Categorical data to numerical , as models don't work with Text data .\n* each category gets its different columns , mostly binary . \n* Know more : https:\/\/riptutorial.com\/pandas\/example\/20990\/one-hot-encoding-with--get-dummies---","2e6c0186":"## For missing values in numerical cols , we fillNa with 0.","2171059d":"### Now , we are merging train and test datasets , so that we can handle *** 'noise'*** and ***missing data*** in the dataset .
