Korean officials attribute this to** a strategy called TRUST: transparency; robust screening and quarantine; unique but universally applicable testing and; strict control and treatment.** There is one approach called **drive-through test stations**, which allow health workers to take swabs to test for the virus without people leaving their cars. This approach is quite effective and helpful, which is now being copied by other countries, including Canada, Germany and the U.S.\n\n**Reference: **\nTiang, J., Ma , D., Huang, S., & Han, W.
