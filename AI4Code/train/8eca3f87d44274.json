Check:","481df04d":"There is absolutely no way to separate the different colors by using any clever engineered \"special feature\" in a ML model. Otherwise it wouldn't be a Markov process.\nThis is the reason why even a trivial model achieves 0.93 on the LB and the best models achieve 0.941. It's very likely that\n\na) there won't be any more increases of more than maybe 0.002 on the LB\n\nb) already 0.94 is due to the specific train and test data and unlikely to generalize to new unseen data.\n\nEveryone can in principle check this: it's easy to generate new training data. Just use P to generate new open_channel data and then add gaussian noise with mean and std taken from the individual \"blobs\" in the training data (I've checked: all open_channel values have the same noise standard deviation and also identical distance).\n\nHave fun!","46149f89":"This is all information contained in the signal. There are no hidden features, all that remains to be done is to separate the spherical point clouds. If the noise were smaller, this would be trivial. The only problem in this competition is due to the fact that the noise smears the different \"matrix elements\" into each other. Ans since it's white (Gaussian) noise (I have checked this via Fourier transformation), it is impossible to do this better than a certain upper limit. This is especially true for the most \"smeared\" sequence 4.

This means that the probability for the value of data point n+1 depends *only* on data point n. A Markov process can be fully specified by the transition matrix P: the value of the current sample n corresponds to the rows of P and the value of the next sample n+1 corresponds to the columns of P.

Let's check this:","b583d826":"IMPORTANT EDIT: A basic assumption in this notebook is wrong: the signal data is *not* the result of a first-order Markov process. In fact, the open\\_channel data itself is the result of a first-order Markov process. Therefore, the situation is more complicated than described here. Still, most of the arguments remain relevant. I've explained more [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/liverpool-ion-switching\/discussion\/140634).\n\nThis notebook analyzes and visualizes the training data and demonstrates that the signal data is indeed the result of a simple Markov process (however, a hidden one) combined with Gaussian (white) noise. **This puts a strong upper limit on what a model can achieve in this competition.**","67938843":"Here is the full training data (signal and ground truth (open channels)), each sequence has 500.000 samples corresponding to 50s of data acquisition. 5 different \"data models\" can be visually identified (sequences 0, 2, 3, 4, 5), shown here in red.
