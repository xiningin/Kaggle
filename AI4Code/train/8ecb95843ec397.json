Let's try to be as silly as possible for this. \n- Height (X)\n- Income (Y)\n\nWe are holding an assumption that the data is continuous, i.e, scales up in a specific order as:\n- 100, 200, 300.....\n\nSince both height and income can follow this pattern, this would be a satisfactory dataset. \n\nOur aim, with linear regression, is to find relations between the two datasets. Our entire approach revolves around the question:\n- Is income related to the height of the person? \n- Do taller people earn more? \n- If it really does, can we predict it? \n\nConsidering our dataset for a 1000 people, our dataset would consist of these datapoints: \n- 145 cm, 51000 USD\n- 184 cm, 62000 USD\n- 152 cm, 59000 USD\n\nAnd so on. \n\nLinear regression lets us do some math on these data points and describes the correlation between these datasets. That is, how strongly does height really relate with high income.\n\nSince correlation, in this example, has a range 0f 0-1, the correlation would confirm the following hypothesis: \n- A correlation of 1 would mean being tall always means you have a higher income.\n\n- A correlation of 0 would mean there is no relationship between height and income.\n\n- A negative value means a negative correlation, that is, taller people tend to have lower incomes. A correlation of -1 would mean taller people always make less money than shorter people.\n\n\nThis allows us to understand the relation between two variables, or two types of data. \nAlso, once we have the relation, we can use linear regression for prediction. If we know the rough relationship between X and Y, then we can use this relationship to predict values of Y for a value of X we want.\n\nFor this example, it would be: prediciting income for the height of the person\n","b81644e1":"We can now see the Months and the Days of the year 2015.
