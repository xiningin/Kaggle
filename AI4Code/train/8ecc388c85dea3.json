The Anonops IRC channel has\nbeen affiliated with the Anonymous hacktivist group. In particular, chat participants have\nin the past planned and announced their future targets on Anonops. Consequently, a well\u0002engineered ML system would be able to predict cyber attacks by training on such data. In\nstep 2, we instantiated a hashing vectorizer. The hashing vectorizer gave us counts of the 1-\nand 2-grams in the text, in other words, singleton and consecutive pairs of words (tokens)\nin the articles. We then applied a tf-idf transformer to give appropriate weights to the\ncounts that the hashing vectorizer gave us. Our final result is a large, sparse matrix\nrepresenting the occurrences of 1- and 2-grams in the texts, weighted by importance.\nFinally, we examined the frontend of a sparse matrix representation of our featured data in\nScipy.","8407e45a":"Lets count the words in text using hash vectorizer and then perform weighting using tf-idf","16bdee4a":"End result is sparse matrix with each row being a vector representing one of the texts"}}
