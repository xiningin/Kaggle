The big five traits are commonly known by the acronym OCEAN.

CBT has been shown to improve intolerance of uncertainty, and reduce anxiety and fear.\n\nCBT involves problem-solving and engaging in avoided behaviour to test the validity of one\u2019s beliefs. The idea is to challenge unhelpful thoughts, and make decisions based on evidence.\n\nYou may start to feel anxious when only buying items for use in the immediate future. That\u2019s OK.

If everyone complies, we\u2019ll all be OK.\n\nThe reverse was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic with the panic-induced buying of toilet paper, face masks and other \u201cessentials\u201d. Here we saw decision making based on emotion and the government attempting to counter it with fact-based information.\n\nThere is evidence that in times of major crises groups may prioritise their local interests, such as keeping your family, neighbourhood or wider community safe. Such as setting up road blocks around their communities to control access by people who are not local residents.\n\nBut this has the potential to spill over into vigilantism if local protection interests combine with fear. It can prioritise the interests of a few over the greater good.\nhttps:\/\/theconversation.com\/the-psychology-of-lockdown-suggests-sticking-to-rules-gets-harder-the-longer-it-continues-135927","c73bbb5a":"#Script by Chris X https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/docxian\/pixel-correlation-rows-columns","aba6dfd9":"#Cultural factors,by Dougal Sutherland\n\nCultural and political psychology also has an impact on our behaviour during lockdown. Broadly speaking, different cultures can be categorised as \u201ctight\u201d or \u201cloose\u201d.\n\nTight cultures (China, Singapore) tend to be more rule bound and less open but are also associated with more order and self-regulation. In contrast, looser cultures (UK, USA) place more emphasis on individual freedoms and rights, and are correspondingly slow to self-regulate in the face of government requirements.\n\nAustralia appears to fall towards the looser end of the spectrum while New Zealanders sits somewhere in the middle. The challenge will be how we respond as our society continues to \u201ctighten\u201d with strict rules while boredom and annoyance sets in.\n\nPolitical polarisation, which has increased markedly in recent years, may be exacerbated by being physically distant from others. There is a danger that as we stay in our bubbles, both physical and virtual, we fall into \u201cecho chambers\u201d wherein we only hear similar voices and opinions to our own.\nhttps:\/\/theconversation.com\/the-psychology-of-lockdown-suggests-sticking-to-rules-gets-harder-the-longer-it-continues-135927","c6e5ef40":"#Facing Pandemic together could lead to positive psychological growth, by Lowri Dowthwaite\n\nResearch shows that natural disasters, like the novel coronavirus pandemic, can actually bring out the best in people. Although times of significant threat or crisis can cause post-traumatic stress, research shows that so-called \u201cadversarial growth\u201d is just as common as a response. This is our capacity to not only overcome a crisis, but to actually grow stronger, wiser and more resilient.\n\nOften, adversity may help us experience a new appreciation of life, improve our relationships with others, and help us gain personal strength. In other words, what doesn\u2019t kill us makes us stronger.\n\n#The \u201cfight, flight or freeze\u201d and The \u201ctend and befriend\u201d Responses\n\nThe most common response to threats in humans is the \u201cfight, flight or freeze\u201d response, where stress triggers a hormonal response that prepares the body to either fight or run from a threat.\n\nBut more recent research shows we also have a \u201ctend and befriend\u201d response. When faced with a threat, this response releases hormones \u2013 like oxytocin \u2013 that encourage us to build and maintain our social network to reduce stress and anxiety, and build empathy.\n\n#Post-traumatic growth\n\nStudies looking at natural disasters show the \u201ctend and befriend\u201d response actually reduces incidents of post-traumatic stress disorder and promotes \u201cpost-traumatic growth\u201d. These are positive psychological changes that happen in response to a traumatic event, including increased resilience, self-confidence, greater empathy, and improved subjective wellbeing.\nhttps:\/\/theconversation.com\/facing-the-coronavirus-crisis-together-could-lead-to-positive-psychological-growth-134289","34bfdeb3":"![](https:\/\/cdn.statcdn.com\/Infographic\/images\/normal\/21945.jpeg)statista.com","5f53e212":"#Human behaviour and Reward principles, by Dougal Sutherland\n\nAt a very basic level, human behaviour is governed by reward principles.\n\nIf what we do is followed by a perceived reward, we\u2019re more likely to keep doing it. Not getting sick is a reward, but it may not be perceived as such for much longer as most of us weren\u2019t sick in the first place.\n\nThis lack of reward reinforcement could be intensified by an optimism bias - \u201cIt won\u2019t happen to me\u201d - which may become stronger than our anxiety as time passes and the perceived threat reduces.\n\nOutside of our individual psychology, broader social factors come into play. In times of uncertainty we look to others to guide our own behaviour as they set our social norms.\n\nOften, there is a degree of confusion about guidelines on what people are allowed to do, for example when exercising during lockdown. Seeing others out surfing, mountain biking and picnicking in a park can lead to a mindset of \u201cif they\u2019re doing it, why can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nTo counter this, the government should continue to appeal to our sense of shared identity and highlight examples of punishment for rule breakers. But an over-emphasis on punishment risks people sticking to rules merely for social approval, which means they may conform in public but not in private. Being punished can also build resentment and may lead people to seeking out loopholes in the rules.\nhttps:\/\/theconversation.com\/the-psychology-of-lockdown-suggests-sticking-to-rules-gets-harder-the-longer-it-continues-135927","2326c892":"#Psychology of a pandemic, by Dougal Sutherland\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has forced millions of people to live under strict lockdown conditions, but the psychology of human behaviour predicts they will find it harder to stick to the rules the longer the situation continues.\n\nThere are many rule breakers. During a pandemic, fear is one of the central emotional responses and up to this point, most people have complied with lockdown conditions out of fear of becoming infected. But as time passes, people\u2019s resolution may begin to fray.\n\nMore than 40 psychologists are currently reviewing research relevant to people\u2019s behaviour during a pandemic to advance the fight against COVID-19.\n\n* The psychological factors that motivate us to stay in our bubble are a mix of individual, group and societal considerations.https:\/\/theconversation.com\/the-psychology-of-lockdown-suggests-sticking-to-rules-gets-harder-the-longer-it-continues-135927","c6ae1197":"#Socialising, Empathy and Compassion by  Lowri Dowthwaite\n\nResearchers also acknowledge that experiencing this level of crisis will bring about painful emotions, uncertainty, physical suffering, and psychological distress. How we cope with this \u2013 either through the \u201cfight or flight\u201d or \u201ctend and befriend\u201d response \u2013 is vital to our psychological health as individuals and as a community.\n\nIf we can still regularly socialise \u2013 even virtually \u2013 this can help people bond, and build personal growth and social wellbeing in those affected by a collective trauma. This \u201ccommunal coping\u201d also makes us more open to making new friends. The \u201ctend and befriend\u201d response encourages empathy and compassion, gives us better social awareness, and makes us better able to understand the needs of others and how to behave in an empathetic and helpful way.\n\nThough stress is an understandable response during a time like this, choosing how you respond to it is important. The \u201ctend and befriend\u201d response will help us consider others in our community, and may be important for social distancing, and increasing charitable responses or acts of kindness. In the midst of a global crisis, this adaptive stress response may not only reduce incidents of anger, prejudice and violence, but may also foster collective humanity and post-pandemic growth.\nhttps:\/\/theconversation.com\/facing-the-coronavirus-crisis-together-could-lead-to-positive-psychological-growth-134289"}}
