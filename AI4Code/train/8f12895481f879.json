Description\n- A main area of focus is machine learning models that can identify toxicity in online conversations, where toxicity is defined as anything rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion. If these toxic contributions can be identified, we could have a safer, more collaborative internet.\n\n- `Disclaimer`: The dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.\n\n# 2. Evaluation\n- `area under the ROC curve` between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\n# 3. Data\n- `comment_text`: This contains the text of a comment which has been classified as toxic or non-toxic (0...1 in the toxic column). The data set\u2019s comments are entirely in english and come either from Civil Comments or Wikipedia talk page edits.\n\n- What am I predicting?\n> You are predicting the probability that a comment is toxic.
