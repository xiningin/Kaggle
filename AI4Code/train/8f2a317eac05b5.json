It is a define-by-run framework, which means that your backprop is\ndefined by how your code is run, and that every single iteration can be\ndifferent.\n\nLet us see this in more simple terms with some examples.\n\nTensor\n--------\n\n``torch.Tensor`` is the central class of the package. If you set its attribute\n``.requires_grad`` as ``True``, it starts to track all operations on it. When\nyou finish your computation you can call ``.backward()`` and have all the\ngradients computed automatically. The gradient for this tensor will be\naccumulated into ``.grad`` attribute.\n\nTo stop a tensor from tracking history, you can call ``.detach()`` to detach\nit from the computation history, and to prevent future computation from being\ntracked.\n\nTo prevent tracking history (and using memory), you can also wrap the code block\nin ``with torch.no_grad():``. This can be particularly helpful when evaluating a\nmodel because the model may have trainable parameters with\n``requires_grad=True``, but for which we don't need the gradients.\n\nThere\u2019s one more class which is very important for autograd\nimplementation - a ``Function``.\n\n``Tensor`` and ``Function`` are interconnected and build up an acyclic\ngraph, that encodes a complete history of computation. Each tensor has\na ``.grad_fn`` attribute that references a ``Function`` that has created\nthe ``Tensor`` (except for Tensors created by the user - their\n``grad_fn is None``).\n\nIf you want to compute the derivatives, you can call ``.backward()`` on\na ``Tensor``. If ``Tensor`` is a scalar (i.e. it holds a one element\ndata), you don\u2019t need to specify any arguments to ``backward()``,\nhowever if it has more elements, you need to specify a ``gradient``\nargument that is a tensor of matching shape.\n\n","472eaa18":"Do a tensor operation:\n\n","7db03b72":"Create a tensor and set ``requires_grad=True`` to track computation with it\n\n","66d5609c":"You should have got a matrix of ``4.5``.
