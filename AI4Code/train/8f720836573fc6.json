Coronaviruses (CoVs), are enveloped positive-sense (double helix) RNA viruses, characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface; an unusually large RNA genome, and a unique replication strategy . \n\nThe name corona derives from the crown-like (corona) spikes on their surface . Coronaviruses were first identified in the early 1930s; with the first human Coronavirus discovered in 1960s , without clear source ; although some scholars incriminate lower mammals like bats. Coronavirus is zoonotic; meaning that it can infect both animals and humans . \n\nMost coronaviruses cause respiratory diseases of varying degrees and spread the same way other cold-causing viruses do; that is, through human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets. The spreading could be direct, by infected people coughing and sneezing out the droplets containing the virus. respiratory droplets or indirect, by susceptible person touching materials contaminated by infected person. https:\/\/www.hsj.gr\/medicine\/a-success-story-how-botswana-is-winning-the-war-against-coronavirus.php?aid=27014","3f622c4a":"#Coronavirus in Botswana\n\nAs at March 18, 2020, Botswana had not recorded any case of COVID-19, even though their sister country South Africa had confirmed about 116 cases, which later grew to 150 cases by March, 19 with no deaths. Already by March 16, Botswana had closed all its four borders with South Africa. Border posts with Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Namibia currently remain open.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the current COVID-19 will hit Botswana; maybe not during the 1st wave of outbreak. However, there are two strong reasons why COVID-19 may not establish and flourish in Botswana. These are:\n\n#High atmospheric temperature\n\nThe COVID-19 of a double helix RNA virus is highly susceptible to acids and acidic compounds and highly thermolabile; that is, easily destroyed by heat. COVID-19 does not survive in an atmospheric temperature about 26 degrees Celsius. Botswana average temperature at this time of the first outbreak up till April 5, 2020 ranges from 230C lowest to 370C highest; given an average temperature of 300C. This temperature is high enough to decimate COVID-19. In addition to Botswana heat, the air is dry. Both conditions will make it difficult for COVID-19 to establish in Botswana.https:\/\/www.hsj.gr\/medicine\/a-success-story-how-botswana-is-winning-the-war-against-coronavirus.php?aid=27014","a49ab130":"#That performance (above) wasn't well since we have many data.

Unlike most other African countries that have refused to observe that WHO regulations, Botswana has shown to comply. The President of Botswana had just returned from Namibia, where there are confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the President is undergoing a compulsory 14 days quarantine; him and all members of his travel contingent.\n\nPossibility of establishing covid-19 in botswana in winter and recommended preparedness\n\nIf at all the COVID-19 will establish in Botswana it will most likely do so in winter. Botswana\u2019s winter occurs between June\/July to September\/October during which time the average temperature is 40C lowest and 18-190C highest. This temperature is conducive for COVID-19 to establish. Secondly during winter, for some reason, maybe because of the cold, people tend to associate more. This can tamper with maintaining social distance. It is imperative for the government of Botswana to prepare ahead of winter to prevent and\/or contain the virus should there be any outbreak.https:\/\/www.hsj.gr\/medicine\/a-success-story-how-botswana-is-winning-the-war-against-coronavirus.php?aid=27014","20fa5a2d":"#DEXPLOT codes from  Digvijay Yadav https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/digvijayyadav\/understanding-ctds-data\/notebook","89d1585f":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata   @mpwolke ","04f1eb65":"#Comparing 2018 (above) with 1980 Immunizations.","0a7f2887":"#What the Government can do Ahead of Winter to Avoid Covid-19\n\nShutting the borders\n\nQuarantine and Isolation\n\nOrganize awareness campaign\n\nProgram should be taken to the grass roots\n\nProvide containment homes during winter periods\n\nSystematic and continued testing\n\nProvide essential consumables\n\nBotswana day of prayer\nhttps:\/\/www.hsj.gr\/medicine\/a-success-story-how-botswana-is-winning-the-war-against-coronavirus.php?aid=27014","07042d79":"#A Success Story: How Botswana is Winning the War against Coronavirus?\nUchendu G (2020) A Success Story: How Botswana is Winning the War against Coronavirus? Health Sci J. Vol. 14 No. 1: 697.\n\nDOI: 10.36648\/1791-809X.14.1.697\n\nThere is low probability of an outbreak of COVID-19 in Botswana considering the nation\u2019s preparedness through prevention strategies and strict adherence to WHO directives on COVID-19. Botswana has many success stories; their stable economy, peaceful and sustained democracy, long history of respect for human and animal rights etc. Another of Botswana\u2019s success stories, which the rest of the world can emulate is their ability to maintain zero-case of Coronavirus in the midst of the pandemic. \n\nIn this article the author articulates public health structures and systems implemented by Batswana and the Botswana government, which may have helped to maintain a COVID-19-free nation. Primary data was sourced through direct observation, phone calls, e-Mails and minimal face to face interview. Secondary data was sourced from relevant published and un-published documents.\n\nSpeculations linking the COVID-19 outbreak to bioterrorism or divine punishment on mankind were debunked using reviews of scientific evidences. COVID-19 is known to thrive in temperatures below 26 degrees Celsius. The author projects that winter season in Botswana, (May to August) with temperatures between minus to 23 degrees Celsius, may favor outbreak of the virus. Consequently, author recommends some personal and national preparedness strategies for Botswana and the government to help maintain a COVID-19-free nation.https:\/\/www.hsj.gr\/medicine\/a-success-story-how-botswana-is-winning-the-war-against-coronavirus.php?aid=27014","76bde045":"#Botswana preparedness and compliance to WHO directives on COVID-19\n\nBotswana has many success stories; the stable economy, peaceful politics, respect for human and animal rights etc. Another Botswana success story, which the rest of the world can learn is Botswana\u2019s preparedness for the COVID-19 outbreak and compliance to the WHO directives on COVID-19. Within the first week of March, 2020, the government of Botswana had provided free testing at border posts. \n\nFree hand washes were provided in public schools before its eventual closure on March 21, 2020; a new Act on COVID-19 was produced and distributed freely by March 20; aggressive awareness campaign programs resumed; as different national Embassies demonstrated the so-called Coronavirus greeting, religious, sporting and social functions were suspended for 30 days starting from March 18, 2020. By March 20, 2020, not more than 10 people were allowed to gather in one place either for religious or social functions. Defaulter were arrested as at March 23, 2020. \n\nIt is therefore not surprising that although the virus is spreading in the four bordering countries, there is no record of Coronavirus in Botswana. There are arguments that Botswana adhere to extant laws because of their low population but on the contrary, Botswana\u2019s compliance is cultural; Botswana are more law-abiding than citizens of most other African countries.https:\/\/www.hsj.gr\/medicine\/a-success-story-how-botswana-is-winning-the-war-against-coronavirus.php?aid=27014 "}}
