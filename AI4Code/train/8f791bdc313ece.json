The only difference between the clinics was that many medical students served at Clinic 1, while mostly midwife students served at Clinic 2. While the midwives only tended to the women giving birth, the medical students also spent time in the autopsy rooms examining corpses.\n\nSemmelweis started to suspect that something on the corpses spread from the hands of the medical students, caused childbed fever. So in a desperate attempt to stop the high mortality rates, he decreed: Wash your hands! This was an unorthodox and controversial request, nobody in Vienna knew about bacteria at this point in time","d1a5770d":"<font color=\"blue\">\nIt reduced the proportion of deaths by around 8 percentage points","79ea4a4d":"<font color=\"blue\">\nWith the data loaded we can now look at the proportion of deaths over time. In the plot below we haven't marked where obligatory handwashing started, but it reduced the proportion of deaths constantly to such a degree after 01.10.1847.

All in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure that could save many lives.\n\nThe tragedy is that, despite the evidence, Semmelweis' theory \u2014 that childbed fever was caused by some \"substance\" (what we today know as bacteria) from autopsy room corpses \u2014 was ridiculed by contemporary scientists. The medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good.\n\nOne reason for this was that statistics and statistical arguments were uncommon in medical science in the 1800s. Semmelweis only published his data as long tables of raw data, but he didn't show any graphs nor confidence intervals. If he would have had access to the analysis we've just put together he might have been more successful in getting the Viennese doctors to wash their hands.","de3a1f20":"<font color=\"blue\">\nAs we can see in the information above and plots below, the first clinic has more than 2 time death proportion than the second clinic.
