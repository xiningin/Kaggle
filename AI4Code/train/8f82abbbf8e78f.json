It is hard to predict the salary from the grades. We saw that once we specialise to certain areas, the grades seem to correlate with salary, but there are obviously other factors not seen in the data, which affect the salary more than just the grades.\n\nHaving said this, it does seem that women with the same salaries as men in the same areas of specialisation have higher grades. They also need higher grades to get placed. Machine learning models (eventhough not very accurate) do quantify the gender gap.","73b8f9fe":"We see that correlations with grades are much stronger for females than for males. Let us see this on pairplot.","00f9c5e8":"For borderline candidates with the same grades our model changes its prediction between being hired and not after changing the gender, with pretty big jump in probabilities. ","ca30d65d":"We see that now, salary is more corellated to grades (which makes sense), and while being male correlates strongly negatively with grades, it only slightly negatively correlates with salary.

This can be especially seen on pairplot graphs, as cadidates with top 25% salaries have their grades all over the place. Out of all grades, mba_p and etest seem to correlate the most with higher salaries.\n\nOur first conclusion:\n## Grades do not seem to influence the salary.\nHence, we will not pursue further the topic of salary and focus more on ","997e988c":"We observe that the only missing values in the data are in the salary column. They correspond exactly to the non-placed candidates. We can fill the salary as 0. This will also make it harder to predict salary, since the dataset of people with salary consists of roughly 150 entries, which might not be enough for good model.","f5ea10ed":"Women with higher grades than men got rejected. Since women are more likely to be in areas that have lower pay, one would assume that they should have lower entry bar, but this is not the case. ","44ef7922":"From the graphs in the last row, we can see that for people with same salary, females have higher ssc_p, hsc_p, degree_p and mba_p grades, while etest_p grades are mixed. \n## Grades matter much more for women to get higher salary (and seems like they need higher grades to get the same salary as men) \n\nOf course, our most_common dataset is very small, so this could be all noise, but here is one observation:\n\n## Women seem to outperform men in all the grades except for etest.

Our model seems to be slightly optimistic, with the more common error being predicting that a person got placed, while in reality they weren't. This is common in unbalanced dataset.

","8bce83d4":"We see that gender_M coefficient is 1, while degee_p is 0.24.
