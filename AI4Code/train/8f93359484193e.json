There is no credible evidence that chess existed in a form approaching the modern game before the 6th century CE. Game pieces found in Russia, China, India, Central Asia, Pakistan, and elsewhere that have been determined to be older than that are now regarded as coming from earlier distantly related board games, often involving dice and sometimes using playing boards of 100 or more squares.\n\n> - One of those earlier games was a war game called chaturanga, a Sanskrit name for a battle formation mentioned in the Indian epic Mahabharata. Chaturanga was flourishing in northwestern India by the 7th century and is regarded as the earliest precursor of modern chess because it had two key features found in all later chess variants\u2014different pieces had different powers (unlike checkers and go), and victory was based on one piece, the king of modern chess.\n\n> - How chaturanga evolved is unclear. Some historians say chaturanga, perhaps played with dice on a 64-square board, gradually transformed into shatranj (or chatrang), a two-player game popular in northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and southern parts of Central Asia after 600 CE. Shatranj resembled chaturanga but added a new piece, a firz\u0101n (counselor), which had nothing to do with any troop formation. A game of shatranj could be won either by eliminating all an opponent\u2019s pieces (baring the king) or by ensuring the capture of the king. The initial positions of the pawns and knights have not changed, but there were considerable regional and temporal variations for the other pieces.\n\n> - The game spread to the east, north, and west, taking on sharply different characteristics. In the East, carried by Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders, and others, it was transformed into a game with inscribed disks that were often placed on the intersection of the lines of the board rather than within the squares. About 750 CE chess reached China, and by the 11th century it had come to Japan and Korea. Chinese chess, the most popular version of the Eastern game, has 9 files and 10 ranks as well as a boundary\u2014the river, between the 5th and 6th ranks\u2014that limits access to the enemy camp and makes the game slower than its Western cousin.\n\n","d9b868d1":"Explore the data","5126b875":"<img src='https:\/\/cdn.chess24.com\/qQGLOUaTTKO8JhGjrB6ojA\/original\/lindores-abbey-players-s.jpg'>\nsrc=\"https:\/\/cdn.chess24.com\/qQGLOUaTTKO8JhGjrB6ojA\/original\/lindores-abbey-players-s.jpg\"","58e03865":"<h2><span style = \"font-family: fantasy;background-color:yellow;\">CARLSEN<\/span><\/h2>\n","76710420":"## let's See how Carlsen changed over years","ed7a2b78":"<h3><span style = \"font-family: fantasy;background-color:yellow;\">\ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 Do upvote if you find it useful\ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 \ud83e\udd11 <\/span><\/h3>","76ce115d":"<h2><span style = \"font-family: fantasy;background-color:yellow;\">Individual Performance?<\/span><\/h2>\n","3e5e6f0b":"- The Elo rating system measures the relative strength of a player in some games, such as chess, compared to other players.

He was a solid chess player himself, as you can see from this game he played against a young Bobby Fischer.\n[link to read ](https:\/\/www.chess.com\/terms\/elo-rating-chess)"}}
