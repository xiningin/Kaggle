Create a `Series` counting how many times each of these two words appears in the `description` column in the dataset.\n\nHint: use a map to check each description for the string `tropical`, then count up the number of times this is `True`. Repeat this for `fruity`. Create a `Series` combining the two values at the end.","d3f2efb8":"# Introduction\n\nYou have learned how to select relevant data from `DataFrame` and `Series` objects. Plucking the right data out of our data representation is critical to getting work done.\n\nHowever, the data does not always come in the format we want. Sometimes we have to do some more work ourselves to reformat it for our desired task.\n\nThe remainder of this tutorial will cover different operations we can apply to our data to get the input \"just right\". We'll start off in this section by looking at the most commonly looked built-in reshaping operations. Along the way we'll cover data `dtypes`, a concept essential to working with `pandas` effectively.","9a5cdb60":"If you get stuck, **use the `answer_qN` function to see the code with the correct answer.**\n\nFor the first set of questions, running the `check_qN` on the correct answer returns `True`.\n\nFor the second set of questions, using this function to check a correct answer will present an informative graph!\n","0f739d7e":"**Exercise 3**: What countries appear in the dataset most often?","bad195f7":"<!--\n**Exercise 6**: Sometimes the `province` and `region_1` provided in the dataset is the same value. Create a `Series` whose values counts how many times this occurs (`True`) and doesn't occur (`False`).\n-->","3f791304":"**Exercise 7**: What combination of countries and varieties are most common?\n\nCreate a `Series` whose index consists of strings of the form `\"<Country> - <Wine Variety>\"`. For example, a pinot noir produced in the US should map to `\"US - Pinot Noir\"`. The values should be counts of how many times the given wine appears in the dataset. Drop any reviews with incomplete `country` or `variety` data.\n\nHint: you can do this in three steps. First, generate a `DataFrame` whose `country` and `variety` columns are non-null. Then use a map to create a series whose entries are a `str` concatenation of those two columns. Finally, generate a `Series` counting how many times each label appears in the dataset.","d2193d3e":"## Exercises\n\nLook at your data by running the cell below:","011f3878":"**Exercise 5**: I\"m an economical wine buyer.
