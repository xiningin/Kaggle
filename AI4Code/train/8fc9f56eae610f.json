plot we can say that the airbnb's growth was exponential from 2009 to 2015 then suddenly it decreased may be because of other rivals and a significant and most interesting change we can see at year 2020 due to corona virus pandemic reviews dropped down means people are not able to make their trips\n\nIn second graph between host id and the no. of review we can say these are the top host of the london and one had succesfully gained more than 800 reviews\n\nIn third plot between host_response_rate and review_score we can say for host to be a super host they have to maintain the review rate as high as 95% however some outliers are their and most of the host have succesfully secured a review rate of more than 80%\n\nIn second last plot we have information related to no. of reviews with respect to month and common point in all the years from 2011 to 2016 is at the time of june to july the reviews increases means people visits more and in 2011 the reviews are more in october to december and in plot of 2012 suddenly graph goes down during october to december but it is not possible so it means reviews are not provided by peoples. This feature can't be used in model because it is very inconsistent.\n\nPrice v\/s month plot is also very inconsistent and shows in most of the years prices were high during october to december and almost in all years prices were high between march to june this was because of the winter and summer holidays respectively.\n","23a56f5e":"above we can see many values are missing but for review_scores_cleanliness and review_scores_rating we can replace missing values directly with 0 reviews and than all the rows with the null values","9e1e88a0":"Now we are going to analyze between host_response_rate and review_scores_rating to see the relationship of host and host_is_super_host","288af555":"# Analysis Part-II\n\nIn this we are going to analyze the data with respect to host and see the rise of Airbnb across the time\n\nStart with importing all the necessary packages.","83e8a1e1":"Now we will explore the reviewing process with respect to months in a particular year we will see this from 2011 to 2016","4ed4f95b":"Above we can see that for becoming a super host review_score_rating should be strictly tough but however some outliers are there at the bottom of the plot.","6e2bd7a5":"# New-York Airbnb Dataset Exploration","c269fc6b":"# Visualizations\n\nhere we are going to explore the rise of airbnb over years and we will see this relation with respect to the host association"}}
