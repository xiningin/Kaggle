However, as many living and nonliving things make noise, the analysis of these datasets is often done manually by domain experts. These analyses are painstakingly slow, and results are often incomplete.\n\nIn this competition we predict which bird are in the audio\n\nWork, obviously, is in progress :)\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/30Eqq6Y.png)","074a735e":"### Rating","305a6b8c":"It would be interesting to understand why these peaks happen...","808896b6":"There are 264 different birds in train data!\n\nInteresting to notice that max count of rcordings per a bird is 100.","9e523885":"Let's submit it.","b433f5b4":"### Country","3f9ae1fe":"We can see that most recording have quite a duration of less than 2 minutes.","0cf48e52":"It is quite interesting to see that some birds have full 5 rating and some are less loved.","8d8156e2":"### Target","5636ecc2":"There are a lot of different locations!
