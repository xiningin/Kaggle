Introduction \nIn this notebook, I will introduce some basic encoding schemes in a very understandable way. The target audiences are those who just get to know machine learning and want quick access to these techniques. For convenience purposes, I will also provide the sklearn version and the library corresponding to each method.\n\nBy the end of this post, I hope that you would have a better idea of how to apply different encoding schemes.\n\nFor best result, you should look at the data frame -> description -> code","2eda5c9f":"...and sk-learn TargetEncoder with smoothing.\n\n**Note:** By default, the \"smoothing\" coefficient is 1. The bigger the value, the stronger our regularization.

However, if you understand the 12 encoding techniques I introduced above, it would be able to move fast. Moreover, it always worth try all the techniques that are applicable to the feature and decide which one works best. Try to input different regularization coefficient values and see if they increase your score. The cheat-sheet below will help you make some initial decisions. \n\nHave fun playing with encoders!","c5b96c2c":"# 5) M-estimator Encoding\n\nM-Estimate Encoder is a simplified version of Target Encoder. The M stands for maximum likelihood-type. It has only one hyper-parameter \u2014 $m$, which represents the power of regularization. The higher the value of m results into stronger shrinking. Recommended values for $m$ is in the range of $1$ to $100$.

It is defined by the formula:\n   $$JS_i = (1-B)\\cdot \\text{mean}(y_i) + B\\cdot\\text{mean}(y)$$\nwhere $\\text{mean}(y)$ is the global mean of the target, $\\text{mean}(y_i)$ is the mean of the category, and $B$ is the weight. \n\nThe weight B depends on the $\\sigma (y)$ and $\\sigma (y_i)$, which is the variance of the target. However, we do not know what the variance is so we have to estimate it. More about this method [here](https:\/\/kiwidamien.github.io\/james-stein-encoder.html). \n\n**Note:** The limitation of James-Stein is it work only best for the feature that has a normal distribution. \n\nIn the sklearn version, the default sigma is $0.05$.","9f1fa373":"# 5) Hashing Encoding\n\nHashing converts categorical variables to a higher dimensional space of integers. I won't comment on the methodology much here since [scikit-learn](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher.html \"reference\") explain it very well.\n\nThe `n_feature` is the number of columns you want to add. These new columns distinguish the corresponding category. However, you can adjust `n_feature` to any number.

Bayesian Target Encoders\n\nThe general idea of this method is to take the target into account. \n\n**Advantage:** \n\n* Require minimal effort, only create one column for any number of categories in that feature\n\n* Most favorite encoding scheme in Kaggle competition\n\n**Disadvantage:**\n\n* Only work for supervised learning (thus, inherently leaky). This means that when dealing with unsupervised data, it gets worse!\n\n* Need regularization for the previous reason","8db50256":"# 2) Leave One Out Encoding\nThis is very similar to target encoding but excludes the current row\u2019s target when calculating the mean target for a level to reduce the effect of outliers.\n\nAdditionally, you can add some (Gaussian) noise to the data to prevent overfitting. Change the sigma function from 0 to any value between 0 and 1 do the trick.\n","69c87a20":"# 3) Binary Encoding\n\nThis encoding is different from what you think it is\n\nThere are 3 steps:\n* Going down the column, every time it sees a new category, it gives a number, starting from 1 (and the next one is 2)\n* Convert these number into binary\n* Place each digit in this binary in a separate column.\n\nImagine that you have 200 different categories. One hot encoding will create 200 different columns. It the meantime, binary encoding only need 8 columns. (Since 11001000 is 200 in base 2).\n\nIn the code below, I will add the encounter step column so you can see how it works.\n\n**Note**: People sometimes refer hot-encoding as binary encoding"}}
