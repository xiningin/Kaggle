The metropolitan cities are getting busier and hooked up to work so the people prefer ordering food online as they seldom find time to buy groceries and cook food. Start-up\u2019s such as Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo etc. are huge choice of medium for delivering food at their door steps. These start-ups become a medium to deliver food and restaurants becomes the place to prepare food demanded by the consumers. The food delivery is highly prevailing in the metropolitan cities where delivery captains can be seen at a higher rate. These captains receive order request from the buyer and when they accept it the order process begins and end with the food being delivered to the customer. Customers provide rating once the order completed and there are many satisfaction factors that depend on ratings. Customer provide rating post-delivery for the delivery service and another rating post having the meal for the food quality. Customer orders from the same restaurant again if the food quality is good and also from the same service provider if the delivery service is satisfying and thus creating a demand of that restaurant food and delivery service.\n\n## Context of dataset\nThis dataset was collected from the **residents of Bangalore** which studies on factors which are contributing to the demand of food delivery in the city.\n\n\n## Objectives of kernel\n1.
