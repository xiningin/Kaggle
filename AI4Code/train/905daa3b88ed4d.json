They\u2019re built from many decision trees, which makes them easy to use and understand - and you can take advantage of a plethora of interpretability tools and techniques that already exist today.\n\nTF-DF brings this class of models along with a suite of tailored tools to TensorFlow users:\n\nBeginners will find it easier to develop and explain decision forest models. There is no need to explicitly list or pre-process input features (as decision forests can naturally handle numeric and categorical attributes), specify an architecture (for example, by trying different combinations of layers like you would in a neural network), or worry about models diverging. Once your model is trained, you can plot it directly or analyse it with easy to interpret statistics.\nAdvanced users will benefit from models with very fast inference time (sub-microseconds per example in many cases). And, this library offers a great deal of composability for model experimentation and research. In particular, it is easy to combine neural networks and decision forests.\nIf you\u2019re already using decision forests outside of TensorFlow, here\u2019s a little of what TF-DF offers:\n\nIt provides a slew of state-of-the-art Decision Forest training and serving algorithms such as random forests, gradient-boosted trees, CART, (Lambda)MART, DART, Extra Trees, greedy global growth, oblique trees, one-side-sampling, categorical-set learning, random categorical learning, out-of-bag evaluation and feature importance, and structural feature importance.\nThis library can serve as a bridge to the rich TensorFlow ecosystem by making it easier for you to integrate tree-based models with various TensorFlow tools, libraries, and platforms such as TFX.\nAnd for users new to neural networks, you can use decision forests as an easy way to get started with TensorFlow, and continue to explore neural networks from there.\n","a6cd4cd6":"# **<span style=\"color:#e76f51;\">References<\/span>**\n\nhttps:\/\/blog.tensorflow.org\/2021\/05\/introducing-tensorflow-decision-forests.html\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/subinium\/tps-oct-simple-eda\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/craigmthomas\/tps-oct-2021-eda\n\n","a0d4eb24":"# **<span style=\"color:#e76f51;\">Distribution of features Vs Target<\/span>**","8efd872c":"# Work in progress \ud83d\udea7","97e8e323":"# **<span style=\"color:#e76f51;\">Target Variable Distribution<\/span>**","ded21bef":"# **<span style=\"color:#e76f51;\">Basic Statistics of Features<\/span>**","95412f1c":"# **<span style=\"color:#e76f51;\">Target Class Balance<\/span>**"}}
