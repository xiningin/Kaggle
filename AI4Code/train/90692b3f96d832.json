It looks like lot of difference in price existed across market. For intraday trade we can exploit arbitrage opportunity. **We need to initiate a position (buy at the exchange, where the value is lower. And sell at the exchange where the value is higher) when the price difference is maximum. And cover the position (sell the same where you bought and buy where you sold) when the price difference is minimum i.e. ideally zero.**\nIt seems such opportunities exists. The threshold needs to be fixed as per brokerage and other charges. Will do everything quantitatively later."}}
