The shape of the scatter in all of the above plots is linear, which means that there is a strong correlation (more than 0.5) between the variables in question.\n2. To be precise, we can say that the magnitude of correlation between \"maths score\" and \"reading score\" and \"maths score\" and \"writing score\" is more than 0.8 (we'll check that furthur).\n3. Looks like there is a much stronger correlation between the \"reading score\" and \"writing score\" of students, may be more than 0.9.","7e959db6":"***Our values is equal to that of the correlation matrix so next time we can directly plot the correlation matrix, that would save our labour***","868c687e":"# 4.

If one has good reading and writing skills, he\/she gradually improves his\/her performance in maths as well.\n3. More so, reading and writing go hand in hand.\n4. If the same teacher checked the reading and writing exams, must be impressed with the one scoring more in either subject and ended up awarding similar grades in the other. The opposite in the case of low scoring students.\n5. So on...","604c13d5":"***Why do we use this method?***\n\n1. Used to find the magnitude\/strength of the correlation between variables.\n2. More accurate than that of scatter plot.\n\n***Why is it better than scatter plot?***\n\n1. Scatter plots are difficult to interpret.\n2. If there is a lot of data, there is a higher probability of more than one scatter overlapping each other.\n3. This makes the scatter plot difficult to plot as well for we would have to take care of its shortcomings, while on the other hand finding the correlation using a short and efficient algorithm is quite easy\n\n***Why use Pearson's correlation?***\n\n1. Because the relation between all of the variables is linear and Pearson's correlation works well with linear correlations.\n2. Were the relations non linear, we would have used ****\"Spearman's Rank Correlation\"**** .","a61a0ba6":"***Why scatter plot?***\n\n1. The most easiest and visible way of studying the correlation between 2 variables.\n2. One can easily guess the magnitude of correlation by just looking at the shape of the scatter plot"}}
