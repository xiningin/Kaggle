Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account.

The general idea is to count the number of times instances of class A are classified as class B. For example, to know the number of times the classifier confused images of 5s with 3s, you would look in the 5th row and 3rd column of the confusion matrix.\n\n![](https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-EvSXDotTOwc\/XMfeOGZ-CVI\/AAAAAAAAEiE\/oePFfvhfOQM11dgRn9FkPxlegCXbgOF4QCLcBGAs\/s1600\/confusionMatrxiUpdated.jpg)     \n\n\n    **[Scikit-Learn user guide for Confusion Matrix](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html)**","37e35b5b":"<h1  style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\">Area under the ROC curve<\/h1><a id = \"6\" ><\/a>\n\n\n- **[Area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/roc-curves-and-precision-recall-curves-for-classification-in-python\/)** : AUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. By analogy, the Higher the AUC, the better the model is at distinguishing between patients with the disease and no disease.\n\n     **[Scikit-learn user guide for AUC under the ROC curve](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html)**\n     \n ![](https:\/\/glassboxmedicine.files.wordpress.com\/2019\/02\/roc-curve-v2.png?w=576)","10afa631":"Let's see how we can implement mirco-averaged precision using sklearn\n\n**[Scikit-learn user guide for Precision ](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.precision_score)**","9012004e":"Let's see how we can implement micro-averaged F1 score using sklearn\n\n**[Scikit-learn user guide for F1 score](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)**","28e78d57":"Let's Create functions to compute True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives and False Negatives","c9b088ab":"**Approch To compute precision of multi class classification problem**\n\nThere are two different ways to calculate this which might get confusing from time to time.
