So for example the single unit recorded on 10\/1\/2018 (2nd column in table above) had on average  $1.5^2$ spikes in response to this image. The ability of your algorithm to predict the responses to images 0-49 will determine your performance in the competition.\n\n### Creating a simple model\nTo get you started and help you understand how to submit your results I will make a simple model below and submit its results. My hypothesis will be that all neurons are generally responding to the average color in the image. So I will take each image calculate the total amount of red, green, and blue then find the coefficients that best predict the respons of the neuron on the basis these three features. Quantitatively my hypothesis will be that the number of spikes is a linear combination of the amount of red green and blue in an image.\n","ad043987":"So this is a DataArray of of all the spike data on the top line it list of the data dimensions and the number of items along that dimension. So there are 551 stimuli, up to 17 trials, 18 units, 800 discrete time points (each is a milisecond). In the coordinate listed below the top line the dimensions with  a * are primary dimensions (meaning you use these to index) and without a * are auxillary simply giving a description of the data (iso is the quality of isolation from 0 to 4, and stim_t is the time of the stimuli with respect to the beginning of the experiment).  Now lets look at some spike data:","ce7d613a":"# Intro to spike data and Whats the upper limit on performance?\n\n## Intro\nWe are now providing the raw data from which the data you have been competing on was derived. The raw data consists of every trial an image was shown to a neuron and exactly when the neuron spiked relative to the onset of that stimulus. One advantage to having the original trials is that you can get an estimate of the variability from trial-to-trial which in turn can give you a sense of how much noise vs signal there is in the data, which in turn can help you estimate how well you can perform on predicting a given neurons responses. There might be other advantages to having this finer grained dataset but its up to you to find them at the very least you may find the data interesting! So now I'll give you a tour of this new dataset then see if we can estimate the ceiling on performance. \n\n### Loading spike data\nThe spike data is stored in '.nc' files which are used by the xarray package for loading and saving data. xarray is a great package for exploring data when it is multidimensional e.g. it was largely developed for climate science where data is collected over latitude, longtidude, altitude and many measurements are made at each of those positions e.g. temperature, humidity, etc. This format works well for neural data where the dimensions are time, trials, neurons, stimuli, lets take a look:\n","ee9c6b5f":"So we account for a little over 10% of the variance using a very simple feature for the population recorded from on November 8th. The coefficient on red was 12 so when there was alot of red the cell tended respond the most, coefficient on green was 3 so green was associated with higher responses as well, whereas when blue was present the cell tended to fire very little on average. Can you think of other features you can extract from the image that might better predict responses?\n\n### Example submission\n\nNow lets organize all of our responses for a submission. The submission will be a matrix which has 50 rows for each of the held out respones and a column for each individual recording. \n","f9e3faf4":"### Stimuli\nNow lets look at the stimuli:","e6f886ca":"Just looking at the test a sample of the average RGB values for the images we can see some  have similar amounts of red green and blue (all points near each other) on different. Now lets take the RGB averagevalues from the training images and regress them on spike number.","c72a5a9f":"What would you guess the cell prefers? How would you perform a computation on these images which approximated that intuition? Lets see how well the rgb model does.\n","075529d8":"So this is typical neural data. The time axis is second since the stimulis presentaiton where negative numbers are before and positive after. Each yellow line is the time when a spike arrived blue is when no spike arrived. You can see that the number of spikes increases rapidly after about 0.05 seconds post stimulus, this is the result of a typical neural delay.  One thing to notice is that the number of spikes is clearly different from trial to trial on some only one spike and on others a dozen. Thus any estimate of the expected number of spikes is going to be a noisy estimate. Since you are fitting a noisy estimate it is unlikely for you to be able to capture all the variance but how bad is it? Lets do a simulation!\n\nIt is typicaly to model the number of spikes a neuron emits given a stimulus as Poisson distributed:\n$$Y_i \\sim P(\\lambda_i)$$\nWhere $Y_i$ is the number of spikes in response to the $ith$ of $m$ stimuli and it is Poisson distributed with mean $\\lambda_i$. \nFor a Poisson random variable the mean is equal to the variance: $$E[P(\\lambda_i)] = Var[P(\\lambda_i)] = \\lambda_i$$ which is alot of variability!\nA typical experiment involves showing each of the $m$ stimuli $n$ times then averaging the response to reduce this variability and in addition it is heteroscedastic (different stimuli give responses with different variability):\n$$\\bar{Y}_i = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_j^n Y_{i,j} \\sim \\frac{1}{n} P(n \\lambda_i)$$\nBy performing a square root transformation and invoking the CLT the problem becomes easier. First lets see what happens when we take the square root of our responses:\n$$E[\\sqrt{P(\\lambda)}] \\approx \\sqrt{\\lambda}$$ this is a reasonable approximation\n$$Var[\\sqrt{P(\\lambda)}] \\approx \\frac{1}{4}$$ the variance becomes a known constant\n\nso $$\\bar{Y}_i = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_j^n \\sqrt{Y_{i,j}} \\sim \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_j^n{\\sqrt{P(\\lambda_i)}}$$\n\n$$E[\\bar{Y}_i] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_j^n E[\\sqrt{Y_{i,j}}] \\approx \\sqrt{\\lambda_i}   $$\n$$Var[\\bar{Y}_i] = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_j^n Var[\\sqrt{Y_{i,j}}] \\approx \\frac{1}{4n}   $$\n\nFinally invoking the CLT we approximate the average with normal random variables and have:\n$$\\bar{Y}_i \\sim N(\\sqrt{\\mu_i}, \\frac{1}{4n})$$\nGreat so we are in very friendly terrain a normal random variably with known variance! This is after a fair amount of approximations and assumptions the worst of which I would say is assuming the neurons are poisson distributed as often you will find their variance is higher than their mean. But as a first pass it should give us a sense of which neurons have good SNR and which don't.\n\nSo our simulation plan will be to take the average of the square root of responses then simulate the response to each stimulus as $N(\\bar{Y_i}, \\frac{1}{4n})$ and then with the 'perfect model' $\\bar{Y_i}$ (the true means of our simulated responses) see what a typical r value is to it."}}
