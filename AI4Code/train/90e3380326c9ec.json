The name comes from imagining a gambler at a row of slot machines (sometimes known as \"one-armed bandits\"), who has to decide which machines to play, how many times to play each machine and in which order to play them, and whether to continue with the current machine or try a different machine.[5] The multi-armed bandit problem also falls into the broad category of stochastic scheduling. - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Multi-armed_bandit\n\n* Problem Definition\n* Methods\n * e-greedy\n * Softmax Exploration\n * UCB\n * Thompson Sampling\n* Results\n\nRef: https:\/\/github.com\/marlesson\/MaB-Experiments","c50839ef":"## UCB - Upper Confidence Bound","29e55fd6":"We will create 100 ads with different probabilities of being clicked.
