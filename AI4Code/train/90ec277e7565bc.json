Each variety of wine is tasted by three independent tasters and the final rank assigned is the median rank given by the tasters.\nhttps:\/\/online.stat.psu.edu\/stat508\/lesson\/analysis-wine-quality-data","57f8c76a":"![](https:\/\/wicklowwineco.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/portugal-wine-regions.png)wicklowwineco.ie"}}
