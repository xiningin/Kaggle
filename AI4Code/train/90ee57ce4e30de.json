Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k-1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can then be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once.","0380eabf":"# Table of confusion Matrix","460b907e":"# Getting the arrya of the feature and Target columns","058dd41c":"# Hyperparameter tuning\n\nThe value of k (i.e 7) we selected above was selected by observing the curve of accuracy vs number of neighbors.
