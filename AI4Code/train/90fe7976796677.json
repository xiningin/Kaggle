Emerg Infect Dis. 2002;8(11):1310-1313. doi:10.3201\/eid0811.020291\n\nIS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) has been used to investigate Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission within populations since the early 1990s.\n\nHowever, some strains do not have any IS6110 insertions and thus are zero-band strains and are considered a single IS6110 cluster by exclusion. These zero-band strains are rare in the United States and usually are found in persons from Southeast Asia. Recently, the spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) technique was used to divide some zero-copy IS6110 strains into subclusters that are associated with distinct geographic origins.\n\nSix zero-copy IS6110 isolates were identified from 1996 to 2000. These isolates, negative for IS6110 by RFLP analysis, were from 1,180 Maryland cases.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2738562\/","fef2f0ef":"#BCG Tokyo\n\nIn 1924, Dr. Kiyoshi Shiga introduced a BCG strain to Japan from the Pasteur Institute in France. The strain has been propagated for research purposes, and large-scale production was instituted in 1946-1947. At the National Institute of Health, the 172nd passage of BCG was freeze-dried in 1961, named BCG-Tokyo 172 strain.\n\nIn 1965, the Tokyo strain was registered as an International reference preparation of BCG vaccine by the WHO. In 1967, a multiple puncture method using a plastic cylinder was introduced to Japan, thereafter; the multiple puncture vaccination method replaced intradermal injections in Japan.

Current assay compares the nitrate reductase activity of M. tuberculosis from pulmonary specimens cultivated in nitrate-supplemented media. Fifty-five sputum samples were decontaminated and inoculated in conventional (Middlebrook 7H9, Ogawa Kudoh-OK) and in nitrate-supplemented media (Middlebrook 7H9-N, Ogawa Kudoh-N). An aliquot from the media directly reacted with Griess reagent (7H9-N and OK-N) every five days, or transferred to a nitrate substrate solution (7H9, OK).

THP-1 cell apoptosis in response to Mycobacterial infection. Infect Immun. 2003;71(1):254-259. doi:10.1128\/iai.71.1.254-259.2003\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis infection primes human alveolar macrophages (HAM) for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-mediated apoptosis and that macrophage apoptosis is associated with killing internalized bacilli. \n\nVirulent mycobacterial strains elicit much less apoptosis than attenuated strains, implying that apoptosis is a defense against intracellular infection. It was evaluated the potential for phorbol myristate acetate-differentiated THP-1 cells to mimic this response of primary macrophages. Consistent with the behavior of alveolar macrophages, attenuated M. tuberculosis H37Ra and Mycobacterium bovis BCG strongly induce THP-1 apoptosis, which requires endogenous TNF. \n\nTHP-1 apoptosis is associated with reduced viability of infecting BCG. In contrast, virulent wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis do not increase THP-1 apoptosis over baseline. In contrast, wild-type M. bovis infection failed to activate any caspases in THP-1 cells. \n\nBCG-induced THP-1 apoptosis is blocked by retroviral transduction with vectors expressing crmA but not bcl-2. It was concluded that differentiated THP-1 cells faithfully model the apoptosis response of HAM. Analysis of the THP-1 cell response to infection with virulent mycobacteria suggests that TNF death signals are blocked proximal to initiator caspase activation, at the level of TNF receptor 1 or its associated intracytoplasmic adaptor complex.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC143334\/","814649a7":"![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/77\/BCG_advert.jpg\/640px-BCG_advert.jpg)\nhttps:\/\/www.wikiwand.com\/en\/BCG_vaccine","809d876b":"#Criteria 2: MPB64 Protein\n\nMutations Including IS6110 Insertion in the Gene Encoding the MPB64 Protein of Capilia TB-Negative Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates\n\nHirano K, Aono A, Takahashi M, Abe C.

The niacin test detects niacin (nicotinic acid) in aqueous extracts of a culture. M. tuberculosis strains that test negative for the niacin test are very rare. Redox reactions happening in Mycobacterium species produce niacin as a part of energy metabolism. Even though all mycobacteria produce niacin, M. tuberculosis accumulates an excess of niacin because of its inability to process niacin, excreting the excess niacin into the culture media, thus allowing it to be detected using the niacin test.\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Niacin_test#:~:text=Redox%20reactions%20happening%20in%20Mycobacterium,a%20part%20of%20energy%20metabolism.&text=tuberculosis%20accumulates%20an%20excess%20of,detected%20using%20the%20niacin%20test.","fbf603a7":"#Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin strain differences as the basis for immunotherapies against bladder cancer\n\nAuthors: Jun Miyazaki  Mizuki Onozawa  Eiichiro Takaoka  Ikuya Yano - https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/iju.13538\n\nAnother important and defining characteristic of mycobacteria is their capacity to synthesize long\u2010chain \u03b2\u2010hydroxy, \u03b1\u2010alkyl fatty acids, known as MAs. MAs are long 2\u2010alkyl 3\u2010hydroxyl fatty acids, and in M. bovis, the MAs consist mainly of alpha\u2010, keto\u2010 and methoxy classes.\n\nThe wax\u2010like fatty acids also constitute a major part of the characteristic mycobacterial cell wall component and, due to their hydrophobic nature, protect against chemical damage by host bactericidal agents and antibiotics.\n\nBelley et al. proved the importance of the mmaA3 gene in methoxy\u2010mycolate synthesis by means of experiments using the wild\u2010type mmaA3 gene from M. tuberculosis. Behr et al. reported that an SNP occurred in mmaA3 between 1927 and 1931. As a result, methoxymycolic acid production was lost in the BCG substrains obtained between 1927 and 1931. Hayashi et al. showed that \u201cearly\u2010shared\u201d strains of BCG (Russia, Moreau, Japan, Sweden and Birkhaug), which conserve three types of mycolate (alpha, methoxy and keto) in the cell wall, show stronger activities of nitric oxide induction, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u201012 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 from the human epithelial cell line, A549, and the human myelomonocytic cell line, THP\u20101, than did \u201clate\u2010shared\u201d strains of BCG (Danish, Glaxo, Mexico, TICE, Connaught, Montreal, Phipps, Australia and Pasteur. These results suggest that early\u2010shared strains are more potent immunostimulating agents than late\u2010shared strains, and this difference might be related to the presence or absence of methoxy\u2010mycolate in the strains.https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/iju.13538","71741167":"#Click on the bars to read column \"Unnamed: 49\".

Here,it was systematically investigated the involvement of each individual ESX-1 gene in the secretion of both antigens, specific immunogenicity, and virulence. ESX-1-complemented BCG and M. microti strains were more efficiently engulfed by bone-marrow-derived macrophages than controls, and this may account for the enhanced in vivo growth of ESX-1-carrying strains.\n\nGenes Rv3868, Rv3869, Rv3870, Rv3871, and Rv3877 encoding an ATP-dependent chaperone and translocon were essential for secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 in contrast to ppe68 Rv3873 and Rv3876, whose inactivation did not impair secretion of ESAT-6.\n\nThis study has allowed to identify new aspects of the extRD1 region of M. tuberculosis and to explore its role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1346617","ba4d7c85":"#Microscopic image of the Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin bacillus, Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain, magnification:\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/25\/Mycobacterium_bovis_BCG_ZN.jpg\/440px-Mycobacterium_bovis_BCG_ZN.jpg)https:\/\/www.wikiwand.com\/en\/BCG_vaccine","1212deb4":"#Table: Summary of the results of some studies on the protective efficacy of BCG vaccine, adapted from Milstien et al.\nhttps:\/\/www.ecevr.org\/Synapse\/Data\/PDFData\/9995CEVR\/cevr-2-83.pdf\n![](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Sungweon_Ryoo\/publication\/249648792\/figure\/tbl1\/AS:203142043049987@1425444245201\/Summary-of-the-results-of-some-studies-on-the-protective-efficacy-of-BCG-vaccine-adapted.png)https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/Summary-of-the-results-of-some-studies-on-the-protective-efficacy-of-BCG-vaccine-adapted_tbl1_249648792","0d57f1c1":"Fig. Refined genealogy of BCG vaccines, modified from Liu et al.
