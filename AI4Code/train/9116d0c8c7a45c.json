The current version provides functionalities to automatically search for hyperparameters during the deep learning process. Auto-Keras tends to simplify the ML process through the use of automated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms. Neural Architecture Search essentially replaces the deep learning engineer\/practitioner with a set of algorithms that automatically tunes the model.\n\n\n#### For deep learning, for now you have the ImageClassifier, the BayesianSearcher, a Graph module, a PreProcessor, a LayerTransformer, a NetTransformer, a ClassifierGenerator and some utilities. This is an evolving package.\n\n\n#### For tabular dataset, keras has a method called StructuredDataClassifier which is what we will use. Keras also has Automodel that combines multiple inputs. So in simple words, StructuredDataClassifier, TextClassifiers etc. are all TaskAPIs. \n\nWhen doing a classical task such as image classification\/regression, text classification\/regression, ..., you can use the simplest APIs provided by autokeras called Task API: ImageClassifier, ImageRegressor, TextClassifier, TextRegressor, ... In this case you have one input (image or text or tabular data, ...) and one output (classification, regression). \n\nAutomodel, however when you are in a situation where you have for example a task that requires multi inputs\/outputs architecture, then you cannot use directly Task API, and this is where Automodel comes into play with the I\/O API. \n\nGraphAutomodel works like keras functional API. It assembles different blocks (Convolutions, LSTM, GRU, ...) and create a model using this block, then it will look for the best hyperparameters given this architecture you provided. \n    \n\nKeras AUTOMODEL is mainly used for Multi-Modal and Multi-Task. \n\nMulti-model data means each data instance has multiple forms of information. For example, a photo can be saved as a image. Besides the image, it may also have when and where it was taken as its attributes, which can be represented as structured data.\n\nMulti-task here we refer to we want to predict multiple targets with the same input features. For example, we not only want to classify an image according to its content, but we also want to regress its quality as a float number between 0 and 1.\n\n    \n#### Now, lets do the modeling using StructuredDataClassifier","f7cf4ea6":"The above method saves the feature importance, drift variables coefficients and the final predictions into a separate folder named \u2018save\u2019.","2299191c":"#### Now lets check the performance in our test set","70da0121":"### Customized Search Space\n\nFor advanced users, you may customize your search space by using AutoModel instead of StructuredDataClassifier. \n\nYou can configure the StructuredDataBlock for some high-level configurations, e.g., categorical_encoding for whether to use the CategoricalToNumerical. You can also do not specify these arguments, which would leave the different choices to be tuned automatically and that is the major difference between using a StructuredDataClassifier and AutoModel.","012eeee0":"<a id=\"tpo\"><\/a>\n\n\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/450\/0*dCD9QwVjhVnKKz6U.jpg)\n\n\n### TPOT(Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool)\n\n\nTPOT is a tree-based pipeline optimization tool that uses genetic algorithms to optimize machine learning pipelines. TPOT is built on top of scikit-learn and uses its own regressor and classifier methods. TPOT explore thousands of possible pipelines and finds the one that best fit the data.\n\nTPOT cannot automatically process natural language inputs. Additionally, it\u2019s also not able to processes categorical strings, which must be integer-encoded before being passed in as data.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dyd911kmh\/image\/upload\/f_auto,q_auto:best\/v1537396029\/output_2_0_d7uh0v.png)\n\n\n#### SOURCE - DATACAMP","30dad432":"### You can also tell TPOT to export the corresponding Python code for the optimized pipeline to a text file with the export function and I personally think this is an amazing feature:","c024291a":"### Let us begin to look at the various frameworks, along with code.","0f20885b":"In the above, 5 generations were computed, each giving the training efficiency of the fitting model on the training set. \n\nAs evident, the best pipeline is the one that has the CV accuracy score of 74%.

Two components are added to Bayesian hyperparameter optimization of an ML framework: meta-learning for initializing the Bayesian optimizer and automated ensemble construction from configurations evaluated during optimization. It performs well on small and medium-sized datasets, but it cannot be applied to modern deep learning systems that yield state-of-the-art performance on large datasets.\n\n\n### Lets build a model now.\n\n\n### Here are the main features of the API. You can:\n\n    - Set time and memory limits\n    - Restrict the searchspace by selecting or excluding some preprocessing methods or some estimators\n    - Specify some resampling strategies (e.g. 5-fold cv)\n    - Perform some parallel computation with the SMAC algorithm (sequential model-based algorithm configuration) that stores some data on a shared file system\n    - Save your model as you would do with scikit-learn (pickle)","896eb453":"#### We already have our train and test sets, so we just need to choose our response variable, as well as the predictors.

Running TPOT isn\u2019t as simple as fitting one model on the dataset. It is considering multiple machine learning algorithms (random forests, linear models, SVMs, etc.) in a pipeline with numerous preprocessing steps (missing value imputation, scaling, PCA, feature selection, etc.), the hyper-parameters for all of the models and preprocessing steps, as well as multiple ways to ensemble or stack the algorithms within the pipeline. That\u2019s why it usually takes a long time to execute and isn\u2019t feasible for large datasets.\n\n    TPOT can recommend different solutions for the same dataset. If you're working with a reasonably complex dataset or run TPOT for a short amount of time, different TPOT runs may result in different pipeline recommendations. When two TPOT runs recommend different pipelines, this means that the TPOT runs didn't converge due to lack of time or that multiple pipelines perform more-or-less the same on your dataset.","93c9c311":"### The Reason for this notebook was to check the various Automl frameworks that are widely used and also try them Hands-on.

It is what you feed to it, is returned and hence the process before the modeling is something that cant be replaced.

AutoML essentially focuses on two major aspects \u2014 data acquisition\/collection and prediction. All the other steps that take place in between can be easily automated while delivering a model that\u2019s optimized well and ready to make predictions.\n\nThe success of machine learning in a wide range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts\u00b9. AutoML tends to automate the maximum number of steps in an ML pipeline\u2014with a minimum amount of human effort and without compromising the model\u2019s performance.\n\n\n### Advantages\n\n#### The advantages of AutoML can be summed up in three major points:\n\n    - Increases productivity by automating repetitive tasks. This enables a data scientist to focus more on the problem rather than the models.\n\n    - Automating the ML pipeline also helps to avoid errors that might creep in manually.\n\n    - Ultimately, AutoML is a step towards democratizing machine learning by making the power of ML accessible to everybody.","75c3cbef":"### Pros:\n\n    - Easy to get started if you know sklearn\n    \n    - Has parameters\/hyper parameters similar to SKLEARN API, so a quick baseline shouldn't take time.\n    \n    - Support Model Persistence and Parallel Computation\n    \n    \n### Cons:\n\n    - Installation of the package is not straight forward and has lots of dependencies, be it in kaggle or outside.\n    \n    - Not as explanatory in terms of the results and doesn't have plenty of options that other tools have. \n    \n    - Takes a lot of time to return the results.
