Modelling county as a fixed effect\n\nOne way to incorporate the impact of county is to bring the county in to our equation for the linear model by treating it as a fixed effect. This would look like: \n\n$$\ntime_{c_{i}} = b_{0} + b_{1}age + c_i\n$$\n\ni.e. each county has it's own additional term that wil change the intercept. To model this we will need to alter our dataframe to encode our counties as numeric variables. So we will use **one-hot encoding**, where we will make a new column for each county:","16cd561c":"##### Simple Linear Regression\n\nWe will start with the most familiar linear regression, a straight-line fit to data.\nA straight-line fit is a model of the form\n\n$$\ny = b_0 + b_1x \n$$\n\nwhere $b_1$ is commonly known as the *gradient*, and $b_0$ is commonly known as the *intercept*. So for our dataset, `y` would be the bounce time, `x` their age, `b_1` the rate of change of the bounce time with respect to `age` and `b_0` the intercept when `age` is 0.\n\n$$\ntime = b_0 + b_1age\n$$","b429440b":"Ah... clearly there is substantial grouping - us Londoners seem to have short attention spans (maybe...).

Well maybe we could do a separate regression for each county.\n\n---","484205a9":"---\n\n### 5. Wrap Up\n\nWell done for getting this far!

If we did we would have to to estimate a slope and intercept parameter for each regression. That\u2019s two parameters, three locations and eight counties, which means 48 parameter estimates (2 x 3 x 8 = 48). \n\nAlso we would now be taking our nice dataset of 480 observations, that presumably took a long time to collect, and effectively reducing it to lots of sample sizes of 20. This really decreases our statistical power, and thus also increases our chances of a Type I Error (where you falsely reject the null hypothesis) by carrying out multiple comparisons.\n\nSo what could we do? Well we could modify the model to account for the different counties, and add it to our linear model.","1b9fbcef":"But what model have we actually fitted here? Is it what we wanted to investigate initially? The  model is estimating the difference in bounce times between the counties now as well, and we aren't actually interested in that. If you were then this is correct to do so, but the website company just wanted to know whether age affects the bounce times. And by including county in we are obscuring this. So to look at the impact of age on bounce times we need to control for the variation between the different counties (as well as between the locations). So to do that, we have to treat our counties as **random effects**, and build a **mixed effect model**!\n\nHurray for getting here! \n\n![](https:\/\/memegenerator.net\/img\/instances\/57364565\/hurray-time-to-close-your-laptops.jpg)","f6c0b525":"Huh, that's strange - it's very similar.

All we have done is say in the last one that the county has a randome intercept, but the same slope. This is very similar to the fixed effect approach, where county was included as a term that would impact the intercept. All we have changed is sayng that the intercepts for each county are probably drawn from a similar distribution. To ensure that each county has its own random slope we need to include this in our random effects forumla, like so:","d7ab3d31":"We can have a look at these parameters within the model object, with the relevant parameters being ``coef_`` and ``intercept_``:","08827913":"This scaling won't impact the statistical findings in our example but you may find in more complex models than the one in this tutorial this can be very helpful in speeding up your models fitting.

Hmmm, it's tricky and there are lots of answers out there. In brief, we view fixed effects as the variables that we are interested in. We wanted to know about age so we recorded data on that and wanted to see how it impacted the response variable. County was not we were interested in, but we recorded it as we were aware that our sampling methodology could lead to clustering in our data that could invalidate the linear model from before. If we hadn't recorded that someone who was given this dataset to analyse may have incorrectly said that  age was an important predictor of bounce rate.\n\nRandom effects are often our groups we are trying to control for, like county in our example. In particualr twe control for counties when we have not exhausted all the available groups - we only had 8 counties in England. If we wanted to make predicitons about the counties, then we would have tried to sample them better firstly, and also treat them as a fixed effect. \n\nFurther reading for those who want a better answer!:\n\nhttps:\/\/dynamicecology.wordpress.com\/2015\/11\/04\/is-it-a-fixed-or-random-effect\/\n\nAnd see the discussion in the paper linked in the take home challenge 3. ","a97fea7c":"## Mixed models","d2e0fb84":"In this summary of the model, we can clearly see that the `age_scaled` is having a more noticable impact than in the fixed model earlier (coefficient of 0.136 rather than 0.048), however, importantly it is still not significantly different to 0, with the 95% interval for this coefficient spanning -1.065 - 1.336.\n\nAnd let's look at the predictions.","587f1a77":"### 1. Interacting with the data","fa47ae25":"---\n\n### 2. Linear Regression","bab745f3":"\n### 4. Mixed effects models\n\nAs we have discussed above, a mixed effects model is ideal here as it will allow us to both use all the data we have (higher sample size) and better acknowledge the correlations between data coming from the counties and locations. We will also estimate fewer parameters and avoid problems with multiple comparisons that we would encounter while using separate regressions.\n\nSo in this model we treat our `age`, which is what we are interested in, as a **fixed effect**, and `county` and `location` as a **random effect**.\n\nBut what does that mean? Well it's sort of a middle ground here between assuming our coefficient for the gradient and intercept are all the same (what we did in the first regression) and assuming they are all independent and different. If we look back at our equations, we now may assume that while $b_0$ and $b_1$ are different for each county, the coefficients all come from a common group distribution, such as a normal distribution:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ntime_c = b_{c0} + b_{c1}.age  \\\\ \\\\\nb_{c0} \\sim N(\\mu_{b_0}, \\sigma^2_{b_0}) \\\\\nb_{c1} \\sim N(\\mu_{b_1}, \\sigma^2_{b_1})\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSo we now assume the intercepts $b_0$ and gradients $b_1$  come from a normal distribution centered around their respective group mean $\\mu$ with a certain standard deviation $\\sigma^2$, the values of which we also estimate.","7b8ee9e5":"So from this we would say quite confidently that as age increases so does the bounce time. (To test if this increase is significant see the take home challenge 1.)\n\nHowever, to run a linear regression a number of assumptions about the data need to be met. One of these is that the residuals are **homoscedastic**, which means that the residuals are normally distributed in relation to the predicted value, i.e. are our predictions equally bad (or good) across our predicted values. We can look at this by plotting the residuals, using my new favourite package yellowbrick:\n","6186fc7e":"Before we carry on it is often a good idea to **scale** our independent (explanatory) variables so that they are **standardised**.

Add in locations for the mixed effect model\n\nIn section 4 we constructed our mixed effect model, treating county as a random effect. However, what about location? This will really improve our predictions.\n\n**Hint: You will need to create a new variable that considers how the random effects are nested. For example there is nothing important about the locations a, b, and c that link location a in London with that in Essex. Therefore explicitly nest them**","0e231c0b":"The first thing we might want to do to see if the bounce time is dependent on the age is to plot this data, and then fit a linear regression to the data:","2ea1b4ed":".. just kidding ...\n\nbut you have now covered loads of material and can now have a go at using a mixed effect model. \n\n---","34a7e5b7":"Okay, so perhaps its not ideal...\n\nLet's check some of the other assumptions. For a good list of the assumptions (with code in R), have a look here http:\/\/r-statistics.co\/Assumptions-of-Linear-Regression.html. \n\nOne of the other key assumption is that the observations of our data are independent of the other data. When we collected our data we were doing it in 8 different counties and in 3 locations within each county. So we could check this by comparing the bounce times for each county. To do this let's use one of the categorical plots in seaborn:","fbf667d6":"### Dataset\n\nToday we will be using a dataset that looks at the bounce rates of users of a website with cooking recipes. A bounce rate is a measure of how quickly someone leaves a website, e.g. the number of seconds after which a user first accesses a webpage from the website and then leaves. Most websites want individuals to stay on their websites for a long time as they are more likely to read another article, buy one of their products, click on some of the sponsored links etc. As such, it can be useful to understand why some users leave the website quicker than others. \n\nTo investigate the bounce rate of the website, we chose three locations in 8 counties in England, and got members of the public of all ages to undertake a survey\/test questionaire. In the test we asked them to use our search engine to query for something they want to eat this evening. The search engine listed our website first, as well as other websites that would be returned. The users that clicked on our website were then timed and their bounce time recorded. We also recorded their age, and made a note of the county and location.\n\nWe have been asked by the website to work out if younger individuals are more likely to leave the website quicker.","5e617b5c":"... or if you fancy there is some more material for those interested."}}
