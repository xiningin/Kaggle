Action is also amongst the top ones, which is expected. Later on we will try to find if there is a good difference between the genres available on each catalog.","9cd01611":"# Inferences\n\nWe've obtained some interesting inferences from this dataset. Here's a summary of them:\n\n* **Quantity of Movies**: Prime Video is by far the service with more movies and tv shows, followed by Netflix. Netflix, Hulu and Disney+ together still don't reach half the quantity of movies available on Prime Video.\n* **Recent Titles**: Prime Video is also the catalog with the biggest quantity of recent movies (10 years old or less). But this represents only 50% of its catalog. On the other hand, Netflix and Hulu have a much bigger percentage of their catalogs composed by recent movies - 82% and 67% respectively. And Disney+ has surprisingly only 36%! Which means their movie catalog is currently mostly of classics.\n* **Genres**: Hulu, Netflix and PrimeVideo have very similar quantities for the top genres, with Drama, Comedy and Thriller being the top three ones. Disney+ has a different catalog, with Family, Adventure, Fantasy, Animation and Musical being the most predomintant genres. \n* **Age**: Adult movies (18+) is the biggest part of the Netflix, Prime Video and Hulu catalogs, although they also offer a good quantity of movies for children and teenagers. Disney+, focuses primarily on movies for the whole family and children. It is safe to say that more than 90% of its catalog can be watched by children.\n* **Old Movies**: Prime Video has really focused on the classics! That helps to explains why it has such a huge catalog when compared to the other services. About 2K of the total catalog is from movies prior to 1980.\n* **Movie Ratings**: Hulu has the best mean ratings for both IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.  All platforms offer a good quantity of well rated movies in their catalog. However, the Prime Video ratings mean is much lower compared to the other platforms. We can conclude that the overall quality os the Hulu and Netflix catalogs are much better. Having more movies and series does not mean having the best catalog.\n\n# Conclusions:\n\nWhat can help me decide between a specific platform?\n\n* If you are interested on having a **huge catalog** Prime Video is definitely a good choice. Netflix comes second and is also a good choice - both have a big catalog!\n* For watching **recent movies and tv shows** (last decade), Netflix is a great option - those compose 81% of its catalog. Hulu also has a good percentage of 67%.\n* If you are interested in movies for **Adult**s, and genres such as Dramas, Comedies and Thriller, Netflix , Hulu  and Prime Video are all good options. \n* Disney+ is defintely a great choice for **family friendly** movies and genres such as fantasy and adventure.\n* Prime Video seems to be the best platform for watching very **old movies** (40 years old or more) since it offers about 2K movies prior to 1980.\n* Hulu has a smaller catalog, but it comes first on the ratings mean. If you are interested in having a **small catalog with good quality stuff**, Hulu may be the best choice. Disney+ also has a small catalog while keeping a good overall quality. Its catalog should increase during the next years since it is a new service. Netflix is a good middle term between having a big catalog x quality. Prime Video comes last on ratings, a consequence of having such a huge catalog.","f2bba457":"## 2.

We can also find something interesting by getting the mean of Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each:","c18fad0a":"# Asking and Answering Questions\n\nWe've already gained several insights about the available movies exploring individual columns of the dataset. Let's ask some specific questions in order to get more useful insights from this data. \n\nLet's obtain the following details:\n\n1. Biggest number of movies and tv shows\n2. More recent movies and tv shows\n3. Most popular movie genres in each catalog\n4. Better suited for for children or adults\n5. The best for old movies and tv shows\n6. Best IMDb \/ Rotten Tomatoes ratings","1c21c3b5":"Now there are no longer empty values in the columns Age, IMDb and Language. We are good to go.","11541d79":"In recent years the number of online streaming platforms available has increased a lot!\n\nNetflix, Disney+, Prime Video, hulu... what if I don't want to pay for all of them at the same time? How can I choose which service is best for me? Let's try to answer these questions.","e97e20f7":"Using the describe method to check the min\/max values for all numeric columns and see if there is anything wrong.","a7ceaa90":"![platforms.jpeg](attachment:platforms.jpeg)","2d5b38cf":"## 1. Biggest number of movies and tv shows","38764fbe":"The number of recent movies follows the same pattern of the previous graph - the services with more titles are also the ones with more recent titles, with Prime Video in first place by far. However, the difference between Prime Video and Netflix has decreased a lot compared to the first graph. \n\nLet's see the percentages below:","157df3f0":"Note: Custer's Last Stand and The Vatican Museums didn't need to be corrected. These two are really long! \n\nDescribing the data again. Everything looks fine now:","f6b4a2a0":"### Which languages are mostly represented in the streaming service of our dataset?","c8aae8b5":"### Language\n\nOne last change: since we are interested in working with the Language column, let's also replace the Nan values with \"Unknown\"","33a5ef08":"## 4. Better suited for for children or adults\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the age classification. Are you interested is movies created for Adults? Or do you have a big family with children using the service? Let's compare the age classification for each platform to see if we can find any interesting patterns.","37fbbb98":"Hulu, Netflix and PrimeVideo have very similar quantities for the top genres, with Drama, Comedy and Thriller being the top three. Romance, Action and Documentary comes right below with small differences between each platform. \n\nThe notable difference here is definitely Disney+. The Family genre does not even show up on the top ten list for PrimeVideo, and it is on the 9th position for both Netflix and Hulu. In contrast, Family is number one in the Disney+ catalog. A similar thing happens with other genres like Adventure, Fantasy, Animation and Musical - those genres are more predominant on the Disney+ catalog. It is important to remember, though, that the quantity of movies (x) is much higher in Prime Video and Netflix. However, as we will discuss on question 6, having a bigger catalog may also reduce the overall quality of movies offered under the mentioned genres. ","667876b3":"## 6. Best IMDb \/ Rotten Tomatoes ratings\n\nSince Prime video has a huge difference of available movies when compared with other platforms, just comparing the quantities may not provide us with a good overview.
