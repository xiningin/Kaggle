Printing Variables\nLet's create our first variable! A variable holds a value of any type, be it an Int, String, Float or others. We use the = sign to assign a value to a variable.\n\n1. Create a Variable named myString and assign it the value \"This is the value\"\n2. Create a Variable named myInt and assign it the value 23 \n3. Print your variables\n4. Create a new variable myOtherInt and assign it the value of myInt, print myOtherInt\n5. Change the values and print again","08e5f5c8":"## Exercise 1 - Putting it all together\n\n1. Add code to the following cell to swap variables `a` and `b` (so that `a` refers to the value previously referred to by `b` and vice versa).\n2. Position your print statements so that you print `a` and `b` before AND after the swap.\n\nHINT: You need 3 variables and 2 print statements to complete this task","bd4c86ee":"# Cafe 2 - Types and Variables ","08ee1333":"## 1. Printing Types\nPython comes with different types in order to do different things.\n\nA string is always between the \"\" quotations marks such as \"Hello World\", an Int is a number without a decimal you can do calculations with such as 2, and a Float is a number with a decimal you can do a calculations with such as 2.0 and 2.2. There are more types in python, but let's focus on these 3 for now.\n\nA Reminder of Python Types: \n\n| Name           | Type   | Description                                                  |\n|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Integer        | Int    |Whole numbers: 45, -5, 670                                    |\n| Float          | Float  |Numbers with a decimal point: 2.3, 4.6, 100.0                 |\n| String         | Str    |Ordered sequence of characters: \u201cSammy\u201d, \u201cHello\u201d, \u201c2000\"      |\n| List           | List   |Ordered sequence of objects: [10, \u201chello\u201d, 200.5]             |\n| Dictionarie    | Dict   |Unordered Key\/value pairs: {\u201ckey\u201d: \u201cvalue\u201d, \u201cname\u201d: \u201cFrankie\u201d}|\n| Tuple          | Tup    |Ordered immutable sequence of objects: (10, \u201chello\u201d, 200.5)   |\n| Set            | Set    |Unordered collection of unique objects: {\u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d}            |\n| Boolean        | Bool   |Logical value (True or False)                                 |\n\n<span style=\"display:none\"><\/span>\n#### Right now we will only focus on Integer, Float, and String\nTODO:\n1.
