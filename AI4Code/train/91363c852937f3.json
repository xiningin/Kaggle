This makes sense for any categorical feature when there isn't really any order to the categories. In the case of instlevel, though, each category is related to other categories in an orderly fashion. If we remap these to values that capture the scale, we'll be able to reduce the dimensionality of our models as well as pass it more information. \n\nFor now, we'll use a linear scaling, though I could also see an argument that exponential growth could be more accurate in the case of instlevel.

We should probably only include one of these, maybe two, but definitely not all three.\n\ninstlevel and escolari mins and sums are highly correlated.\n\n`area1` and `area2` are 100% inversely correlated, so we should only include one of them.\n\n`public` and `coopele` aren't as inversely correlated, but still highly correlated, so we shoud only include one of those.\n\n`r4t3`, `tamhog`, `hhsize`, and `hogar_total` are also all highly correlated and seem to all be about total household size. We should just include one of them.","b825eaaa":"Aside from the IDs of the individual and household, there are really three columns, each that look to have a mix between numbers and yes, nos. According the data descriptions:\n\n> dependency, Dependency rate, calculated = (number of members of the household younger than 19 or older than 64)\/(number of member of household between 19 and 64)\n\n> edjefe, years of education of male head of household, based on the interaction of escolari (years of education), head of household and gender, yes=1 and no=0\n\n> edjefa, years of education of female head of household, based on the interaction of escolari (years of education), head of household and gender, yes=1 and no=0\n\nIt seems like for `edjefe` and `edjefa` they added \"no\" for anyone who had 0 years of education and \"yes\" for anyone with 1. We can easily transform those back to numeric columns. I am a little suspicious of why they would do the latter and would want to validate with the stakeholders that they didn't transform anyone with more than 1 years of education into a \"yes\". For now, we'll respect the data definition.\n\nDependency is a rate, though and doesn't list this rule. Luckily, I found in the discussion that this is a general rule and can be applied to the `dependency` field as well:\n\n> yes it is a general rule we applied to the database. In these three cases (edjefe, edjefa, dependency), when converting formats the variables were not delabeled for some reason. In the database yes is always 1 and no is always 0.","9fd69b6e":"### v18q1\n\nNext, let's look at **v18q1**. The description for this field is \"number of tablets household owns\". There's also a field `v18q`, which represents if the individual \"owns a tablet\".  Theoretically, `v18q1` would be a derivative field summing the `v18q` for the individuals in the household. It's possible a blank `v18q1` could  represent households without a tablet. Let's see if we can confirm these before plowing forward.","488f6e36":"For the remaining 350 individuals between 7 and 19, we'll begin by simply imputing their values as part of our data preprocessing pipeline step. If needed, we might look further into this and see if can make a more meanginful inference from other data. For now, though, we'll spend the time on getting a working model and just use a basic imputer.\n\nI see in the IDB response that this should be capped at 5. We should check to see that everyone is capped correctly or evaluate whether this matters.","cb08e0b2":"# Common Libraries","5ceecd57":"Wrong! We can immediately see that the hypothesis that v18q1, the \"number of tablets household owns\" is *not* the sum of `v18q` for each individual in the household. Household 28ec0c747 lists 2 for `v18q1`, but a 1 for each of the 6 individual's `v18q`.\n\nI'm now realizing that `v18q` is probably a boolean field indicating whether the household for that individual owns a tablet, similar to many of the other fields in the dataset. We can check.","bf454840":"## Attributes with NaNs","d250e121":"We've addressed all of the columns with a lot of missing values. We will address the remaining missing values by imputing them as part of our preprocessing pipeline. And the other two attributes are so small that we can either impute them as well or drop those rows. For later tuning, we may want to look at them further to see if we can make some smart decisions about what they should be. For now, I think we've successfully built some transformer to handle NaN values. Next up, let's handle text and categorical attributes.","446841a2":"We can see that there a few weakly correlated attributes with the target variabe, `Target`. That's good news, otherwise we'd have a tough time training a model worth anything. \n\nOne other thing I notice here is that the squared eqivalent attributes, e.g. `SQBescolari` to `escolari` seem to have a lower correlation to the un-squared attribute. We might want to omit the squared variables.\n\n`meaneduc`, average years of education for adults (18+), and `hogar_nin`, Number of children 0 to 19 in household, are the most correlated attributes, so we should pay extra attention to those two concepts.","2ca5880d":"Okay, first things we notice is that we have 9,557 rows in our training set and 23,856 in our test set. Each row represents an individual and the household they correspond it is indicated by their `idhogar` value. According to the business objective, we are only interested in classifying households, the `Target` should be the same for every individual in a household. Let's see how many households are in each set.","d3a51b91":"# Submit","aee50725":"# Import Data","80a11ab6":"We can see that most of the individuals who have a missing `v2a1` have a 1 for `tipovivi1`. Looking at the data definitions, this indicates individuals who \"own and fully paid house\". This corresponds to one of the hypotheses we had for why `v2a1` could be legitimately be blank. For these, we should fill with 0s.\n\nWhat about the others with a missing `v2a1`? A few have a 1 for `tipovivi4` and the rest have a 1 for `tipovivi5`. These represent \"precarious\" and \"other(assigned,  borrowed)\", respectively. I'm not sure exactly what precarious refers to, but `tipovivi5`, homes that are assigned or borrowed probably can also be assigned a 0 value for `v2a1`. Since `tipovivi4` represents such a small percentage of this set, we could choose to impute those values or set them to 0 as well. As a first round, we're going to leave them as blank and impute them as part of our preprocessing pipeline, but should flag this as something we might want to revisit as we try to squeeze more performance from our models. We should probably do some research to find out if that is a common designation for housing. ","4643d47e":"Good news is that for most features, there aren't a lot of missing values. Let's figure out how best to handle each of these.\n\n### rez_esc\n\nFirst, `rez_esc`. The description of this field is \"Years behind in school\".  Let's take a look to see if we can figure out why there are so many empty values here. My intuition is that it has something to do with whether the individual is in school or not. For example, a two year old can't really be \"behind in school\". Nor can a graduate. We'll also check to see if there's been any discussion for how this field was created by IDB.","39ecd294":"So what to do about `tamviv` and `r4t3`. The correlation isn't high enough to hit our 95% threshold in our automatic correlation detection above, but there's still high correlation. It seems as if when there are more people living in the household than are currently part of the household?\n\nIt's hard to say exaclty what's going on here and what the difference is, if there is a legitimate one, without talking to the stakeholders, but I think the best thing to do is merge the two columns together taking the max between the two into a new column. We'll create a new attribute `tamviv_r4t3_combined` and experiment with how it performs leaving only it in vs. all three. Worst case, we'll end up dropping it if the models don't use it.","8fc7ae5c":"## Aggregating Individual Features to Household Features\n\nSince the primary business objective is concerned with households, we're going to be training our model just on households. It would be a shame to lose all of the information embedded in all of the individual attributes. To address this, let's add some features that aggregate the individual attributes to the household level by applying a few different statistics","0ca8a8d7":"Almost 2.5 times the number of households in the test set. This means we should be very cautious to make sure that our model doesn't overfit the training set because if we do, we'll likely score pretty poorly on the test submission.\n\nLet's take a look at the label distirbution both for individuals and household.","ede47e91":"Yep, I feel comfortable now creating a transformer to set those 0s. And, moreover, we might want to consider excluding `v18q` from the final features used in the models, since it's redundant with `v18q1`\u20140 for `v18q1` is equivalent with 0 `v18q` and anything else is equivalent to 1 `v18q`","18a0e515":"Okay, looks like we're okay in terms of the distributions between the train set and the extracted households. We should take not that our classes are very imbalanced. If the test set follows the same distribution, we could use a naive model that simply predicts the `Target` to be 4 and we'll be right over 65% of the time. This certainly won't help IDB figure out how to focus their support, since most households would be classified as non-vulnerable and, therefore, not in need of additional support. Still, it's good to be aware of this as we evaluate our models.\n\nIt seems like a lot of the features in the dataset are boolean. To start exploring the data and distributions, let's take a look at all the numeric attributes that aren't boolean to see what their distributions are and see if we can identify anything interesting about the data we're working with.","764a3ad3":"The thing that jumps out from this analysis is that range for the age of individuals where `rez_esc` is not na is between 7 and 17. The other variables don't show an obvious difference. Indeed, IDB clarifies in a discussion about this variable: \n\n> This variable is only collected for people between 7 and 19 years of age and it is the difference between the years of education a person should have and the years of education he\/she has. it is capped at 5.\n\nAs a first step, then, let's create a custom transformer that fills in 0 for anyone who is younger than 7 or older than 19.","f71bba2f":"## Ordinalize features","1426039f":"Bingo! All of the values in the `v18q` column are 0s or 1s. ***And...*** that 7342 count rings a bell. In fact, it's the count of the number of NaN values in the `v18q1` column. It's now pretty reasonable that any field that has a 0 in `v18q` is part of a houseold that doesn't own a tablet and, therefore, the count of tablets in the house, `v18q1` should be set to 0. First, let's make sure this isn't a fluke and that there are households with more than 1 tablet.

Why would someone not have a monthly rent payment? I can only think of a few valid reasons, they own a house outright, live with someone else rent-free, or are homeless. If we can't figure out how to fill in some of these values, we might have to ignore this field. That would be a shame, though, since there's probably a decent correlation with a household's poverty level and their rent (or whether they own their home). \n\nAgain, the representitive from IDB offers some help in the [Kaggle discussions](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction\/discussion\/61403#360694):\n\n> In the example of v2a1 you should first filter by tipoviv3. Most households that don't have information will be households that do not rent or are not paying loans (tipoviv2). If a household is tipoviv3 and does not have information then you need to make a choice about the treatment of the variable either assume 0, impute a value or not use the variable. Basically in those cases we don't know the value.\n\nLet's see what we can find out following that path."}}
