For clarity, I will use the most complex part of the training data for illustration: the part [2000000:2500000], where the number of open channels is 0-10.\n\nThe underlying process here is a Markov process with num_states possible states (here: num_states=11). The Markov property means that the probability of finding the system in state s at data point i depends only on s_i-1, the state of the previous data point. The process is therefore fully characterized by the *transition matrix P_trans*, a (num_states,num_states) Matrix where P_trans[i,j] is the probability for the system going to state j in the next step when i is the the current state.\n\nHowever, the true current state of the system is unobservable, which is why they are called *Hidden Markov Models*. Instead, the system emits an observable *signal* at each time step. The probability for observing a specific signal depends only on the current state. We therefore need another matrix *P_signal* of dimension (num_states, num_signals) with num_signals = the number of possible signals. Again, P[i,j] is the probability of observing signal j if the system is currently in state i.\n\nThe algorithm also requires the initial probability distibution *p_in* of the states before the first signal observation. This is completely irrelevant in our case, we use a uniform distribution.\n\nThe final input we need is the *chain of observed signals*, in our case the signal data of length 500.000. The Viterbi algorithm then returns a chain the most probable sequence of true states that would produce the observed signal chain, i.e. the solution we're looking for in this competition. \n\nWhen I tried to understand the Viterbi algorithm, I was struck by how complicated it is usually presented. In fact, it is surprisingly simple. Here's the code:","0c83a82d":"All set. One line of code and we have our solution:","2cba6bed":"Not great, not bad ;)","612dbf28":"**And just like that, we have improved our F1 score for ALL batches!

There are many ways to do this (I've tried them all ;)), here I use the simplest one: Just use the actual distribution of the signal for each of the true states. We can do this because it's training data and we know the true state.\n\nImportant: the signal we have is actually a (practically) continuous floating point number. We need discrete signals. So, we need to put the signal into discrete bins. Here, I use 1000 bins. Again, I've tried using more, it doesn't help.","bf6baad0":"Now let's do a full run, using the test data. Use the data without drift, see [this notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/friedchips\/clean-removal-of-data-drift):","f45979f9":"**Introduction**\n\nThe problem we are trying to solve in this competition is known as a *Hidden Markov Model*. There exists an algorithm which finds the most probable solution for such problems without any \"real machine learning\": the **Viterbi algorithm**. In this notebook, I explain this algorithm and apply it to the problem at hand. Since the organizers have mentioned the Viterbi algorithm several times, I think it's instructive to demonstrate it here, even though it also results in a LB score of only ~0.935, providing further confirmation for the fact that there simpy isn't any additional information available in the data.","25338bd9":"The Viterbi algorithm works like this:\n\n- for each signal, calculate the probability vector p_state that the signal was emitted by state i (i in [0,num_states-1]). At step 0, this is simply p_in * transpose(p_signal).\n- for all following signals, calculate for each possible state i the probability that the system is now in state i like this: first, calculate the probability that the system transitioned into state i by multiplying the previous p_state with the transposed p_trans. Then take the maximum of these possibilities and multiply with transpose(p_signal).\n- finally, find for each signal point the state with the highest probability (-> argmax).\n\nIf we would actually calculate the probabilities like that, especially for 500.000 signal points, we end up with probabilities in the range of 10 ** (-100000)! This wouldn't work, so we need to use logarithms of probabilities, as a result, all multiplications become additions.\n\nThat's all. Now we have to figure out P_trans and P_signal for our problem. I demonstrate this for a specific part of the training signal:","3555d551":"# The Viterbi Algorithm - Kalman Filtering\n\n**First off, a special thanks to [Markus F](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/friedchips) for his outstanding work with Viterbi Algorithm implementation and analysis. I've linked his original kernel below, which this one is based on:**\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/friedchips\/the-viterbi-algorithm-a-complete-solution\n\n**As he has stated in his analysis, the solution he achieved was statistically optimal if applying the Viterbi Algorithm alone. However, one that that can be done is pre-processing the signal data in order to help the algorithm. This can be done with a multitude of signal filtering techniques. I have done some such analysis in other kernels below:**\n\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/teejmahal20\/a-signal-processing-approach-low-pass-filtering\n\n**However, it became clear that any type of low pass, high pass filtering is not the way to go for this problem. That is due to the nature of the noise that plagues the signal. We know that our signal has been injected with [Gaussian White Noise](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/White_noise) which means that this noise is constant across the entire frequency spectrum. Therefore, it impossible to simply attenuate a particular frequency in order to maximize our Signal-to-Noise (SNR). We need some sort of filtering technique that can assist with this type of noise...**\n\n**That is where Kalman Filtering comes into play. I am not going to go into depth into the mathematical details for kalman filters (you can find that [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kalman_filter)). But I will say that Kalman filters are well-known (used in controls) for their ability to estimate a variable (or signal) while also accounting for the presence of process and\/or measurement noise (particularly gaussian noise). It seems like a perfect choice for a signal like ours**\n\n**The goal of this kernel is to show that we can get improvement in our F1 score by pre-processing our signal through a kalman filter prior to applying the Viterbi Algorithm\n**\n\n**If you find this topic useful, please upvote!\n**","c94e9ff3":"Here you can see each probability distribution:","9e392164":"We finally need to put the actual signal into these bins as well:","530a55c9":"**Predict the test states using p_trans and p_signal from the training data.

This value basically determines how much to weight the observations coming into the filter. In basic terms, it can be viewed as a 'smoothing' factor. We don't want this too high so that it over smooths our signal, but not too low where not enough broadband noise is rejected. I found the value below by grid searching based on F1 score to find the amount of filtering that accounted for best performance.**","2c2b47a0":"## Viterbi without Kalman Filtering"}}
