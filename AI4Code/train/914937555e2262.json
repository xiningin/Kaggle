The services sector is projected to grow by only 1 percent in 2020 due to lower trade (imports are expected to fall by 7 percent) and travel. Travel to Rwanda has fallen by 70 percent, which has caused a major impact on the tourism industry.\n\nThe agricultural sector, which is a major economic driver, was also impacted, further to the already expected decline because of adverse weather. A reduction in demand due to COVID-19 as well as a drop in international prices of export crops has made the situation worse. The industrial sector will also slow because of a drop in demand and delays in foreign direct investment in the construction sector.\n\nEconomic growth is projected to slow down to 2 percent in 2020 from 9.4 percent in 2019. In the medium term, the economy is expected to recover with growth reaching 6.3 percent in 2021, and back to its average growth of 8 percent in 2022. https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/News\/Articles\/2020\/08\/06\/na080620-rwanda-harnesses-technology-to-fight-covid-19-drive-recovery","1b8aa6fd":"The only one correct is Vaccination Timing.

The Fund will support the recovery of businesses hardest hit by COVID-19 to allow them to resume operations and safeguard employment. Efforts include refinancing hotels; providing working capital for large companies, microbusinesses and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and setting up an SME guarantee scheme.\n\n#The government responded to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Data is collected for analysis by outbreak investigation teams.\n\nCOVID-19 surveillance: A health facility digital reporting surveillance system is used to monitor influenza-like illnesses and severe acute respiratory infections in real time to provide an early warning of suspected COVID-19 cases.\n\nInfection prevention: Robots have been used in healthcare settings to carry out simple tasks, like checking temperatures and monitoring patients, to reduce exposure of healthcare workers.\n\nData visualization: A Geographic Information System (GIS) is being used to monitor COVID-19 cases at the household level to assess the need for implementing lockdown measures, focus public health interventions where there is evidence of community transmission, and monitor at-risk populations.\nhttps:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/News\/Articles\/2020\/08\/06\/na080620-rwanda-harnesses-technology-to-fight-covid-19-drive-recovery","06c2921a":"#Rwanda\u2019s use of grassroots networks. An innovative way to assist households.\n\nIn the year 2000, Rwanda adopted the National Decentralization Policy\u2014a \u201cpeople centered\u201d policy that uses grassroots networks and local governments to help lessen shocks on households and alleviate poverty. Household assistance is based on Ubudehe categorization, a long-standing cultural value of mutual assistance that was also adopted by the government as a poverty reduction strategy.\n\nUbudehe is a socio-economic stratification system that provides support for Rwandans in lower categories with social protection schemes such as cash transfer, public works, access to agricultural inputs, shelter, health, and education with the aim to graduate to higher categories. The process has been useful in identifying vulnerable households\u2014through community-based identification, the Ubudehe database, and other means\u2014that need assistance as a result of the crisis. In 2018, core social protection programs covered 6.5 percent of the population. These are being scaled up to cover more people in this period of pandemic.https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/News\/Articles\/2020\/08\/06\/na080620-rwanda-harnesses-technology-to-fight-covid-19-drive-recovery","6106970a":"#Sweetviz codes from Taha07 https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/taha07\/sweetviz-automated-eda\/notebook ","5acac260":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata   @mpwwolke ","1149e345":"The government leveraged the country\u2019s already high financial inclusion rate (93 percent) and took measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 by waiving peer-to-peer mobile money transfer fees, merchant payment fees, and transfers from account to mobile wallets or vice versa for three months.\n\nThe above measures limited cash usage, which raises the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
