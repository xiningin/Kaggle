The calculated frequencies typically have very high standard deviation, and the longest period detected is usually quite long. The curves could potentially be sinusoidal in nature, but often only fragments of it can be seen in the observed windows. There could also be an overall upwards or downwards trend for the overall curve. As this is an extragalactical class, some faraway objects have higher uncertainties in their observations.\nIt is worth noting that some of the class 88 objects appear to have an exactly 1-day period. While in some cases this appear to be spurious, there are also cases where it appears plausible. However, even for those objects where 1-day period is detected, from the raw time-domain plot, we can often find what appears to be a long timescale evolving trend. Further investigation is needed for this class.","f67f8530":"Class 95 is another case of non-periodic burst events, although the curvature of the peaks appear to be smaller than the peaks in other burst classes, and some bands visibly 'lag' behind others.

The skew of the data is all over the place. Also, this is a class of objects within the galaxy, but the observation uncertainty can be pretty high. If we look at a sample of original data from this class, it appears that objects in this class are rather faint (in terms of flux difference to the reference picture). Considering the low % of 'detected' observations, it is likely that the high deviation, low error points that occasionally pop up in the light curves are actually the real events, whereas most of the curve is just background.","9d854e4e":"Class 42 appears to be mostly flat. It is extragalactical, so high uncertainty happens in some cases. It most likely is a class of objects with \"burst\" events, although the actual burst is not always detected in the observation windows. When the burst happens, the object's magnitude increases dramatically across all bands and gradually falls back to normal levels in a few months. If the burst is indeed detected, it will be characterised by relatively low frequency std between bands together with very high detected periods. Other features like skewness can also be used to identify this class of objects, as a burst usually results in high skew in the light curve.","53d67b48":"### Class 62","f4d96db9":"**Can you distinguish between the different classes with just your eyes?**\n\nNew: Multiband frequencies are now fitted with the `gatspy` package and the fitted values are plotted.
