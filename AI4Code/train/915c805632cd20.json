This is what we had observed in our EDA notebook of wine data.","ab8f4a25":"## Splitting the data into Train and Test Set\nWe want to check the performance of the model that we built. For this purpose, we always split (both input and output data) the given data into training set which will be used to train the model, and test set which will be used to check how accurately the model is predicting outcomes.\n\nFor this purpose we have a class called 'train_test_split' in the 'sklearn.model_selection' module.","4563110c":"We already have actual target values (i.e. y_test) for X_test. Let's compare y_test and the predicted value for X_test by our log_model.","c5c0b370":"## Separating Input Features and Output Features\nBefore building any machine learning model, we always separate the input variables and output variables. Input variables are those quantities whose values are changed naturally in an experiment, whereas output variable is the one whose values are dependent on the input variables. So, input variables are also known as independent variables as its values are not dependent on any other quantity, and output variable\/s are also known as dependent variables as its values are dependent on other variable i.e. input variables. Like here in this data, we can see that whether a person will buy insurance or not is dependent on the age of that person\n\nBy convention input variables are represented with 'X' and output variables are represented with 'y'.","56dbb5d3":"If you observe here, the class wise false positives (above the main diagonal) and the class wise false negatives (below the main diagonal) are almost symmetrical. So, the accuracy score is an important metric here.","869b4d54":"We have already done the EDA part of this dataset in our earlier notebook. So we will not dive into EDA more here.

Logistic Regression Model gave 54% of accuracy and Random Forest is giving 66.8% of accuracy on the same dataset.","71953749":"## About Dataset\nI hope all of you guys remembered the wine dataset on which we have done exploratory data analysis and also build logistic regression model for this dataset. Here we will take red wine data. Given different physiochemical tests, we want to predict the quality of wine in range 1 to 10.\n\nThe reason behind taking the same dataset is that we can easily notice the differences between Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.","2ec47dec":"## Building Model\nNow we are finally ready, and we can train the model.\n\nFirst, we need to import our model - Random Forest Classifier (again, using the sklearn library).\n\nThen we would feed the model both with the data (X_train) and the answers for that data (y_train)","17722f1c":"## Model Performance\nWe can also check how accurate our model is performing using the 'accuracy_score' class from 'sklearn.metrics'.","f86c059c":"## Loading Data\nPandas module is used for reading files.

So, we import each and every library that we want to use.\n\nIn data science, numpy and pandas are most commonly used libraries. Numpy is required for calculations like means, medians, square roots, etc. Pandas is used for data processin and data frames.
