We call it as \u2018top-down\u2019 because it begins from the top of tree when all the observations are available in a single region and successively splits the predictor space into two new branches down the tree. It is known as \u2018greedy\u2019 because, the algorithm cares (looks for best variable available) about only the current split, and not about future splits which will lead to a better tree.\n\nStopping Criteria: The most common stopping procedure is to use a minimum count on the number of training instances assigned to each leaf node. If the count is less than some minimum then the split is not accepted and the node is taken as a final leaf node.\n\nFor this dataset Petrol_consumption is considered as the Target variable and rest are Predictors:\\\n\n**Q.  Why does Tree considered Petrol_tax as Root of Tree?**\\\n**Ans**The reason could be the feature_importances as from above codes we can see Petrol_tax has feature importance value compared to others. So, the Petrol_tax is selected as root of tree and other features as decision nodes.\n\n**The Split :** Purity of the node increases with respect to the target variable. Decision tree splits the nodes on all available variables and then selects the split which results in most homogeneous sub-nodes.\n\n##### Hyperparameters Considered:   max_depth=4,  max_features=4\n1. The tree uses Petrol Tax features with threshold value of 7.25 to initially divide the samples.\n2. We can see out of 33 Samples the root (Petrol Tax) split into two other decision nodes:\\\n   i.  Where Petrol_tax <= 7.25 then it uses another feature (Paved Highways) with total number of sample of 15 as decision node.\\\n   ii.Where Petrol_tax> 7.25 then it uses feature Average Income as another decision node with Sample count of 18.\n3. The tree considered Mean Squared Error(MSE) as the determining and decision making criteria. \n4. In the above plotted decision tree every node is a conditon how to split values. The least the MSE the better the result. \n5. We can see from decision nodes there are several boxes known as leaf nodes where MSE=0 and thus tree stops branching from that nodes.\n\n","0e1274cb":"##### Dividing Data into Predictors and Target Variables","014064cb":"We see that the predictions are not accurate.

Maximum depth of tree(vertical depth) to control over-fitting as higher depth will allow model to learn relations very specific to a particular sample.\\\nii. max_features these are selected randomly but higher value selection results in Overfitting.**\n\nWe have used the above mentioned parameters to improve decision tree accuracy and reduce MSE. by fitting in our model this can also be called a one way of prune the tree.\n\nObservation\n1.
