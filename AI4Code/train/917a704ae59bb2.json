The *slope-intercept form* is a specific way of writing a 2-variable linear equation so that the equation definition includes the slope and y-intercept. The generalised slope-intercept form looks like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}y = mx + b \\end{equation}\n\nIn this notation, ***m*** is the slope and ***b*** is the y-intercept.\n\nFor example, let's look at the solved linear equation we've been working with so far in this section:\n\n\\begin{equation}y = \\frac{3x - 4}{2} \\end{equation}\n\nNow that we know the slope and y-intercept for the line that this equation defines, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\begin{equation}y = 1\\frac{1}{2}x + -2 \\end{equation}\n\nYou can see intuitively that this is true. In our original form of the equation, to find y we multiply x by three, subtract 4, and divide by two - in other words, x is half of 3x - 4; which is 1.5x - 2. So these equations are equivalent, but the slope-intercept form has the advantages of being simpler, and including two key pieces of information we need to plot the line represented by the equation. We know the y-intecept that the line passes through (0, -2), and we know the slope of the line (for every x, we add 1.5 to y.\n\nLet's recreate our set of test x and y values using the slope-intercept form of the equation, and plot them to prove that this  describes the same line:","4f0d246e":"## Equations with Variables on Both Sides\nSo far, all of our equations have had a variable term on only one side. However, variable terms can exist on both sides. \n\nConsider this equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}3x + 2 = 5x - 1 \\end{equation}\n\nThis time, we have terms that include **x** on both sides. Let's take exactly the same approach to solving this kind of equation as we did for the previous examples. First, let's deal with the constants by adding 1 to both sides. That gets rid of the -1 on the right:\n\n\\begin{equation}3x + 3 = 5x \\end{equation}\n\nNow we can eliminate the variable expression from one side by subtracting 3x from both sides. That gets rid of the 3x on the left:\n\n\\begin{equation}3 = 2x \\end{equation}\n\nNext, we can deal with the coefficient by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{3}{2} = x \\end{equation}\n\nNow we've isolated x. It looks a little strange because we usually have the variable on the left side, so if it makes you more comfortable you can simply reverse the equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{3}{2} \\end{equation}\n\nFinally, this answer is correct as it is; but <sup>3<\/sup>\/<sub>2<\/sub> is an improper fraction. We can simplify it to:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = 1\\frac{1}{2} \\end{equation}\n\nSo x is 1<sup>1<\/sup>\/<sub>2<\/sub> (which is of course 1.5 in decimal notation).\nLet's check it in Python:","3e4730c7":"## Intercepts\nWhen we use a linear equation to plot a line, we can easily see where the line intersects the X and Y axes of the plot. These points are known as *intercepts*. The *x-intercept* is where the line intersects the X (horizontal) axis, and the *y-intercept* is where the line intersects the Y (horizontal) axis.\n\nLet's take a look at the line from our linear equation with the X and Y axis shown through the origin (0,0).","98945005":"## Next part Comming Soon --> ","b05e7e3c":"The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the X axis, and at this point, the **y** value is always 0. Similarly, the y-intercept is where the line crosses the Y axis, at which point the **x** value is 0. So to find the intercepts, we need to solve the equation for **x** when **y** is 0.\n\nFor the x-intercept, our equation looks like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}0 = \\frac{3x - 4}{2} \\end{equation}\n\nWhich can be reversed to make it look more familar with the x expression on the left:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{3x - 4}{2} = 0 \\end{equation}\n\nWe can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n\\begin{equation}3x - 4 = 0 \\end{equation}\n\nThen we can add 4 to both sides to get rid of the constant on the left:\n\n\\begin{equation}3x = 4 \\end{equation}\n\nAnd finally we can divide both sides by 3 to get the value for x:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{4}{3} \\end{equation}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = 1\\frac{1}{3} \\end{equation}\n\nSo the x-intercept is 1<sup>1<\/sup>\/<sub>3<\/sub> (approximately 1.333).\n\nTo get the y-intercept, we solve the equation for y when x is 0:\n\n\\begin{equation}y = \\frac{3\\cdot0 - 4}{2} \\end{equation}\n\nSince 3 x 0 is 0, this can be simplified to:\n\n\\begin{equation}y = \\frac{-4}{2} \\end{equation}\n\n-4 divided by 2 is -2, so:\n\n\\begin{equation}y = -2 \\end{equation}\n\nThis gives us our y-intercept, so we can plot both intercepts on the graph:","0038f098":"## Combining Like Terms\nLike terms are elements of an expression that relate to the same variable or constant (with the same *order* or *exponential*, which we'll discuss later). For example, consider the following equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\textbf{5x} + 1 \\textbf{- 2x} = 22 \\end{equation}\n\nIn this equation, the left side includes the terms **5x** and **- 2x**, both of which represent the variable **x** multiplied by a coefficent. Note that we include the sign (+ or -) in front of the value.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation to combine these like terms:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\textbf{5x - 2x} + 1 = 22 \\end{equation}\n\nWe can then simply perform the necessary operations on the like terms to consolidate them into a single term:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\textbf{3x} + 1 = 22 \\end{equation}\n\nNow, we can solve this like any other two-step equation. First we'll remove the constants from the left side - in this case, there's a constant expression that adds 1, so we'll use the opposite operation to remove it and do the same on the other side:\n\n\\begin{equation}3x + 1 - 1 = 22 - 1 \\end{equation}\n\nThat gives us:\n\n\\begin{equation}3x = 21 \\end{equation}\n\nThen we'll deal with the coefficients - in this case x is multiplied by 3, so we'll divide by 3 on boths sides to remove that:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{21}{3} \\end{equation}\n\nThis give us our answer:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = 7 \\end{equation}","ef6a59f1":"Let's look at another example, in which the variable is a whole number, but its coefficient is a fraction:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{2}{5}x + 1 = 11 \\end{equation}\n\nAs usual, we'll start by removing the constants from the variable expression; so in this case we need to subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{2}{5}x = 10 \\end{equation}\n\nNow we need to cancel out the fraction. The expression equates to two-fifths times x, so the opposite operation is to divide by <sup>2<\/sup>\/<sub>5<\/sub>; but a simpler way to do this with a fraction is to multiply it by its *reciprocal*, which is just the inverse of the fraction, in this case <sup>5<\/sup>\/<sub>2<\/sub>. Of course, we need to do this to both sides:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{10}{1} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\end{equation}\n\nThat gives us the following result:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{50}{2} \\end{equation}\n\nWhich we can simplify to:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = 25 \\end{equation}\n\nWe can confirm that with Python:","9990f169":"# Getting Started with Equations\nEquations are calculations in which one or more variables represent unknown values. In this notebook, you'll learn some fundamental techniques for solving simple equations.\n\n## One Step Equations\nConsider the following equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}x + 16 = -25\\end{equation}\n\nThe challenge here is to find the value for **x**, and to do this we need to *isolate the variable*. In this case, we need to get **x** onto one side of the \"=\" sign, and all of the other values onto the other side. To accomplish this we'll follow these rules:\n1. Use opposite operations to cancel out the values we don't want on one side. In this case, the left side of the equation includes an addition of 16, so we'll cancel that out by subtracting 16 and the left side of the equation becomes **x + 16 - 16**.\n2. Whatever you do to one side, you must also do to the other side. In this case, we subtracted 16 from the left side, so we must also subtract 16 from the right side of the equation, which becomes **-25 - 16**.\nOur equation now looks like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}x + 16 - 16 = -25 - 16\\end{equation}\n\nNow we can calculate the values on both side. On the left side, 16 - 16 is 0, so we're left with:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = -25 - 16\\end{equation}\n\nWhich yields the result **-41**. Our equation is now solved, as you can see here:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = -41\\end{equation}\n\nIt's always good practice to verify your result by plugging the variable value you've calculated into the original equation and ensuring that it holds true. We can easily do that by using some simple Python code.\n\nTo verify the equation using Python code, place the cursor in the following cell and then click the &#9658;<b>|<\/b> button in the toolbar.","d1000b46":"## Slope\nIt's clear from the graph that the line from our linear equation describes a slope in which values increase as we travel up and to the right along the line. It can be useful to quantify the slope in terms of how much **x** increases (or decreases) for a given change in **y**. In the notation for this, we use the greek letter &Delta; (*delta*) to represent change:\n\n\\begin{equation}slope = \\frac{\\Delta{y}}{\\Delta{x}} \\end{equation}\n\nSometimes slope is represented by the variable ***m***, and the equation is written as:\n\n\\begin{equation}m = \\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} \\end{equation}\n\nAlthough this form of the equation is a little more verbose, it gives us a clue as to how we calculate slope. What we need is any two ordered pairs of x,y values for the line - for example, we know that our line passes through the following two points:\n- (0,-2)\n- (6,7)\n\nWe can take the x and y values from the first pair, and label them x<sub>1<\/sub> and y<sub>1<\/sub>; and then take the x and y values from the second point and label them x<sub>2<\/sub> and y<sub>2<\/sub>. Then we can plug those into our slope equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}m = \\frac{7 - -2}{6 - 0} \\end{equation}\n\nThis is the same as:\n\n\\begin{equation}m = \\frac{7 + 2}{6 - 0} \\end{equation}\n\nThat gives us the result <sup>9<\/sup>\/<sub>6<\/sub> which is 1<sup>1<\/sup>\/<sub>2<\/sub> or 1.5 .\n\nSo what does that actually mean? Well, it tells us that for every change of **1** in x, **y** changes by 1<sup>1<\/sup>\/<sub>2<\/sub> or 1.5. So if we start from any point on the line and move one unit to the right (along the X axis), we'll need to move 1.5 units up (along the Y axis) to get back to the line.\n\nYou can plot the slope onto the original line with the following Python code to verify it fits:","7c71d715":"In a linear equation, a valid solution is described by an ordered pair of x and y values. For example, valid solutions to the linear equation above include:\n- (-10, -17)\n- (0, -2)\n- (9, 11.5)\n\nThe cool thing about linear equations is that we can plot the points for some specific ordered pair solutions to create the line, and then interpolate the x value for any y value (or vice-versa) along the line.","8ffaf509":"## Using the Distributive Property\nThe distributive property is a mathematical law that enables us to distribute the same operation to terms within parenthesis. For example, consider the following equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\textbf{4(x + 2)} + \\textbf{3(x - 2)} = 16 \\end{equation}\n\nThe equation includes two operations in parenthesis: **4(*x* + 2)** and **3(*x* - 2)**. Each of these operations consists of a constant by which the contents of the parenthesis must be multipled: for example, 4 times (*x* + 2). The distributive property means that we can achieve the same result by multiplying each term in the parenthesis and adding the results, so for the first parenthetical operation, we can multiply 4 by *x* and add it to 4 times +2; and for the second parenthetical operation, we can calculate 3 times *x* + 3 times -2). Note that the constants in the parenthesis include the sign (+ or -) that preceed them:\n\n\\begin{equation}4x + 8 + 3x - 6 = 16 \\end{equation}\n\nNow we can group our like terms:\n\n\\begin{equation}7x + 2 = 16 \\end{equation}\n\nThen we move the constant to the other side:\n\n\\begin{equation}7x = 14 \\end{equation}\n\nAnd now we can deal with the coefficient:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{7x}{7} = \\frac{14}{7} \\end{equation}\n\nWhich gives us our anwer:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = 2 \\end{equation}\n\nHere's the original equation with the calculated value for *x* in Python:","fb2f11ea":"The ability to calculate the intercepts for a linear equation is useful, because you can calculate only these two points and then draw a straight line through them to create the entire line for the equation.","8d757e3a":"## Working with Fractions\nSome of the steps in solving the equations above have involved working wth fractions - which in themselves are actually just division operations. Let's take a look at an example of an equation in which our variable is defined as a fraction:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{x}{3} + 1 = 16 \\end{equation}\n\nWe follow the same approach as before, first removing the constants from the left side - so we'll subtract 1 from both sides.\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{x}{3} = 15 \\end{equation}\n\nNow we need to deal with the fraction on the left so that we're left with just **x**. The fraction is <sup>x<\/sup>\/<sub>3<\/sub> which is another way of saying *x divided by 3*, so we can apply the opposite operation to both sides. In this case, we need to multiply both sides by the denominator under our variable, which is 3. To make it easier to work with a term that contains fractions, we can express whole numbers as fractions with a denominator of 1; so on the left, we can express 3 as <sup>3<\/sup>\/<sub>1<\/sub> and multiply it with <sup>x<\/sup>\/<sub>3<\/sub>. Note that the notation for mutiplication is a **&bull;** symbol rather than the standard *x* multiplication operator (which would cause confusion with the variable **x**) or the asterisk symbol used by most programming languages.\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{3}{1} \\cdot \\frac{x}{3} = 15 \\cdot 3 \\end{equation}\n\nThis gives us the following result:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = 45 \\end{equation}\n\nLet's verify that with some Python code:","fb9cbfa9":"## Two-Step Equations\nThe previous example was fairly simple - you could probably work it out in your head.

The first thing we'll do is to cancel out the *constants*. A constant is any number that stands on its own, so in this case the 2 that we're subtracting on the left side is a constant. We'll use an opposite operation to cancel it out on the left side, so since the current operation is to subtract 2, we'll add 2; and of course whatever we do on the left side we also need to do on the right side, so after the first step, our equation looks like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}3x - 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 \\end{equation}\n\nNow the -2 and +2 on the left cancel one another out, and on the right side, 10 + 2 is 12; so the equation is now:\n\n\\begin{equation}3x = 12 \\end{equation}\n\nOK, time for step two - we need to deal with the *coefficients* - a coefficient is a number that is applied to a variable. In this case, our expression on the left is 3x, which means x multiplied by 3; so we can apply the opposite operation to cancel it out as long as we do the same to the other side, like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} \\end{equation}\n\n3x &divide; 3 is x, so we've now isolated the variable\n\n\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{12}{3} \\end{equation}\n\nAnd we can calculate the result as <sup>12<\/sup>\/<sub>3<\/sub> which is **4**:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = 4 \\end{equation}\n\nLet's verify that result using Python:","7939c11f":"# Linear Equations\nThe equations in the previous lab included one variable, for which you solved the equation to find its value.

These variables depend on one another; the value of x is determined in part by the value of y and vice-versa; so we can't solve the equation and find absolute values for both x and y. However, we *can* solve the equation for one of the variables and obtain a result that describes a relative relationship between the variables.\n\nFor example, let's solve this equation for y.
