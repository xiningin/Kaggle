But few of the algorithms are used popularly, let\u2019s look at them in detail:\n- __Connectivity models__: These models are based on the notion that the data points _closer in data space __exhibit more similarity__ to each other __than__ the data points __lying farther__ away_. These models can follow two approaches.<br> Examples of these models are __hierarchical clustering algorithm__ and its variants.<br><br>\n- __Centroid models__: These are __iterative clustering algorithms__ in which the notion of similarity is derived by the __closeness of a data point to the centroid of the clusters__. K-Means clustering algorithm is a popular algorithm that falls into this category. These models run iteratively to find the __local optima__.<br><br>\n- __Distribution models__: These clustering models are based on the notion of __how probable is it that all data points in the cluster belong to the same distribution__ (For example: Normal, Gaussian). These models often suffer from __overfitting__. A popular example of these models is __Expectation-maximization algorithm__ which uses multivariate normal distributions.<br><br>\n- __Density Models__: These models search the data space for __areas of varied density of data points__ in the data space.
