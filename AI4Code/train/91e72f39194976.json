Afterwards, you train your model on the training data and evaluate it on the test set. To finish this exercise, you will then save your model in HDF5 format.\n\n##\u00a0Data\n\nFor this exercise we will use the Reuters newswire dataset. This dataset consists of 11,228 newswires from the Reuters news agency. Each wire is encoded as a sequence of word indexes, just as in the IMDB data we encountered in lecture 5 of this series. Moreover, each wire is categorised into one of 46 topics, which will serve as our label. This dataset is available through the Keras API.\n\n## Goal\n\nWe want to create a Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using Keras which we can train to classify news items into the specified 46 topics.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWe start by importing everything we need for this exercise:","07047739":"## 1.

Exercise part: model training and evaluation\n\nNext, define the batch_size for training as 32 and train the model for 5 epochs on *x_train* and *y_train* by using the *fit* method of your model. Then calculate the score for your trained model by running *evaluate* on *x_test* and *y_test* with the same batch size as used in *fit*.","b19af42c":"Note that we cap the maximum number of words in a news item to 1000 by specifying the *num_words* key word. Also, 20% of the data will be test data and we ensure reproducibility by setting our random seed.\n\nOur training features are still simply sequences of indexes and we need to further preprocess them, so that we can plug them into a *Dense* layer. For this we use a *Tokenizer* from Keras' text preprocessing module. This tokenizer will take an index sequence and map it to a vector of length *max_words=1000*. Each of the 1000 vector positions corresponds to one of the words in our newswire corpus. The output of the tokenizer has a 1 at the i-th position of the vector, if the word corresponding to i is in the description of the newswire, and 0 otherwise. Even if this word appears multiple times, we still just put a 1 into our vector, i.e. our tokenizer is binary. We use this tokenizer to transform both train and test features:","8c03d10d":"Then we have to install a little library in order to submit to coursera","453e34cb":"IMPORTANT! => In case h5py has been installed, please restart the kernel by clicking on \"Kernel\"->\"Restart and Clear Outout\" and wait until all output disapears. Then your changes are beeing picked up\n\nAs you can see, we use Keras' Sequential model with only two types of layers: Dense and Dropout. We also specify a random seed to make our results reproducible. Next, we load the Reuters data set:"}}
