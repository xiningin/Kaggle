That is **Networking skill**. I can't emphasize enough for this skill. This is the skills, if you can grasp correctly then it will take you higher than you can't imagine. So, What is networking?\n\nNetworking is the exchange of information and ideas among people with a common profession or special interest, usually in an informal social setting [6]. It means having a connection with useful people, from those you can get the idea, opportunity etc. But it wasn't as easy as it sounds. It doesn't work in one direction, meaning you only take advantages. You have to also give and share to your network.\n\nNetworking will help you develop and improve your skill set, stay on top of the latest trends in your industry, keep a pulse on the job market, meet prospective mentors, partners, and clients, and gain access to the necessary resources that will foster your career development [7].\n\nFor example, you apply for a job in a great company. And obviously, there will hundreds of other applicants. How you will stand out? If you can get a recommendation from someone inside the company or have a relation with management people, I can assure you that you will have the chance of getting the job is over 90%. Also, most of the time high scale job is offered to specific people, imagine how you will get that offer if nobody knows you. \n\n\nBuilding a real relationship is not easy, it is an art. So which people should we network with? Does it have to the management people often! The answer is no. As we talk earlier that we have to follow the successful DS & ML people. But the following is important but it is more important to have personal contact with them. But how? One of the important sources is the Media sources where they share and communicate.

","2288ee85":"<a id='cloud_big_data_technical'><\/a>\n### Cloud computing & Big Data are must for high scale job ( Technical Skill: 5 )\nNow we have come to one of the important technical skills required for becoming a valuable data scientist or machine learning engineer. Cloud computing and big data are skills that separate valuable ds\/ml people. In most modern company & enterprise, have cloud support for their company. Most of them stored their data in the cloud. Not only that most of the software and other technical runs on cloud app engine. \n\nTo be valuable ds\/ml people, we must need a solid understanding of cloud computing. Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user [5].\n\nWhy we need a solid foundation in cloud products. Because cloud computing is not as easy as it sounds. There can be hundreds of problem encountered in work. And most importantly you have to know how to use cloud efficiently. Because it is not free. As we saw in the non-technical section that you should have business skills. That means you have to use the cloud as efficiently possible to save companies resources. \n\nThere are three main big names in the cloud computing business. 1. AWS, 2. Google Cloud, 3. Microsoft Azure\n\nThe most popular one is AWS. This one controls over 50% of market share. Many big-name ( Netflix) use AWS. To build yourself, you should have a solid understanding of AWS. If you are beginner then Google cloud and Azure might be a good option. \n \nAll major services offer some sort of big data products ( e.g Google Bigquery ). \n\nWhat I am trying to say is that you should have a basic understanding of all of these services but have mastered at least AWS or Google cloud. But let see what cloud computing products and big data products are used by high-income achievers. ","cb1c006d":"### What makes a company great for data scientists and ML engineer?\nAs a Data scientist or ML engineer, we have to choose a company that leverages Data Science for its Strategic Differentiation.

This translates to much more satisfying roles for the data scientists (ie. you get more autonomy, mastery, purpose) [3].\n \nTheoretically, we now know that we have to find and choose those company that incorporates ds and ml. To know what high salary achievers are working on we will use 2019 kaggle survey dataset.

Some examples include knowledge of programming languages, mechanical equipment, or tools [4]. Technical skills differ from field to field.

But the important thing is that we looked through all the skills using real data from real data scientist and machine learning engineer. I hope it will help DS & ML community to build their career. \n\nWe used 2019 Kaggle Survey dataset. It helps us to differentiate between skills of high salary achievers.

But in this notebook, we will try to look through from the lens of tech industry specially focused on data science and machine learning fields.\n\n\nIncreasing your salary or getting high paying jobs isn't that easy or isn't that hard though. There are hundreds of articles, books out there that talk about how to get higher-paying jobs. But still, most of the people don't get it. Because, most people give in to the two worst enemies of success: they take the path of least resistance (in other words, they\u2019re lazy) and\/or they want immediate gratification: they don\u2019t consider the long-term consequences of the actions they take today [1].\n\nTo succeed in the long term in any field you have to set yourself up a `higher standard`.

Because once you mastered one, it will easy for you to move or learn others as well. But before completing the cloud computing section one thing I must say from my experience. That is containerization. \n\n**We should have knowledge in containerization for mastering the cloud**\n\nOften We want to train our model in the cloud or want to inference in the cloud. But one thing that we should have a foundation on is containerization. Containerization involves bundling an application together with all of its related configuration files, libraries and dependencies required for it to run in an efficient and bug-free way across different computing environments [8]. \n\nWhen we want to train our model cloud, it means will have to run in a different environment from where we build, often that can cause a massive problem. Also, in the cloud, we have to train in multiple nodes and for that containerization is a must. Most popular containerization is Docker. And for running your applications in different nodes there is Kubernetes. You can say this is the job of a software engineer. But often time you have to use it and we all should have knowledge in that.  Learn more [here](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/docker-made-easy-for-data-scientists-b32efbc23165).

That is non-technical skills. No matter how skilful we are or how many degrees and qualification we have, without some common non-technical skills, we will be invaluable. So What are non-technical skills?\n\nNon-Technical Skills are interpersonal skills which include: communication skills; leadership skills; team-work skills; decision-making skills; and situation-awareness skills [2]. These skills are not directly correlated with our job role, but it is essentials for success in any job. Let's see what we need for DS\/ML jobs.\n\n* **Effective communication skills**: This is one of the most important skills for DS\/ML field or any other field. Communication skills are the key to job success. Effective communication skills mean to effectively communicate\/present your findings, research or idea to the technical and non-technical audiences.\n\n    We have previously seen that high salary achievers are working with more than 20+ other people. And they are building prototypes and model and applying machine learning model to new areas. In here, communication plays a vital role. Because often time we have to present our work and hypothesis to the manager and other management people and most of the time they don't have the technical knowledge in this domain. So we have to present our works in a way that they understand that. Effective communication skills will immensely help in this situation for climbing up the ladder and overall company success.\n   \n    \n* **Business skills**: Business skills is also one of the most important but most ignored skills for DS & ML field. Business skills mean a lot of things. But for simpler definition, it means the insights, research and idea you derive from data, how will this affect the company business growth and support. Also, for this, we have to understand the company business model, growth and other factors very well. \n\n    For example, we have seen that the most popular job role is to Analyze and understand data to influence product or business decision. So, in this case, we have to understand how our insights align with company target, growth. \n\n\n> \"Data science is more than just number crunching: it is the application of various skills to solve particular problems in an industry,\" explains Dr N. R. Srinivasa Raghavan, Chief Global Data Scientist at Infosys.\n\n\nWe just talked about the two most important non-technical skills that most of the data scientist ignore. There are also a lot of other skills. Some of them are **Critical thinking, Leadership, Proactive problem solving, Intellectual curiosity** etc. These are also important skills. To learn these skills, we need to read and learn a lot with real-life practice. As I said, we have to follow who already achieved a high position in the ds\/ml field.

For language-related work, expert have differed from others in these Contextualized embedding ( Elmo, CoVe ) and Transformer language model ( BERT ) methods.<br\/>\n    <br\/>\n    \u2022 Python is dominant programming language alongside with SQL for RDMS. Also, R is in the third position. Jupyter notebook for IDE's, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for visualization and tensorflow, scikit-learn, Keras for model building. We all should have foundation skills in these tools for high-quality jobs. <br\/>\n    <br\/>\n    \u2022 Alongside with traditional tools, we found AutoML which automates most of the DS & ML work and we can focus more on creativity side. Because this is a newly emerging tool, we can use it to rise up from the crowd. Also, we saw high achievers use AutoML for model selection, feature enginnerng, hyper-parameter tuning using H20.ai, Tpot, DataRobots ai, DataBrick ai, google AutoML. We should familiarize ourself with this tool. <br\/>\n    <br\/>\n    \u2022 Cloud computing and Big data are essential for landing a high paying job. We have seen AWS dominate the cloud industry. EC2, AWS lambda are the two most popular cloud computing products among high salary achievers. Google BigQuery, AWS redshift, Athena are popular bigdata products among high achievers. We should have foundation on these products. Because as I said earlier we have to follow those who already successful. <br\/>\n<p\/>\n<\/div>\n\n<br\/>\nBack to the [Secrets for getting a high salary](#main_secrets_section).\n\n***","f9782a97":"We are seeing some rankings among popular AutML libraries. Though `Auto-sklearn, Google AutoML` are on top, `H20.ai, Tpot, DataRobots ai, DataBrick ai` have number high salary people comparatively. But this doesn't reduce the importance of auto-sklearn or google AutoML, we are just saying `H20.ai, Tpot` are more popular among high salary achievers vs others. So we should have an overall idea of the above-mentioned libraries. ","b14e87c0":"We are seeing that **Coursera** is the most popular among all salary ranges. I think you already take the **Andrew Nag** popular course on machine learning on Coursera. Coursera is popular because it is mostly and exclusively focused on data science and machine learning and taught by University professor and other qualified teachers. We should choose the Coursera for our learning. \n\nNext, we are seeing that **Udacity** and **Fast.ai** are also very popular among high achievers. You can choose Udacity for a whole range of topics from deep learning to communications and others. But fast.ai focused, especially on deep learning. So it depends on you. Your first choice will be Coursera. You can choose Udacity for versatility and fast.ai for deep learning. Also, you can **Kaggle Courses**. Kaggle courses are a little bit different. It offers a practical way of learning DS & ML.

Because a company with awful management and culture can ruin your career. So, What makes a good company?\n\nSome general factors apply to any company. Like **management, brand recognition, growth mindset, environment, bonus and benefit** etc. These are the general quality a company or corporation must have, to be a great place for work. [Read this](http:\/\/www.ubf.consulting\/what-makes-a-company-great\/) to find out common factors for great companies. \n\nBut a good company may not be the best fit for a data scientist. We will find out what is a good company for data scientists and ML engineers. Also, not every job is the right fit for us. We have to find jobs that match with high-income ds and ml skills. ","fd81dfd9":"<a id='ml_method_technical'><\/a>\n### We also need ML method ( Technical Skill: 3 )\nIn recent days, two of the subfields of machine learning is become very popular because of its huge opportunity and application. These are computer vision and natural language processing. You need to know some of the basics of these two methods. But you don't need to master the two at once and you can't though.\n\nThese two fields are very complex. It deals with very complex data. One is the image and other text. For dealing with these complex problem, there are several methods developed over the years for each of these tasks. For example Inception v3 is a widely-used image recognition model that has been shown to attain greater than 78.1% accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. The model is the culmination of many ideas developed by multiple researchers over the years.\n\n\nBy using basic ml algorithms you may not achieve higher accuracy. But there are a lot of methods have been developed using ml algorithms by the researcher that is used by many professionals. For image, computer vision methods and for language that is NLP methods. Let's see what the expert is doing.","592e789c":"# <font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">But how do we follow high-income achievers in DS & ML?<\/font> \n\nWe will use ```2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey``` dataset. ```2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey``` dataset contains many important questions that we will use to find important information about high-income achievers. We will mostly see technical skills from high achievers because this survey mainly asked technical questions. But we will also derive other skills from that and other sources. \n\nThe dataset has also data about the salary of DS & ML people. Already, there are a lot of analysis and notebooks are written on this dataset. From [official kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/paultimothymooney\/every-response-to-every-question-no-data-filtering) we have seen that most popular salary range is ```$0-999```, ```$10,000-14,000``` and ```$100,000-124,999```. \n\nFor our notebook, we have to identify a high salary, medium salary and low salary. But how do we identify that? Because the survey contains responses from multiple countries, where salary and living cost are vastly different. We can use the PPP rate or only USA response, but we don't have enough data on the median salary in every country like the USA.\n\nFor simplicity, we will use dollar currency as it is used globally and we will use USA salary standard. This will make our analysis much easier. I know that salary consider low in the USA might consider being high in most countries but salary consider high in the USA is mostly consider premium in most other countries. So the skills we get from the high achievers will be accurate and constant in most countries. \n\nWe know from [here](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/08\/24\/how-much-americans-earn-at-every-age.html) that average income in the USA is ```$56,516```. So we created three separate salary class from this survey that we will use in our analysis. These are \n\n1. Less than \\$50K: We will consider this as low income.\n2. \\$50K to \\$150K: This range will consider to medium income.\n3. More than \\$150K: This range is considered to be the highest income achievers.\n\n\nNow that we have created a separate salary class, it will be easier using this in our analysis to differentiate high salary achievers. But first, let's see the main skills we need to get a high paying job.","16fd901d":"We are seeing that some role is very popular among data scientists and ML engineers. These are: \n\n* Analyze and understand data to influence product or business decision\n* Build prototypes to explore and applying machine learning to new areas\n* Experimentation and iteration to improve existing ML models\n\nTo get high-quality jobs you have to very proficient in this type of role. For example, you should be very comfortable analyzing complex data often come in raw form and make a decision that will increase company growth and success. Secondly, building prototypes to explore and applying machine learning to new areas. To master this, you have to know machine learning algorithms. You need to learn machine learning model insights and how to apply to a new field. These are not easy skills but you can learn by practising. So we should start practising these skills. We can also use Kaggle or personal projects to build a foundation in these roles. ","4f948776":"We are seeing all of the AutoML methods is popular among high salary achievers. Like automated full pipeline that enables automatically build end-to-end ml pipeline ( e.g Google AutoML ). If you want to learn more about AutoML and their use case [watch this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Rsg_XzgGqZw). So above we see some popular AutoML method. These are \n* Automated hyperparameter tuning (e.g. hyperopt, ray.tune) \n* Automated feature engineering\/selection (e.g. tpot, boruta_py)\n* Automated model selection (e.g. auto-sklearn, xcessiv) etc\n* Automation of full ML pipeline ( e.g Google AutoML )\n\nWe should have a foundation in the above method to stand out from the crowd and keep ourself ahead. This is a new invention in the ML field that makes engineer life a lot easy. For example, manual hyper tuning is hard and time-consuming and error-prone. But AutoML hyper tuning can reduce that a lot. We need to grasp this technology asap. For that, we have to know which platform or libraries expert is using for AutoML.","5b5cc150":"We are seeing that towards data science, journal, twitter, kaggle forums are good sources of the virtual medium that can we use to getting to know high salary achievers in DS & ML. For example, we can use Kaggle forums and Twitter to build a relationship with them and these media is also great sources of communication and sharing ideas. Often time many high achievers post important posts in these media that we can use to learn from. \n\nThese media sources are important. But we have to remember that this is a virtual relationship. And, as expert says that real-life relationship is much more effective compared to others. \n\nWell, you can also use the media mentioned above to build real-life relationships but one of the most popular ways of doing this will be attending `meetup, conferences`. Before we mentioned, a lot of technical products and companies. Well, these companies regularly arrange meetup and conference that you can use as a starting point. For example, Kaggle recently started kaggle days in different parts of the globe.\n\nIn this type of meetup, there are a lot of inspiring people and ds\/ml and other management people come. You can make a great relationship from there.

But to master these, you have to use tools and also you have to have a solid foundation in tools for building algorithms, analyzing data. Tools are different in a different field. For DS & ML we have separate tools. There are some common tools available for DS & ML. Like programming language, IDE's, notebooks, visualization libraries, ML frameworks etc. Also, there are other types of tools which automate these tools. We will talk about both.\n\n\n* **Programming language**: a Programming language is a foundation for our tools. There are a lot of options to choose from. We can use to 2019 Kaggle survey to data to find out language popularity. But there is already insight available for this. So let's use that. [From here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/strangemane\/evolution-of-a-kaggler#what-programming-languages-do-you-use-on-a-regular-basis) we know that Python is the most popular programming language. Because of its versatility, it used heavily in model building, visualizing, analysing etc. R is the third and it is useful for statistical analysis. And we are seeing SQL is in the second position because we DS & ML people always need to tackle with the relational database. I assumed you already have fluency Python or R. So to be a valuable data scientist or ML engineer we have to master Python and SQL.\n\n* **IDE's, notebook**: [From here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/strangemane\/evolution-of-a-kaggler#how-we-analyze) we are seeing Jupyter notebook is popular among data scientist. \n\n* **Frameworks and libraries**: [From here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/strangemane\/evolution-of-a-kaggler#which-of-the-following-machine-learning-frameworks-do-you-use-on-a-regular-basis) we know that sci-kit-learn, tensorflow, Keras is dominant libraries in ML. For visualization, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly are popular. \n\nWe must have a solid understanding of the above tools. I hope you already have a basic understanding of these tools. \n\n\n**We already familiar with these tools, let's talk about something new**<br>\nNow we are going to see a new tool that automates our DS & ML work a lot. This is called AutoML. We are going to see now how high salary achievers use AutoML. A new technology that is changing the machine learning community.\n\nAutomated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating end-to-end the process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. In a typical machine learning application, practitioners have a dataset consisting of input data points to train on. There are different kinds of AutoML available.
