However after the reopening of schools in September, the trend is seen to be reversing and the level of engagement in marginalized districts is lower than in other districts. This can be explained in the following way:\n\nAs of September 2, 2020, 73 percent of the 100 largest districts in America have chosen to instruct fully online, according to [Education Week](https:\/\/soeonline.american.edu\/blog\/digital-divide-in-education). This affects over eight million students. While schools in more affluent districts are able to provide laptops to all students in need, others don\u2019t have the funding. To help increase equity, some districts have held fundraising events. For example, Chicago public schools received $50 million to provide high-speed internet to 100,000 students. Whereas other districts who lack funding, such as Palo Verde Unified School District in California, provided learning packets every two weeks instead of holding online classes.\n\n**State intervention, practices or policies and there relationship to digital learning**\n\nTo help in bridging this gap,there  are states that have come up with policies that will aid in reducing this inequality. For example, some states have ensured that every student has access to Wi-Fi and a computer. The California Bridging the Digital Divide Fund raised $12.3 million to help allocate supplies to students, and a California digital divide task force and fund collected donations that bought 56,700 laptops and provided 94,000 hot spots, according to [EdSource](https:\/\/edsource.org\/).Chicago public schools have also made headway, providing free high-speed internet to 100,000 students. Additionally, they have begun building a permanent support system for Chicago families known as Chicago Connected. This effort works with philanthropic partners to bridge initial costs and will provide internet access to families who need it most.","1427ba3d":"Does connectivity have an influence on engagement and access?","963c2f87":"There is a steady increase in engagement levels from January to March 2020.

This is the time when most of schools were closed down indefinately. This explains the drop in the level of engagement from month 3. This brought about a lot of confusion and uncertainty in the education sector. Issues such as prolonged closure, uncertainty about the timing of reopening, likely constriction in the academic calendar and the resultant learning discontinuity among students forced the states and educational institutions to find alternative options to assuage the varied impacts. This is where the digital\/online learning came into play. \n\nFrom July onwards, the level of engagement is seen to be going up and even higher than before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. This is because, schools,institutions and even corporates started using online platforms for learning and working from home.

Low-poverty schools are defined as public schools where 25.0 percent or less of the students are eligible for FRPL\n2. mid-low poverty schools are those where 25.1 to 50.0 percent of the students are eligible for FRPL\n3. mid-high poverty schools are those where 50.1 to 75.0 percent of the students are eligible for FRPL\n4. high-poverty schools are those where more than 75.0 percent of the students are eligible for FRPL.\n\nTherefore, I will use this information to make assumptions on which districts are marginalized and those that are not.
