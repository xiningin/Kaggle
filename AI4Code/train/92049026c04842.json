Exploratory Data Analysis","fb299b74":"As we observe, the deposit_type as 'Non Refund' and the 'is_canceled' column are correlated in a counter-intuitive way. Over 99% of people who paid the entire amount upfront have canceled their hotel bookings. This raises the question if there is something wrong with the data (or the description). What else stands out for Non Refund deposits? Here is a table of all mean values of the data, grouped by deposit type.","39f5af76":"# 1. Business Understanding\n\nAn Online travel booking company is suffering from loss in revenue because of the uncertain booking cancelation of its customers. The company wants to know which customer will cancel the booking. As a data-scientist we have to help the company to predict whether the customer will cancel the booking or not. We have all the booking details like arrival_date_year, stays_in_week_nights, arrival_date_day_of_month etc of the customers from various countries. We have to do some data analysis to answer some questions and we have to work on Machine Learning model(s) to help predict whether the customer will cancel the booking or not.\n\nWe will focus on Exploratory Data Analysis for answering business questions first and then move on to the prediction approach.","6bfa199b":"### Q1: Read the dataset and visualize the target column (i.e. is_cancel).
