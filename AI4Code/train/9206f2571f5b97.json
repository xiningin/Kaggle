to move in syncro with the others as tenure increases. It does not seem that there is any significant correlation between the number of active Additional Services and tenure, although people with borderline tenures have an extremely high number of Additional Services.\n\nIt's weird that so many people with high tenures have so many additional services. Is it just that there are many people with maximum tenure although the percentage of additional services across tenure level stays the same?

Spoiler: No. See following graph that proves that elderly are proportionally more connected than youngsters and are only a reduced percentage of the population).\n\nMultipleLines do not seem to affect the churn rate.\n\nShorter-term contract renewals are highly correlated with the churn rate.

Possible explanations:\n- Launch offer: all additional services forever included at a discounted price.\n- Selection bias: the first customers are the ones who appreciate the most the services offered by the company.\n\nEither case, we can dismiss the hypothesis that additional services are accumulated through tenure, for two reasons:\n- There is a strong spike up in the percentage and number of users with all the services around tenure = 70. Nonetheless, the trend in percentage of users with all the services grows constantly, while the absolute number of the individual services stays pretty much constant across tenure levels. This means the the increase in percentage is justifiable only by a convenient launch offer all-inclusive, that rules out the large amount of active offers for customers with extremely high tenure. [This regression](#another_cell) confirms our result;\n- if there was a cumulation of benefits, the drop on the 69th tenure value could be hardly justifiable, whereas it could be justified by a change in the offer or a decrease in interest towards the company.","b57c2039":"0.274 is going to be our threshold.

Although unlikely, it is also possible that these services get cumulated with tenure, and thus their effect on the churn only reflects the negative impact of tenure on the churn rate; in the next cells we will try to figure out whether this is true or not.\n\n- StreamingTV and StreamingMovies do not seem to have a large enough effect on customer Churn Rate.","38059a64":"Let's compute some last computations before extracting the Dummy Variables from our dataset and proceeding to the Regression Part.","c959e496":"To assess whether additional services are accumulated through tenure (e.g. fidalty programs), we run a lmplot for each additional Internet service.","73c9cafc":"Most of the variables differentiate between \"No\" and \"No internet service\".

For this reason, we are going to exclude _MonthlyCharges_ from our model, and then re-run our VIF analysis. This time around, we expect a low VIF for both _InternetService_ variables.\n\nWe are also going to re-insert in our regression _OnlineBackup_ and _DeviceProtection_, which we removed earlier on, as they might have been affected by multicollinearity.","d45224e0":"This is our final model.
