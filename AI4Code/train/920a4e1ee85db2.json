However, after this process, the input features are no longer identifiable, and you cannot make any inference based only on the output of t-SNE. Hence it is mainly a data exploration and visualization technique.*","a67bc490":"### If you have worked with a dataset before with a lot of features, you can fathom how difficult it is to understand or explore the relationships between the features. Not only it makes the EDA process difficult but also affects the machine learning model\u2019s performance since the chances are that you might overfit your model or violate some of the assumptions of the algorithm, like the independence of features in linear regression. This is where dimensionality reduction comes in. In machine learning, dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. By reducing the dimension of your feature space, you have fewer relationships between features to consider which can be explored and visualized easily and also you are less likely to overfit your model.","cae07a70":"### t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)","f5ced717":"Linear dimensional reduction using PCA\n\n\nNon Linear dimensional reduction using t-SNE","cc8ca290":"* Feature Elimination\n* Feature Selection\n* Feature Extraction","be821cb5":"# Introduction to t-SNE\n","b16b2e4a":"* #### The algorithms starts by calculating the probability of similarity of points in high-dimensional space and calculating the probability of similarity of points in the corresponding low-dimensional space.
