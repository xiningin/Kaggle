They will make sure that the most vulnerable will have access to the vaccine first. Reassuringly, current data on COVID-19 shows good outcomes for people with Crohn's and Colitis, including those in the high risk (shielding) group.\n\nHealth and social care workers are considered the highest priority for vaccination. This is because they are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus, and they also have a high risk of transmitting the virus to the vulnerable patients they care for.\n\nThe next priority for vaccination is those who are at increased risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19. Based on currently available UK data, this includes: people over the age of 50, with the risk increasing with age. People with underlying co-morbidities including chronic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, malignancy, obesity and dementia.With help from medical experts, the government has also identified people who are at risk of serious illness from COVID-19 - these are people who are in the extremely clinically vulnerable\/ high risk group and are shielding.\n\n\nThis information is not final - the work of the committee is ongoing and they will consider additional risk factors like ethnicity and gender (as well as many others) as more information becomes available. They must also consider how effective and safe the vaccine is in different age or risk groups - and how long the protection will last. This is not yet known as the vaccines are still being developed and tested. The aim is to create a vaccine that is safe for most people, including those taking immunosuppressive medicines.\n\nCrohn's & Colitis UK are working with the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) to ensure that higher risk people with Crohn\u2019s or Colitis are prioritised for the vaccine. Decisions will be based on the science and will protect those most at risk. \n\nThis year, more people will be offered the flu vaccine in England, including those who are shielding or live with someone who is. https:\/\/www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk\/news\/coronavirus-covid-19-advice","17ebcd97":"#Dexamethasone (a steroid) as a treatment for COVID-19\n\nDexamethasone is a steroid used to reduce inflammation in the body. A clinical trial called the RECOVERY Trial found dexamethasone is an effective treatment in preventing some deaths in people who are seriously unwell with COVID-19 \u2013 these are patients who are in hospital on oxygen or on ventilators.\n\nDexamethasone only works for people who have become seriously unwell with COVID-19 and require oxygen or a ventilator. It is not effective for people with mild symptoms (those who do not need help with their breathing). In the rare cases where a person becomes seriously unwell, their body produces excessive and damaging inflammation as they try to fight off the virus. This is known as a cytokine storm, and in people with COVID-19 leads to severe inflammation in the lungs \u2013 making it difficult to breathe. Dexamethasone works by reducing this inflammation. But for people who are not experiencing a cytokine storm, reducing the activity of the immune system makes it more difficult for the body to fight off infections. \n\nThere is no evidence that taking steroids for Crohn\u2019s or Colitis will protect you from COVID-19, as dexamethasone only works for people who need help with their breathing. The timing and dosage of dexamethasone to treat COVID-19 is very different to how steroids are given to treat Crohn's and Colitis. Dexamethasone needs to be given for for a short time period and at a precise point in the infection to work.https:\/\/www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk\/news\/coronavirus-covid-19-advice","4bffc567":"![](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcShR8TnqprelW8fdRltNTvVDJaUe_HjCtBetg&usqp=CAU)flipper.diff.org","c79a54de":"#What research is happening on the Coronavirus and Crohn's and Colitis?\n\nScientists and healthcare professionals across the world are united in their mission to better understand the coronavirus, to find treatments and develop a vaccine.
