By the way, [Alexander Dyakonov](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dyakonov), a former top-1 kaggler, loves the simplest k-NN but with the tuned object similarity metric;\n- Good interpretability. There are exceptions: if the number of neighbors is large, the interpretability deteriorates (\"We did not give him a loan, because he is similar to the 350 clients, of which 70 are the bad, and that is 12% higher than the average for the dataset\").\n\nCons:\n- Method considered fast in comparison with compositions of algorithms, but the number of neighbors used for classification is usually large (100-150) in real life, in which case the algorithm will not operate as fast as a decision tree.\n- If a dataset has many variables, it is difficult to find the right weights and to determine which features are not important for classification\/regression.\n- Dependency on the selected distance metric between the objects. Selecting the Euclidean distance by default is often unfounded. You can find a good solution by grid searching over parameters, but this becomes very time consuming for large datasets.\n- There are no theoretical ways to choose the number of neighbors \u2013 only grid search (though this is often true for all hyperparameters of all models). In the case of a small number of neighbors, the method is sensitive to outliers, that is, it is inclined to overfit.\n- As a rule, it does not work well when there are a lot of features due to the \"curse of dimensionality\". Professor Pedro Domingos, a well-known member in the ML community, talks about it [here](https:\/\/homes.cs.washington.edu\/~pedrod\/papers\/cacm12.pdf) in his popular paper, \"A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning\"; also \"the curse of dimensionality\" is described in the Deep Learning book in [this chapter](http:\/\/www.deeplearningbook.org\/contents\/ml.html).\n\nThis is a lot of information, but, hopefully, this article will be a great reference for you for a long time :)","b30ba4a5":"Let's list the best parameters and the corresponding mean accuracy from cross-validation.","24d7028c":"## 3. Nearest Neighbors Method\n\n*The nearest neighbors method* (k-Nearest Neighbors, or k-NN) is another very popular classification method that is also sometimes used in regression problems. This, like decision trees, is one of the most comprehensible approaches to classification. The underlying intuition is that you look like your neighbors. More formally, the method follows the compactness hypothesis: if the distance between the examples is measured well enough, then similar examples are much more likely to belong to the same class.","3fa8d50b":"For the right group, we can easily see that we only need one extra partition using \"coordinate less than or equal to 18\". But, for the left group, we need three more. Note that the entropy of a group where all of the balls are the same color is equal to 0 ($\\log_2{1} = 0$).\n\nWe have successfully constructed a decision tree that predicts ball color based on its position. This decision tree may not work well if we add any balls because it has perfectly fit to the training set (initial 20 balls). If we wanted to do well in that case, a tree with fewer \"questions\" or splits would be more accurate, even if it does not perfectly fit the training set.

However, cross-validation is computationally expensive when you have a lot of data.\n \nCross-validation is a very important technique in machine learning and can also be applied in statistics and econometrics. It helps with hyperparameter tuning, model comparison, feature evaluation, etc. More details can be found [here](https:\/\/sebastianraschka.com\/blog\/2016\/model-evaluation-selection-part1.html) (blog post by Sebastian Raschka) or in any classic textbook on machine (statistical) learning.","8422dd1e":"For another example, if you do not know how to tag a Bluetooth-headset on an online listing, you can find 5 similar headsets, and, if 4 of them are tagged as \"accessories\" and only 1 as \"Technology\", then you will also  label it under \"accessories\".\n \nTo classify each sample from the test set, one needs to perform the following operations in order:\n1. Calculate the distance to each of the samples in the training set.\n2. Select $k$ samples from the training set with the minimal distance to them.\n3. The class of the test sample will be the most frequent class among those $k$ nearest neighbors.\n\nThe method adapts quite easily for the regression problem: on step 3, it returns not the class, but the number \u2013 a mean (or median) of the target variable among neighbors.\n \nA notable feature of this approach is its laziness \u2013 calculations are only done during the prediction phase, when a test sample needs to be classified. No model is constructed from the training examples beforehand. In contrast, recall that for decision trees in the first half of this article the tree is constructed based on the training set, and the classification of test cases occurs relatively quickly by traversing through the tree.\n \nNearest neighbors is a well-studied approach. There exist many important theorems claiming that, on \"endless\" datasets, it is the optimal method of classification.

Then the procedure is repeated recursively until the entropy is zero (or some small value to account for overfitting).

Pros and Cons of Decision Trees and the Nearest Neighbors Method\n\n### Decision trees\n\nPros:\n- Generation of clear human-understandable classification rules, e.g. \"if age <25 and is interested in motorcycles, deny the loan\". This property is called interpretability of the model.\n- Decision trees can be easily visualized, i.e. both the model itself (the tree) and prediction for a certain test object (a path in the tree) can \"be interpreted\".\n- Fast training and forecasting.\n- Small number of model parameters.\n- Supports both numerical and categorical features.\n\nCons:\n \n- The trees are very sensitive to the noise in input data; the whole model could change if the training set is slightly modified (e.g. remove a feature, add some objects). This impairs the interpretability of the model.\n- Separating border built by a decision tree has its limitations \u2013 it consists of hyperplanes perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, which is inferior in quality to some other methods, in practice.\n- We need to avoid overfitting by pruning, setting a minimum number of samples in each leaf, or defining a maximum depth for the tree. Note that overfitting is an issue for all machine learning methods.\n- Instability. Small changes to the data can significantly change the decision tree. This problem is tackled with decision tree ensembles (discussed next time).\n- The optimal decision tree search problem is NP-complete. Some heuristics are used in practice such as greedy search for a feature with maximum information gain, but it does not guarantee finding the globally optimal tree.\n- Difficulties to support missing values in the data. Friedman estimated that it took about 50% of the code to support gaps in data in CART (an improved version of this algorithm is implemented in `sklearn`).\n- The model can only interpolate but not extrapolate (the same is true for random forests and tree boosting). That is, a decision tree makes constant prediction for the objects that lie beyond the bounding box set by the training set in the feature space. In our example with the yellow and blue balls, it would mean that the model gives the same predictions for all balls with positions >19 or <0.","a48c95ab":"Here, the tree proved to be better than the nearest neighbors algorithm: 94.2%\/94.6% accuracy for cross-validation and hold-out respectively.

Some of the most popular tasks T in machine learning are the following:\n\n- classification of an instance to one of the categories based on its features;\n- regression \u2013 prediction of a numerical target feature based on other features of an instance;\n- clustering \u2013 identifying partitions of instances based on the features of these instances so that the members within the groups are more similar to each other than those in the other groups;\n- anomaly detection \u2013 search for instances that are \"greatly dissimilar\" to the rest of the sample or to some group of instances;\n- and so many more.\n\nA good overview is provided in the \"Machine Learning basics\" chapter of [\"Deep Learning\"](http:\/\/www.deeplearningbook.org) (by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, 2016).\n\nExperience E  refers to data (we can't go anywhere without it). Machine learning algorithms can be divided into those that are trained in supervised or unsupervised manner. In unsupervised learning tasks, one has a set consisting of instances described by a set of features. In supervised learning problems, there's also a target variable, which is what we would like to be able to predict, known for each instance in a training set. ","e47ba82f":"## 4.

Then, from the bottom up, some nodes of the tree are removed by comparing the quality of the tree with and without that partition (comparison is performed using *cross-validation*, more on this below).\n\nThe picture below is an example of a dividing border built in an overfitted tree. \n","a6484034":"<img src=\"https:\/\/habrastorage.org\/webt\/sz\/xq\/sn\/szxqsndrwbeggreswz63mnot2wg.png\" width=30% \/>","6884dc03":"Let's assess prediction quality on our hold-out set with a simple metric, the proportion of correct answers (accuracy).

Note that this performance is achieved by using random parameters.","73da1a02":"\nLet's see the best parameters combination and the corresponding accuracy from cross-validation:\n\n","567447a2":"Furthermore, when there are a lot of numeric features in a dataset, each with a lot of unique values, only the top-N of the thresholds described above are selected, i.e. only use the top-N that give maximum gain. The process is to construct a tree of depth 1, compute the entropy (or Gini uncertainty), and select the best thresholds for comparison.\n\nTo illustrate, if we split by \"Salary $\\leq$ 34.5\", the left subgroup will have an entropy of 0 (all clients are \"bad\"), and the right one will have an entropy of 0.954 (3 \"bad\" and 5 \"good\", you can check this yourself as it will be part of the assignment). The information gain is roughly 0.3.\nIf we split by \"Salary $\\leq$ 95\", the left subgroup will have the entropy of 0.97 (6 \"bad\" and 4 \"good\"), and the right one will have the entropy of 0 (a group containing only one object). The information gain is about 0.11.\nIf we calculate information gain for each partition in that manner, we can select the thresholds for comparison of each numeric feature before the construction of a large tree (using all features).\n\nMore examples of numeric feature discretization can be found in posts like [\"A Simple Guide to Entropy-Based Discretization\"](http:\/\/kevinmeurer.com\/a-simple-guide-to-entropy-based-discretization\/) or [\"Discretizing a continuous variable using Entropy\"](http:\/\/clear-lines.com\/blog\/post\/Discretizing-a-continuous-variable-using-Entropy.aspx).

KB Irani, \"Machine Learning\", 1992).","ace01a30":"In our next case, we solve a binary classification problem (approve\/deny a loan) based on the \"Age\", \"Home-ownership\", \"Income\", and \"Education\" features.\n \nThe decision tree as a machine learning algorithm is essentially the same thing as the diagram shown above; we incorporate a stream of logical rules of the form \"feature $a$ value is less than $x$ and feature $b$ value is less than $y$ ... => Category 1\" into a tree-like data structure. The advantage of this algorithm is that they are easily interpretable. For example, using the above scheme, the bank can explain to the client why they were denied for a loan: e.g the client does not own a house and her income is less than 5,000.\n\nAs we'll see later, many other models, although more accurate, do not have this property and can be regarded as more of a \"black box\" approach, where it is harder to interpret how the input data was transformed into the output. Due to this \"understandability\" and similarity to human decision-making (you can easily explain your model to your boss), decision trees have gained immense popularity.

Let's create a set of points on a plane (2 features), each point will be one of two classes (+1 for red, or -1 for yellow). If you look at it as a classification problem, it seems very simple: the classes are separated by a line. ","51d07bcf":"Let's plot the data. Informally, the classification problem in this case is to build some \"good\" boundary separating the two classes (the red dots from the yellow). Machine learning for this case boils down to choosing a good separating border. A straight line will be too simple while some complex curve snaking by each red dot will be too complex and will lead us to making mistakes on new samples. Intuitively, some smooth boundary, or at least a straight line or a hyperplane, would work well on new data.","99afce7b":"<img align='center' src='https:\/\/habrastorage.org\/webt\/o4\/nx\/p7\/o4nxp7itpg_zxowtmffs5xh3bbw.png'><br>","98f2e908":"### How to Build a Decision Tree\n\nEarlier, we saw that the decision to grant a loan is made based on age, assets, income, and other variables. But what variable to look at first? Let's discuss a simple example where all the variables are binary.\n \nRecall the game of \"20 Questions\", which is often referenced when introducing decision trees. You've probably played this game -- one person thinks of a celebrity while the other tries to guess by asking only \"Yes\" or \"No\" questions. What question will the guesser ask first? Of course, they will ask the one that narrows down the number of the remaining options the most. Asking \"Is it Angelina Jolie?\" would, in the case of a negative response, leave all but one celebrity in the realm of possibility. In contrast, asking \"Is the celebrity a woman?\" would reduce the possibilities to roughly half. That is to say, the \"gender\" feature separates the celebrity dataset much better than other features like \"Angelina Jolie\", \"Spanish\", or \"loves football.\" This reasoning corresponds to the concept of information gain based on entropy.","e32fcd55":"### Class DecisionTreeClassifier in Scikit-learn\nThe main parameters of the [`sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) class are:\n\n- `max_depth` \u2013 the maximum depth of the tree;\n- `max_features` - the maximum number of features with which to search for the best partition (this is necessary with a large number of features because it would be \"expensive\" to search for partitions for *all* features);\n- `min_samples_leaf` \u2013 the minimum number of samples in a leaf. This parameter prevents creating trees where any leaf would have only a few members.\n\nThe parameters of the tree need to be set depending on input data, and it is usually done by means of *cross-validation*, more on this below.","ca1c67f6":"**Conclusion**: the simplest heuristics for handling numeric features in a decision tree is to sort its values in ascending order and check only those thresholds where the value of the target variable changes.","9b6b09a6":"where $p_i$ is the probability of finding the system in the $i$-th state. This is a very important concept used in physics, information theory, and other areas. Entropy can be described as the degree of chaos in the system.
