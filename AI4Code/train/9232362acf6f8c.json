Apart from that we know that if we are doing classification problem then just accuracy is not just the parameter to evaluate our model there are certain other things we need to keep in our mind when we are working on classification model.\n\n###### That are precision, recall, confusion matrix, True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, False Negative.\n\n###### Now lets talk about our problem that is employee churn so here we have to more focus on True Positive and Flase Positive. To understand this in our problem True Positive are those employees who are leaving the company and our ML model predicts them correctly that they are leaving the company and Flase Positive are those employees who are going to leave the company but our model predicts that they will stay in our company. So we need to keep in mind before selecting any ML model from the above 4 models that which model has more precision that is which model has less false positive.\n\n###### By examining all the 4 model we realized that Random Forest wins the race in with high precision and accuracy.
