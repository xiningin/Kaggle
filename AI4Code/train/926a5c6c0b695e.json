The Automatic EDA report is created. The extensive explanations for models are computed.\n\nThe `Compete` mode is perfect for data competitions. Many algorithms are tuned, stacked and ensembled. Golden Features and Features Selection are performed.\n\nLet's check above two modes in this competition.\n\nIf you like the below results, please tell your friends about MLJAR AutoML and give us a star https:\/\/github.com\/mljar\/mljar-supervised \n\nThank you!"}}
