You can find pretty good summary from evidence based researches from \nDr. Ali Abdaal [Here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C0syvUws1ps). In short, i'm wandering about what impacts does coffee have on a coding. That's why i start this little project.\n\n### Data description\nLebanon ranked first among the Arab countries in consuming coffee. This short survey focused on the Lebanese programmers only. The aims were to examine if the Lebanese programmers consume coffee above the normal average level comparing to the average consumption in Lebanon which is 1.4 cups of coffee per day.\n\n### Let start with questions\n- Q1: Do programmers consume coffee above normal average office worker and healthy consumption ?\n- Q2: Drinking more coffee increases coding hours ?\n- Q3: Which types of coffee would lead to longer coding hours ?\n- Q4: Some coders said \"*Drinking coffee help to solve a bug !?*\" Is that true ?\n- Q5: What is coffee preference of each group of people (Age and Gender) ?\n- Q6: Favorite time to drink coffee for coders ?\n\n**Notation :** \n- This is my first time writing a notebook. If you have any suggestions (even typo), feel free to leave a comment or upvote if you found it useful\n- The data is drawed from a small group of coder in Labanon so the conclusion i made is not general \n- This is for EDA practice and serving my curiosity\n- High Coding Hours\tmay not imply high productivity\n\n### Table of content\n[1.

This makes perfect sense why most companies choose to have one coffee station, simply a instant coffee in a jar or small instant coffee machine and some sugar on the side. Not only it's easy to use but also less costly. <br>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/procaffe.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Franke-A400-banner.jpg\" width=\"700px\">\n\n\n","fd0ef3df":"# Conclusion","bb7429bb":"# Q2 \n**Drinking more coffee increases coding hours ?**\n","fb7a2e89":"- Most coders think sometimes drinking coffee help to solve a bug.\n- For female coder (30 to 39), Drink Americano tends to solve a bug."}}
