We'll get into more concepts soon!","17938e07":"### Tokenization \n\n`doc` is the annotated text (that we did using the loaded langauge model). Now, let us tokenize our text. Tokenization has been done along with the above process. We can now print the **chunks**. The tokenized parts are called **chunks**. As a naive description, tokenization is nothing but breaking the long sentences\/text corpus into a small chunks (or mostly words).

It features\nthe **fastest syntactic parser** in the world, convolutional **neural network models**\nfor tagging, parsing and **named entity recognition** and easy **deep learning**\nintegration.

This help us in giving grammatical labels to our Text Corpus. The function `nlp()` takes only string so let us use `str()` to combine all our rows above into one long string.

NLP has become one of the very popular areas of interest due to increase in NLP and also development in Information Extraction (IE) methodologies. \n\n### Sources of Natural Langauge\n\n* Social Media  (like FB Posts\/Comments, Twitter Tweets, Youtube Comments)\n* Speech Transcripts (Call Center Conversations) \n* Voice Agents (Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple Siri) \n\n### Some Applications of NLP\n\n* Automated Customer Service \n* Chatbots\n* Social Listening\n* Market Trends and much more","5df2552a":"### Lemmatization\n\nLemmetiztion is the process of retrieving the root word of the current word.
