This is a model which was trained on a english language corpus to predict the next sequence of sentences and thus understands the structure of the language.\n\nWe just need to fine tune this modle on our data corpus which then can be used to build a classifier.\n\nI am not buidling any classifier as yet because I don't have any idea as to what we need to classify.
