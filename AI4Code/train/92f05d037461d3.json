The standard deviation will be different for log returns computed over longer or shorter intervals, for this reason it is usually normalized to a 1-year period and the annualized standard deviation is called **volatility**. \n\nIn this competition, you will be given 10 minutes of book data and we ask you to predict what the volatility will be in the following 10 minutes. Volatility will be measured as follows:\n\nWe will compute the log returns over all consecutive book updates and we define the **realized volatility, $\\sigma$,** as the squared root of the sum of squared log returns.\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{t}r_{t-1, t}^2}\n$$\nWhere we use **WAP** as price of the stock to compute log returns.\n\nWe want to keep definitions as simple and clear as possible, so that Kagglers without financial knowledge will not be penalized. So we are not annualizing the volatility and we are assuming that log returns have 0 mean.","db3d1f28":"**Weighted averaged price**\n\nThe order book is also one of the primary source for stock valuation. A fair book-based valuation must take two factors into account: the level and the size of orders. In this competition we used weighted averaged price, or WAP, to calculate the instantaneous stock valuation and calculate realized volatility as our target. \n\nThe formula of WAP can be written as below, which takes the top level price and volume information into account:\n\n$$ WAP = \\frac{BidPrice_{1}*AskSize_{1} + AskPrice_{1}*BidSize_{1}}{BidSize_{1} + AskSize_{1}} $$\n\nAs you can see, if two books have both bid and ask offers on the same price level respectively, the one with more offers in place will generate a lower stock valuation, as there are more intended seller in the book, and more seller implies a fact of more supply on the market resulting in a lower stock valuation.\n\nNote that in most of cases, during the continuous trading hours, an order book should not have the scenario when bid order is higher than the offer, or ask, order. In another word, most likely, the bid and ask should never be **in cross.**\n\nIn this competition the target is constructed from the WAP. The WAP of the order book snapshot is 147.5317797.","113c5ebd":"In this competition, our target is to predict short-term realized volatility. Although the order book and trade data for the target cannot be shared, we can still present the realized volatility calculation using the feature data we provided. \n\nAs realized volatility is a statistical measure of price changes on a given stock, to calculate the price change we first need to have a stock valuation at the fixed interval (1 second).

As you can see the book is not as dense as the previous one, and one can say, compared with the previous one, this book is **less liquid**.","81c961e1":"# Log returns\n\n**How can we compare the price of a stock between yesterday and today?**\n\nThe easiest method would be to just take the difference. This is definitely the most intuitive way, however **price differences** are not always comparable across stocks. For example, let's assume that we have invested $\\$$1000 dollars in both stock A and stock B and that stock A moves from $\\$$100 to $\\$$102 and stock B moves from $\\$$10 to $\\$$11. We had a total of 10 shares of A ($\\$1000 \\ \/ \\ \\$100 = 10$) which led to a profit of $10 \\cdot (\\$102 - \\$100) = \\$20$ and a total of 100 shares of B that yielded \\$100. So the price increase was larger for stock **A**, although the move was proportionally much larger for stock B.\n\nWe can solve the above problem by dividing the move by the starting price of the stock, effectively computing the percentage change in price, also known as the **stock return**. In our example, the return for stock A was $\\frac{\\$102 - \\$100 }{\\$100} = 2\\%$, while for stock B it was $\\frac{\\$11 - \\$10 }{\\$10} = 10\\%$. The stock return coincides with the percentage change in our invested capital.\n\nReturns are widely used in finance, however **log returns** are preferred whenever some mathematical modelling is required. Calling $S_t$ the price of the stock $S$ at time $t$, we can define the log return between $t_1$ and $t_2$ as:\n$$\nr_{t_1, t_2} = \\log \\left( \\frac{S_{t_2}}{S_{t_1}} \\right)\n$$\nUsually, we look at log returns over fixed time intervals, so with 10-minute log return we mean $r_t = r_{t - 10 min, t}$.\n\nLog returns present several advantages, for example:\n- they are additive across time $r_{t_1, t_2} + r_{t_2, t_3} = r_{t_1, t_3}$\n- regular returns cannot go below -100%, while log returns are not bounded","f1f40718":"**Realized volatility calculation in python**","0478b46b":"The private leaderboard will be built against the real market data collected after the training period, therefore the public and private leaderboard data will have zero overlap.
