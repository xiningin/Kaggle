It is important however to realize correlation does not causation. It is possible that taking the test preparation course did not lead to improved average test scores, but rather those students that took the test preparation course were already more motivated to succeed and would have scored higher regardless if they participated in the test preparation course. Determining causation requires more analysis and data.","288260de":"A visualization of race shows a clear distinction of groups D and E performing better on math scores, while the effect is visually less noticeable for reading scores.

An analysis of the average test scores for students of these groups shows that students whos parents attended at least some college have an advantage over those students whos parents never attended college. Although this finding is not obvious from the visualization, it appears from the fat tails that these results stems from underperforming students who skew their density curve to the left.","0b5e8be4":"Notice discrepencies between males in females in reading and math scores; males score higher in math while females score higher in reading.","a214ce9b":"Notice reading and writing scores are highly correlated - therefore I only compare math and reading scores for the rest of my analysis because comparing writing scores as well seems redundant.","6a0877be":"Students who recieve free\/reduced lunches perform worse than those who get the standard lunch. The reasoning behind this finding is that the lunch variable is a proxy for the student's socioeconomic status.
