But it's not a requirement. There are Alex and Iara who are not formally traned but performing better than their peers. \n\nIt's an amazing sight to see the following details from the grphs given below.\n\n* Alex and Iara share somewhat similiar pattern in the formatl education ( Amazing because it shows equality)\n* Majority of them have fought and won the masters \/ bachelors battle.\n* Even Alex and Iara stands with similiar proportion when it comes to the ultimate battle of formal education - The Phd.","e2963bdd":"## The Weapons","5e3d718b":"## Into the Battle Ground - Arsenal & weapons \n\nA good soldier with proper weapons can easily win a war. Now we are going to analyze the Arsenel used by Alex and Iara and the weapons they forged.\nThis will be a comprehesive study about the weapons and arsenal they use since it matters a lot in the Kaggle battle ground.","9edca022":"## The Arsenel\n\nArsenel used is an integrel part of developing the weaponary. And it is evident that same weapons can be developed using different arsenels. But it is also a fact that same weapons made using different arsels will have different properities like\n* Complexity of code\n* Execution time\n* Memmory usage.. etc.\n\nWe have extracted the list of arsenel used and it's not surprising. Python is been widely used for creating their weapon of choice by both Alex and Iara. It is also rare to see other languages being used in the kaggle battle ground. Python is their favourite arsenel because of the following reasons.\n* Development speed\n* Flexibility\n* Strong community support\n* Simplicity","7a8107d9":"## Precence of Alex and Iara in the whole world\n\nAlex and Iara was part of this world starting from the inception of computers. Their proportion is an important factor in the binary world since it brings peace and prosperity. From the graph below we can observe the following\n* Alex holds the majority in the kaggle battle ground of 2021\n* Iara holds the second majority but it is less that half of the proportion of alex.\n\n* A non uniformity in the proportion of Alex and Iara and others can be observed here. This needs to be changed. For better world prosperity we need them balenced and the others too.","4df85c99":"Alex and Iara are datascience mythological charectoers from the ancient binary world. They have been in this world from the inception of computers. Starting from machine code and travelling to the era of python and other higher level languages they have seen it all.\n\nKaggle has been presented as a new battle ground for both Alex and Iara were they sharpen their skill and fight for better model performance.\n\nYou can find Alex and Iara on every part of the world. Their names represent the majority gender participation.\n\nNow lets dive deep into the battles they have faught, their skills etc etc ....\n","ce4be5f7":"## Jobs done by Alex and Iara\n\nAlex and Iara do have other jobs other than fighting in the kaggle ground. Its an amazing talent to handle both. Kudos to all the kagglers!!!!.\n\n* Similiar to the pattern of formal level of education Alex and Iara follows the same when it comes for their jobs.\n* Majority of Alex and Iara work as a student ( I too feel proud about this since the writer is also a student ).\n* The second and third majority goes to Data scientist and Software engineering."}}
