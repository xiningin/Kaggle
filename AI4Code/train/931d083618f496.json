For next time, I would do that, and do a wordcloud for each of the subjects to see what stands out. However, I did hope from this word cloud I could at least see 'data'. \n\nThere is much more I could do, but I will save that for next time.\n\nAs for a potential machine learning problem, I could see if I could predict the number of subscribers based on the data I have. I think I could do something with the course_title column and do some feature engineering with it. In addition, I could also feature engineer the datetime column to garner more interesting insights as well. ","5fa338e1":"**Interesting to Note:** \n* Seems as if the average price of a course is just under $50 USD\n* Graphic Design courses has the lowest average prices\n* Web Development courses has the largest interquartile range in price.\n* Music courses have the lowest interquatile range in price. \n\nNow what about the relationships price have with the other features?

I try to write in a dry & humourous style, so please bear with me. Thanks buddy! :)*\n\nUdemy has been on my radar for quite sometime, especially during my late night internet browsing sessions for courses\/learning resources\/ etc. Always allured by those great Udemy sales and discounts. I think I once bought a cheap course or two which I never ended up using. Maybe their formating is not for me, maybe their courses aren't too great, or maybe I'm just stuck in my analysis paraylsis which I think happens to the best of us.  Most likely their marketing skills\/cheap price thought the deal was just too good to pass.\n\nAnyways, I found this dataset so let's see what we can find here. Thank you Larxel for uploading. \n\nFor the most part I'm going to do an EDA on the dataset, and if there is a machine learning problem I could do on this dataset I will do that towards the end, if I got time. But first let's pull up the data dictionary so I can start figuring out what kind of questions I could ask.\n\n### Data Dictionary\n\n| Feature| Note |\n|---|---|\n|course_id| ID|\n|course_title|Title of the course.|\n|url|Course URL|\n|is_paid|Is it a paid course or not.|\n|price|Price of the course|\n|num_subscribers|Amount of students subscribed to the course|\n|num_reviews|Number of reviews.|\n|num_lectures|Lectures per course|\n|level|Course diffculty|\n|content_duration|Duration of all course materials in hours|\n|subject|Subject of the course|","382f6560":"* It seems more and more courses are being released each year, however why is there a dip in 2017. Maybe this dataset was created in the middle of 2017. I wonder if there is a full Udemy course dataset outthere, that is more up to date. ","3bbc98d3":"# Guiding Questions.\n\n1. What ist the most popular course in terms of number of subscribers and number of reviews? \n2. What are the most popular subjects?\n3. I wonder if there is a relationship for the length of the course and number of subscribers? \n4. I wonder if there is a relationship between price of the course to number of subscribers?\n\n\nThese are just some quick questions I could think about while looking at my data dictionary and the kaggle dataset preview. I think I'm just going to deep dive from here and see if I could create an interesting story. "}}
