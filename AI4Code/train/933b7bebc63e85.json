If you're interested in learning about reinforcement learning, you are in the right place. As we all know the best way to learn about a topic is to build something and make a kernel about it. My plan is to make a series of notebooks where I work may way towards a full-fledged chess AI named RLC (Reinforcement Learning Chess). \n\nTackling chess is a big challenge, mainly because of its huge state-space. Therefore I start with simpler forms of chess and solve these problems with elementary RL-techniques. Gradually I will expand this untill we end up in a chess AI that can play actual games of chess somewhat intelligibly. The forms of chess I want to cover in my notebooks are:  \n\n#### 1. Move Chess \n- Goal: Learn to find the shortest path between 2 squares on a chess board  \n- Motivation: Move Chess has a small statespace, which allows us to tackle this with simple RL algorithms.\n- Concepts: Dynamic Programming, Policy Evaluation, Policy Improvement, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, Synchronous & Asynchronous back-ups, Monte Carlo (MC) Prediction, MC Control, Temporal Difference (TD) Learning, TD control, TD-lambda, SARSA(-max)\n\n#### 2. Capture Chess\n- Goal: Capture as many pieces from the opponent within n fullmoves\n- Motivation: Piece captures happen more frequently than win-lose-draw events. This give the algorithm more information to learn from.\n- Concepts: Q-learning, value function approximation, experience replay, fixed-q-targets, policy gradients, REINFORCE, actor-critic\n\n\n#### 3. Real Chess (a.k.a. chess)\n- Goal: Play chess competitively against a human beginner\n- Motivation: A RL chess AI\n- Concepts: Monte Carlo Tree Search\n\n#### Other notebooks\n[**Notebook 2: Model free learning**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arjanso\/reinforcement-learning-chess-2-model-free-methods)  \n[**Notebook 3: Q-networks**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arjanso\/reinforcement-learning-chess-3-q-networks)  \n[**Notebook 4: Policy Gradients**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arjanso\/reinforcement-learning-chess-4-policy-gradients)  \n[**Notebook 5: Monte Carlo Tree Search**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arjanso\/reinforcement-learning-chess-5-tree-search)\n\n\nIn my notebooks, I will describe and reference the Reinforcement Learning theory but I will not fully explain it. For that there are resources available that do a match better job at explaining RL than I could. For that my advice would be to check out David Silver's (Deepmind) lectures that are available on Youtube and the book Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto referenced below.","6c9bb5c9":"# References","902efcec":"This value function below shows the expected discounted future reward from state (0,0) = -185","c5f67bef":"**Theory**\n\nIf we want our agent to optimize its rewards, we want its policy to guide behavior towards the states with the highest value. This value can be estimated using bootstrapping:\n* A state (s) is as valuable (V) as the successor state (s') plus the reward (R) for going from s to s'. \n* Since there can be mulitple actions (a) and multiple successor states they are summed and weighted by their probability (pi). \n* In a non-deterministic environment, a given action could result in multiple successor states. We don't have to take this into account for this problem because move chess is a deterministic game.\n* Successor state values are discounted with discount factor (gamma) that varies between 0 and 1.  \n* This gives us the following formula:  \n![](http:\/\/incompleteideas.net\/book\/ebook\/numeqnarraytmp7-2-2.png)  \n\nNote that:\n* The successor state value is also en estimate. \n* Evaluating a state is bootstrapping because you are making an estimate based on another estimate\n* In the code you'll see a synchronous parameter that will be explained later in the policy evaluation section\n\n","887ee2e8":"### The agent\n- The agent is a chess Piece (king, queen, rook, knight or bishop)\n- The agent has a behavior policy determining what the agent does in what state","04b9b72c":"**Python Implementation**","ae50dc14":"Now that we know what the values of the states are, we want to improve our Policy so that we the behavior is guided towards the state with the highest value.

If we use ony 1 iteration instead we call it value iteration.","f93248f5":"1. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction  \n   Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G.
