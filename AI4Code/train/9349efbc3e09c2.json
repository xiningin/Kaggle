","cad6c330":"   Across the United States there are communities that are disproportionally impacted by landfills and other waste facilities, resulting in negative impacts from both an economic and environmental standpoint. With minorities accounting for fifty-six percent of the population near toxic waste sites and landfills, environmental justice is something that impacts people of color  all across the United States (Howerton, 2019). Exposure to landfills up to 2km has proven dangerous to humans and increases the risk of asthma, prostate cancer, and other cancers and diseases (Njoku, Edokpayi and Odiyo, 2019). Environmental justice is defined as the principle that \u201call people and communities are entitled to equal protection of environmental and public health laws and regulations\u201d (Mohai, Pellow, and Roberts, 2009, pg 407). Specifically, when it comes to the location of waste management operations, companies justify the placement of their facilities based off of economic cost. However their decisions take advantage of numerous groups of people by viewing certain communities as the \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d (WITF, 2018).\n\n  This literate programming report analyzes the spatial relationship between race population and landfill locations by county in Wisconsin. The county of Milwaukee historically has one of the largest population of people of color in Wisconsin (WACEC, 2001). By isolating Milwaukee county and joining it with landfill location data, a spatial analysis can be used to determine how much of the county has at one point or another been within a 2km hazardous zone.\n","9385f7e2":"## Data","e968393f":"Viewing the first few rows of the WI counties data set shows the column names which will be needed to isolate the part of the shapefile that represent Milwaukee.

","68543c60":"Through spatial analysis, it is evident that a large portion of Milwaukee County, which has the greatest population of people of color in Wisconsin, has been at one point or another been contaminated by a hazardous radius zone from a past or currently existing landfill. By looking at the table for the wi_counties shapefile, the county of Milwaukee was able to be isolated and made into its own data frame. Once the study area was obtained a spatial join was used to select all landfills within the county\u2019s boundaries for further analysis. A spatial buffer was used to visualize the 2km radius around each landfill to determine the magnitude at which Milwaukee has been contaminated. In conclusion an overwhelming majority of the county has been within proximity to environmental hazards from past and current facilities. Additionally, many buffers observed were close to or overlapped with the shoreline of Lake Michigan which raises extra concerns about the flow of pollutants cross state boarders.\n\n\nTo further improve this study, demographic data by districts could be added as an additional component to identify what specific communities are being disproportionately exposed to conditions that cause greater negative health impacts. This would create a more accurate visual representation of the Environmental Justice concerns that are impacting many communities within Milwaukee. Another element that would further the progress of this spatial analysis would be to separate the landfill data by the type of waste facility it was or is. This information could then be labeled by icons making it easier to identify what possible health risks the neighboring communities might be experiencing depending on what kind of exposure they are living near.","2389e586":"## Background","0277254d":"The wi_counties shapefile as well as the wi_landfills_shapefile are currently stored in Kaggle's database and need to be imported and read into this code which can be done using `gpd.read_file`.","c4a24e31":"## Methods","21ad6dd3":"The landfill data that I will be using in my project is from the WI DNR which shows the locations of both past and present landfills.

Kaggle has a feature which allows one to upload data sets which creates file paths that can be copied and pasted into a code. Geopandas allows for the reading of the shapefiles. Once these files are read, a spatial join can be conducted allowing for the isolation of Milwaukee county. Next step involves using a \u2018buffer\u2019 tool to program rings with a 2km radius around each landfill. This 2km radius will show how much of Milwaukee was once or currently is within a hazardous zone from a given landfill. Once the tools are all implemented, matplotlib will be used to add aesthetic elements to the map.
