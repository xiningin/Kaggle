The CPI inflation stood at 4% YoY in the previous month. The spike in retail inflation was primarily led by a surge in food inflation.\n\nThe food inflation, as measured by the consumer food price index (CFPI), rose to a three-year high of 7.9% YoY in October, mainly due to soaring prices of vegetables, fruits, and pulses. The inflation in food prices has been on a rising trend for the past eight months due to supply disruption led by delayed and uneven monsoon across the country. The majority of the contribution to the increase in food prices came from the rural economy as inflation in the same has doubled in a month from 3.1% YoY in September to 6.3% YoY in October.\n\nOn the other hand, the inflation in miscellaneous, services, pan, tobacco, and intoxicants led to a moderation in core inflation to 3.6% YoY as against 4.2% YoY in the last month. Thus, indicating the prevailing subdued consumption demand in the economy.\n\nGiven that CPI has breached the RBI's medium-term target of 4% and is in sharp contrast with the shrinking industrial activity in the economy, this may complicate the monetary policy decision in December. The likely rate cut decision will depend upon the flexibility of RBI in dealing with the retail inflation and the July-September quarter GDP number expected to be released later this month.\n\nSource: \n\nhttps:\/\/www.indiamacroadvisors.com\/page\/category\/economic-indicators\/inflation-prices\/consumer-price-index\/\n\n","faa96e25":"### Rural","6fdc1fe9":"### Rural","d18b0968":"# Reading Data","554b3589":"# Food and Beverages","6dbe6358":"### Urban","ead4f6b1":"### Urban","f3583d43":"### Rural","084084eb":"### a) Rural","5697f105":"### Urban","ee35779f":"# Consumer Food Price Index","f53f945c":"### a) Rural","6df03596":"### Urban","dc389bdd":"### b) Urban","278d6c93":"### Urban","c8523b01":"# Housing","5b8fd3b2":"### Rural","e1c231c3":"# General Index - All Groups","a1a416d3":"# Clothing and Footwear","870f2a9a":"The data is spread across 6 Groups which we will explore in this notebook. \n6 Groups are:\n    \n* Food and beverages\n* Pan, tobacco and intoxicants\n* Clothing and footwear\n* Housing\n* Fuel and light\n* Miscellaneous\n","89bf85fa":"# Introduction\n\n\n### What is CPI\n\nA Consumer Price Index (CPI) is designed to measure the changes over time in general level of retail prices of selected goods and services that households purchase for the purpose of consumption. The CPI measures price changes by comparing, through time, the cost of a fixed basket of commodities. The basket is based on the expenditures of a target population in a certain reference period. Since the basket contains commodities of unchanging or equivalent quantity and quality, the index reflects only pure price. \n\n\n### History \n\nCPI numbers were originally introduced to provide a measure of changes in the living costs of workers, so that their wages could be compensated to the changing level of prices. However, over the years, CPIs have been widely used as a macroeconomic indicator of inflation, and also as a tool by Government and Central Bank for targeting inflation and monitoring price stability. Hence CPI is considered as one of the most important economic indicators\n\nIn India, segment specific CPIs, namely CPI (IW)- Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers, CPI (AL)- Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers, CPI (RL)- Consumer Price Index for Rural Labourers are being compiled regularly, catering to the need of specific population group. CPI (UNME)- Consumer Price Index for Urban Non-Manual Employees has been discontinued w.e.f. December, 2010. The National Statistical Commission (NSC), under Dr. C. Rangarajan, in its Report (2001), observed that CPI numbers catering to specific segments of the population can be considered as partial indices only. These indices are not oriented to reflect a true picture of the price behavior and effect of price fluctuations of various goods and services\nconsumed by the general population in the country, over a period of time.This Commission, therefore, recommended for compilation of CPI for rural and urban areas.\n\nPresently the consumer price indices compiled in India are CPI for Industrial workers CPI(IW), CPI for Agricultural Labourers CPI(AL) and; Rural Labourers CPI(RL) and (Urban) and CPI(Rural).The CPI(IW) and CPI(AL& RL) compiled are occupation specific and centre specific and are compiled by Labour Bureau. This means that these index numbers measure changes in the retail price of the basket of goods and services consumed by the specific occupational groups in the specific centres. CPI(Urban) and CPI(Rural) are new indices in the group of Consumer price index and has a wider coverage of population. This index compiled by Central Statistical Organisation tries to encompass the entire population and is likely to replace all the other indices presently compiled. In addition to this, Consumer Food Price Indices (CFPI) for all India for rural, urban and combined separately are also released w.e.f May, 2014.\n\n\n### Data\n\nThe Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) calculates the CPI for the country as a whole and for individual states. The Consumer Price Index is released every month at 5.30 p.m. on 12th day of the following month. If it is a holiday, then it is released on the next working day.\n\nPrice data are collected from selected towns by the Field Operations Division of NSSO and from selected villages by the Department of Posts. Price data are received through web portals being maintained by the National Informatics Centre (NIC).\n\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe formula for calculating Consumer Price Index is Laspeyre\u2019s index which is measured as follows;\n\n[Total cost of a fixed basket of goods and services in the current period * 100] divided by Total cost of the same basket in the base period\n\n\n### How CPI Affects Us\nThis index is an important economic indicator and is widely considered as a barometer of inflation, a tool for monitoring price stability and as a deflator in national accounts. The dearness allowance (DA) of Government employees and wage contracts between labour and employer is based on this index.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.arthapedia.in\/index.php?title=Consumer_Price_Index\n\nCPI-Changes_in_the_Revised_Series.pdf\n\n### Motivation for Kernel\n\nThis notebook is going to be fairly simple - exploring the growth in CPI for Urban and Rural for the 6 Groups.
