However, there is another major issue. These length of the time periods is not contant for differnt NGAs and even for the same one's and might also collide.

Here we proposed and implemented a\nprocedure that systematically incorporates various factors that affect agricultural yields in different world regions and different time periods. Any such scheme must be based on an explicit\nmodel, which means making simplifying assumptions. In particular, we assumed that we can use a single agricultural crop, a major carbohydrate source for populations inhabiting each NGA. \n\nNext, due to limitations of historical data on how various cultivation practices (fallowing, irrigation, and fertilization) affected yields in the past, it is difficult to draw much conclusions from the dataset. \ud83c\udf3e\ud83c\udf3d\n\nWhile using generic coefficients is a reasonable first step (and certainly better\nthan not taking these processes into account), what is needed next is an investigation that will allow us to tailor this approach to individual Seshat NGAs, with their different climates and physical environments. Yet another limitation of the present study regards the way in which climate effects are currently handled. A millennium-long time step is far too long for many of the questions that we want to ask about the evolution of complex societies and, particularly, for the periodic breakdowns that they go through. A time step of 1 century, or, better, of a decade, would be much more informative.\n\n","df1cb9ce":"**Observations:** Rice and wheat, followed by maize, and millet were the most popular sources of carbohydrates across various NGAs","5e13ad1e":"![Alt Text](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-tD49ceKDfV0\/WVGIGzO0QmI\/AAAAAAAAk7E\/AArfVEW_bWUNUBYUGAizjEKRA51tcPPYwCLcBGAs\/s1600\/AGRICULTURAL%2BREVOLUTION.jpg)\n\n<h1 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#FFC305\"> Ancient Agriculture, and our history <\/h1>\n\nIsn't agriculture and farming one of the most important activities needed for a man's survival? \n\nThe history of agriculture is the story of humankind's development and cultivation of processes for producing food, feed, fiber, fuel, and other goods by the systematic raising of plants and animals. Prior to the development of plant cultivation, human beings were hunters and gatherers.\ud83e\ude93 The knowledge and skill of learning to care for the soil and growth of plants advanced the development of human society, allowing clans and tribes to stay in one location generation after generation. \n\nArchaeological evidence indicates that such developments occurred 10,000 or more years ago. \ud83c\udf3e\ud83c\udf3d\n\n\n<h1 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#FFC305\"> A brief introduction about the dataset <\/h1>\n\nBefore actually starting to learn about the dataset, we should first try to understand the organization and its purpose for \n\n**About Seshat**\n\nSeshat: \nGlobal History Databank is an international scientific research project of the nonprofit Evolution Institute. Founded in 2011, the Seshat: Global History Databank gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses. The Databank consults directly with expert scholars to code what historical societies and their environments were like in the form of accessible datapoints and thus forms a digital storehouse for data on the political and social organization of all human groups from the early modern back to the ancient and neolithic periods.\n\nGlobal History Databank is governed by the Board of Directors, who are advised by a number of subject matter consultants. Data collection for a specific NGA is coordinated by a Regional Editor, and data entered for a specific polity has been gathered in consultation with expert historians and archaeologists but is continually updated via ongoing expert review. The hands-on work of populating the databank is accomplished by the project\u2019s Research Assistants and Postdoctoral Research Associates. \n\n\n**About the Project: Agricultural Productivity and Carrying Capacity**\n\nAgricultural productivity and its variation across time and space plays a fundamental role in many theories of human social and cultural evolution. Because agricultural societies enjoy a demographic advantage over hunter-gatherer societies, the transition from foraging to agriculture fueled a series of population expansions world-wide, which spread the farmers\u2019 culture, language, and genes with them. However, although the Neolithic Revolution was one of the most consequential transitions in human evolution, we lack systematically collected quantitative estimates of the productivity of past agricultural systems on a large enough scale.\n\n![Alt Text](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/474x\/e8\/a0\/60\/e8a06059b8cf49d04a8ec3df85cc3534.jpg)\n\nIn particular, by how much did adoption of agriculture increase human carrying capacity, the maximum population density a particular environment can sustain indefinitely, without depleting critical resources needed for survival and reproduction? Even more importantly, how did agricultural productivity \/carrying capacity vary over time (as new technologies were invented and spread, and as a result of climate change) and in space (between geographic regions characterized by different soils, landscapes, and climate)? Seshat: Global History Databank is exploring various techniques to combine estimations of historical ecology, corp types and yields, and farming practices along with simulations of changing weather patterns to produce reliable, empirically-grounded estimates of productivity and carrying capacity in different parts of the world through time.\n\nIt's becoming too boring, isn't it? Let us dive right into our dataset now and try to understand it! \ud83c\udf3e\ud83c\udf3d","dba91e31":"> We can see that the graphs show how the dates vary.
