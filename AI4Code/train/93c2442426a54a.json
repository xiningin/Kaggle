While the ship could reportedly stay afloat if as many as 4 of its 16 compartments were breached, the impact had affected at least 5 compartments. It was originally believed that the iceberg had caused a long gash in the hull. After examining the wreck, however, scientists discovered that the collision had produced a series of thin gashes as well as brittle fracturing and separation of seams in the adjacent hull plates, thus allowing water to flood into the Titanic. Later examination of retrieved ship parts\u2014as well as paperwork in the builder\u2019s archives\u2014led to speculation that low-quality steel or weak rivets may have contributed to the sinking.****\n\n### This is super-basic, and I'm learning .
