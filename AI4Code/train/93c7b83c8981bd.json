cities and towns the dropout rate of underdeveloped states is very much high as compared to the well-Known states consisting of big cities.\nAnd that is why we have high admission rates in developed states.","9f941d7a":"***","7d1cbcca":"***","9f51a9c3":"****","21d35317":"Again,very bad numbers in the underdeveloped states.We can only say that this is a very low number and will be improved upon.Since these states do not recieve 24x7 electricity must be a prime reason for these results and also on further researching I came to notice that the Primary and Lower Secondary schools contribute to this schocking results,whereas higher secondary institutes are still having a good percentage of electricity supply,that is the reason why the results have slightly gone up.\nAlso the regions which have 100% of their schools equipped with electricity facilities are basically Union Territories and have less,but well developed schools,that's the prime reason their numbers are excellent.\nI firmly believe these numbers have grown in recent times as the goverment today is focusing more in to these development areas.","bd37c2a0":"# Schools Having Comuters","1c866652":"Since women education is been prioritized and also accepted in backward areas of the country ,therefore we can see huge percentage of schools are having girls toilet facility.Some of the developed states do not touch 100% because the data contains boys only schools also.However ,the state of Meghalaya and Assam have the least percentage of schools with girls toilet facility i.e 66% and 78% respectively.We can digest this because these states are not the best developed ones hit by natural calamities all over the year and lack of awareness towards women education in these areas may led to these results.Also less local population may be one of the reasons since people from these areas migrate to other parts of the country for work so it could be a possible case.","049c70da":"************","cd5b9fe3":"# Gross Dropout Rate","a3214552":"# Schools With Boys Toilets.","65685f5d":"# Thank You","fcc1e0c2":"In the Period of 4 years from 2012 to 2016,the total percentage of schools having water facilities in India are 96.11%\nSome of the UT's have well developed schools it seems 5 of them have water facility in each and every school.\nWhereas some of the states in East India like Assam,Arunachal Pradesh,Tripura and Meghalaya have water facilities in only 75% of their schools.\nRest of the states are having a good water-facility in atleast 90% of their schools.","8eb9c6e7":"# Lets First look into data containing schools with water facilities.","f4589c90":"I think the graphs are self-explanatory if you have followed till here.So the need of computers in a primary school is less as compared to secondary and higher secondary schools and that is the reason why we are seeing these graphs which are very low in Primary but grow in Secondary and higher secondary.\nIt is also good to know that many states have a good percentage of their schools havng computer labs in the primary section as well.\nAnother factor can be lack of electricity as proven in previous section.","11bfda21":"***","8bf60276":"***","e0b9ddf9":"# Schools with girls toilet","43d97912":"*All the above results show that the 4 states have very bad water facilitiy in thier Primary

Electricity\n\nI personally think schools should not be allowed to built without an electric conection.","4a47cede":"As we have seen above the states which have underdeveloped education system are listed too frequently in the lack of facilities provided in school.\nThis includes states like Assam,Bihar,Meghalaya,Arunachal Praadesh.Which we can see above as well but interesting thing I found is that the state of Andhra Pradesh is having very poor numbers for this case,as low as 73.97% overall.This could be because the state has ever changing goverment and most of its school are goverment controlled and funded by goverment and also boys can litter in open place so they did not require the need for having Boys toilets.But I think the numbers are increasing since,PM Modi announced Swachh Bharat Campaign which focuses on imporving cleanliness in the country and building public toilets wherever nececcary.","fe2a2cb8":"Some of the states have crossed 100% that is because increase in number of admission over the years."}}
