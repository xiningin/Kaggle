Remember, when we said that CLT requires sufficient sample size. \n\nLet's change the **number of sample means** first. That is, number of times sample is drawn and mean is calculated. NOte that, we are not changing the sample size. We will do that later. ","294824b4":"## What is the use of CLT ?\n\nThe first and foremost use is that we can approximate the mean and the standard deviation of the unknown distribution. Credit goes to CLT.\n\nAnother use is w Hypothesis Testing and constructing confidence intervals.","c5f95ad6":"Central Limit Theorem states that **given a dataset from an unknown distribution, the sample means will approximate the normal distribution**\n\nConfused ? Let's break it down.\n\nSuppose we have a dataset of points, from an unknown distribution. Let's sample some points of size 'd' and calculate the mean. We do this step of sampling and calculating the mean multiple times. Then the distrbution of that sample means will be like a bell curve of normal distribution. **Regardless of any distribution from which original dataset was created.** Except for few distributions.\n\nFor CLT to work, the unknown distribution must have a finite variance, which is not the case with Cauchy Distribution. Also, CLT applies to independent, identically distributed variables. \n\nHigher the number of points in the samples, CLT works better. For a rule of thumb, samples size should at least 30. **Law of Large Numbers**","7282ba31":"We can see even if the original distribution is chosen as uniform distribution, results are same.","f6df1321":"We can try this with original distribution being other distribution, let's do it with uniform distribution","c90fd4f8":"Although, everytime above code cell runs, the plots will be all different, but I am really sure that bottom-right plot, which is created with sample size of 1000 and iteration done 10000 times, will be the prettiest normal distribution. That's because of the sizes of samples and iteration is large. **LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS**"}}
