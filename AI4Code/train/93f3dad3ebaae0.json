Correlation is a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things. A correlation coefficient is a way to put a value to the relationship. Correlation coefficients have a value of between -1 and 1. A \u201c0\u201d means there is no relationship between the variables at all, while -1 or 1 means that there is a perfect negative or positive correlation."}}
