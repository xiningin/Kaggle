Based on data from 2010 to 2016\nTo make our visualization more up-to-date with current years, we will look at the trends in the latest years of data available from 2010, and perform the same analysis as above.\n\nClearly, Nintendo has lost their huge lead, and other noteable companies like Activision, EA, Ubisoft have made substantial progress into the top ranked games.","4068e950":"Unsurprisingly, there are different characteristics even across the major regions. Nintendo is a Japanese company and it is no surprise they are the Japanese's favorite. The other regions such as US, Europe and others, are more diversified, as other companies do have substantial share, though Nintendo still dominates the top 100.\n\nIt would therefore seem that Nintendo is extremely successful in being the favorite among consumers. We will explore this claim more when we look at the dataset in full later.","beca9239":"We note that there are some rows with no years or with no publishers. We will drop these rows for this analysis, as this workbook depends a lot of visualizing the data by **Year** and by **Publishers**","5cc42f25":"# **4.

Comparing the full dataset\nWe now turn our attention back to the full dataset, instead of narrowing our analysis on the top 100 games. Considering that there are 576 publishers in the dataset, to allow us to look at the top players, I have set an arbitrary threshold of showing publishers with Global_Sales > 50m.\n\nWe note that Nintendo and EA have the most global sales, with 1.7b and 1.1b in Global Sales respectively.\n\nFrom the same table, we also observe that Nintendo has the highest sales in NA, Europe and Japan as well compared to all the other competitors","b902cc7b":"We now look at the number of games each Publisher published.\n\nSimilar to above, an arbitrary threshold of 100 games were set so we can focus on the more established Publishers.\n\nUnsurprisingly, EA produced the most games, which also partly explains it's second position in the global sales ranking (after all, more games released do generate more sales to some extent). On the other hand, the top performer, Nintendo, produced approximately half of EA at 696 games, signifying more sales were generated per game for Nintendo.\n\nAlso unsurprising, is that the publishers with high global sales, also had released many games as well (Activision, Ubisoft, Sony etc.) as these companies appear in the top for both lists.","87b0e50e":"For NA and EU, Shooter, Platform, Sports, Role-Playing and Action are the top genres which gamers in the region like.\n\nHowever, Japan does not follow this trend. Shooter genre is one of the least popular, and Role-Playing is the most popular genre. This actually corresponds to our real world observation that many games created by Japan are Role-Playing games","fbb7b228":"Looking at the top 3 games per Genre, based on Global Sales, Nintendo dominates the list! Meanwhile, Action is dominated by Take-Two Interactive with their GTA franchise, while Activision dominates the Shooter genre with their Call of Duty franchise.","ca0d1693":"**4b. Genre based on Top 100**\n\nBy looking at the genre split of the top 100 ranked games, Shooter and Platform were the top performers in the top 100.","a33151fd":"# 7. Conclusion\nThis is my simple EDA on this dataset. Through this dataset, we are able to analyse the distribution of sales by Publisher and by Genre, and determine which were the big players from 1980 through to 2016, and from 2010 to 2016. It also let us have a glimpse on which Publishers were more popular in which Genre, which can provide for some insights if we were to perform an competitor analysis for the gaming industry. We can compare the top players for a particular Genre to determine the Publisher's direct competition. As an example, Nintendo may not be a direct competitor with Activision, since the type of games they create likely attracts different market segments. We would thus be more interested in companies that release Shooter game to make our analysis more relevant.\n\nAll in all, I believe there may be some other improvements which can be done to make this analysis more meaningful, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback, whether for the coding or for the analysis! :)\n\nFinally, if you like my analysis, please leave an upvote :) Greatly appreciated for a beginner like me","f2ee6f92":"**5c. Comparing by Publishers**\n\nLet us now do some analysis based on the Publishers.","4e9dd8a7":"# **2. Info of dataset**","da5dd1a7":"# **1. Import packages and data**","5b80ddab":"# **3. Years in which Games are released**\n\nFirst, we get the count of number of games released for each year in the dataset.\n\nWe first get the data for the top 10 years. We observe that the highest number of games (according to this dataset) released is from 2007 to 2011.","3e73c504":"There is not much changes in terms of the genres that the Publishers specialize in. However, Activision seem to have focused more on their Shooter Genre as compared to our previously analysis.\n\nFinally, one clear distinction is that the bars for Activision and EA are much greater than Nintendo, unlike when we compared the whole dataset. This is consistent with what we have observed previously.","26a4a631":"We now plot the total global sales by Genre, and we notice one key difference. Action was not the top genre in the top 100 games list. In totality, however, it seems that the market is more keen on the Action Genre, though not many made it into the top 100. Sports and Shooter still retain their position in the top spots.\n\nSimilarly, for Japan, Role Playing still dominates the market, and has at least twice the market share of the next most popular genre.","572f867a":"This chart is useful as it allows us to see which companies are known for which Genre of games. As we can see, the specialty of companies vary quite significantly. While **Activision** and **Ubisoft** both specialize in **Action, Misc, and Shooter**, companies like **EA** have a strong focus on niche in **Sports**, **Nintendo** with **Platform, Role-Playing and Sports**, and **Sony** being more popular in **Racing, Platform, and Action**.\n\nWe also observe the relative importance each company places in their genre. For example, Activision, EA and Ubisoft seems to develop their niche genre of games more heavily, and place less emphasis on the remaining genres. Nintendo and Sony, on the other hand, seems to be more diversified, having garnered quite substantial sales even for genres which are not their top.","cf8c7e01":"As expected, many of the platforms (except PC) have limited lifespan, with most phasing out within a decade or so. In particular, we notice that Wii (by Nintendo) was very successful in the initial 5 years, and slowly faded out. It's successor, WiiU, was not very popular.\n\nThe top platforms with highest sales can be observed to be Wii, PS3, X360, PS2, PS, DS (based on intensity of the color, with darker colors indicating higher sales). Sorting the Global Sales based on the platform confirms this."}}
