Climate change is arguably one of the greatest challenges we currently face. There is a scientific consensus that emission of fossil fuels by humans is leading to climate change, with serious negative consequences for life on our planet and for all of us. At the same time, the climate is extremely complicated, and understanding it requires an interdisciplinary effort, including chemistry, atmospheric science, geology, and social sciences. Further, scientists study climate through a broad range of observations of the land, atmosphere, and oceans. Some of the most difficult observations to collect are in the harsh, remote environments of the polar regions. Yet polar observations are crucial because the unique conditions of the polar regions lead to amplification of climate change. In this CGI, you will work directly with polar data, examining the greenhouse effect observed in the Arctic and Antarctic through the lens of quantum mechanics.

Earth's surface absorbs sunlight (mainly UV and visible light) and emits energy out to space as infrared radiation. When the incoming radiation equals the outgoing radiation, the Earth is said to be in _radiative balance_. By burning fossil fuels, humans have siginficantly increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation from Earth's surface and also emit infrared radiation up to space and back down to Earth. This causes Earth's surface to warm up until it re-achieves radiative balance.
