Performance Assessment\n\n## WHAT IS IT? \n\n#### Performance assessment, also known as alternative or authentic assessment, is a form of testing that requires students to perform a task rather than select an answer from a ready-made list. For example, a student may be asked to explain historical events, generate scientific hypotheses, solve math problems, converse in a foreign language, or conduct research on an assigned topic. Experienced raters--either teachers or other trained staff--then judge the quality of the student's work based on an agreed-upon set of criteria. This new form of assessment is most widely used to directly assess writing ability based on text produced by students under test instructions.\n\n## HOW DOES IT WORK?\n\n### Following are some methods that have been used successfully to assess performance:\n\n#### Open-ended or extended response exercises are questions or other prompts that require students to explore a topic orally or in writing. Students might be asked to describe their observations from a science experiment, or present arguments an historic character would make concerning a particular proposition. For example, what would Abraham Lincoln argue about the causes of the Civil War?\n\n#### Extended tasks are assignments that require sustained attention in a single work area and are carried out over several hours or longer. Such tasks could include drafting, reviewing, and revising a poem; conducting and explaining the results of a science experiment on photosynthesis; or even painting a car in auto shop.\n\n#### Portfolios are selected collections of a variety of performance-based work. A portfolio might include a student's \"best pieces\" and the student's evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of several pieces. The portfolio may also contain some \"works in progress\" that illustrate the improvements the student has made over time.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UM5bxbosgD8\/maxresdefault.jpg)","b2a7aac3":"#### AS we can see that males beat famales in math scores statics by defferent education level ","d0532cd4":"like we c : we had 2 types of data \n* object \n* intiger","1b517046":"from this plot we can explote some notes :\n1. famale are from group B \/ C more then males\n2. male are from group A \/ D more then famales \n3. male and famales are probably the same in group E","fa94f28c":"## C- Writing score","c79a0d10":"### A- Gender","d5f9f8dd":"* Male from all groups A\/B\/C\/D\/E had mean more higher then female \n* females had the lowest scores in Group B \/ C \/D  but the hegher scores in Group B\n* in group E we can see that male and females are propably equalize \n","3bd103be":"### scores by gender","99e6154e":"in the first look in the description we can see that :\n\n* female is the most frequence value in gender columns by 518\n* group C is the most frequence value in race columns by 319\n* some college is the most frequence value in educ_level columns by 226\n* standard is the most frequence value in lunch columns by 645\n* none is the most frequence value in test columns by 642\n\nwe can see also that :\n\n* the mean of scores in ( math , reading and wrinting ) is height then 65 ","40f55965":"### lunch & test ","d9bfe5f1":"# conclusion 3\n### From what we see in the pervious plots and analysis we can conclude that female beat males in writing score statics at all levels : education level \/ lunchs \/ tests \/ races","ff9757c0":"# conclusion 2\n\n### From what we see in the pervious plots and analysis we can conclude that female beat males in reading score statics at all levels : education level \/ lunchs \/ tests \/ races","74f68d25":"as we can see the number of fame are more then males with a small different ","53e66db9":"# finding missing values","8893c35c":"# EDA"}}
