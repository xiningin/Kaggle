Think of this layer as unstacking rows of pixels in the image and lining them up. This layer has no parameters to learn; it only reformats the data.\n\nAfter the pixels are flattened, the network consists of a sequence of two `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layers. These are densely connected, or fully connected, neural layers. The first Dense layer has 128 nodes (or neurons). The second (and last) layer is a 10-node softmax layer that returns an array of 10 probability scores that sum to 1. Each node contains a score that indicates the probability that the current image belongs to one of the 10 classes.\n****","0b0c5ea1":"## Train the model\n\nTraining the neural network model requires the following steps:\n\n1. Feed the training data to the model. In this example, the training data is in the `X_train` and `y_train` arrays.\n2. The model learns to associate images and labels.\n3. You ask the model to make predictions about a test set\u2014in this example, the `X_test` array. Verify that the predictions match the labels from the `y_test` array.\n\nTo start training, call the `model.fit` method\u2014so called because it \"fits\" the model to the training data:","b1ad3aa9":"## Makes predictions\n\nWith the model trained, you can use it to make predictions about some images.","8e186d94":"## Build the model\nBuilding the neural network requires configuring the layers of the model, then compiling the model.\n\n## Set up the layers\nThe basic building block of a neural network is the *layer*. Layers extract representations from the data fed into them. Hopefully, these representations are meaningful for the problem at hand.\n\n\nMost of deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers. Most layers, such as `tf.keras.layers.Dense`, have parameters that are learned during training.","464bc4e5":"# 3.
