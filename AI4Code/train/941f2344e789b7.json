For example a news website makes a claim that average sale price of a 32 inch television produced by various brands is 250 dollars. \n\nIf we have sale price data of various brands for 32 inch television then we can test this claim by formulating a hypothesis, testing it , interpreting the results and then make a conclusion.\n\nIn statistics, assumptions are verified by formulating a null hypothesis and then its either proved or disproved. A hypothesis is something which can be tested like in this case mean sale price of 32 inch television sets. In this case null hypothesis (H0) will be that there is no difference between actual and hypothesized mean, i.e. the average sale price calculated from data is not statistically different from hypothesiszed mean.\n\nAlternative hypothesis (Ha) will be that there is difference between the actual mean calculated from data and hypothesized mean claimed by the website.\n\nStatistical significance is determined by p-value (probability value) , which can be between 0 and 1. In this scenario, this means how likely it is that difference between mean calculated from data and mean reported by website has occured by chance. Normally a significance value of 0.05 is selected, so if p-value > 0.05 then this means that there is high probability that difference in two values is observed via chance and we do not reject the null hypothesis. \n\nIf p-value < 0.05 then this means that difference between two values has not occured by chance and indeed the mean calculated from data is different from then mean reported by website. \n\nIn this post we will explore how to conduct a one sample t-test in Python\n\nThis test can be two sided or less than or greater than. Two sided t-test means that value of mean caluclated from sample is different (can be less or more) than the hypothesized mean. But in one sided t-test, null hypothesis is that either value is less or greater than the hypothesized mean. \n \nHere we will go for two sided t-test as we are just interest in the fact that if two prices are different or not.\n\nFormula for one sample t test is:\n\n(x_mean-x_hypothesis)\/std_error_of_mean","b694ae15":"Before applying t-test we need to see if this data is normally distributed or not. For this purpose we will check skewness of column SalePrice."}}
