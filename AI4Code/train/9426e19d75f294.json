Learning rate is one of the most difficult parameters to set, because it significantly affects model performance.\n\nThe method `learn.lr_find()` helps you find an optimal learning rate. It uses the technique developed in the 2015 paper [Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks](http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1506.01186), where we simply keep increasing the learning rate from a very small value, until the loss stops decreasing. We can plot the learning rate across batches to see what this looks like.\n\nWe first create a new learner, since we want to know how to set the learning rate for a new (untrained) model.","c0b1492a":"What is that `cycle_len` parameter? What we've done here is used a technique called *stochastic gradient descent with restarts (SGDR)*, a variant of *learning rate annealing*, which gradually decreases the learning rate as training progresses. This is helpful because as we get closer to the optimal weights, we want to take smaller steps.\n\nHowever, we may find ourselves in a part of the weight space that isn't very resilient - that is, small changes to the weights may result in big changes to the loss. We want to encourage our model to find parts of the weight space that are both accurate and stable. Therefore, from time to time we increase the learning rate (this is the 'restarts' in 'SGDR'), which will force the model to jump to a different part of the weight space if the current area is \"spikey\". Here's a picture of how that might look if we reset the learning rates 3 times (in this paper they call it a \"cyclic LR schedule\"):\n\n<img src=\"images\/sgdr.png\" width=\"80%\">\n(From the paper [Snapshot Ensembles](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1704.00109)).\n\nThe number of epochs between resetting the learning rate is set by `cycle_len`, and the number of times this happens is refered to as the *number of cycles*, and is what we're actually passing as the 2nd parameter to `fit()`.

You should put the data in a subdirectory of this notebook's directory, called `data\/`. Note that this data is already available in Crestle and the Paperspace fast.ai template.","62882295":"When we run `learn.fit` we print 3 performance values (see above.) Here 0.03 is the value of the **loss** in the training set, 0.0226 is the value of the loss in the validation set and 0.9927 is the validation accuracy. What is the loss? What is accuracy? Why not to just show accuracy?\n\n**Accuracy** is the ratio of correct prediction to the total number of predictions.\n\nIn machine learning the **loss** function or cost function is representing the price paid for inaccuracy of predictions.\n\nThe loss associated with one example in binary classification is given by:\n`-(y * log(p) + (1-y) * log (1-p))`\nwhere `y` is the true label of `x` and `p` is the probability predicted by our model that the label is 1.","bb32add7":"### Confusion matrix ","6aa1f89e":"The loss is still clearly improving at lr=1e-2 (0.01), so that's what we use. Note that the optimal learning rate can change as we train the model, so you may want to re-run this function from time to time.","13cc26e9":"### Looking at pictures again","50f21581":"**Important: This notebook will only work with fastai-0.7.x.
