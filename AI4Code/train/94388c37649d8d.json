Seven days of daily confirmed cases would be predicted based on our model. \n\n>A recurrent neural network (RNN) based long short-term memory (LSTM) structure has been implemented. We have scaled the features in order to be in the same range as a preprocessing step. Furthermore, one layer of LSTM was implemented and dense and adam optimization were designed to get better results. In the training mode, past five-days of the data were fed to the train data and prediction is done on the sixth-day of data. Assessing the accuracy of the model was attained by mean absolute percentage error. In the end, seven days of daily confirmed cases in Canada were forecast.\n\n\n\n"}}
