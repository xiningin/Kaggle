The basic idea is the same: it multiplies the number of particular viral genes in a sample so they can be observed.\n\nBut LAMP is designed to be much simpler, faster and cheaper than PCR.\n\n* LAMP tests can be conducted in a simple heat bath, meaning almost any lab or hospital could theoretically do the test.\n\n* The results are confirmed by a dye that changes colour \u2014 allowing them to be read with the naked eye.\n \n* The result takes just 30 minutes, and as a result, has the potential to allow a huge number to be done quickly, concurrently and in almost any location.\n\nLindomar Pena from the Department of Virology at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Brazil has done extensive work on LAMP diagnosis tests, including validating a LAMP test for the Zika virus. He said the process was extremely sensitive, meaning if it's well designed and conducted, it's highly unlikely to miss any case.\n\nBut that same sensitivity means the test will sometimes return false positives.\n\nDr Lindomar said that while that's problematic in many instances, it's not for COVID-19.\n\"You want as many positives as possible, to control it and trace all the contacts,\" Dr Lindomar said.\nHe said missing cases of COVID-19 would be a big problem, but falsely identifying some cases would not.  \n[Ref LAMP](https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2020-03-25\/amateur-scientist-making-a-rapid-test-for-coronavirus\/12084974)","b1679ada":"**To view topic summary list of journal articles click on hidden Output cell preceding each topic. **\n\n**Or download csv file from Output section of notebook.**","73af0c10":"<a id=\"s-5\"><\/a>\n# <div class=h2>5.

Papers are not always peer-reviewed in this area, but getting information as soon as possible in publications may be helpful.\n\n\nOpen Source validation projects to share plans and data publicly and develop open source diagnostic kits based on LAMP papers are in development. [see e.g.Biofoundry](https:\/\/foundry.bio\/coronavirus-covid-19\/) The research by Dr. Jinzhao Song and scientists at University of Pennsylvania [A Single and Two-Stage, Closed-Tube, Molecular Test for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) at Home, Clinic, and Points of Entry](https:\/\/doi.org\/10.26434\/chemrxiv.11860137.v1) is an example of a design being copied. They have a patent for a test and have made it available for the public good.  Other examples in this area will be a space to watch. \n\n\nConfirmation data using samples of patients will be useful for validation and other analysis. \n\n\nUntil a vaccine or cure is found, testing may be the best tool for containment. For countries needing to scale up testing and where testing equipment and availability are scarce, LAMP for COVID-19 could be a game changer. "}}
