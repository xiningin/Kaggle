In order to use the pretrained weights, you need add a new dataset containing the weights. Go to Data tab and click on 'Add Data Source'. Then search for 'Keras Pretrained Model' dataset which contains weights of different architectures like VGG19, Inception, Resnet50, Xception.\n\nThe dataset contains 3 directories: Training, Validation and Testing. Each directory contains sub-directories with images of different fruits.","ed7a2b29":"We have not used any X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test or generated any labels for our classes. It is because we are using the flow_from_directory function of ImageDataGenerator. This function takes a directory as an input and assign the class indices to its sub directories. For this function to work, each subdirectory must contain a single class object only.\nAnother function of ImageDataGenerator is 'flow'. With this function, we need to provide X_train, y_train. If you use X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, don't forget to normalize X_train and X_test and use on hot encoding for y_train and y_test."}}
