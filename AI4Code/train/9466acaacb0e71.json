However, at least we know that there isn't any clear correlations between a particular variable and the target.","e483ebd7":"This is perhaps the most revealing visualisations. It shows us that our features (especially '*cont1*' and '*cont5*') have unusual distributions. '*cont1*' appears to turn into an categorical variable when greater than 0.4 and '*cont4*' is a linear distribution once above 0.3. \n\nThis could suggest that these variables need to split into additional features or have functions applied to their values to create a bigger distinction between very similar values.","0acf3387":"So above we can see that the majority of the features do not contain outliers, however features *cont5* and *cont12* do contain some points that are could be considered as outliers.","7cbc678b":"# Analyse the Target","90305f58":"We will now look at the **LOF (Local Outlier Factor)** outliers.","2f999c0c":"The takeaway from this is that the categorical variables are not a silver bullet for determining the target.

So I will leave the choice up to you, but show you how to visualise these points.**\n\nFirst we will look at outliers for the *target*.\n\nWe will add noise to the one dimensional features in order to \"explode\" the points out, helping us see the distributions and potential outliers.\n\nWe will use two methods for finding outliers:\n* The first will consider a point to be an outlier if it is N standard deviations from the mean. N is defined as the threshold.\n* A more complex form of outlier detection is LOF (Local Outlier Factor) which uses a points 20 nearest neighbours to determine if it is in a low density region (and therefore potentially and outlier).","2780523c":"### Feature Outliers\n\nFirst we will look at the threshold outliers."}}
