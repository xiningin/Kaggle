It creates decision trees on the given data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It is also a pretty good indicator of feature importance.\n\n\nRandom forest algorithm combines multiple decision-trees, resulting in a forest of trees, hence the name `Random Forest`.

So, it does not suffer from the overfitting problem. \n4.\tRandom forest classifier can handle the missing values. There are two ways to handle the missing values. First is to use median values to replace continuous variables and second is to compute the proximity-weighted average of missing values.\n5.\tRandom forest classifier can be used for feature selection. It means selecting the most important features out of the available features from the training dataset.\n\n\nThe disadvantages of Random Forest algorithm are listed below:-\n\n\n1.\tThe biggest disadvantage of random forests is its computational complexity. Random forests is very slow in making predictions because large number of decision-trees are used to make predictions. All the trees in the forest have to make a prediction for the same input and then perform voting on it. So, it is a time-consuming process.\n2.\tThe model is difficult to interpret as compared to a decision-tree, where we can easily make a prediction as compared to a decision-tree.\n","2d38c74b":"I have removed the `doors` variable from the model, rebuild it and checked its accuracy.
