According to graph and resul, infective growth rate is white noise. ","12ee9663":"#### Partial Correlation\n\nIn probability theory and statistics, partial correlation measures the degree of association between two random variables, with the effect of a set of controlling random variables removed. If we are interested in finding to what extent there is a numerical relationship between two variables of interest, using their correlation coefficient will give misleading results if there is another, confounding, variable that is numerically related to both variables of interest. This misleading information can be avoided by controlling for the confounding variable, which is done by computing the partial correlation coefficient. This is precisely the motivation for including other right-side variables in a multiple regression; but while multiple regression gives unbiased results for the effect size, it does not give a numerical value of a measure of the strength of the relationship between the two variables of interest.\n\nFor example, if we have economic data on the consumption, income, and wealth of various individuals and we wish to see if there is a relationship between consumption and income, failing to control for wealth when computing a correlation coefficient between consumption and income would give a misleading result, since income might be numerically related to wealth which in turn might be numerically related to consumption; a measured correlation between consumption and income might actually be contaminated by these other correlations. The use of a partial correlation avoids this problem.\n\nExtract from: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Partial_correlation","41c3b8de":"## Validation ","8be2d8ce":"#### Explanation\n\nSee Behavior of disease above.","c1187c02":"### Disclaimer\n\n**This notebook does not affirm that all the models are exact it just offers  a track to better understand and give some approximation answers to fight effectively against this pandemic in the world.**","c765501e":"# Carrying capacity\n\nThe **carrying capacity** of biological species in an environment is the maximun population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely, given the food, habitat, water, and neccesities available in the environment.\n\n**Extrait: Wikip\u00e9dia carrying capacity**\n\nIf we use a carrying capacity definition, we can do this identification:\n\n- biological species is SARS Cov 2\n- the food, habitat, water, and neccesities available in the environment is human being in its environment.\n\nThe human environment may be a factor in the spread of covid 19 disease.

Given that the covid 19 destabilizes the economy of a country, the barrier mesures can be accepted by the population if there is support from the authorities of that country. If we take one of the barrier measures containment, containment is effective in an environment if this environment has a sustained economy otherwise it becomes ineffective because a population can not accept to die of starvation by being confined.

This strategy was based on 13 measures that we will only mention the most important, we have:\n\n- *the land, air and sea borders of Cameroon will be closed: all passenger flights from abroad are suspended, with the exception of cargo flights and ships transporting everyday consumer products as well as essential goods and materials , whose stopover times will be limited and supervised; Cameroonians wishing to return to their country will have to attach their various diplomatic representations;*\n\n- *the issuance of entry visas to Cameroon at the various airports is suspended;*\n- *all public and private training establishments belonging to different levels of education, from kindergarten to higher, including vocational training centers and grandes \u00e9coles will be closed;*\n- *gatherings of more than fifty (50) people are prohibited throughout the national territory;*\n- *the drinking places, restaurants and places of leisure will be systematically closed from 6 p.m., under the control of the administrative authorities;*\n- *urban and interurban journeys should only be made when absolutely necessary;*\n- *drivers of buses, taxis and mototaxis are invited to avoid overloads in public transport: law enforcement will take particular care;*\n- *the populations are invited to strictly observe the hygiene measures recommended by the World Health Organization, namely in particular washing their hands regularly with soap, avoiding close contact such as shaking hands or kissing, cover your mouth to sneeze.*\n\n**source: https:\/\/www.spm.gov.cm\/site\/?q=fr\/content\/strategie-gouvernementale-de-riposte-face-la-pandemie-de-coronavirus-covid-19**\n\nThrough these measurements, we see very well that the disease could not develop so easily until the point where the curve reaches saturation after two days. **April 5 to April 7, 2020**. But after **April 7, 2020** it starts to be like a staircase curve. What can be behind this behavior? Are there one or more parameters that can explain this? we will be following this notebook.\n\nIn the meantime, because of the socio-economic situation of this country imposed by Covid19, the government of Cameroon was forced to relax the measures to combat Covid19 on April 30, 2020: we will mention the most important that can promote the surge of the pandemic in Cameroon; We have:\n\n- Opening after 6 p.m., drinking places, restaurants and places of leisure, with the obligation for customers and users to respect barrier measures, in particular the wearing of protective masks and social distancing.\n- lifting of the measure reducing the regulatory number of passengers in all public transport by bus and taxis. Wearing a mask is compulsory and overloading is prohibited.\n\n**source: https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/afrique\/52496808**\n\nWhat worries me with these two measures from the current 19 measures, is the fact that Cameroonians do not know individual responsibility for respecting the barrier measures against SARS Cov 2. The government's decision could bring an exponential growth of the disease . Bars, restaurants, public transport, etc. are places with high risk and high transmission of the disease.
