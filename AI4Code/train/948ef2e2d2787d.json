Instead, the only way to identify a Pok\u00e9mon as belonging to this group is through statements from official media, such as the games or anime.\n\nAlthough there are no explicit criteria in what defines a Pokemon to be legendary, we know for a fact that legendary Pokemon are \"...incredibly rare and often very powerful...\". Using the stats of each Pokemon, I will attempt to use classification models to see if how accurate we can predict a legendary Pokemon!","0c76cd50":"**Dealing with null values**\n\nCurrently, there are three columns that contain null values.","31313976":"While capture_rate and base_total seem to demonstrate some more obvious trends, we will also use some other features for our model. I was surprised to see that the experience growth was not as strong of a feature as the other two, but there does seem to be some commonality between legendary Pokemon.","b2ffe57c":"We know that legendary Pokemon are both \"rare\" and \"powerful\", the attributes that reflect these qualities may give us better insight as to how we can predict what is a legendary Pokemon.\n\nBecause legendary Pokemon are rare - we know that capturing them may be a tougher than catching non-legendary Pokemon. This is demonstrated with the following plot:","c40d81cb":"# Random Forest Model\n\nI will utilize a RFModel with a pipeline implementation.","b0de5cea":"All the features seem to vary in data types, so we will preprocess the ones that may give us better insight in predicting legendaries. I will use the follow features within my model:","f99e26a5":"Because there are species that only contain one type, we will set their type_2 NaN values to \"None\".\n","66b55a81":"# Gradient Boosting Model\n\n\nI figured that a gradient booster model may have a high accuracy. XGBoost did not accept the categorical preprocessing transformers, so I will implement XGBoost without the pipeline implementation.","35a10b50":"*Types*\n\nPokemon have special charactersitics, such as types that make them unique. For example, if their species is based off of an aquatiac mammal, their type would be considered water. Many species have more than one type, as shown below.","c65ad7aa":"The rate at which we can capture them are *significantly* lower than their non-legendary counterpart. \n\nBecause legendary Pokemon tend to be more powerful, their base stats should indicate that they are stronger than their non-legendary counterparts. This is demonstrated below:","aea3a480":"As we can see, there are no obvious trends between the amount of legendary Pokemon per generation. The last generation seems to have the highest amount of legendary Pokemon, but that does not particularly say much. The next step is to see if there are any common traits that the legendary Pokemon have.","42d75d9c":"*Height and Weight*\n\nFor these null values, I will use the SimpleImputer function.","5115b9c2":"With the gradient booster, I was able to accurately classify almost all Pokemon into the right category.","4b8860c5":"This is my first ever machine learning project, please let me know if there is any issues with my implmentation :~)!","b3bf0512":"Although the accuracy as a whole had a decent result, the accuracy in which it predicted legendaries was 9\/15 which is 60%.
