Which types of games are more successful in number of ratings?__\n\nSince we didn't use the number of installs in our analysis (because we don't have an exact value for each game, just a range), we can infer the success for each type of game from the total number of ratings for each category. With this in mind, the \"__ACTION__\" category has the highest number of ratings at $4.13 \\times 10^6$ installs, which shows the popularity of action mobile games.","bd6f30ac":"__2. Paid or free games? If paid, what is a good price to go for?__\n\nWe have seen that free games have a higher average number of ratings than paid games, so it could be a better option for a game developer to go for a free game. If the game is paid, a generally good price can be set at $1.99.","662522d6":"__4.
