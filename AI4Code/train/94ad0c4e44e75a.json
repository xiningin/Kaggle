Tune Hyperparameters\n\n- https:\/\/pycaret.org\/tune-model\/\n\n\n> Tuning hyperparameters of a machine learning model in any module is as simple as writing tune_model. It tunes the hyperparameter of the model passed as an estimator using Random grid search with pre-defined grids that are fully customizable. Optimizing the hyperparameters of a model requires an objective function which is linked to target variable automatically in supervised experiments such as Classification or Regression. However for unsupervised experiments such as Clustering, Anomaly Detection and Natural Language Processing PyCaret allows you to define custom objective function by specifying supervised target variable using supervised_target parameter within tune_model (see examples below). For supervised learning, this function returns a table with k-fold cross validated scores of common evaluation metrics along with trained model object. For unsupervised learning, this function only returns trained model object. The evaluation metrics used for supervised learning are:\n>\n> - Classification: Accuracy, AUC, Recall, Precision, F1, Kappa, MCC\n> - Regression: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2, RMSLE, MAPE\n>\n> The number of folds can be defined using fold parameter within tune_model function. By default, the fold is set to 10. All the metrics are rounded to 4 decimals by default by can be changed using round parameter. Tune model function in PyCaret is a randomized grid search of a pre-defined search space hence it relies on number of iterations of search space. By default, this function performs 10 random iteration over search space which can be changed using n_iter parameter within tune_model. Increasing the n_iter parameter may increase the training time but often results in a highly optimized model. Metric to be optimized can be defined using optimize parameter. By default, Regression tasks will optimize R2 and Classification tasks will optimize Accuracy. \n","d5d0c668":"# PyCaret2 AutoML Regression Example\n\n- https:\/\/pycaret.org\/\n\n> PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that aims to reduce the cycle time from hypothesis to insights.

Blend Models\n\n- https:\/\/pycaret.org\/blend-models\/\n\n\n> Blending models is a method of ensembling which uses consensus among estimators to generate final predictions. The idea behind blending is to combine different machine learning algorithms and use a majority vote or the average predicted probabilities in case of classification to predict the final outcome. Blending models in PyCaret is as simple as writing blend_models. This function can be used to blend specific trained models that can be passed using estimator_list parameter within blend_models or if no list is passed, it will use all the models in model library. In case of Classification, method parameter can be used to define \u2018soft\u2018 or \u2018hard\u2018 where soft uses predicted probabilities for voting and hard uses predicted labels.

It also reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Although it is usually applied to decision tree methods, it can be used with any type of method. Bagging is a special case of the model averaging approach.\n\n \n> **Boosting:**\n> Boosting is an ensemble meta-algorithm for primarily reducing bias and variance in supervised learning. Boosting is in the family of machine learning algorithms that convert weak learners to strong ones. A weak learner is defined to be a classifier that is only slightly correlated with the true classification (it can label examples better than random guessing). In contrast, a strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily well-correlated with the true classification.","de3bbf25":"# 10.

The idea behind stacking is to build a meta model that generates the final prediction using the prediction of multiple base estimators. Stacking models in PyCaret is as simple as writing stack_models. This function takes a list of trained models using estimator_list parameter. All these models form the base layer of stacking and their predictions are used as an input for a meta model that can be passed using meta_model parameter. If no meta model is passed, a linear model is used by default. In case of Classification, method parameter can be used to define \u2018soft\u2018 or \u2018hard\u2018 where soft uses predicted probabilities for voting and hard uses predicted labels.
