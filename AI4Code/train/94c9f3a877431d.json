Due to this I think the results came out quite well.","e39f9792":"The first ten words look fine above so time to make the generator.\nFor this I've set it to write a title from 2 to 4 words long. \n\nI also capitalize words that are in lower case while leaving Uppercase words alone. I felt this looks better.","0d809185":"So here I use regex to remove any characters that aren't in the english alphabet. This help gets rid of numbers, colons and non-english words. \n\nI also get rid of words that are three characters or less as these are unlikely to be helpful in generating good names, this removes words like \"the\" and \"and\".","3ea68a35":"Personally I think this works pretty well. Not every Title generated will be great but I think it produces an believable mobile game title the vast majority of the time. \n\nYou can change the seed above to see new titles. Some can be pretty amusing."}}
