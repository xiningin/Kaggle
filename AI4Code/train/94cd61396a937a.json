As we can see from the above information that just we miss some Latitude and longitude values.","d82847fb":"The first plot shows a stable number of flights during the days of the month. This result is expected when we look at the previous plot because by plotting the number of flights per day during the year we loose information about the day of the week and, as the plots show, this information is more relevant than the actual day of the month. Furthermore, the number of flights decreases in the last days of the months, this is due to the fact that not all the months have the same number of days (as can be noticed from the white boxes in the next plot). \n\nThe heat map shows the number of flights per day of the month for each month.\n\nFinally, the second bar plot and heat map, clearly show how, regardless of the month, the number of flights drops down at night and it reaches is maximim values between 6 and 7 AM, with other two small peaks between 15 and 16, and 17 and 18. \n\nThe last plots show also that February has a lower number of flights with respect to the other months, this information was already suggested by the previous plots showing the values per day of the week.","a0b5cd1a":"From the above figure we can said that for the top 20 busiest airport, it is more likely to have a delays. the maximum probability to get a delays is on the airport \"LGA\" it equals to 0.28. ","ab61a6a8":"As expected from the previous plot, the percentage of delayed flights is higher in the middle of the week (Thursday), while it decreases on saturday. This is probably what creates the bigger oscillations in the days-of-the-month plot. Furthermore it can be noted that the percentage of delayed lights drops to its minimum value on staurday, where we know from the previous plots that there are less flights.","6636d670":"From the average number of delayed flights per hour it can be noticed that night hours have the smallest average delays and this value increases over time until it reaches it maximum at 19. This information is coherent with what we've already seen, infact we know that night hours have less flights and the shape of this curve to the one of the previous one so we can say that there could be a correlation between the percentage of delayed flights and the average value of the delay.\n\nWith data of year 2015, the flight from 5AM to 8AM often depart earlier than in their schedule. The flights in the morning have less delay then in the afternoon and evening.","bb03a810":"In this series of questions we focus on the computation of statistics about the percentage of delayed flights. \n\nA flight is considered as delayed if it's actual arrival time is more than 15 minutes later than the scheduled arrival time.","2827fbe1":"This plot shows that, even if the previous plot showed a very low number of flights at night, there a not-indifferent percentage of delayed flights in the late hours (up to 19%). In particular, it can easily be noticed that the percentage starts to increase at 5 AM and reaches its maximum values between 19 and 20 (more than one flight out of four (25%)), then it decreases again. To get a better understanding of the delays it would be useful to have statistics about the actual value of the delay (next plots).","100866e6":"From the plot we can see that in February we have the lowest flight traffic amount, while in July we have the hightest one. In fact, another relevant information shown by the above plot is that in holiday periods (Summer holidays in the months of July and August and Christmas holidays in December) the flight amount is much bigger with respect to other months, especially those following a holiday period.","0f9d99aa":"Each flights described by some features : \n* **YEAR, MONTH, DAY, DAY_OF_WEEK:** dates of the flight \n* **AIRLINE:** An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airline \n* **ORIGIN_AIRPORT and DESTINATION_AIRPORT:** code attributed by IATA to identify the airports \n* **SCHEDULED_DEPARTURE and SCHEDULED_ARRIVAL :** scheduled times of take-off and landing\n* **DEPARTURE_TIME and ARRIVAL_TIME:** real times at which take-off and landing took place \n* **DEPARTURE_DELAY and ARRIVAL_DELAY:** difference (in minutes) between planned and real times \n* **DISTANCE:** distance (in miles) **","e8ffa474":"We are ready now to draw some observations from our data, even if we have only looked at data coming from a year worth of flights:\n\n* The probability for a flight to be delayed is low at the beginning or at the very end of a given months\n* Flights on two first weekdays and on the weekend, are less likely to be delayed\n* October and September are very good months for travelling, as the probability of delay is low ","c30a2a6a":"### Statistics on the fraction of delayed flights:","9c7736d0":"### Basic queries:"}}
