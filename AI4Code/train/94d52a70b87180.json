So in our series we will not consider the first eight days (since there previous eighty days is not in the series).\n    We have to test the last 68 values. This would be based on the last 80 days stock prices of each day in the test data.\n    Since we have neglected first 80 and last 68 is our test set, the train dataset will be between 80 and 180 (100 days)."}}
