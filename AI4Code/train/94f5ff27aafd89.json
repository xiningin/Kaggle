A series of VGGs are exactly the same in the last three fully connected layers. The overall structure includes 5 sets of convolutional layers, followed by a MaxPool. The difference is that more and more cascaded convolutional layers are included in the five sets of convolutional layers .\n\n![config](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/blurred-machine\/Data-Science\/master\/Deep%20Learning%20SOTA\/img\/config2.jpg)\n\n\n- Each convolutional layer in AlexNet contains only one convolution, and the size of the convolution kernel is 7 * 7 ,. In VGGNet, each convolution layer contains 2 to 4 convolution operations. The size of the convolution kernel is 3 * 3, the convolution step size is 1, the pooling kernel is 2 * 2, and the step size is 2. The most obvious improvement of VGGNet is to reduce the size of the convolution kernel and increase the number of convolution layers.\n\n\n![config](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/blurred-machine\/Data-Science\/master\/Deep%20Learning%20SOTA\/img\/config3.jpg)\n\n\n- Using multiple convolution layers with smaller convolution kernels instead of a larger convolution layer with convolution kernels can reduce parameters on the one hand, and the author believes that it is equivalent to more non-linear mapping, which increases the Fit expression ability.\n\n![config](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/blurred-machine\/Data-Science\/master\/Deep%20Learning%20SOTA\/img\/config4.png)\n\n- Two consecutive 3 * 3 convolutions are equivalent to a 5 * 5 receptive field, and three are equivalent to 7 * 7. The advantages of using three 3 * 3 convolutions instead of one 7 * 7 convolution are twofold : one, including three ReLu layers instead of one , makes the decision function more discriminative; and two, reducing parameters . For example, the input and output are all C channels. 3 convolutional layers using 3 * 3 require 3 (3 * 3 * C * C) = 27 * C * C, and 1 convolutional layer using 7 * 7 requires 7 * 7 * C * C = 49C * C. This can be seen as applying a kind of regularization to the 7 * 7 convolution, so that it is decomposed into three 3 * 3 convolutions.\n\n- The 1 * 1 convolution layer is mainly to increase the non-linearity of the decision function without affecting the receptive field of the convolution layer. Although the 1 * 1 convolution operation is linear, ReLu adds non-linearity.","431c7354":"# VGGNet Complete Architecture","38d6023b":"![config](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/blurred-machine\/Data-Science\/master\/Deep%20Learning%20SOTA\/img\/network.png)","1e555bfc":"![title](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/blurred-machine\/Data-Science\/master\/Deep%20Learning%20SOTA\/img\/vgg.png)","3921de11":"### Building a VGG-16 model ","e61b049a":"### Working with pretrained model\n\n- Keras library also provides the pre-trained model in which one can load the saved model weights, and use them for different purposes : transfer learning, image feature extraction, and object detection.

Dropout is after the first two fully connected layers, p = 0.5.\n\n- Although it is deeper and has more parameters than the AlexNet network, we speculate that VGGNet can converge in less cycles for two reasons: one, the greater depth and smaller convolutions bring implicit regularization ; Second, some layers of pre-training.\n\n- **Parameter initialization** : For a shallow A network, parameters are randomly initialized, the weight w is sampled from N (0, 0.01), and the bias is initialized to 0. Then, for deeper networks, first the first four convolutional layers and three fully connected layers are initialized with the parameters of the A network. However, it was later discovered that it is also possible to directly initialize it without using pre-trained parameters.\n\n- In order to obtain a 224 * 224 input image, each rescaled image is randomly cropped in each SGD iteration.
