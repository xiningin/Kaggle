I install all the libraries in the first part because the algorithms I will use later. Furthurmore, I have investigated the data, presented some visualization and analysed features. Let's write it. I will import necessary Python modules and read the data.","34e51076":"LINEAR REGRESSION ","cdf71c41":"VISUALIZATION \n\nVisualized the dataset using scatter_matrix function of pandas library which shows the plot of each attribute with every other attribute.From this we can find out the factors which have linear relationship with chances of admission.\n\nIn this case it can be observed that-\nGRE score\nTOEFL score\nCGPA\nHave linear relation with chances of admission. It means our prediction will be largely dependent on their values as compared to other attributes."}}
