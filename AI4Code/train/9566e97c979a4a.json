Wow. I'm going to have to think more carefully about the risks I am willing to take.\n\nTo spell this out more clearly, let us consider what a typical week for you might look like:\n\n1. You mostly work from home when possible\n2. However you are required by your work to make two visits to the office for staff meetings. You travel in a private car to the workplace, but the workplace visits each take several hours of sharing an office space with 10 other colleagues. Everyone is supposed to socially distance and wear masks, but in reality they do not.\n3. On the weekend you participate in a sweaty basketball game with 8 friends.\n\nLet's consider each office visit as a group of 10 people, and the basketball game as a group of 8 people and calculate the chance of getting ill in a year if this is a typical week during 2020.","cc1c928e":"33.56% and 33.63% are near enough to be considered equivalent.\n\nSo how are these odds affected by different social interactions?","7fe4b6cb":"Thus, if you and those you socialize with all consistently wear a simple cloth mask, you can safely multiple your socialization budget **by nine**!\n\nThinking about this, if I attend a group event of 27 people where wearing masks is insisted on by the conveener, the risk to me is equivalent to me meeting up with 3 of my friends where none of us take any precautions. Hm!","0fb54e93":"To calculate the number of infectious people currently living in your country, we need to make some approximations. People are most contagious in the 48 hours prior to showing symptoms, but may be contagious up to 72 hours before becoming symptomatic. However people who never show any symptoms are thought to carry the same amount of coronavirus in their systems. \n\n\nData seems to indicate that asymptomatic carriers are less infectious than symptomatic carriers. [5](http:\/\/www.emro.who.int\/health-topics\/corona-virus\/transmission-of-covid-19-by-asymptomatic-cases.html#:~:text=Available%20evidence%20from%20contact%20tracing,transmission%20of%20the%20virus.) However some experts believe asymptomatic carriers may be more contagious since they are unlikely to be isolating or adopting behaviors designed to prevent spread. [4](https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/diseases-and-conditions\/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus#:~:text=We%20know%20that%20a%20person,they%20start%20to%20experience%20symptoms.)\n\nIt is generally  recommended that a person ill with Covid, or suspected of being ill with Covid, should remain isolated for 14 days, but research generally points to a person remaining contagious for 10 days after testing positive.\n\nSo, to calculate the number of infectious people in our country, we simple add up the past 10 days of daily new cases. ","e6af2b9f":"Wow... One in three.\n\nNotice how the maths can be simplified with very little loss of accuracy:","8c8137a0":"# Informing how we can socialize in any given week\nNext we want to consider what degree of risk we can afford on a weekly basis if we are to not exceed our risk profile of having a 2% chance of getting ill over a whole year period.","9afb7d8b":"We see that the relationship is linear to the number of people we associate with. Additionally, multiple events over a week can be added together to get the overall weekly risk. The risk of attending a 200 person event where you socialize closely with everyone, is equivalent to the risk of attending 200 separate catchups with friends individually.\n\nMakes you think - which is going to provide you with more personal enrichment?\n\nSo if my annual risk comfort level is 2%, how many people does that allow me to socialize with on a weekly basis?","9c21c33a":"Let us now consider different levels of social interaction and the risks associated. \n\nIf we take no precautions, let us assume for the sake of calculation social interactions that are close enough in proximity and contact that contagion is assured if either of us is currently infectious.","7a91327a":"\n## Minimizing risk\nOK, so what can we do then to mitigate these odds?\n\nThe biggest step we can obviously take is to minimize social gatherings and contact during the pandemic.\n\nBut when socializing is unavoidable, there are steps we and others can take to minimize the likelihood of contagion.\n\n## Make a socialization budget for yourself\nA common mentality that emerges during this pandemic is that many people began with high levels of precautions during the early months of March, April and May, but take less precautions as social events occur that \"force\" them into attending a larger group event. Attending larger events tend to shift a person's mindset. Their overall level of risk comfort is illogically modified. \n\n> If it would be unthinkable for me not to join my family's Christmas gathering, an event of 12 people, How can I refuse to catch up with my 6 friends each week?\n\nA more logical approach would be to think in terms of a \"risk budget\". If you can put a number on your risk comfort level, then you can calculate how many people this allows you to associate with in a year, hence in a month, hence each week. \n\nIf you need to join your family for Christmas, then you need to work out how you can reduce your socializing in other situations by a total of 12 people.\n\ne.g.\n> I catch up with roughly 5 people each week. This is around 20 people per month. In order to maintain my risk budget in December, I will rearrange my month to only catch up with 8 people outside of my family's Christmas event.\n \n## Take precautions at social gatherings\n### 1. Wear a mask, and encourage others to wear a mask\nMasks work in both directions. A sick person wearing a mask has their mask blocking particles they exhale, but healthy people around them then also have a second barrier preventing any escaping particles from entering their respiratory system.\n\nReseach on the effects of a population wearing face masks has shown a reduction of 2% in the daily case growth rate 21 days after masks are mandated.[6](https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019\/question-and-answers-hub\/q-a-detail\/q-a-small-public-gatherings-and-covid-19) N95 masks are practically around 90% effective in blocking virus-laden aerosols, and normal surgical cloth masks around 67% effective.[7](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-020-02801-8)\n\nThis means if you wear a normal cloth mask and those around you do not, you are reducing your chance of being exposed to Covid by air droplets by 67%. ","caafe47a":"# How much can you risk it?\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.omanobserver.om\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Woman-Wearing-Face-Mask-e1589385650398.jpg?resize=800%2C445&ssl=1\" width=\"600\">\n\nLife is about taking calculated risks. Obviously if you want to prioritize not getting ill with the Coronavirus above all other considerations, you would remain in your home and never socialize with others no matter how low the infection rate is in your country.\n\nOtherwise, it comes down to figuring out what your comfort level of risk is in terms of Covid.\n\n## Why don't we want to catch Covid?\nFirstly, I don't want to die or be permanently scarred by Covid. Fortunately for me, given my health and age, it appears the chances of dying from covid are fairly low for me.\n> Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment, and for the majority \u2013 especially for children and young adults \u2013 illness due to COVID-19 is generally minor.\n> \n> However, for some people it can cause serious illness. Around 1 in every 5 people who are infected with COVID-19 develop difficulty in breathing and require hospital care.\n> \n> People who are aged over 60 years, and people who have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease or hypertension are among those who are at greater risk of developing severe or critical illness if infected with the virus.\n[1](http:\/\/www.who.int\/indonesia\/news\/detail\/08-03-2020-knowing-the-risk-for-covid-19)\n\n> [You can look up hospitalization statistics for your age group here](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1105402\/covid-hospitalization-rates-us-by-age-group\/)\n> \n> [You can look up the effect of any underlying health conditions you may have here](https:\/\/www.tfah.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/COVIDunderlyingconditions040320.pdf)\n> \nHowever, I don't want to be responsible for infecting others. The odds of not dying and having no lasting effects are not as good for older generations and people with certain existing health preconditions.\n\n> Adults of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19:\n> \n> * Cancer\n> * Chronic kidney disease\n> * COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\n> * Heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies\n> * Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant\n> * Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 kg\/m2 or higher but < 40 kg\/m2)\n> * Severe Obesity (BMI \u2265 40 kg\/m2)\n> * Pregnancy\n> * Sickle cell disease\n> * Smoking\n> * Type 2 diabetes mellitus\n[2](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/need-extra-precautions\/people-with-medical-conditions.html)\n\nAnd it isn't only the people I may unwittingly infect as an asymptomatic carrier directly myself, there are those who might die from the generations of infected people that might stem from me.\n\nAnd finally, there is the severe economic impact lockdowns and closures have our our nation's economies. Do I want to be part of the reason for my country failing to get cases under control? No.\n\n## So what is your comfort level with risk?\nSo coming back to my first question, what is your comfort level with risk? Put a number on it. \n\nBecause if we can put a number on acceptable risk, then we can calculate what level of social interactions we can safely maintain. Let's get math geeky!\n","fa23a976":"\n\n### 2. Choose outdoor venues, or indoor venues with good ventilation\n\n### 3. Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people, particularly if they are coughing or sneezing.\n\n### 4. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, or with a hand sanitizer. \n\n## Conclusions\nWhat is your take-away lesson?\n\nI started this exercise thinking that if I could calculate the relevant probabilities, I would be able to assure myself that the given risk of contracting Covid are quite small and I can assure myself some regular small group socializing is harmless.\n\nI now see this is not the case. Socialization is important for our mental health as humans, but we need to consider carefully the size of these gatherings and the precautions that are being taken.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2020\/08\/26\/PSAS\/0319e247-83b2-46bd-b529-1dced12c672d-Mask-Poster_Paul-Richmond-1.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n\nFor myself, \n1.
