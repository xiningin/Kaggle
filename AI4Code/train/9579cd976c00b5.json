These datasets are either bi-class (such as determining whether a person is male or female, an e-mail is spam or spam) or multi some examples of classification problems are: voice recognition, handwriting recognition, biometric identification, document classification, etc. Here we have types of classification algorithms in machine learning:\n* \u2022\tLinear Classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier\n* \u2022\tSupport Vector Machines\n* \u2022\tDecision Trees\n* \u2022\tIncreased Trees\n* \u2022\tRandom Forests\n* \u2022\tNeural Networks\n* \u2022\tNearest Neighbor\n","a1387eb6":"* Numpy and pandas libraries were used for mathematical functions and data manipulations, Seaborn and matplot libraries were used for visualization.","ca2eeb33":"**Random Forest Classifier**\n* Random forest\u0131classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.\n*             First, the Random Forest algorithm is a controlled classification algorithm. (Supervised classification algorithm). As we can see from the name, the algorithm simply creates a forest randomly. There is a direct relationship between the number of trees in the algorithm and the results they can achieve. As the number of trees increases, we get a definite result. \n<img src= \"https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/iY55n.jpg\" alt =\"Titanic\" style='width: 200px;'>","7dd61173":"**Data Normalization**\n*           Normalization (parsing) is the process of parsing a table consisting of too many columns and rows in databases into its subsets containing fewer rows and columns to free it from repetition.\n","5305ba2b":"*           That's how we read the data.","3bc380df":"*           Representation of the last five lines of data","18bf15c6":"**Create Test and Train Arrays**","f1abb7d6":"**Categorizing Data**","8f5ad503":"*  That chart shows that alcohol ratio and quality correlation.","7a4e2ccd":"**MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT**\n*           Here I developed a machine learning project using the python language.
