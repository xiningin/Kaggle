There is a subtle relationship between age and salary range, indicating that customers with high annual earnings are usually part of an older audience.","941c762b":"In our original database, the column that identifies the target of the business problem is given by `Attrition_Flag`. In order to be able to train a predictive model, it is necessary to prepare in this column to transform it into \"0s and 1s\". For this, it is possible to use a class `DefineTarget` which, in turn, is responsible for applying a modification to a database based on a target column and an entry given as a positive class.","834af9ef":"Once the numerical and categorical sets of our training base are separated, we will start the steps of building individual pipelines for each of the two primitive types, starting with the numerical pipeline and its particularities.","46e16176":"<a id=\"2.3\"><\/a>\n<font color=\"dimgrey\" size=+2.0><b>2.3 Financial Profile<\/b><\/font>\n\n<a href=\"#top\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" role=\"button\" aria-pressed=\"true\" style=\"color:white\" data-toggle=\"popover\">Go to TOC<\/a>","6587a252":"In this step, some important variables will be defined for the use of the `ClassificadorBinario` class of the `pycomp` package.

The breakdown by attrition flag indicates that there is no direct relationship between these two variables with clients who migrated to another institution. This is because the red points indicated in the graph are spread across all two dimensions and are not positioned in a specific portion of the axes.","b9419c14":"To validate the impact of the logarithmic transformation on candidate predictive models, we will optionally propose a step in the pipeline that applies this procedure to the numerical features present in the base.

We know that different decisions can be made taking into account the marital situation and the \"family size\" of each client. The bar graph above shows:\n\n1. The base is formed, in its majority, by married clients and, therefore, in spite of being majority in the whole analysis by registered dependents, single clients without dependents surpass married clients without dependents.\n2. The financial institution may, in some way, further analyze single customers who have a large number of dependents (green bars).
