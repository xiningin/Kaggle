Let's see if unregistered customers are the main culprits.\n\n\n\n**Q2: Do unregistered users take longer or shorter trips?**\n\nFirst let's plot a pie chart to determine the proportion of unregistered users.","a61c1b93":"Today I will be performing an exploratory analysis on the SF Bay Area Bike Share database using SQLite supplemented by the pandas library.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in extracting data from database files using SQL and the ability to analyze these values in context. This database contains four data tables: station, status, trip, and weather.\n\nHere are some questions I will try to answer over the course of this exploration:\n* What was the trip with the longest duration?\n* Do unregistered users take longer or shorter trips?\n*  Which stations are the most popular?\n* Which routes are the most popular?\n\n\n","9a2fb5f5":"Now that the data is ready to go, lets see what tables we have to work with.","45a09b47":"First, the data must be imported into python. I will set up a function that takes an sql query as a parameter and returns a dataframe visualization of that query. This will save coding time in the long run.","f8738154":"For anyone who is familiar with San Fransisco, it would make sense why these are the most popular stations. Townsend at 4th is blocks away from AT&T park, the financial district, and is the location of both a Caltrain and BART station. Both the Caltrain and BART serve hundreds of thousands of commuters every day. The Ferry Building is also one of the iconic landmarks of San Fransisco and is right along the Embarcadero, a very popular area among tourists.\n\n\nLets take this a step further. We can utilize the \"status\" table in the database and determine which stations are empty the most. It appears that the status table consists of status updates pulled from each station every two minutes. Each station contains 1,047,142 unique status readings.","7ea851bf":"So it appears that the longest ride recorded is over six months long! It is very likely that this could have been a glitch. Pulling up the top 10 longest rides will hopefully provide some context as to whether this datapoint is a fluke.","aa879e28":"It turns out only two out of 5 of our most popular stations are in the top 10 most empty stations. The other three must be very popular drop-off stations as well, which allows the kiosks to maintain a steady number of bikes.\n\nLets create a quick plot to show the distribution of available bike readings for all stations.","70386d59":"Lets see if how common it is for a ride to go over 24 hours","bdb6421c":"So unsubscribed customers take much longer rides on average. This would make sense as unsubscribed customers are more unaware of the charges that are incurred if you go over your 30 minute time limit. Other potential influential factors include the fact that unsubscribed customers come from certain demographics, such as tourists who would be doing more sight-seeing.\n\n\n\n**Q3: Which stations are the most popular?**\n\nIn order to extract the data needed, the \"trip\" and \"station\" tables will need to be inner-joined:\n\n"}}
