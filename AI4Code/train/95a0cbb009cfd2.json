Existance of outliers may change the mean and standard deviation of the whole dataset that can badly affect the performance of the model. Outliers also increases the variance error and reduces the power of statistical test. We find outliers in due to data entry errors, Experimental measurement error, Measurement error(Instrument error), and\nSampling error. <br>\n\nDetecting outliers is one of the challenging job in data cleaning. There is no any precise way to detect and remove outliers due to specific of datasets. Yet, raw assumption and observation must be made to remove those outliers that seems to be unusual among all other data.

You cannot go directly to modeling with raw data in your hands. As data scientists commonly say: garbage in garbage out. So it is a very indispensable task to clean your data, handle missing values, and deal with outliers before build you machine learning models. \n\nIn this tutorial we will go through several techniques to handle missing data by customizing the missing values and imputing the missing data values using different methods such as  mean, median, mode, a constant value, forward fill, backward fill and polynomial interpolation. After that, we will see how to implement some common methods to detect and remove outliers from the dataset. ","eaa6c7bf":"### Replace some irrelevant column values using a map dict"}}
