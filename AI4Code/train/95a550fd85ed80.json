base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model.

This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.","0b114983":"Furthermore, since having mentioned about Objects and classes within the OOP framework, let us now create 5 objects that represent our 5 learning models via our Helper Sklearn Class we defined earlier.","3b0ae204":"# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!","a493de80":"**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.

Therefore we will invoke this very useful attribute via our function earliand plot the feature importances as such","a0453445":"### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code\/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn classifiers. Therefore this cuts out redundancy as  won't need to write the same methods five times if we wanted to invoke five different classifiers.","09330cc0":"# Second-Level Predictions from the First-level Output","8cad97bb":"**Pearson Correlation Heatmap**\n\nlet us generate some correlation plots of the features to see how related one feature is to the next.

Therefore I'll print out the values from the code above and then simply copy and paste into Python lists as below (sorry for the lousy hack)","0c8c53b5":"Bear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\nThe rest of the code are simply methods of the class which simply call the corresponding methods already existing within the sklearn classifiers. Essentially, we have created a wrapper class to extend the various Sklearn classifiers so that this should help us reduce having to write the same code over and over when we implement multiple learners to our stacker.","e724c04c":"# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

Gradient Boosting classifer\n 5. Support Vector Machine","0de540fc":"# Introduction\n\nThis notebook is a very basic and simple introductory primer to the method of ensembling (combining) base learning models, in particular the variant of ensembling known as Stacking. In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\n\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling\/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\n\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \n\n\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\n\n\n  [1]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mmueller\/allstate-claims-severity\/stacking-starter\/run\/390867\n  [2]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/arthurtok\/titanic\/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808","8bc28530":"Now let us calculate the mean of all the feature importances and store it as a new column in the feature importance dataframe.","b93e5a5f":"**Takeaway from the Plots**\n\nOne thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\nFinally let us generate some pairplots to observe the distribution of data from one feature to the other. Once again we use Seaborn to help us.","74782fe2":"**Interactive feature importances via Plotly scatterplots**\n\nI'll use the interactive Plotly package at this juncture to visualise the feature importances values of the different classifiers  via a plotly scatter plot by calling \"Scatter\" as follows:","d8f4afd9":"All right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.
