If we look at stability of results then France is most stable in Summer and Norway in Winter Games\n4. If we look number of medal points in relation to GDP, the best country in Summer Games is Bulgaria and in Winter it is Norway.\n5. If we look number of participants compared to population of a country then the best are Slovenia and Latvia for Winter Games, and New Zealand for Summer Games\n6.

Idea is to see who has best year (meaning lowest GPD per medal points) when, and roughly see how much.","226b6fa9":"### Some of the teams have more than one version. \nE.g. there is Austria, but also Austria-1 and Austria-2. This three should be merged. We will do this by 1st creating the list of teams with \"-\" in it. We create this list from initial dataframe.","7df9558d":"### Next we check results for the three countries:","156d8a00":"### Conclusion about GDP per medal\nWell it is obviously clear why in best years Bulgaria got low on GDP per medal, they got relatively lot of medals on summer games and, in same time, their GDP was very low. Interestingly their GDP grew from 2000 onward, but their number of medal points was decreasing. They are not going to repeat their success from 1996 any time soon. Norway, on the other hand, had relatively stable results in winter games but their GDP grew too. So, they will not be able to repeat their success from 1994. \n\nAnyway, it still remains; Bulgaria had the best result in summer and Norway in winter games. So, there are new champions?","e552a86b":"### Let's see how the dataset looks like\nCheck describe() and info().","ba8cd252":"### So United States is not so mighty!\nEspecially if we look at the number of gold medals, United States is not even in Top 3. So the might of US comes from summer Olympic Games. Let's see where this might come from - in other words which events Top 5 countries in both seasons get most of the medals. The parameter to check who is in Top 5 will be Medal points. In other words for winter following countries are top 5:\n1. Germany\n2. United States\n3. Norway\n4. Russia\n5. Canada\n\nFor summer season top 5 countries are:\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Russia \n4. Germany\n5. Great Britain\n\nWe will start from dataframe \"medals\".","df861e2b":"### In Summer Olympic Games the best is Jamaica and in Winter Norway\nJamaica has in average 0.64 medal points in summer games per 100.000 population. With this result they are the best. Their best score is 0.9 - almost a medal per 100.000 population.\nNorway, on other hand, wins more then a medal per 100.000 population in Winter Games. Their best score is 1.16 medal points ","e76e9457":"### Now the graphs\nNext we will show graph for each country in top 5 for season of top 10 events with won medal points.","5f301542":"### Group athletes into teams\nWe are not interested in performance of an athlete but teams (e.g. China basketball team). Therefore we group same country athletes into teams by grouping by year, season, team and event. Furthermore we sum medals. If we leave it this way number of medals of group sports will be multiplied. We actually want to get number of medals per event. Thus we change every number of medals > 0 to 1. After that we reset index to return the data into dataframe.\nSince I know I will do this more than once, I'll make a function out of it (I know because I've already done this :) )","cc0a766e":"### Now we want a string that we will use to get only needed columns\nBy needed I meant those years when Olympic games took place. We also need country name. These are column names.","82bf22f6":"### We saw which countries are the sportiest\nNot sure if that is even english word, but I guess you know what I mean. Number of participants show us how sporty a country is. Now, one last details is left for analysis: how sporty AND successfull countries are. For this, we will compare population with medal points. Good thing is we have most of the functionality and data ready.\n\nFirst we do summer!","617532a6":"### Now we know the sportiest countries \nIt is Slovenia and Latvia for Winter Games, and New Zealand for Summer Games. Now I want to see couple of more details. First of all, what are the averages of ParticipantsPer100kPop in best years, what are ParticipantsPer100kPop results over years for the mentioned countries, and how number of Olympians and habitants changed over years for these three countries.","d7a7f450":"### Now we show comparison for Bulgaria!","344ca18b":"### Interesting!\nWhen we look at parameter which shows how many points got a team per event then some other countries are stars! Netherland in Winter Olympics, and Ethiopia in Summer Olympics. \nTo be honest, this view is not absolutely fair. The reason is that for single sports like running and skiing for one event more participants can participate from the same team. This means that a country participating on basketball tournament can have 0, 1, 2 or even 3 points from same event. A country participating 100m running event and having multiple (capable) participant can get 0, 1, 2 and 3 but also 4, 5 and 6 points. And this is the twist. \nMaybe more fair approach would be to separately show group and single sports. But that is idea for some other time :).","04fb3048":"### Now winter\nNext we do winter.","bb2c6ba2":"### Want to see who the best is\nAdding sum of medals and weighted sum. We need this to say who the best is :). Weighted sum is simple (multiplying number of gold medals with 3, silver with 2 and then summing up with bronze medals.","066267a4":"### Let's define new features \nNew feature will give us number of medals per participant, medals per sport and medals per event. Formula should be Medal_pts \/ participants. Numbers will be usually below 1.\n\nReality is that some sports (like basketball) require more participants then some other (skiing). Therefore medal_pts per event sounds like great indicator of success - how many did I achieve of my target.","56f1f490":"### To avoid messing up the masterpiece we copy the dataframe\nTo be able to roll back to our \"final\" data we copy the dataframe.","977c8497":"### Let's get the population\nWe get the population of countries from CSV file and check the head if dataframe.","427f2d15":"### Anyway, winter first!","7116de1f":"### Let's select only relevant columns\nWe create new dataframe with relevant columns and all the rows.","598eb635":"### Now we create dictionary with translations\nKey of the dictionary is existing name and value is new name aligned with teams' names in \"Athletes\" dataframe.","c61b785b":"Or Canada in winter.","2d58ab43":"### Graphs are messy\nBut we learned something: there are big variations between years for some countries.

And we use it again now.","81963bba":"### Now we sum up based on teams \nWe sum up all medals that a team got in between 1994 and 2016.","4855af60":"### Now we repeat process\n1. we check if there are countries that are in list of medals and events\n2. We melt the population data\n3. we merge population data with our \"total\" data","a39ddcb7":"### Variables\nLet us create some variables that will help us write less. I know which I need since this is not the first version of the notebook :).","1bf5aa6c":"### We do not want to show countries that have too few medals.\nThat is not because we do not want to show them but it is crowdie. So we remove those that at best years had less or equal to 5 medal. (My Croatia is still in the list :) ). Then we draw bubble plot where size of bubbles is defined by weighted sum of medals.","c46a80d6":"### Create dummy features for different medals\nTo help in future manipulation we are turning textual field Medal (Gold, Bronze, Silver, NaN) in separate features. Since not all athletes won medals \"no medal\" is real possibility. Thus we don't have to remove any dummy features.","38b0e55c":"### Now the graph\nActually following code could be written differently but to make it easier to follow I kept it in two lines (I could also create new function that would call those two or even design drawGraphBestYears to call returnDFOfBestYears).","40702de5":"### Looking at the graph we see one interesting thing:\nThere is far less countries with more than 5 medals in best years in winter Olympics then on summer. Which is normal since there is less events. It would be interesting to see which countries are on one or other or both lists? This requires a bit of a different approach. Firstly we create two separate dataframes out of list of teams winning more than 5 medals in summer and winter Olympics. Then we in both dataframes add column 'Game' with value 1 for summer and 2 for winter. Then we merged two dataframes and summed 'Game' column and got new frame. In new frame if value of column 'Game' is 1 then the team won more than 5 medals only in summer, if it is 2 then the team won more than 5 medals only in winter, and if it is three then in both. Drew the graph with changed y tick labels to reflect the logic.","e98154b3":"### Let's see how countries' results relate to population!\nWe already added two features in data set: ParticipantsPer100kPop (number of participants on a game per 100.000 habitants of the country) & MedalPointsPer100kcapita (how many medal points got a country per 100.000 habitants).\n\nFor this we will use the existing (already used) functions: returnDFOfBestYears & drawGraphBestYears.","496ecf00":"### How sporty a country is?\nThe idea behind this is to check how many Olympians a country has but per capita. Or, to get nicer number, per 100.000 habitants. This number should show us a dedication on a country side. Having said that, there are a limited number of events or Olympians a country can send. Therefore this point of view might suit small countries more than large countries. But, nevertheless we will check it. First we do summer.","044a9dc0":"### This is how the data looks now\nWe have all the previously added data like number of events on which country participated and we added GDP. ","06508b60":"### Olympians per capita for Summer Olympic games.","31a8fd92":"### Let's see how the dataframe looks now\nWell only the head of the dataframe, but you get the point.","d153c1ed":"### This is how masterpiece data looks like\nLet's check what we got!","69e4a0a7":"### Conclusion about coefficient of variation - sort of (1\/2)\nUnlike at other cases here is better who is lower on graph. So, in Winter Olympic Games the most reliable countries are Germany and Norway. In Summer Olympic Games the most reliable are United States and France. \n\nLet\u2019s print France in summer and Norway in winter.","a44255f6":"### So for Latvia is getting easier\nSince population is dropping in Latvia, they will, probably, get even better in number of participants per capita.","057fc982":"### Comparing to Medal points graphs we see difference\nIn case of medal points graphs best years for countries are latter years (closer to 2016) whereas on the graph \"Billions of GDP per medal point\" best years are earlier years. This is explainable with growth of GDP over years. For example let's check GDP for Bulgaria (the lowest number of USD billions per medal point in summer games - 0,3), and Norway (the lowest number of USD billions per medal point in winter games - 2,59) and compare it with number of medals.\n\nBeing lazy as I am, first we do a function. The function is parameterized so it can be used later.","f87dacea":"### It is all the GDP data\nWe can check the data to format \/ shape \/ content.","10aee7f5":"### Is number of medals enough?\nProbably not. We need to see how many events were at each game to see potentially maximal number of medals.

This time there will be no more athletes and no more events. Only teams.

The dataset includes data until year 2016.","67021913":"### Now summer!","e946ae4d":"### The idea!\nThe idea is to see beyond absolute number of medal or medal points. This is why I added features Medal points per participant (MedalPtsPerPart), Medal points per sport (MedalPtsPerSport) and Medal points per event (MedalPtsPerEvent). The new features could show us a different story. Right?\n\nSo, we are going to use previously written functions returnDFOfBestYears and drawGraphBestYears (I guess now you see why I did put it in function ;) ). \n\n### First we going to do summer\nFirst season we are going to cover is summer. We will draw best year for a country based on medal points per event. It should be good view since it shows how many points you won vs. how many points you could win. With a twist.","c354da84":"### Let's move to financial data\nIt is only GDP for the countries. We want to see GDP only in years when games took place and remove the rest. First we import the data."}}
