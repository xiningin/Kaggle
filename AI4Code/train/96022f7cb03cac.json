rather a quick snapshot of how healthy is our community.\n\nIt has been a while that I notice more and more users getting high kaggle ranks in a short amount of time (people becoming expert within a day, or masters in a month) and, reading the forums very frequently, I have also noticed that the comments are becoming more and more in the lines of *thanks for sharing* and *please upvote my other work*.\n\nVery often I notice nice notebooks being published with even some non-trivial approach in it that could spark interesting conversations and a little army of users that just post links to their own notebook about another topic, completely unrelated to what they are commenting.\n\nTherefore, I decided to check if it is me getting grumpy the older I get or the quality of the forums is significantly dropping.\n\nThis notebook will focus on 4 things: \n\n* Average number of questions asked over time\n* Average number of requests of upvotes over time\n* Average number of self-promoting comments over time\n* Average number of thank you over time\n\nTo do so, Meta Kaggle is the perfect dataset.","23280d6c":"One hand, yes, it is just me being more and more grumpy the older I get, since the requests of upvotes are about 2.5% (excluding the one contained in the Notebooks) and the self promotion is around 0.2% of the comments. However, it is undeniable how the trend is to ask less and less questions and the thirst for upvotes is getting bigger and bigger.\n\nIf we focus on the comments on Notebooks, we notice that the requests for upvotes are twice as many than the average.","d65829e6":"Which is sad because many users put a lot of effort in creating quality content (not me, not this notebook) and all they get back is glorified spam.\n\nNow, I don't deny it is nice the feeling of getting upvoted and a community that says thank you more often is not a negative thing. However, I fear the quality of the conversation in a community of data scientists eager to learn everything about their field is going to deteriorate to a simple hunt for upvotes like any forgettable social media.\n\nThe Kaggle ranking system, as far as I know, decays the points, not the achievements. Everyone will eventually become a Kaggle expert if we simply continue being active. There is no point in getting there faster and it doesn't build a portfolio that a company will appreciate (unless you are applying for social media manager, in that case your ability of getting likes is a must).\n\nI don't want to open the pandora box of users putting upvotes only to get upvoted, or texting you in private on LinkedIn to arrange some sort of upvotes trade. None of this is against the rules and it gets, at worst, in the category of the poor taste but the reason we are here is the quality of the community and if we undermine it we won't have a place to learn the next new thing.\n\nSpeaking of poor taste, there are so many ways to get upvotes, like slapping a fairly non informative wordcloud"}}
