Mean: Tells us that on an average, around 24 mosquitos are attracted to beer individuals, while the average number of mosquitos attracted to water treatment individuals is 19. \n\n2. Median: We also saw in the box and whisker plot, the median tells us the middle values of the data for two treatmnets. 24 and 20 for the beer and water treatments.\n\n3. Standard Deviation : It tells you, on average, how far each response lies from the mean. For Beer Treatment it is 4.04 and for Water treatment it is 3.56.\n\n4.

Ranging from 12 to 30 mosquitos, using a box and whisker plot allows us to see that individuals who had the beer treatment were more attractive to mosquitos than the individuals who had the water treatment.\n \n2. The table above shows us that the median of the beer measurements, 24 mosquitos, corresponds with the higher interquartile of the water treatment group. \n\n3. The median of the water treatment group, 20 mosquitos, corresponds to the lower interquartile of the beer treatment group. \n\n4. This shows us that a higher number of mosquitos targeted the beer group, this is because the lower interquartile for that group is still higher that the median and maximum number of mosquitos in the water group. \n\n### Therefore, if we interpret this table alone, it would support the argument that beer intake will increase the amount of mosquitos that are attracted to an individual.","1aac156d":"### We are interested to know just how unusual it is to get a difference as big as we actually see, in these many samples of differences we expect by chance, from random sampling.\n\n### To do this we calculate : The P-Value\n\n### By observing where our initial test statistic (4.38) falls within this distribution, we obtain our p-value.
