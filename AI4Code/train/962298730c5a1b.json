As we noticed above, the long difference between the two day and not receiving the SMS reminder leads to not show up of patient to their appointment.\n\n## Limitations\n\n* We need more indicators to explore why patients who don't have scholship show up to their medical appointment more than patien who have scholarship.\n\n* We need more indicators about transport and how far the hospital to patients house.\n\n* We need more indicators about situation fiancial and social about patients.\n\n* We need more variety dataset, we need a pupolation where we have more old age patients, more patients who have diseases...etc.\n\n\n\n","6183b377":"the 3539 null values are the rows where the Age = 0.
