So, we have to repeat the measurements. It results in obtaining a set of values. The representation of the distribution of data values is done by plotting a single data point (known as mean value of dataset) and an error bar to represent the overall distribution of data.","7161643e":"<h2 style=\"color:blue;\">Bar Chart :<\/h2>\n\n**Function :**\n\nPresents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. \n\n**When to use:**\n\nIt is used when to compare between several groups.\n\nBar Plot shows the distribution of data over several groups.
