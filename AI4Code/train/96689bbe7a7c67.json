Hence, in the present scenario, wastewater-based epidemiology, and sewage surveillance may provide valuable insights into the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the human population and could serve as a sensitive surveillance system and a crucial early warning tool.\n\nFurther studies are required to determine the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, transmissibility through wastewater, and the potential to infect humans via the fecal-oral route.

Clinical, laboratory and imaging data were recorded.\n\nOf the 69 COVID-19 patients, 20 (28.99 %) had positive fecal viral tests who were younger, had lower C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen (FIB) levels on admission (all P < 0.05), and showed more improvement and less progression on chest CT during recovery. \n\nThe median duration of positive viral signals was significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory samples (P < 0.05). In spite of the negative oropharyngeal swabs, eleven patients were tested positive for viral RNA in stool specimens, with their fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA Ct (cycle threshold) values reaching 25\u201327. 6 of these 11 patients' Ct values rebounded.\n\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistence was significantly longer in fecal samples than in oropharyngeal swabs<\/font>\n\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens was associated with a milder condition and better recovery of chest CT results while the median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistence was significantly longer in fecal samples than in oropharyngeal swabs.

These reports demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might occur in the gastrointestinal tract, which may result in transmission by the fecal-oral route.\n\nMost importantly, the risk of aerosol or contact transmission associated with fecal samples warrants more attention. Notably, clearance of viral RNA from patients\u2019 stool specimens requires more time than clearance from oropharyngeal samples . \n\nThe dynamic changes in the viral load of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens are not clear. In addition to the epidemiology, COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, which is considered to be associated with prolonged symptoms.\n\nHowever, whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens has a strong relationship with the condition and prognosis of COVID-19 is unclear.https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7455175\/","ce3285ab":"<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Prognoses between Patients with Positive and Negative Fecal Tests<\/font>\n\nThe authors found that most of the symptoms and laboratory findings did not differ between patients with positive and negative fecal viral tests.\n\nChest CT results showed heterogeneity of the lesions in different lobes of the lung.

Second, the sample size of COVID-19 patients with positive fecal viral tests was relatively smaller than the sample of patients with negative respiratory viral tests (20 vs 49). \n\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens does not necessarily indicate more severe condition and poor recovery.\n\nThe median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistence was significantly longer in fecal samples than in oropharyngeal swabs.

In view of the possible role of asymptomatic and undiagnosed COVID-19 patients in transmitting the disease via the fecal-oral route, strict wastewater surveillance should be implemented as a preventive measure, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus present in water, soil, and other environmental compartments will finally accumulate in the wastewater and sewage.\n\nNovel computational surveillance methods are being used for analyzing wastewater based epidemiology of COVID-19 at national and global levels and temperature, average in-sewer travel time, and per-capita water use have been identified as critical variables. \n\nBesides, many new economic and rapid monitoring tools are being developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and wastewater, including ELISA, paper-based indicator methods, and biosensors. These tools will reveal the accurate picture of the ongoing pandemic associated with a specific population linked to a wastewater treatment plant.\n\nSewage and wastewater surveillance can help in the screening of entire population. it is non-invasive, as well as it can help in diagnosis well before the detection of clinical cases.

However,the sensitivity of WBE for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is less as compared to norovirus due to the low viral load in wastewater.\n\nWastewater can get tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but cannot isolate the infective virions. Based on structural characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 it is assumed to behave differently in aqueous environments but still considerable persistence in various environments provides clues regarding risks of transmission. \nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7728433\/","a651714c":"<font color=\"#E74C3C\">In wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 50% samples<\/font>\n\nIn wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 50% samples (6\/12) from influent untreated wastewaters in the world's worst-affected country, Italy. \n\nRecently, it has been speculated with an apprehension of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through irrigation system that relies in the majority of places through usage of sewage water especialy the less developed countires. Amid ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and emerging evidences of SARS-CoV-2 presence in the wastewater one must be hesitant to reuse the unprocessed or partially processed waterwater for irrigation.\n\nThe sensitivity of WBE may depend upon the population size of sewer catchment, proportion of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and mildly symptomatic individuals. Viral particles or RNA in sewage samples represents a collection of virus shed by many people in the community; hence it is equivalent to pooled testing.\n\nMoreover, global investigators highlighted that sewage surveillance could reveal the true scale of the COVID-19 pandemic and helps in designing crucial policy makings to contain the virus.\n\nWaterborne viruses often enter and contaminate water sources through contaminated feces, and the same has been proposed for COVID-19 . Its survival in water, transmissibility through water, and potential to infect the consumers are vital issues that need to be explored for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAlthough enveloped viruses like coronaviruses (CoVs) have different structural and survival characteristics in water compared to non-enveloped viruses especially the waterborne enteric viruses like norovirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A virus or adenovirus which are excreted in large amounts in feces and are responsible for major water-related outbreaks, timely investigation and current evidence necessitate future strategies for prevention of any possible eventuality.\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Frequent Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Sewage Water.

However, as viruses cannot replicate outside the host cell, their detection in environmental samples\/surfaces and sewage suggests their excretion by infected humans or animals.\n\nFor host cell entry, SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract (enterocytes) and other internal organs, like the testes, kidneys, and heart, but has medium to low expression in the lungs (type 2 pneumocytes), liver, blood, spleen, and brain. \n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT)<\/font>\n\nThe higher expression of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is also supported by SARS-CoV-2 shedding for a longer duration from the stool samples of patients with COVID-19. Consequently, diarrhea has been observed in 2 to 50% (average, 10.4%) of COVID-19 patients, with or without respiratory symptoms.\n\nAlthough current evidence suggests the involvement of the GIT in SARS-CoV-2 infection, evidence for the direct involvement of the liver is lacking. Further studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying viral shedding via the fecal route, and to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 is a hepato- or cholangio-tropic virus that can be secreted into the bile.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7728433\/","9e1b9312":"<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Symptoms and Laboratory Findings on Admission<\/font>\n\nFever was more common in patients with negative fecal viral tests than in patients with positive viral tests (58 % vs 22 %, P = 0.039). \n\nSix (10.53 %) of the 49 patients with negative fecal viral tests presented breathlessness, which was not observed in the patients with positive fecal viral tests.
