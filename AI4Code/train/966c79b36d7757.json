Does the correlation make sense?**","0d821ab4":"## Get the Data\n\nWe'll work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:\n\n* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.\n* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes\n* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes\n* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member. \n\n** Read in the Customers csv file as a DataFrame called customers.**","13c5451d":"**Check the head of customers, and check out its info() and describe() methods.**","5ed6541b":"** Train\/fit lm on the training data.**","b3f76fee":"** Use model_selection.train_test_split from sklearn to split the data into training and testing sets.

Let's quickly explore the residuals to make sure everything was okay with our data. \n\n**Plot a histogram of the residuals and make sure it looks normally distributed. Use either seaborn distplot, or just plt.hist().**","f6eab7f0":"## Imports\n** Import pandas, numpy, matplotlib,and seaborn. Then set %matplotlib inline \n(You'll import sklearn as you need it.)**","418a0a64":"In this exercise consider following scenario:\n\nYou just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions\/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.\n\nThe company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!\n\nJust follow the steps below to analyze the customer data.","1b69dc8d":"## Training the Model\n\nNow its time to train our model on our training data!\n\n** Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model **","563b31ef":"*Answer here*","f48fef76":"**Create an instance of a LinearRegression() model named lm.**","230b930c":"## Training and Testing Data\n\nNow that we've explored the data a bit, let's go ahead and split the data into training and testing sets.\n** Set a variable X equal to the numerical features of the customers and a variable y equal to the \"Yearly Amount Spent\" column. **","87b9d973":"**Create a linear model plot (using seaborn's lmplot) of  Yearly Amount Spent vs. Length of Membership. **","7d74e478":"**Let's explore these types of relationships across the entire data set.

Or maybe that doesn't even really matter, and Membership Time is what is really important.  Let's see if we can interpret the coefficients at all to get an idea.\n\n** Recreate the dataframe below. **","074b00ca":"**Based off this plot what looks to be the most correlated feature with Yearly Amount Spent?**"}}
