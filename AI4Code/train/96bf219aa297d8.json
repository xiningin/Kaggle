Comparing reading and writing to each other results in a narrower distribution than comparing either subject to math scores.\n\nLogically, this makes sense. Reading and writing are closely related, and often taught within the same class in schools When plotting data we can actually see the relationship visualized here.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that students who struggled appear to have struggled in all three subjects.","416b59d8":"## A little bit of wrangling\n\nFor certain plots, I'd like to break down the score columns. Lets move subject into it's own column and store all scores together to make the data easier to plot.","adc635ca":"# Race\/ethnicity vs Test Scores","05a923a3":"## Importing data\n\nFirst we'll need to import our data and see what we're working with.","c3d7c34d":"# Analyzing Student Test Score Data\n\nI look into visualizing and analyzing test scores in reading, writing, and math from students accross different genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds.\n\nLet's see what we can find.","7eb9c2a7":"Variation based upon race\/ethnicity is noticable but not drastic. Group E (highest) averages about 10 points higher than group A (lowest).\n\nRegardless, this may potentially be used to inform quality of education based on community. A further study comparing more homogenized school districts vs more divers districts may be warranted to see the outcome of diversity on education and test performance.\n\nThis could also possibly inform funding or systemic issues within the educational system, depending on what further data can be obtained.","728cb03e":"# Lunch Status vs Test Scores","df82c8e0":"On initial inspection this appears to show that students on a free\/reduced lunch program scored lower on average than students on standard lunch, across the board.\n\nwhile this may be significant, the smaller sample size of free\/reduced lunch does cast doubt. Repeated studies may be necessary to determine actual correlation.\n\nIf we decide that there is correlation here and that lunch status informs household income status, this should be cause for concern. Without quality education it can be hard for citizens to rise above poor financial situations. The largest difference appears to be in math scores which is even greater cause for concern. Math skills directly impact things like the ability properly manage personal accounting matters."}}
