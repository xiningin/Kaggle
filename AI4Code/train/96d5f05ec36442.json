(Learning new things is What I believe \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23)\nIt is a python module, which helps us to print table on terminal. It is one of the basic python modules for reading and writing text tables in ASCII code. It aims to make the interface as similar as possible like csv module in Python. The texttable module supports both fixed-size tables (where column sizes are pre-determined) and dynamic-size tables (where columns can added or removed).","e841873e":"Now let's create a texttable object:","560f6068":"First create a list to save the data in:","aef92d71":"## 1) Install bs4:","ca8fb41b":"## 3) Install texttable:","273e9304":"Now let's make a loop so that we can keep getting the data we require to be saved:","dbccd670":"### 4) Let's Import all the libraries:","afa6bb65":"### 6) Get URL html:","baa2f6cd":"So, with this, we will get started with writing \u270d\ufe0f our own code for scrapping the data for **COVID-19** data from the below website \u270c\ufe0f\n\n'https:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/coronavirus\/countries-where-coronavirus-has-spread\/'","765da5cd":"## Pre code for web scrapping and all the concept:\n\nBut first if you have not gone through the **\"\ud83c\udf10Web Scrapping of Flipkart For Laptops\ud83d\udcbb\u2714\ufe0f\"** click on the below link to see what is web scrapping and how to do it on Flipkart website below:\n\n**https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/riteshpatil8998\/web-scrapping-of-flipkart-for-laptops**","66800352":"## 8) Let's now use iter(), but why must be the question?\n\nThe iter() function creates an object which can be iterated one element at a time.\n\nThese objects are useful when coupled with loops like for loop, while loop.","1265da42":"# Introduction:\n\nSo as you have seen what is web scrapping and how to scrape data from Flipkart, now we will dive more into various websites to scrape data so that we can work on the datat scrappedd for analysis."}}
