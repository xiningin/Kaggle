Different forumula are appropriate for different contexts; you will need to use your discretion for which score is most appropriate for your corpus.\n\nFor example, consider the **Gunning Fog Score**: \n\nNamed after Robert Gunning, the Gunning Fog Score was originally developed in the early 1940s to reduce \u201cfog\u201d in newspapers and business writing. Gunning was a private consultant for newspapers and businesses; his objective was to help his clients produce more clear, accesible writing that could reach wider audiences. This was the logic underlying the Fog Index, which is considered to be one of the most reliable and simplest forumula to apply:\n       \n> Fog Index = 0.4 * ((average sentence length) + (percentage of Hard Words))\n>\n> Where *Hard Words* = words with more than two syllables\n\nBut there are many different scores designed for various applications.

It can also mean the number of years of education generally required to understand this text, relevant when the formula results in a number greater than 10. \n\nFor example, a score of 9.3 means that a ninth grader would be able to read the document.\n\nIt is calculated as follows: \n\n![equation_2.svg](attachment:equation_2.svg)","10e8a51a":"### Dale-Chall Readability socre\n\nProvides a numeric gauge of the comprehension difficulty that readers come upon when reading a text.

In natural language, readability depends on its content (i.e. the complexity of vocabulary and syntax). Our focus in readability analysis is the words themselves -- in particular, how they are arranged into more or less comprehensible sentences and paragraphs.\n\nThink about what good writing looks like. Good writing is intended to communicate information. If a piece of writing fails to convey that information, it is likely because it was not written in a clear, straightfoward fashion. The types of words used and the structure of grammar are thus crucial towards creating a more or less readable document. This is the intuition behind readability metrics - that good writing follows a consistent structure, one that can be quantified.\n\nBelow, we will explore various readability formulae used in NLP. Readability Scores were originally designed to assist writers in improving their content  to make it understandable for larger audiences.\n\n## Textastistic\n\nLet's start with the Textastic software from Erin Hengel.
