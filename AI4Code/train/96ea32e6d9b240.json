This concluded that the genetic component is likely to contribute more to the emergence of diabetes in the Pima Indians and their offspring.","31e61108":"# Introduction\n\nActually it was a question for many scientists why so many Pima Indian Women suffer from diabetes in relation to other ethnicities.\n\nThe study was carried out by scientists to investigate the significance of health-related predictors of diabetes in **Pima Indians Women**. The study population was the females 21 years and above of Pima Indian heritage patients of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases. \n\nThe research question was: what are the health predictions that associated with the presence of diabetes in Pima Indians? \n\nThe study aimed at testing the significance of health-related predictors of diabetes in Pima Indians women. That was according to World Health Organization criteria (i.e. if the 2-hour post-load plasma glucose was at least 200 mg\/dl at any survey examination or if found during routine medical care). A total of 768 women were registered in the database.\n\nSo, here we have to find out why so many Pima Indian Women suffer from diabetes in relation to other ethnicities?\n\nTo find the reason behind this, we have to find whether there is a relationship between the numbers of times a women was pregnant and the BMIs of Pima Indian Women older than 21 years old, or whether the women have diabetes and their diabetes pedigree function (a function that represents how likely they are to get the disease by extrapolating from their ancestor\u2019s history).\n\nSo lets start the analysis, but before that, I think we should understand our dataset and good to have basic knowledge of diabetes also.\n\n\n### What is Diabetes?\n\nDiabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn\u2019t make enough\u2014or any\u2014insulin or doesn\u2019t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn\u2019t reach your cells.\n\n### What is Gestational Diabetes?\nGestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you\u2019ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes causes high blood sugar that can affect the pregnancy and the baby\u2019s health. \n\nResults indicate that the highest prevalence of diabetes is found in high rates in Indian Pima.\n\nSo, lets start and try to find out why Pima Indians Women have higher rate of diabetes.","5f260fa9":"**Use the predict method to predict values using your KNN model and X_test.**","3cb66d85":"<p style=\"font-weight: bold;color:#FF4500\">Highlights<\/p>\n\nIt is surprising that the median BMI does not immensely change as the number of pregnancies increases.

Each point on the ROC curve represents a sensitivity\/specificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. A test with perfect discrimination (no overlap in the two distributions) has a ROC curve that passes through the upper left corner (100% sensitivity, 100% specificity). Therefore the closer the ROC curve is to the upper left corner, the higher the overall accuracy of the test.\n\nAUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for classification problem at various thresholds settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s.\n\n* The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. \n* It is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.\n* The TPR defines how many correct positive results occur among all positive samples available during the test. \n* The FPR defines how many incorrect positive results occur among all negative samples available during the test.\n* What is a good ROC value? A rough guide for classifying the accuracy of a diagnostic test is the traditional academic point system\": .90-1 = excellent (A) .80-.90 = good (B) .70-.80 = fair (C) .60-.70 = poor (D)\n","117c49b9":"<p style=\"font-weight: bold;color:#FF4500\">Highlights<\/p>\n* It seems that Insulin is highly correlated with Glucose (about 0.58), BMI (about 0.23) and Age (about 0.22). It means that as the values of glucose, BMI and Age increase, the insuline is also increasing. It seems logical also that fat and aged people might have high level of insuline in their bodies.\n* In the same way SkinThickness is highly correlated with BMI (about 0.65).","5255e471":"Let us see distribution and also boxplot for outliers of feature \"Pregnancies\".","d5e4b124":"## Missing values counts","5daccbb0":"### Heatmap to find correlation ","c031954c":"<p style=\"font-weight: bold;color:#FF4500\">Highlights<\/p>\nThe pairs plot builds on two basic figures, the histogram and the scatter plot.
