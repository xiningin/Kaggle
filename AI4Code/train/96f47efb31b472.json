This notebook is rather meant to be for someone who might not know where to start. As an ml beginner myself, I find it helpful to play with these sorts of commented kernels. Any suggestions for improvement or comments on poor coding practices are appreciated!","b6883c04":"## How did our model do?\n### You should have gotten around 0.10, or 10% accuracy. This is terrible. 10% accuracy is what get if you randomly guess a number. There are many ways to improve this, including not using a vector classifier, but here's a simple one to start. Let's just simplify our images by making them true black and white.\n\n- To make this easy, any pixel with a value simply becomes 1 and everything else remains 0.\n- We'll plot the same image again to see how it looks now that it's black and white. Look at the histogram now."}}
