Each module will have a word explanation, some code examples, and a more information section which you can use to dig deeper into the nuances of Python. To provide beginners with the best experience, **I recommend forking this notebook** (you should be able to do so at the top right), which will allow you to read the comments I write within the code in a much neater format.
