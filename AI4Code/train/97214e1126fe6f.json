In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among America\u2019s most vulnerable learners continue to grow. \n\n problem statement:\n\n*    What is the picture of digital connectivity and engagement in 2020?\n*    What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online and distance learning, and how might this also evolve in the future?\n*    How does student engagement with different types of education technology change over the course of the pandemic?\n*    How does student engagement with online learning platforms relate to different geography? Demographic context (e.g., race\/ethnicity, ESL, learning disability)? Learning context? Socioeconomic status?\n*    Do certain state interventions, practices or policies (e.g., stimulus, reopening, eviction moratorium) correlate with the increase or decrease online engagement?\n","3823122d":"Work in progress....\n\nPlease upvote it\n\nThank You :)"}}
