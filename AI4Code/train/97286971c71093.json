A mechanism of action usually includes mention of the specific molecular targets to which the drug binds, such as an enzyme or receptor. Receptor sites have specific affinities for drugs based on the chemical structure of the drug, as well as the specific action that occurs there.\n\nIn this competition, the task is predicting multiple targets of the Mechanism of Action (MoA) responses of different samples. Samples are drugs profiled at different time points and doses. Dataset consists of various group of features and there are more than two hundred targets of enzymes and receptors."}}
