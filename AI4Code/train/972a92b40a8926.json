Emm now here multiplicative principle fails so badly and subtraction principle come to rescue us. So what will be the answer.\n\nwe know that Number of words that consists of 4 letters are (26 * 26 * 26 * 26)  but how can we say compute that these words consists of atleast on vowel \n\nfor example if we have\n\nabc[26] if we have a b c word where a is a vowel we have 26 letter available for the last slot but\nbbs[5] in this case where we have no vowel on first 3 slots  we have only 5 choices so here is something that is dependent on the previous selection. SO what can we do here\n\n\nWe know that we have 5 vowels in a english and 21 consonants and we can easily calculate words consists of only consonants i.e 21 * 21 * 21 * 21 i.e 194481 Now we can easily calculate words include atleast 1 vowels i.e\n\n\nTotal words       - Words include only consonants = Words includes atleast 1 vowel\n26 * 26 * 26 * 26 - 21 * 21 * 21 * 21             = 262495","fe7cfce3":"# What if we want to know that in list [101 ... 401] How many numbers are divisible by 5?\n\n1. Take first element in list which is divisible by 5 (in our case its 105)\n2. Take Last element in list which is divisible by 5 (in our case its 400)\n3. Apply formula \n\n# Formula\n> ( First_element + (n-1)5 = last_element) -----> n = (last_element - first_element \/ 5) + 1\n\n# Time Difference:\n\nYou will see that their is a hugh time difference in fucntion in which we use some counting formula and on the other hand we using sequential method to solve the problem (like most of the programmers do)\n","775eedf0":"# Multiplication Principle.\nSometime we have to find out combinations that our algorithm have to find process and we also have to calculate that time taken by our algorithm to perform that action e.g if our algorithm will takes 1 sec to process 1 combination. than our algorithm will takes 9000sec to process 9000 combinations. i.e 150 mins to performa task. In some cases we have to find alot of combinations.\n\n\n# Real time Example\nI am going to share a real time example that I have been gone through.\n\nI am working as data-scientist in programmers force. Now our goal is to make image clear enough to read text from the image for that we have to apply a list of filters to get our work done. We were working on real time and you know that every image is different from other because some images are capture with dslr some with varity of mobile cams now if we apply every filter on the image some images are crystal clear but some becomes so bad and if we are playing with images order of filters do matter e.g if we apply erision filter on image and than apply dillation filter on the image their will be no effect on the image so this combination is so bad. and if we apply erision filter and than apply remove_small_dots filter on the image this combination gives really satisfying results. Now we have to find combination of filters that we will apply on every image and predict it from our model and keep on apply filter until the model confidence becomes greater than 95 percent. We have total of 12 filters and in 1 request we have to process approximate 12 images. for every request our alogrithm is taking 100ms to process 1 combination on 1 image. Now we have total of **12!(479001600) combination** and **12 images**. So total we have **5748019200 combination to process 1 request**  approximatly 18 years to process 1 request. Damn if we go into the coding without knowing about the figures we lost our 1 to 2 weeks that will be totaly useless. So its really good to find out algorithm complexity before diving into the code and improve your algorithms on paper to save your time.\n\n\nIn this section we will learn some multiplicative techniques that will help us out in finding our algorithm's time complexity","979f9724":"Practice Examples:\n\n# Question 1\nIn a sports stadium with numbered seats, every seat is occupied except seats  33  through  97 .\n\nHow many seats are still available?

But often we just lose our interest in this because of boring and complicated statistic terms. Yes, probability and statistics are boring, but today I want to change your attitude to this and show a little bit more convenient way to learn all the important concepts.
