It's more about weaknesses than strengths:\n\n1. DJ let down by driving (not hitting enough fairways) and short putting.\n2. Rory let down by his bunker play.\n3. BK no obvious weakness (world ranking 1).\n\nMy other analysis suggested that GIR was the most important stat. Here BK leads but it is the tiniest of margins!"}}
