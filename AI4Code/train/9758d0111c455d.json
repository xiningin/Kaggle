Our problem is a regression problem. We want to identify relationship between output (Survived or not) with other variables or features (Gender, Age, Port...). We are also perfoming a category of machine learning which is called supervised learning as we are training our model with a given dataset. With these two criteria - Supervised Learning, we can narrow down our choice of models to a few. These include:\n\n- Linear Regression\n- Support Vector Machines and Linear SVR\n- Stochastic Gradient Descent, GradientBoostingRegressor, RidgeCV, BaggingRegressor\n- Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest, XGBRegressor, LGBM, ExtraTreesRegressor\n- MLPRegressor (Deep Learning)\n- VotingRegressor","355a20fd":"### 5.1 Linear Regression <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"5.1\"><\/a>\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)","5e85c98b":"### 5.6 Decision Tree Regressor <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"5.6\"><\/a>\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)","9997b4a1":"**Stochastic gradient descent** (often abbreviated **SGD**) is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties (e.g. differentiable or subdifferentiable). It can be regarded as a stochastic approximation of gradient descent optimization, since it replaces the actual gradient (calculated from the entire data set) by an estimate thereof (calculated from a randomly selected subset of the data). Especially in big data applications this reduces the computational burden, achieving faster iterations in trade for a slightly lower convergence rate.

It splits the tree leaf wise with the best fit whereas other boosting algorithms split the tree depth wise or level wise rather than leaf-wise. So when growing on the same leaf in Light GBM, the leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than the level-wise algorithm and hence results in much better accuracy which can rarely be achieved by any of the existing boosting algorithms. Also, it is surprisingly very fast, hence the word \u2018Light\u2019.

The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees (e.g. max_depth, min_samples_leaf, etc.) lead to fully grown and unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be controlled by setting those parameter values. Reference [sklearn documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier.html). \n\nIn extremely randomized trees, randomness goes one step further in the way splits are computed. As in random forests, a random subset of candidate features is used, but instead of looking for the most discriminative thresholds, thresholds are drawn at random for each candidate feature and the best of these randomly-generated thresholds is picked as the splitting rule. This usually allows to reduce the variance of the model a bit more, at the expense of a slightly greater increase in bias.

This type of problem is very common in machine learning tasks, where the \"best\" solution must be chosen using limited data. If a unique solution exists, algorithm will return the optimal value. However, if multiple solutions exist, it may choose any of them. Reference [Brilliant.org](https:\/\/brilliant.org\/wiki\/ridge-regression\/).","9cdb8f1c":"The core principle of **AdaBoost** is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each so-called boosting iteration consist of applying N weights to each of the training samples. Initially, those weights are all set to 1\/N, so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted data. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence.

In each stage n_classes_ regression trees are fit on the negative gradient of the binomial or multinomial deviance loss function. Binary classification is a special case where only a single regression tree is induced. The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore, the best found split may vary, even with the same training data and max_features=n_features, if the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits enumerated during the search of the best split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting, random_state has to be fixed.
