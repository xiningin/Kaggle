So, in this first iteration, our focus is on the selection of features from the available training dataset.\n## Finding out Feature importance\nWe need to know which the important features are. In order to find that out, we are going to train the model using the Random Forest classifier. After that, we will have a rough idea about the important features for us.","9aab95db":"## Implementing hyperparameter tuning\nHere, we will look at how we can obtain optimal values for the parameters.

Other classifiers, such as logistic regression, KNN, and RandomForest do not perform well on the validation set.

After building several model we ended up with two  GradientBoosting and AdaBoost which performed better than others followed by Random Forest. We dicided to go further with the two and implemented a voting-based for the two which will allow us to choose the best model.
