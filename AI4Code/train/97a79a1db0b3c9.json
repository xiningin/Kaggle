One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.\n\nThe columns in this dataset are:\n\n*     Id\n*     SepalLengthCm\n*     SepalWidthCm\n*     PetalLengthCm\n* PetalWidthCm\n*     Species\n\nIn this Notebook, we are going to predit the species of Iris based on the its features like length and width of Sepal and Petal.","3b58f860":"**Correlations in the dataset**","6159d125":"**Findings:**\n* Length of Sepal correlates with the length and width of the petals in the flowers","5616b12c":"**Statistical Insights about the dataset**","770b870f":"## **Data Preparation**\n\nHere, we are preparing data.

That is, it is a model that is used to predict the probabilities of the different possible outcomes of a categorically distributed dependent variable, given a set of independent variables (which may be real-valued, binary-valued, categorical-valued, etc.).
