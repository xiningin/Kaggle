It is just like cutting down the branches of a tree to its stems. For example, the stem of the words eating, eats, eaten is eat.\nSearch engines use stemming for indexing the words. That\u2019s why rather than storing all forms of a word, a search engine can store only the stems. In this way, stemming reduces the size of the index and increases retrieval accuracy.\n<\/p>","abbc2be7":"<center><img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/319\/1*Uucq42G4ntPGJKzI84b3aA.png\"><\/center>","bf1e350b":"<center><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1600\/1*z4f7My5peI28lNpZdHk_Iw.png\"><\/center>","f96c8e04":"<center><h1 style=\"font-size:300%; font-family:cursive; color:black; background:yellow; padding:11px; border-radius: 20px 20px;\">3.

Word2Vec <\/h1><\/center>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:150%; font-family:cursive;\">Word2vec is a technique for natural language processing published in 2013. The word2vec algorithm uses a neural network model to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence. As the name implies, word2vec represents each distinct word with a particular list of numbers called a vector. The vectors are chosen carefully such that a simple mathematical function (the cosine similarity between the vectors) indicates the level of semantic similarity between the words represented by those vectors.Word2Vec is an efficient and effective way of representing words as vectors. The whole body of the text is encapsulated in some space of much lower dimension. In this space, all vectors have certain orientation and it is possible to explicitly define their relationship with each other. The distributed representation of words as embedding vectors opens up many possibilities to find the words in ways that suits many applications in NLP.\n<\/p>","a218e79a":"<center><img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/700\/1*ytMHEQlqqOXY8UHv2fkxmA.jpeg\"><\/center>","c916f97a":"<center><h1 style=\"font-size:200%; font-family:cursive; color:black; background:red; padding:11px; border-radius: 20px 20px;\"> One Hot Representation <\/h1><\/center>\n","3f9cc0f7":" <center><h1 style=\"font-size:200%; font-family:cursive; color:black; background:red; padding:11px; border-radius: 20px 20px;\"> Word Embedding Representation <\/h1><\/center>\n\u200b","cbac69a6":"<center><h1 style=\"font-size:280%; font-family:cursive; background:yellow; color:black; border-radius:10px 10px; padding:10px;\">Roadmap to Natural Language Processing (NLP)<\/h1><\/center>","8a4de56c":"<center><h1 style=\"font-size:300%; font-family:cursive; color:black; background:yellow; padding:11px; border-radius: 20px 20px;\">5.
