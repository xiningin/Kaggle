But what alternatives do you have for models?\n\nYou can see in scikit-learn's [documentation](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) that the decision tree model has many options. The most important options determine the tree's depth.  A tree's depth is a measure of how many splits it makes before coming to a prediction.  \n\nIf a tree to has 10 splits, data will be split into \\\\(2^{10}\\\\) groups of houses, or 1024 leaves.  \n\n**Overfitting**:  When we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf.  Leaves with very few houses may make very unreliable predictions for new data.\n\n**Underfitting**:  If our tree very shallow, it doesn't divide up the houses into very distinct groups.  Resulting predictions may be far off for most houses, even in the training data (and it will be bad in validation too for the same reason). When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called **underfitting**.  \n\nWe want to find the model between underfitting and overfitting.  Visually, we want the low point of the (red) validation curve.\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AXSEOfI.png\" alt=\"underfitting_overfitting\" width=\"500\"\/>\n\n### Example\nLets use `max_leaf_nodes` argument to control overfitting vs underfitting.

Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.*\n\nWe now have a fitted model that we can use to make predictions.\n\nIn practice, you'll want to make predictions for new houses coming on the market rather than the houses we already have prices for. But we'll make predictions for the first few rows of the training data to see how the predict function works.\n","18c6b373":"---\n# Building Your Model\n\nYou will use the [**scikit-learn**](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/index.html) library to create your models.  When coding, this library is written as **sklearn**, as you will see in the sample code. Scikit-learn is easily the most popular library for modeling the types of data typically stored in DataFrames. \n\nThe steps to building and using a model are:\n* **Define:** What type of model will it be?  A decision tree?  Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.\n* **Fit:** Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.\n* **Predict:** Just what it sounds like\n* **Evaluate**: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.\n\nHere is an example of defining a decision tree model with scikit-learn and fitting it with the features and target variable.","7fbab096":"- Your mean absolute error for the in-sample data was about 500 dollars.  \n- Out-of-sample it is more than 250,000 dollars.\n\nThis is the difference between a model that is almost exactly right, and one that is unusable for most practical purposes.  As a point of reference, the average home value in the validation data is 1.1 million dollars.  So the error in new data is about a quarter of the average home value. \n\nLet's find ways to improve this model!","586d7a12":"--- \n# [Random Forests](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/ensemble.html#forest)\n\nDecision trees leave you with a difficult decision. A deep tree with lots of leaves will overfit because each prediction is coming from historical data from only the few houses at its leaf. But a shallow tree with few leaves will perform poorly because it fails to capture as many distinctions in the raw data.\n\nEven today's most sophisticated modeling techniques face this tension between underfitting and overfitting. But, many models have clever ideas that can lead to better performance. We'll look at the [**random forest**](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/ensemble.html#forest) as an example.\n\nThe random forest uses many trees, and it makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree. It generally has much better predictive accuracy than a single decision tree and it works well with default parameters. If you keep modeling, you can learn more models with even better performance, but many of those are sensitive to getting the right parameters. \n\nA random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.\n\n\nWe build a random forest model similarly to how we built a decision tree in scikit-learn - this time using the `RandomForestRegressor` class instead of `DecisionTreeRegressor`.","50aa2eac":"## Choosing \"Features\"\nThe columns that are inputted into our model (and later used to make predictions) are called **features**. In our case, those would be the columns used to determine the home price. Sometimes, you will use all columns except the target as features. Other times you'll be better off with fewer features. \n\nFor now, we'll build a model with only a few features. Later on you'll see how to iterate and compare models built with different features.\n\nBy convention, this data is called **X**.","76fd1f74":"# Intro to Machine Learning\nThis is condensed from [Intro to Machine Learning Kaggle course](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-machine-learning)\n- Build a model\n- Validate a model\n- Overfitting and underfitting\n- A more sophisticated model: Random forests","f6d2e01d":"# Conclusion \nThere is likely room for further improvement, but this is a big improvement over the best decision tree error of 250,000.

We used a single \"sample\" of houses for both building the model and evaluating it. This is bad.  If our model doesn't hold when it sees new data, the model would be very inaccurate when used in practice.\n\nSince models' practical value come from making predictions on new data, we measure performance on data that wasn't used to build the model. The most straightforward way to do this is to exclude some data from the model-building process, and then use those to test the model's accuracy on data it hasn't seen before. This data is called **validation data**.\n\n### Coding It\nThe scikit-learn library has a function `train_test_split` to break up the data into two pieces. We'll use some of that data as training data to fit the model, and we'll use the other data as validation data to calculate `mean_absolute_error`.\n\nHere is the code:","949fec19":"## Selecting Data for Modeling\nYour dataset had  too many variables to wrap your head around, or even to print out nicely.  How can you pare down this overwhelming amount of data to something you can understand?\n\nWe'll start by picking a few variables using our intuition.

This lets us try many candidate models and keep the best one. ","ae2826c9":"## Our Scenario\nYour cousin has made millions of dollars speculating on real estate. He's offered to become business partners with you because of your interest in data science. He'll supply the money, and you'll supply models that predict how much various houses are worth.\n\nYou ask your cousin how he's predicted real estate values in the past. and he says it is just intuition. But more questioning reveals that he's identified price patterns from houses he has seen in the past, and he uses those patterns to make predictions for new houses he is considering.\n\nMachine learning works the same way.  We'll start with a model called the [**Decision Tree**](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/tree.html#). There are fancier models that give more accurate predictions. But decision trees are easy to understand.\n\nFor simplicity, we'll start with the simplest possible decision tree. \n\n![First Decision Trees](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7tsb5b1.png)\n\nIt divides houses into only two categories. The predicted price for any house under consideration is the historical average price of houses in the same category.\n\nWe use data to decide how to break the houses into two groups,  and then again to determine the predicted price in each group.  This step of capturing patterns from data is called **fitting** or **training** the model. The data used to **fit** the model is called the **training data**.  \n\nWe will get to the details of how the model is fit (e.g. how to split up the data).  After the model has been fit, you can apply it to new data to **predict** prices of additional homes.\n\n---\n## Improving the Decision Tree\nYou can capture more factors affecting home price using a tree that has more \"splits.\" These are called \"deeper\" trees. A decision tree that also considers the total size of each house's lot might look like this: \n\n![Depth 2 Tree](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/R3ywQsR.png)\n\nYou predict the price of any house by tracing through the decision tree, always picking the path corresponding to that house's characteristics. The predicted price for the house is at the bottom of the tree.  The point at the bottom where we make a prediction is called a **leaf.**   \n\nThe splits and values at the leaves will be determined by the data, so it's time for you to check out the data you will be working with."}}
