Grisel and Charles Ollion for their courses at Master Data Science from Polytechnique\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to learn to use Neural Networks for text classification. The main goal is for you to understand how we can apply deep learning on raw text and what are the techniques behin it\n\nIn this notebook, we will:\n- Train a shallow model with learning embeddings\n\nHowever keep in mind:\n- Deep Learning can be better on text classification that simpler ML techniques, but only on very large datasets and well designed\/tuned models.\n- Many open source projects are really powerfull annd can be re-used: [word2vec](https:\/\/github.com\/dav\/word2vec) and [gensim's word2vec](https:\/\/radimrehurek.com\/gensim\/models\/word2vec.html)   (self-supervised learning only), [fastText](https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/fastText) (both supervised and self-supervised learning), [Vowpal Wabbit](https:\/\/github.com\/JohnLangford\/vowpal_wabbit\/wiki) (supervised learning).\n- Plain shallow sparse TF-IDF bigrams features without any embedding and Logistic Regression or Multinomial Naive Bayes is often competitive in small to medium datasets.","be68f8b8":"The model seems to overfit. Indeed the train error is really low whereas the test error is really higher. It seems that we have a variance porblem. Adding regularization like drop-out may help to stabilize the performance\n\nEdit : we have added drop-out. It is still not enough. We need to work on regularization technics to stabilize our performance.\n\nEdit2 : With less epochs, we manage to reduce the variance.","d104ac2f":"Vector space model is well known in information retrieval where each document is represented as a vector.

You may use different tokenizers (from scikit-learn, NLTK, custom Python function etc.). This converts the texts into sequences of indices representing the `20000` most frequent words\n- sequences have different lengths, so we pad them (add 0s at the end until the sequence is of length `1000`)\n- we convert the output classes as 1-hot encodings","df612fdb":"We can definitly see a trand in our representation between negative and postive sentences.","ae2377a9":"## A complex model : LSTM","af26c43b":"The tokenizer object stores a mapping (vocabulary) from word strings to token ids that can be inverted to reconstruct the original message (without formatting):","c25394fa":"to visualize our results we will use tsne","cea53be2":"We are going to use our precedent model for our embedding.
