They believed that the political leadership understands that keeping the coalition intact is fundamental for overcoming a wide array of governance, security and socioeconomic challenges. They emphasized that they will spare no effort, through their good offices, to remind interlocutors that progress depends on the readiness of all actions to put aside partisanship to avoid a political crisis that could have major consequences on the country\u2019s stability. https:\/\/reliefweb.int\/report\/democratic-republic-congo\/covid-19-exacerbating-tensions-democratic-republic-congo-s","c365e25a":" While COVID-19 restrictions and increased violence in the east have hampered efforts to hold a structured dialogue with the Government as requested by the Council, the Mission is pursuing its internal planning and hopes to build on its constructive relationship with Kinshasa (Congo's Capital) to develop a joint strategy \u201cas soon as the context becomes more conducive\u201d. In that sense, they asked the Council to continue to support for the Mission and the full range of United Nations activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including help to curb the spread of the coronavirus and to respond to the many humanitarian emergencies still facing the population.\n \nOn the humanitarian situation, they called for sustained international support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and Ebola, as well as flexible financial arrangements to bolster development efforts in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nhttps:\/\/reliefweb.int\/report\/democratic-republic-congo\/covid-19-exacerbating-tensions-democratic-republic-congo-s","341ff1a6":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke ","5e74c53a":"Meanwhile, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be torn by violence caused by armed groups and intercommunity conflict as political turmoil and the pandemic impact the Government\u2019s ability to respond, she said. In parts of Ituri Province, which borders on South Sudan and Uganda, attacks by assailants associated with the Walendu community have led Hema and Alur youth to form self\u2011defence groups, sparking fears of a further ethnicization of tensions. \n\nReports of incursions by elements of the South Sudan People\u2019s Defence Forces are also raising concerns. In North Kivu, presumed members of the Allied Democratic Forces ambushed a MONUSCO (United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) convoy on 22 June, leaving an Indonesian peacekeeper dead and another wounded. In the hauts plateaux of South Kivu, intercommunity conflicts have degenerated, they condemned the attacks on displaced populations and the use of hate speech. Meanwhile, in Tanganyika Province, more than 100 civilians have been killed in clashes between Twa and Bantu in recent months.https:\/\/reliefweb.int\/report\/democratic-republic-congo\/covid-19-exacerbating-tensions-democratic-republic-congo-s"}}
