Individual Company customer Data\n# **THE FIREST PROJECT ON THE BOOTCAMP SDIAA T5 **","4a3535b1":"# Abstract\nCustomer data analysis is a detailed analysis of a company's ideal customers. It helps businesses better understand their customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and interests of different types of customers.\nCustomer data analysis helps the company to identify the types of target groups in terms of age, gender, residence, country,... etc. and to adjust its products based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to each customer in the company's database, the company can analyze which customer segment is likely to buy the product and then market the product to only that specific segment\n# Design\nThis project is one of the T5 Data Science BootCamp requirements. Data provided by Kaggle has been used in this project. Create powerful marketing campaigns that are more personalized and timely. Helping the sales team. From the results of these analyzes, the team can make better products by knowing which features customers prefer and what they do not like and target groups prefer\n\n**\n# Data\n\u25cf\tThey are the customer of an individual company and information about the customer in terms of family income has been collected to find out more ways to attract the customer and what ages, marital status and educational qualifications are affected by sales and through which statistics are made and predicted the most buying and most researched customers ,\n\u25cf\tThe dataset is provided in .csv ,and dataset includes about 40,000 rows and 15 columns Each row corresponds to a customer infomation, and includes the variables:\n\n# Algorithms\n\u2022\tWhen working on analyzing data, you\u2019ll likely come across data that is missing (also called null values or NaNs) .Data cleaning by used drop null value of column you have null  [ education, marriage , house_owner ] \nis an important part of the data analysis pipeline and making sure that it\u2019s all tidy up will make your analysis much stronger.\n\n\u2022\trename column names is one of the most often applied data manipulations, rename name [val_house ]to [value_house]\n \n\u2022\tDataFrame will contain columns that are not useful to your analysis. Such columns should be dropped from the DataFrame to make it easier for you to focus on the remaining columns, Drop columns [car_prob , customer_psy , mortgage ]\n\n# Tools\n\u2022\tNumpy and Pandas for data manipulation\n\n\u2022\tMatplotlib and Seaborn for plotting\n\n\u2022\tclean data\n\n\u2022\tStreamlit for interactive visualizations\n","220daeae":"# 3.Cleaning Dataset\u00b6","51f3be6e":"# Q8\\ What the least occupation ?'","5f7e88d0":"# 4.Analysis and Visualization\u00b6","6aaae43e":"# 2-Loed Dataset","d40397a2":"# Q4\\ What is the most common age is marrige on the customer?"}}
