Modern large pike species are native to the Palearctic and Nearctic realms, ranging across Northern America and from Western Europe to Siberia in North Asia.\n\nPikes have the elongated, torpedo-like shape typical of predatory fishes, with sharply pointed heads and sharp teeth. Their coloration is typically grey-green with a mottled or spotted appearance with stripes along their backs, providing camouflage among underwater weeds, and each individual pike marking patterns are unique like fingerprints. Pikes can grow to a maximum recorded length of 1.83 m (6 ft), reaching a maximum recorded weight of 35 kg (77 lb).","cc522850":"## Pike Graph\n\n- Histogram\n- Boxplot\n- 2D Denstiy\n- Map Locations","bc083bfb":"Cost function for ridge regression\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*hAGhQehrqAmT1pvz3q4t8Q.png)","62fad513":"# Roach","42f10199":"The bream is usually 30 to 55 cm (12 to 22 in) long, though some specimens of 75 cm (30 in) have been recorded; it usually weighs 2 to 4 kg (4.4 to 8.8 lb).

It is a silvery grey colour, though older fish can be bronze-coloured, especially in clear waters. The fins are greyish to black, but never reddish.\n\nThe common bream generally lives in rivers (especially in the lower reaches) and in nutrient-rich lakes and ponds with muddy bottoms and plenty of algae.

Its body has a bluish-silvery colour and becomes white at the belly. The fins are red. The number of scales along the lateral line is 39\u201348. The dorsal and anal fins have 12\u201314 rays. Young specimens have a slender build; older specimens acquire a higher and broader body shape. The roach can often be recognized by the big red spot in the iris above and beside the pupil. Colours of the eye and fins can be very pale, however, in some environments.\n\nIn Central and Northern Europe, the common roach can most easily be confused with the common rudd (Scardinius erythropthalmus), the dace (Leuciscus leuciscus), or the ide (Leuciscus idus). They can be distinguished by these characteristics:\n\nThe common rudd has a more yellow\/greenish or golden colour. The backfin is placed more backwards and between the tip of the ventral scales and the first ray of the anal fin are only one or two scales. The roach has four or five scales there. The mouth of the rudd is more upturned and the head appears sharper.\nThe dace has a greenish body, colorless eyes and fins, and a distinct 'nose'.\nThe ide has a higher number of scales along its lateral line (55\u201361), a rounder body, and a bigger mouth and head.","42d35c01":"# Whitefish","a97b98df":"# Lasso Regression","ccef01d9":"I wonder your thoughts about the notebook","96322f3e":"# Pike","cd396dd9":"![](http:\/\/tackletactics.com.au\/assets\/full_6800_982011602635767581048761294958078835294208n.jpg)","83afd05b":"Lake whitefish are similar in appearance to other whitefishes in the Coregoninae subfamily of the salmon family Salmonidae, such as the northern cisco (Coregonus artedi). As with all salmonids, they have an adipose fin.To the distinction from cisco, the lake whitefish has a snout which overhangs the short lower jaw, so that the mouth opens in a slightly inferior position. Thus the fish can feed on the bottom of lake beds or grab food particulates out of the water or from the surface of a water body. The cisco in turn has a short snout with a lower jaw that extends beyond the snout. Both the cisco and lake whitefish are discernible from the mooneye due to the small posterior dorsal adipose fin. Another notable feature of the lake whitefish is the presence of two small flaps in each nostril. Their coloration is typically silver to white with an olive to pale-green or brown dorsal hues. The ventral fins are white and the tail has a dark posterior edge. The tail fin of the lake whitefish is severely forked, making it a fast swimmer.\n\nLake whitefish from inland lakes can reach a weight upwards of 5 pounds (2,300 g) (the largest Lake Whitefish caught on rod and reel is 15pounds 6 oz from Clear Lake Ontario Canada on May 21, 1983 by Chris T. D. Webster according to the Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame in Hayward Wis USA]]). On average, the lake whitefish weighs only 4 pounds. They can grow to 31 inches (79 cm) and commonly reach 20 inches (51 cm).","a993114b":"## Reference\n\n* https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/how-to-create-dummy-variables-in-python-with-pandas\/#:~:text=A%20dummy%20variable%20is%20a,python%20using%20get_dummies()%20method.\n\n* https:\/\/www.kdnuggets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/train_test_split-2.jpg\n\n* https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Linear_regression\n\n* https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/ridge-and-lasso-regression-a-complete-guide-with-python-scikit-learn-e20e34bcbf0b\n\n* https:\/\/www.roughfish.com\/content\/lake-whitefish-0\n  \n* https:\/\/dynamitebaits.com\/match-coarse\/roach-fishing-how-to-break-your-pb-redfin\/\n    \n* http:\/\/tackletactics.com.au\/Species\/Saltwater\/Bream\/5-Tips-for-Targeting-Southern-Black-Bream\n\n* https:\/\/www.clarionledger.com\/story\/sports\/2017\/06\/01\/big-bream-abound-these-5-lakes\/362330001\/","422f89f9":"Cost function for Lasso regression\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*P5Lq5mAi4WAch7oIeiS3WA.png)","b30c8a64":"Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity.

The perch, of which three species occur in different geographical areas, lend their name to a large order of vertebrates: the Perciformes, from the Greek: \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03b7 (perke), simply meaning perch, and the Latin forma meaning shape. Many species of freshwater gamefish more or less resemble perch, but belong to different genera. In fact, the exclusively saltwater-dwelling red drum is often referred to as a red perch, though by definition perch are freshwater fish. Though many fish are referred to as perch as a common name, to be considered a true perch, the fish must be of the family Percidae.\n\n**Speicies**\n\n**The European perch** (P. fluviatilis) is found in Europe and Asia. This species is typically greenish in color with dark vertical bars on its sides with a red or orange coloring in the tips of its fins. The European perch has been successfully introduced in New Zealand and Australia, where it is known as the redfin perch or English perch. In Australia, larger specimens have been bred, but the species rarely grows heavier than 2.7 kg (6 lb).\n\n**The Balkhash perch** (P. schrenkii) is found in Kazakhstan, (in Lake Balkhash and Lake Alakol), Uzbekistan, and China. It is very similar to the European perch, and grows to a comparable size.\n\n**The yellow perch** (P. flavescens), smaller and paler than the European perch, is found in North America. In northern areas, it is sometimes referred to as the lake perch. This species is prized for its food quality and has often been raised in hatcheries and introduced into areas in which it is not native. Yellow perch are almost identical in appearance to European perch, but have a more yellow coloring. These fish typically only reach a size of about 38 cm (15 in) and 1 kg (2 lb 3 oz)","01c47cc5":" The only difference is instead of taking the square of the coefficients, magnitudes are taken into account. This type of regularization (L1) can lead to zero coefficients i.e. some of the features are completely neglected for the evaluation of output. So Lasso regression not only helps in reducing over-fitting but it can help us in feature selection.","5fdb5959":"# Train - Test Split","d932611c":"lasso predicts negative values like ridge model","b9b20357":"# Perch \n","a35d4270":"**Note: linear regression assumptions should be tested.

The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.","564992b4":"**Our target variable is Weight**","336e1a84":"## Dummies ","025b1a7e":"# Model","8a05bf44":"Smelts are a family of small fish, the Osmeridae, found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, as well as rivers, streams and lakes in Europe, North America and Northeast Asia. They are also known as freshwater smelts or typical smelts to distinguish them from the related Argentinidae (herring smelts or argentines), Bathylagidae (deep-sea smelts), and Retropinnidae (Australian and New Zealand smelts).\n\nSome smelt species are common in the North American Great Lakes, and in the lakes and seas of the northern part of Europe, where they run in large schools along the saltwater coastline during spring migration to their spawning streams. In some western parts of the United States, smelt populations have greatly declined in recent decades, leading to their protection under the Endangered Species Act. The Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) found in the Sacramento Delta of California, and the eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) found in the Northeast Pacific and adjacent rivers, are both protected from harvest.\n\nSome species of smelts are among the few fish that sportsmen have been allowed to net, using hand-held dip nets, either along the coastline or in streams. Some sportsmen also ice fish for smelt. They are often fried and eaten whole."}}
