Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n- headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n- heals - Number of healing items used.\n- Id - Player\u2019s Id\n- killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n- killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a \u201cNone\u201d.\n- killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n- kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n- longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n- matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n- matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n- matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are \u201csolo\u201d, \u201cduo\u201d, \u201csquad\u201d, \u201csolo-fpp\u201d, \u201cduo-fpp\u201d, and \u201csquad-fpp\u201d; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n- rankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API\u2019s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of \u201cNone\u201d.\n- revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n- rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n- roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n- swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n- teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n- vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n- walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n- weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n- winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a \u201cNone\u201d.\n- groupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n- numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n- maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n- winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.\n","14c9b79b":"## Number of death race","c6db572d":"### Check null value","d3109db8":"## The distance for a professional killer","4f030e34":"# Read data","d3851ddf":"# Casestudy question\n- [Number knock by headshot more 10 headshot?](#Number-knock-by-headshot-more-10-headshot-?)\n- [The survivor death in 6 minute](#The-survivor-death-in-6-minute)\n- [The Fast killer](#The-Fast-killer)\n- [Number of death race](#Number-of-death-race)\n- [If you more walkDistance you get more kill?](#If-you-more-walkDistance-you-get-more-kill-?)\n- [The distance for a professional killer](#The-distance-for-a-professional-killer)","d9426866":"## The survivor death in 6 minute","fd60fddf":"# Conclusion : The goal of exploratory data analysis is to get you thinking about your data and reasoning about your question.","fc0956e5":"Some player have a problem find weapon or stay relax  within 6 minute they are killed.","d154c47a":"# First import data and libraly must use ","078a594e":"### How many id in test data?","382bb4cd":"The picture on top from book [The art of Data Science](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Art-Data-Science-Roger-Peng\/dp\/1365061469).I recommend you should read in 2020  because the process in book which is fundamental to data science , data engineer , data analyst or related filed. \n# 5 core activities of data analysis \n1.
