These people might be the regular customers of the mall and are convinced by the mall\u2019s facilities.\n\nIn cluster 3(orange colored) we see that people have high income but low spending scores, this is interesting.

The Elbow Method is one of the most popular methods to determine this optimal value of k.\n1. Distortion: It is calculated as the average of the squared distances from the cluster centers of the respective clusters. Typically, the Euclidean distance metric is used.\n2. Inertia: It is the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center.\n\nWe iterate the values of k from 1 to 9 and calculate the values of distortions for each value of k and calculate the distortion and inertia for each value of k in the given range.","ff89a6f7":"#### Segmentation using Age , Annual Income and Spending Score","ea68b9a5":"In the above bar graph the distribution of each Age Group in the shopping complex is clearly depicted.\n\nBy looking at the graph above, it is clear that the age group of 27 to 39 are very frequent but there is no clear pattern. It can be deduced that older age groups are lesser frequent in comparison to the younger ages. Interestingly, there are equal number of visitors in the complex for the age 18 and 60. People aged about 55, 56, 69, 64 are very less frequent in the shopping complex. People aged about 32 are the most frequent visitors in the shopping complex.","e59108d6":"## Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL)"}}
