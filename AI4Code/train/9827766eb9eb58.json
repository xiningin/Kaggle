We are implementing various measures.\n\nAt a press conference after the National Cabinet Meeting on Friday,**** May 8****, Prime Minister Morrison set three restrictions on the past measures toward the goal of achieving a safe economy against the new coronavirus in July. We announced the \"Roadmap for Australia Safe against New Coronaviruses\" that will be alleviated in Japan.\nWith regard to this restriction relaxation measure, the governments of each state and territory will decide concrete measures in consideration of the situation in each region. \n\nI think that the government of Australia took the situation seriously,and succeeded in controlling the situation.\n\nreference:\nhttps:\/\/www.jtb.com.au\/special\/article.php?id=108"}}
