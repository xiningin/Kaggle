This is just for illustration purposes and we don't need to be accurate (may contain mistakes encountered during the data collection and preprocessing stages) but they give us a ballpark figure and some starting point to work from.\n\nWe will see this from the perspective of each country's development status. You will see from the visuals what is meant by that. One thing about _Development Status_, it's clear mostly who the **Developed** and **Less\/Under Developed** countries are more or less, although there is no such thing as a clear distinction between **Developed** and **Developing** countries. Different organisations can label some of the newly graduated **Developed** countries as **Developing** while others consider them as **Developed**. To avoid these confusions and ambiguity, in all such cases such countries have been assigned the _Development Status_ of **Developed\/Developing**. There is still a chance to find a few countries with a slightly different _Development Status_ when going through other corpora of information about countries of the world.

While another handful have only completed surveys once or twice but not all the four years. Therefore those countries do not show a growth in their participation. Another pocketful of countries show a single digit growth even though they have been regularly completing the surveys. This sudden drop could be attributed to situations in those countries impacting the Data Science \/ Machine Learning communities there (it's something to look closer into) -- and it could be outside their control as personal or learning (educational) priorities change if economic or political challenges approach a region. Two other countries i.e. **Taiwan** and **Singapore** are showing a negative growth and this stands out in the table. Despite these ups and downs the region is managing well, as these losses are offset by other strong participation from **India**, **China**, **Japan**, **Saudi Arabia**, **Turkey** and a handful of others. A small exception to note aout **Saudi Arabia** as it's participation is only since a couple of years - a new member as compared to many others in this region of the world. Another country to note is **China**, it started off with a big bang of **~200%** growth but last few years it's been on a decline, but it's initial start has helped maintain the average growth rate - I do agree this isn't the real picture though but statistical measures like average can hide trend many a times.\n    \n<i><p style=\"font-size:18px; background-color: #FFF1D7; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">**EDIT:** As mentioned in the [Revisions](#revisions) section, due to changes in the dataset, the following countries have moved up or down the list as compared to the previous versions of this report: **Saudi Arabia**, **China**, **India**, and **Turkey**.

There is a lot of participation from **Asia**, **Europe**, the **Americas** but looking at the number of non-particiapting countries (participation in Kaggle and Kaggle Surveys), makes me think that there may need to be some sort of outreach to those countries as well. Although the graph for **North America** looks skewed it's because of the smaller island nations that fall under the **North America** umbrella, and they could be a good adage to the future community. Otherwise the three big nations i.e. **Canada**, **USA** and **Mexico** have been participants since the beginning, although declining in participation. Same goes for **Oceania**, with an extra 30-odd countries under it, they are independent island countries around the continent of **Australiasia**. Also there are massive opportunities in **Africa**, given only **12.1%** of the continent is involved while a staggering **87.9%** of the continent is either unaware or not directly connecting with the Kaggle Data Science \/ Machine Learning communities, or may be even unable to connect (may not be a priority or do not have the necessary resources and support). **Note:** they are NOT present on Kaggle (or may not be participating) and hence NOT present in the Survey data since the beginning.","f4b75abb":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents<\/span><\/a>","550771d3":"### <div class=\"subsection_title\">Prequels\/sequels\n\n- [Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science (data-prep)](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/neomatrix369\/kaggle-machine-learning-data-science-data-prep\/) | [Extended Dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/neomatrix369\/kaggle-machine-learning-data-science-survey-ext) | [Additional Dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/neomatrix369\/world-bank-data-1960-to-2016-extended)\n- **Kaggle Global Outreach (analysis)**","ae358cbe":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents<\/span><\/a>","8ec1a081":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents<\/span><\/a>","e1dc9181":"<a id='summary'><\/a>\n\n----------\n> ## <div class=\"subsection_title\">Summary\n>\n> - We sifted through many survey responses datasets, preprocessed them and merged them to create a combined dataset and further combined it with other datasets to enrich the existing information gathered by the survey activities.\n> - Several countries across the six continents of **Asia**, **Africa**, **Europe**, **the Americas** and **Oceania (Australia and New Zealand)** participated in providing feedback since **2017** through to **2020**.\n> - Looking at the metrics from the Survey responses shows how vibrant the community is and how they have spent time and have been engaged for a long time learning and contributing back.

Also to highlight that the title of the notebook, is trying to convey a few hints (or messages):\n    \n- the outreach of Kaggle as a community and what the maintainers ARE doing to reach out, and support\n- the outreach of Kaggle as a community and what the maintainers COULD be doing to sustain and support the existing Data Science \/ Machine Learning community\n- also what could be done to include those in the wing who are not participating but can be reached out\n\nAs in my view, survey processes and the responses received from them act as a pulse about the community at different points in time - they are a great way to do community-health checks. Because the quality of the data gathered from such an action will depend on this factor and will also be reflected throughout the process and in the data collected. In our case, the metrics are going to be super helpful to throw light on such and other insights.\n\nThe views and opinions I'm making are solely based on a constrained framework and the condition that the data we have collected may be reflecting only a portion of the Data Science and Machine Learning world out there (the little we know from what we receive as responses). And it is down to us to further prove or disprove these arguments and conjectures. So the analysis and conclusions may have limitations outside the context of this framework or condition. I'm also indirectly eluding to presence of bias in the results\/outcome\/interpretations from the data, which we will see through the following sections of the report (the different angles and lenses drawn out in the rest of the notebook).\n\nI agree that this approach is a *bit meta* as we are using the survey metrics (not just the data gathered by the survey) to make analysis, assessments and conclusions about the survey itself and how this can be changed or improved at the same time assessing the current community and the future participants of the community.","c37c5c65":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents<\/span><\/a>","d54d2224":"<i><p style=\"font-size:21px; background-color: #FFF1D7; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">These lenses help paint a better picture of the state of things with regards to the data collected via the **Kaggle Data Science \/ Machine Learning Survey** each year.

Also the proportion of Kaggle members responding to the survey compared to the total number of registered Kaggle members is a significantly low figure (a very big difference). For each year these numbers are **0.2803%**, **0.3997%**, **0.3302%** and **0.3343%** for the years **2017**, **2018**, **2019**, and **2020** respectively. There could be many reasons for this and it would be good to investigate this as it's a recurring event. Another question that comes up immediately with regards to the above, since the ratios are such small, can we say that the sample is representative of the Data Science\/Machine Learning community at large or even on Kaggle, this remains to be seen. And maybe for myself or others to provide some more reasoning or reports on this. Besides, it would be good to compare these numbers against that of active Kaggle members (for each year) and then try to conclude from them.","f9994b1a":"<a id='growing_in_participation'><\/a>\n\n----------\n\n#### <div class=\"subsubsubsection_title\">*a.
