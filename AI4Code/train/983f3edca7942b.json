In addition, even under these circumstances, the Brazilian government has failed to take effective containment measures for fear of negative effects on the economy. To see the number of people in recovery, it exploded on June 8, and this result suggests that the \"recovery\" definition may have changed that Brazilian government had been using. And, in fact, the president has made it clear on Twitter that he has changed his statistical methods. All in all, it's clear that the number of cases in Brazil is only going to increase future.","0c4c2d59":"# Number of infected people in Brazil and more ...\n20M51790\nMizuochi Takumi\nmizuochi.t.aa@m.titech.ac.jp","240d9cdc":"# How the Brazilian government is addressing the issue\nThe Brazilian government has not taken any lockdowns or other measures throughout the country and has asked state governors to determine the details of the restrictions.
