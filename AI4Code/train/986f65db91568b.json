A pair of $\\mathbf{(x_i,y_i)}$ is called training example. The subscripe $\\mathbf{i}$ in the notation is simply index into the training set. We have $\\mathbf{m}$ training example then $\\mathbf{i = 1,2,3,...m}$.\n\nThe goal of supervised learning is to learn a *hypothesis function $\\mathbf{h}$*, for a given training set that can used to estimate $\\mathbf{y}$ based on $\\mathbf{x}$. So hypothesis fuction represented as \n\n$$\\mathbf{ h_\\theta(x_{i}) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_i }$$   \n$\\mathbf{\\theta_0,\\theta_1}$ are parameter of hypothesis.This is equation for **Simple \/ Univariate Linear regression**. \n\nFor **Multiple Linear regression** more than one independent variable exit then we will use $\\mathbf{x_{ij}}$ to denote indepedent variable and $\\mathbf{y_{i}}$ to denote dependent variable. We have $\\mathbf{n}$ independent variable then $\\mathbf{j=1,2,3 ..... n}$. The hypothesis function represented as\n\n$$\\mathbf{h_\\theta(x_{i}) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_{i1} + \\theta_2 x_{i2} + ..... \\theta_j x_{ij} ...... \\theta_n  x_{mn} }$$\n$\\mathbf{\\theta_0,\\theta_1,....\\theta_j....\\theta_n }$ are parameter of hypothesis,\n$\\mathbf{m}$ Number of training exaples,\n$\\mathbf{n}$ Number of independent variable,\n$\\mathbf{x_{ij}}$ is $\\mathbf{i^{th}}$ training exaple of $\\mathbf{j^{th}}$ feature.\n","cef76511":"There is no missing value in the data sex"}}
