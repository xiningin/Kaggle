But, when label encoding is performed, the State names are ranked based on the alphabets. Due to this, there is a very high probability that the model captures the relationship between countries such as New York < California < Florida.\n\nThis is something that we do not want! So how can we overcome this obstacle? Here comes the concept of One-Hot Encoding.\n\nOne-Hot Encoding is another popular technique for treating categorical variables. It simply creates additional features based on the number of unique values in the categorical feature. Every unique value in the category will be added as a feature.\n\nOne-Hot Encoding is the process of creating dummy variables.","479c7e3b":"Here in the above we have convert each category into a seperate column.\n\nNow we will convert our data into training and testing data to perform linear regression","536a3638":"we can observe that we have a categorical variable here, first we will convert the categorical varaible into a numerical variable using Labelencoder.","ed57528d":"Now we will perform linear regression"}}
