Platform users can either take the role of guests or hosts.

Furthering that, finding any way to associate the experience to things that hosts can change would be advantageous to answering our main business goal.\n\nA large part of this would be to find a good way to measure customer experience or customer satisfaction. Since AirBnb is a platform where hosts can post listings which guests then visit, I would like to take the \"customer\" as the guest, and their experience would be related to how well they rated the experience using the provided rating mechanisms in the website or app. Any customer experience metric derived should take this rating mechanism into account.\n\nWe are assuming that we only have access to the listings CSV file and the data contained within it, which is supposed to tell us about each of the AirBnb listings in Seattle. Using this dataset, we should understand what data is available to us, and how to transform it into a dataset that can be used to link customer experience to the various listing attributes. A large part of this will involve applying transformations to the data, and dealing with missing data.\n\nThe aim is to see what AirBnb hosts can do to most likely improve the guest experience on the AirBnb platform. We can extend our understanding of how customer experience is linked to listing attributes, to understand what AirBnb hosts can easily do to improve the guests' experience.\n\nTo summarise, **translating our business goals into data mining goals**, we have:\n1. Can we find an appropriate metric for understanding the quality of guests' experience?\n2. How can we link listing attributes with the customer experiences?\n3. What aspects of the listings can hosts easily alter to substantially boost the guest's experience?","f3c62aaf":"#### Geolocation\n\n* street\n* neighbourhood\n* neighbourhood_cleansed\n* neighbourhood_group_cleansed\n* city\n* state\n* zipcode\n* market\n* smart_location\n* country_code\n* country\n* latitude\n* longitude\n* is_location_exact\n* jurisdiction_names","2dad0e46":"It is not made clear but these columns appear to reference how many days that the given listing has vacant that can be booked, at the time that the data was scraped from AirBnb.

Using reviews_per_month on the other hand would be applicable to all hosts. Also, a high number of reviews per month could contribute to the \"magnitude\" of the customer experience.","5f2d5bad":"The ID and system columns are not required for analysis, but we will ensure that the data has index set to the internal 'id' field, so that we can keep track of which records are being used.","e91ae950":"Treating the money columns as floats, we can get descriptive information on the distributions of the numeric columns.\n\nWe can see that the average price is 127, the median guests_included is 1 and 75% of listings have just 1 or 2 minimum nights.\n\nMaximum nights has some extremely high values.","8ef15ccc":"This result is not the strongest result, but it is at least an improvement on OLS.","8a7e7d6c":"The license column is completely empty.

Both are important for understanding the experience.\n\nHowever, since we are opting for just one response variable in this data science problem, we must try to find a way to \"blend\" these metrics together to reward essentially \"a large number of good user experiences\". This is attempted below by simply multiplying the two metrics together (after having converted the review score to a decimal from 0-1).","ff2ea843":"The street column is a text based string indicating the street that the listing is on.

These columns should come in useful later when we look at our first business question \"Can we find an appropriate metric for understanding the quality of guests' experience?\"\n\nWe have a wide variety of columns related to **attributes of the property listed**, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, beds, amenities, property_type and room_type. From a business perspective, these have varying degrees of control from the host. For example, number of beds could conceivably be changed by the host if there is enough room, but property_type will most likely be out of the host's control. Regardless, these property-centric data points could be useful for answering business question 2, and some of them for business question 3.\n\nThere seem to be some columns related to the **geolocation** of the listing, such as neighbourhood, neighbourhood_cleansed, neighbourhood_group_cleansed, zipcode, latitude and longitude. We obviously don't require using any geolocation datapoints on the city level resolution or above, such as country , since we are just looking at data in Seattle. It's widely known that there are certain areas in cities that are more popular than others. It's possible that certain neighbourhoods would be attractive to a specific subset of the AirBnb guests. We could therefore use this geolocation information to frame our business questions more precisely.\n\nThere are also columns seeming to relate to the **policies** set by the host, such as price, weekly_price, security_deposit, minimum_nights and maximum_nights. These are properties from a business perspective would be directly controlled and easily set by the user, and we should try to include as many of these features as possible in our analysis. These properties should be helpful for business questions 2 and 3.\n\nThere seem to be some **descriptive** fields regarding the ad and its relation to the listed property. These could be: name, summary, space and description, for example. It is difficult to say at this stage how useful these columns would be.\n\nThere are also some columns referencing **attributes of the host**, such as host_name, host_about, host_location, host_response_time. Some of these attributes can be controlled by the host, such as host_response_time and host_location, however others such as host_name are not so easily changed. Some of these features could be useful for answering business questions 2 and 3.\n\nThere are some columns related to the listing **availablilty**, such as has_availability and availability_30. I'm not sure how useful these columns would be in relation to our business questions regarding guest customer experience and what the host can do about it.\n\nThere are several **ID and system** fields such as id, listing_url, scrape_id, last_scraped and xl_picture_url. Since we are just focussing on this listings CSV and not pulling in other data sources, it's probable that we will only need an ID for each record, and not need the other ID fields.

However, if we end up selecting a binary or discrete response variable, this could turn into a classification problem. Since reviews are given generally on a line from 0-100, it's most likely that the second data mining question will be resolved using regression.\n\nFurther challenges with the second problem will be selecting appropriate features, transforming variables and engineering and\/or replacing features. Empty, invalid and outlier values will need to be considered. This process is likely to take some time.\n\nThe third data mining question will become a **feature importance** problem. If the second question is solved using a regression problem, then most likely this will utilize the coefficients of the model in order to ascertain which features contribute the most to the response variable, i.e. the customer experience.

To reiterate, our business goal from this exercise was to find ways that hosts can improve the guests' experiences.\n\nWe have broken this into the 3 data mining questions that have guided us to this:\n\n#### 1. Can we find an appropriate metric for understanding the quality of guests' experience?\n\nWe did exploratory analysis to discover the array of review-based metrics and understand which of them could be contenders for a CX score. We found that CX score can be well posed as a \"velocity of good reviews\", calculated using the reviews_per_month and review_scores_rating columns. We understood that better results would be achieved at this stage by narrowing the scope to just the University District neighbourhood.\n\nWe found a reasonable metric for understanding customer experience.\n\nGoing forward, AirBnb Seattle could expand on this insight to create a more robust CX score metric that can be adapted throughout all Seattle neighbourhoods. Once this is acheieved and it can be used for more accurate predictions, it could be compared with the AirBnb Boston dataset for further improvements and generalisations.\n\n\n#### 2. How can we link listing attributes with the customer experiences?\n\nWe underwent a lot of data understanding and preparation of the features. By grouping the features into business-informed feature groups, we were able to analyze and interpret the source data more easily and follow a robust process of feature engineering. We were able to then use this cleaned dataset and the new CX Score variable to predict CX score.\n\nWe ultimately found that we could to a moderate degree link listing attributes with the customer experience.\n\nWhile the performance of the final model was not strong, it was a promising start, and I would like to do further feature engineering and modelling to optimise and improve on the model.\n\n#### 3. What aspects of the listings can hosts easily alter to substantially boost the guest's experience?\n\nUtilising the model that we had just developed, it was quite simple to find the most important features contributing to the CX score by taking coefficients of the linear model.\n\nWe could recommend a strategy for hosts in the University District by incentivising them to:\n\n* Become verified on Facebook\n* Enable the 'instant bookable' feature\n* Provide breakfast\n* Respond faster to guests\n\nGoing forward we could put this plan into action and measure whether the recommendations had any effect on the overall CX score.\n","edf2d196":"We found earlier that price does not have any null values, however weekly_price, monthly_price, security_deposit and cleaning_fee do, so let's be mindful of that when creating features from them. ","27ef8c2c":"The vast majority of beds are of the \"Real Bed\" type, with a small number of other less luxurious types on offer.","f0d89f1a":"We will lookup the host's neighbourhood in the neighbourhood columns to ascertain whether they live in the listing property's neighbourhood.","6c7c35c6":"# Predicting AirBnb Review Scores\n\nThis notebook will be using the listings.csv dataset from the AirBnb Seattle dataset on Kaggle.","5fb0bd6f":"#### Review-based datapoints\n\n* number_of_reviews\n* first_review\n* last_review\n* review_scores_rating\n* review_scores_accuracy\n* review_scores_cleanliness\n* review_scores_checkin\n* review_scores_communication\n* review_scores_location\n* review_scores_value\n* reviews_per_month","6b27a36d":"We have 3 groups of property type with more than 100 values: House, Apartment and Townhouse.

Some kind of web scraping script was likely used to generate this data.\n\nThe last_scraped column would appear to represent the date when the listing was scraped, and the calendar_last_scraped column appears to be the date the calendar was scraped.","4adefb34":"#### Criteria for model assessment\n\nWe will be evaluating our results\/model against tests in order to be satisfied with its validity.\n\nFor the first data mining problem, we will visualise the distributions of the response variable candidates in order to ascertain which of them have reasonable distributions that could conceivably produce stable output when using as a response variable for modelling.\n\nWe will also need to ensure that the metric chosen will satisfy the business requirements for being an adequate representation of customer experience, and that it is not just chosen solely to produce good results from the model.\n\nFinally, we may want to narrow the scope of the project. We are only looking to improve guests' customer experience, and this could be limited to certain subsets of the user base. It is worth bearing in mind that this is just one project within an entire team's ongoing roadmap. As long as the user base chosen is large enough for potential insights to be significant, then this will contribute towards satisfying our business goals.\n\nFor the second data mining problem, we will use cross validation to evaluate candidates for modelling the data. We will evaluate using the R2 score and the RMSE if using regression. We could also plot residuals of the model to evaluate skew.\n\nThe third data mining problem will follow from the solution of the second data mining problem. We can apply a properly evaluated model on the data in order to assess the feature importance.
