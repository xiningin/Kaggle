If you plan to not use Jupyter Notebooks or any other programming language, please see our [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021). The following are some important links!\n\n- Competition Page: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/\n\n- Online Visualizer: https:\/\/2021vis.lux-ai.org\/\n\n- Specifications: https:\/\/www.lux-ai.org\/specs-2021\n\n- Github: https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\n\n- Bot API: https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\/tree\/master\/kits\n\nAnd if you haven't done so already, we **highly recommend** you join our Discord server at https:\/\/discord.gg\/aWJt3UAcgn or at the minimum follow the kaggle forums at https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/discussion. We post important announcements there such as changes to rules, events, and opportunities from our sponsors!\n\nNow let's get started!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nWe assume that you have a basic knowledge of Python and programming. It's okay if you don't know the game specifications yet! Feel free to always refer back to https:\/\/www.lux-ai.org\/specs-2021.\n\n## Basic Setup\n\nFirst thing to verify is that you have **Node.js v12 or above**. The engine for the competition runs on Node.js (for many good reasons including an awesome visualizer) and thus it is required. You can download it [here](https:\/\/nodejs.org\/en\/download\/). You can then verify you have the appropriate version by running\n","a95de3f5":"We have something that survives! We are now ready to submit something to the leaderboard. The code below compiles all we have built so far into one file that you can then submit to the competition leaderboard","d1a0539b":"Ok now that we have code to find resources closest to a given position, lets code our agent to use this and tell its units to go to the closest resource and mine them! We can copy our empty agent code and add a loop that loops over all our units and make them move towards the resources","0a902673":"Now lets watch a match where our agent plays against a sample agent and see if it moves towards the resources! We can then verify by watching the replay and seeing our orange unit (team 0) move towards a nearby forest and collect wood","6d944736":"Ok so woah, what just happened? We just ran a match, that's what :)\n\nThere's a number of quality of life features in the visualizer, which you can also find embedded on the kaggle competition page when watching replays or on the online visualizer when using replay files. \n\nIf you find this replay viewer slow, you can also download a local copy of this replay viewer in addition to lowering the graphics quality, see https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/LuxViewer2021 for instructions.\n\nAt this point, we recommend reading the [game specifications](https:\/\/www.lux-ai.org\/specs-2021) a bit more to understand how to build a bot that tries to win the game.","130ff26e":"The `make` function is used to create environments that can then run the game given agents. Agents refer to programmed bots that play the game given observations of the game itself. \n\nIn addition to making the environment, you may also pass in special configurations such as the number of episode steps (capped at 361) and the seed.\n\nNow lets create our environment using `make` and watch a Episode! (We will be using the seed 562124210 because it's fun)","01f7293d":"Ok now that our agent finds and collects resources but our citytile was consumed by darkness! What now? Well units can only carry so much resources before they can't collect anymore. And to keep your City alive, you must move your unit on top of any CityTile that is in that City. (Recall that a City is composed of connected CityTiles)","1fde9fd3":"We will also need Kaggle Environments","9ac8a55b":"## Create a submission\nNow we need to create a .tar.gz file with main.py (and agent.py) at the top level. We can then upload this!","57660cb8":"## Submit\nNow open the \/kaggle\/working folder and find submission.tar.gz, download that file, navigate to the \"MySubmissions\" tab in https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/lux-ai-2021\/ and upload your submission! It should play a validation match against itself and once it succeeds it will be automatically matched against other players' submissions. Newer submissions will be prioritized for games over older ones. Your team is limited in the number of succesful submissions per day so we highly recommend testing your bot locally before submitting.","0ff0c859":"With this function, we are ready to start surviving the nights! The code below rewrites our agent to now have units who have full cargos to head towards the closest citytile and drop off their resources to fuel the city.","2cbfb7d1":"## Additional things to check out\n\nMake sure you check out the Bot API at https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\/tree\/master\/kits\n\nThis documents what you can do using the starter kit files in addition to telling you how to use the annotation debug commands that let you annotate directly on a replay (draw lines, circle things etc.)\n\nYou can also run the following below to save a episode to a JSON replay file. These are the same as what is shown on the leaderbaord and you can upload the replay files to the online replay viewer https:\/\/2021vis.lux-ai.org\/\n\n\nFor a local (faster) version of the replay viewer, follow installation instructions here https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Viewer-2021","925033d5":"## CLI Tool\n\nThere's a separate CLI tool that can also be used to run matches. It's recommended for Jupyter Notebook users to stick with just this notebook, and all other users including python users to follow the instructions on https:\/\/github.com\/Lux-AI-Challenge\/Lux-Design-2021\n\nThe other benefit however of using the CLI tool is that it generates much smaller, \"stateless\" replays and also lets you run a mini leaderboard on multiple bots ranked by various ranking algorithms"}}
