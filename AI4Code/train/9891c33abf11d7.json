A<br>Review and Analysis of Approaches to Research<br>Synthesis \n\nAbstract:   background when we began this process we were doctoral students and a faculty member in a research methods course as students we were facing a review of the literature for our dissertations we encountered several different ways of conducting a review but were unable to locate any resources that synthesized all of the various synthesis methodologies our purpose is to present a comprehensive overview and assessment of the main approaches to research synthesis we use research synthesis as a broad overarching term to describe various approaches to combining integrating and synthesizing research findings methods we conducted an integrative review of the literature to explore the historical contextual and evolving nature of research synthesis we searched five databases reviewed websites of key organizations handsearched several journals and examined relevant texts from the reference lists of the documents we had already obtained results we identified four broad categories of research synthesis methodology including conventional quantitative qualitative and emerging syntheses each of the broad categories was compared to the others on the following key characteristics purpose method product context underlying assumptions unit of analysis strengths and limitations and when to use each approach conclusions the current state of research synthesis reflects significant advancements in emerging synthesis studies that integrate diverse data types and sources new approaches to research synthesis provide a much broader range of review alternatives available to health and social science students and researchers\nresearch synthesis is the overarching term we use to describe approaches to combining aggregating integrating and synthesizing primary research findings each synthesis methodology draws on different types of findings depending on the purpose and product of the chosen synthesis see additional file 1\nbased on our current knowledge of the literature we identified these approaches to include in our review systematic review metaanalysis qualitative metasynthesis metanarrative synthesis scoping review rapid review realist synthesis concept analysis literature review and integrative review our first step was to divide the synthesis types among the research team each member did a preliminary search to identify key texts the team then met to develop search terms and a framework to guide the review\nover the period of 2008 to 2012 we extensively searched the literature updating our search at several time points not restricting our search by date the dates of texts reviewed range from 1967 to 2015 we used the terms above combined with the term method eg realist synthesis and method in the database health source academic edition includes medline and cinahl this search yielded very few texts on some methodologies and many on others we realized that many documents on research synthesis had not been picked up in the search therefore we also searched google scholar pubmed eric and social science index as well as the websites of key organizations such as the joanna briggs institute the university of york centre for evidencebased nursing and the cochrane collaboration database we hand searched several nursing social science public health and health policy journals finally we traced relevant documents from the references in obtained texts\nwe included works that met the following inclusion criteria 1 published in english\n2 discussed the history of research synthesis 3 explicitly described the approach and specific methods or 4 identified issues challenges strengths and limitations of the particular methodology we excluded research reports that resulted from the use of particular synthesis methodologies unless they also included criteria 2 3 or 4 above\nbased on our search we identified additional types of research synthesis eg metainterpretation best evidence synthesis critical interpretive synthesis metasummary grounded formal theory still we missed some important developments in metaanalysis for example identified by the journals reviewers that have now been discussed briefly in the paper the final set of 197 texts included in our review comprised theoretical empirical and conceptual papers books editorials and
