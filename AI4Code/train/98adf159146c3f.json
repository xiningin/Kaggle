One of the factor I presumed, is higher expected salaries.

But how hard? Let's see the odds!\n","5d66ca40":"**Rank vs. Alumni Salaries**","ca50f593":"It's true. The better the college rank, the better the salary of its alumnus. But how about the cost? Is it really worth it?","3da21b5f":"Wow so in general, you are more likely to get higher grant aid from private colleges than public colleges.","3f43a596":"Now if you want to dream, I suggest you to dream big. So if you want to go to college, I suggest you pick the best colleges, maybe the top 50 colleges in the US. And from those, which are the more financially reasonable?","b471f774":"However, there's got to be some colleges that charge reasonable cost with a promise of getting a job with reasonable salary. Let's see!","ac4d6185":"As you can see, in terms of percentage, private colleges have better rank than private colleges. And because they have better rank, the acceptance rate is also generally lower than public colleges. But we should also consider the fact that ther are more public colleges than private colleges","995cff81":"**Ranking vs. Acceptance Rate**","96a2bb60":"How about the score? Well the correlation is just too high, of course the higher the rank, the higher your score would be needed. So study hard and choose wisely!","5ea7e911":"Well although private colleges are generally more expensive than public colleges, private colleges also generally have higher BEP, which means it would be faster for you to break even.","407208c1":"Well, except for the University of North Calorina, Chapel Hill,(and the military), the correlation is very linear. How about grant aid? Let's see!","9c92089c":"The cost is also generally higher for better ranks colleges! Wow that some expensive amount. Some of them doesn't even make any sense! And unsurprisingly, private colleges are in general much more expensive than public colleges.","639632f6":"It's not a myth, both for the public and private colleges: in general, the higher the rank, the lower the acceptance rate. It's not really a surprise though, but it's interesting to see that the scatter implies the distribution of Public and Private colleges are similiar. But is it?","332ae44e":"Well, if you want to have a bright future without educational cost for college, the military academy would be best for you, especially if you love your country so much. But, other than the academy, what are other more reasonable option, and how does it stakes with ranks?","36c68deb":"So there you go! You can choose one of these 50 colleges based on the money you have right now and the grant aid you might get as a student.(as to prevent taking the student loans)","294076e4":"Acceptance Rate, Alumni Salary and Total Annual Cost has surprissingly medium and low correlation with the rank of the colleges.
