which supports least number of cover types can be used to differentiate between cover types.\n\nVertical distance to hydrology is directly proportional to horizontal distance to hydrology.\n\nKrummholz can grow on patches with zero to 1200 meters horizontal distance to hydrology indicating that it can grow on steeper slope as well where in there is less water in the soil .\n\nWillow is the only cover type that has no Aspect value above 270-280 degrees and only grows in Cache la Poudre.","079a9165":"We can observe a pattern over here. Soil type 1 to 10 excluding 7,8 and 9 belonging majorly to soil families, Cathedral and Vanet are found to support growth of Douglas-fir, Willow and Ponderosa Pine.\n\nSoil types 22 to 33 belonging to soil families Leighcan and Como can be seen to support growth of Aspen, Spruce, Lodgepole Pine.\n\nAnd soil later in the range from soil type 35 to 40 belonging to soil families Cryumbrepts,Bross, Moran supports growth exclusively of Krummholz and Spruce.\n\nSoil type that support least number of cover types can be used to distinguish within cover types for example:\nAs mentioned in the plot above, here we can see the reason why soil type 4,6,10,23,30,31,32,33 cannot be used as class separating parameters as they support growth of many cover types.\n\nSoil type 9, Troutville family, very stony supports growth of only Lodgepole pine. Likewise, other soil type that can be utilized for distinguishing cover types include soil type 12, 14, 18, 27, 28, 35, 36, 37.\n\nSome cover types grow specifically in certain type of soil whereas trees such as Aspen and Douglas fir can be seen growing in any type of soil.","0ac5e86c":"We can see many outliers here.\n\nFire is known to indirectly benefit Aspen trees, since it allows the saplings to flourish in open sunlight in the burned landscape.

Possible reason for low diversity might be high elevation. We shall check this in the plots below.","a6d26cd1":"As expected we can observe Neota Wilderness Area highly elevated reflecting low diversity in this area in comparison to other three areas. \n\nOther three area's elevation fall in the range 2,400 to 2,900 and only Neota's is above 3000.\n\nIf we compare both the plots Krummholz can be clearly seen growing on elevated patches in Rawah, Comanche Peak and Neota.\n\nPonderosa Pine, Douglas-fir grows in Comanche Peak and Cache la Poudre with elevation in the range 2000meters2750meters.\n\nAs discussed earlier, Willow being the tree that grows on patches with low elevation is found only in Cache La Poudre.","9a84de54":"Let us now address continuous features namely : Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology, Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology, Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways, Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points.\n\nFirst let us take a look at distribution of data points of the above mentioned features.","6fe2a20c":"Aspect is the orientation of slope, measured clockwise in degrees from 0 to 360, where 0 is North-facing 90 is East facing, 180 is South facing and 270 is West facing.\n\nIn the plots above we can see that most of the vegetation in the data set are found on patches of land with downward slope facing to the east.\n\nIf we look at the box plot of Aspect, we can see that all the cover types except Willow has Aspect values ranging from 0 to 360 degrees. Thus making Aspect not a suitable parameter to differentiate within these cover types.\n\nAlthough one thing to note is that Willow has no Aspect value above 270-280 degrees indictaing that there will be less or no prevalence of Willow trees in slope facing West direction.","c1bef1b6":"Patches of all cover types can be found near roadways upto a distance of 2000 metres. \n\nOnly L.Pine and Spruce are found beyond a distance of 6000 metres from roadways.\n\nRawah wilderness can be seen to accomodate more forest cover beyond a distance of 6000 metres from the road.","7ada9145":"Krummholz cab be seen growing in wider range of horizontal distance to hydrology.\n","dd7e5fd3":"We can see that overall sampling distribution of patches of seven different cover types over four wilderness areas  is uniform. \n\nEach cover type corresponding to 2160 patches","097ad863":"We can observe class separation to some extent in case of elevation and some interesting patterns with respect to aspect, hillshade and slope.So, let us take a closer look at these parameters with Cover Type as response variable.","90df3e98":"## Continuous features ","8ac5cf74":"Let us take a look at correlation plots including density plots across various parameters in the dataset using Seaborn's Pairplot function and also correlation heatmap.
