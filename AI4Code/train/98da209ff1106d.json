On March 29, Tsim Sha Tsui\u2019s Kwong Wing Catering wrote that police entered the restaurant twice within 15 minutes, claiming they received reports that tables were less than 1.5 metres apart. Officers took the ID numbers of all staff.\n\nTwo days later, police raided Central\u2019s Cafe Seasons, owned by the son of pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai, during lunch hours. Officers demanded the IDs of diners, claiming they suspected some of them were meant to be in mandatory quarantine. The incident was later confirmed by a police spokesperson.\n\nMore recently, dozens of police entered Prince Edward\u2019s Ki Lung Tea Restaurant two evenings in a row on April 11 and 12. Staff said officers barked orders rudely, demanding the kitchen stoves be turned off, checking its alcohol license, and falsely claiming it was an offence not to install panels to sub-divide tables.\n\nNone of these three high-profile incidents, however, have resulted in any charges so far.\nhttps:\/\/hongkongfp.com\/2020\/04\/17\/explainer-after-months-of-protests-is-hong-kong-selectively-enforcing-covid-19-laws\/","0fea98ca":"#Explainer: After months of protests, is Hong Kong selectively enforcing covid-19 laws? by Elson Tong - 17 april 2020\n\nFrom March 28 onwards, restaurants were ordered to keep tables at least 1.5 metres apart. The next day, public gatherings of more than four people were banned. And on April 1, karaokes and nightclubs were closed. In the days that followed, bars and beauty parlours were also closed.\n\nHowever, arriving on the back of a nine-month protest movement and rampant cries of police brutality, the authorities stand accused of selectively enforcing the measures. Pro-protest businesses say they are repeatedly targeted, while officials have allegedly turned a blind eye to breaches by pro-government figures.\n\nAre Hong Kong\u2019s social distancing measures being used as an excuse to crack down on the ongoing protest movement? HKFP rounds up key incidents that have caused Hongkongers to question whether enforcement has become politicised.\n\nRegulation 12 also empowers government officers to enter any premises subject to the social distancing measures, conduct examinations, and demand any person for identification. As online commentator Ah Chit wrote, the devil was in the detail.\nhttps:\/\/hongkongfp.com\/2020\/04\/17\/explainer-after-months-of-protests-is-hong-kong-selectively-enforcing-covid-19-laws\/","20a519ce":"Aside from its effect on protests, questions have arisen over how the ban on gatherings \u2013 and its exceptions \u2013 should be interpreted.
