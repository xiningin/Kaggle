[Research](https:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0030723) shows that increased talent retention is associated with increased productivity while lower attrition rates are associated with higher sales and financial performance. Additionally, attrition directly impacts the bottom line as [researchers](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fgJzAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Griffeth,+R.,+%26+Hom,+P.+2001+&ots=nvMC_k8KXy&sig=pX_aPKq0de93WbEPDXhnD5gjVfo#v=onepage&q=Griffeth%2C%20R.%2C%20%26%20Hom%2C%20P.%202001&f=false) have shown that the cost to replace a single worker ranges anywhere from 93% to 200% of their annual salary. On top of this research, many companies have taken note with many looking specifically at [employee churn](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/companies-step-up-efforts-to-keep-workers-from-quitting-11583058602) and how to respond in an attempt to improve the quality of their workforce.  ","2206bd2d":"### Barplot","baba41b3":"This time we find fewer correlations than with the numerical data. This indicates that we could use the categorical data to build our model.","2e15077f":"Pivot table analysis:\n\nThere is quite a bit of information here. Much of this should be used to look at the best and worst cases in order to determine how to respond to Attrition rates similar to how [Google approaches people analytics](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00NLHJKBE\/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). For instance further data gathering such as employee interviews and employee sentiment surveys can be sent out to high attrition areas of the company such as those with low job involvement (33%), low job level (26%), and low environment satisfaction (25%) to determine what is causing people to leave. Conversely similar data gathering can also be conducted on low attrition areas such as Research Directors (2%), mid-high job level (4%) or even high Job Involvement (9%) to determine what is working well.","81d13cce":"Looking first at employees retained (row with index of 0) we see that the precision is .89. In other words this model predicts an employee will stay 89% of the time. On the other hand, recall is 98%. In other words this model correctly identifies 98% of all employees retained.\n \nLooking next at employees attrited (row with index of 1) we see that the precision is .64. In other words this model predicts an employee will leave 64% of the time. On the other hand, recall is 23%.

A business leader can use this information to understand her team and better understand what staffing needs are. Additionally, she can use this to better predict the individuals who will stay or leave. While the 64% is not a high number of precision, the business leader can still use this model to better expect who will leave and pair this with qualitiative factors to identify who they should further invest in or who they should divest in. \n\nFor next steps, the HR analytics team should: First, identify the quality of the attrits by identifying them as regretted or non-regretted attrits. Second, identify why people are leaving through an exit survey. Third, learn more about the high attrition areas and low attrition areas of the company to better understand the environmental trends impacting attrition. These analyses will help the business better understand how harmful attrition is and the different factors contributing to attrition.

If we could collect more data we'd like to see how this compares in our industry and region to benchmark how well we are doing.\n- There are more single and divorced combined than married people at the company (the ethics and legalities of this data might preclude analyzing or acting on this information)\n- The vast majority of employees receive a 3 with none receiving a 1 or 2 and only ~ 15% receiving a 4. This is disappointing because a further analysis in employee churn is to see how effective it is. While a high amount of turnover is often bad for the company, very low rates of employee turnover could also be bad because the company is not moving on employees who are poor fits or poor performers. When you have a greater distribution of employee ratings it is easier to see how effective the turnover is.
