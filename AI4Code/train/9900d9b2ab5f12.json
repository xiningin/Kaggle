One of the most famous tragedies in modern history, it inspired numerous stories, several films, and a musical and has been the subject of much scholarship and scientific speculation.\n\n\n<h2>Origion and construction<\/h2>\n\n* In the early 1900s the transatlantic passenger trade was highly profitable and competitive, with ship lines vying to transport wealthy travelers and immigrants. Two of the chief lines were White Star and Cunard. By the summer of 1907, Cunard seemed poised to increase its share of the market with the debut of two new ships, the Lusitania and the Mauretania, which were scheduled to enter service later that year. The two passenger liners were garnering much attention for their expected speed; both would later set speed records crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Looking to answer his rival, White Star chairman J. Bruce Ismay reportedly met with William Pirrie, who controlled the Belfast shipbuilding firm Harland and Wolff, which constructed most of White Star\u2019s vessels. The two men devised a plan to build a class of large liners that would be known for their comfort instead of their speed. It was eventually decided that three vessels would be constructed: the Olympic, the Titanic, and the Britannic.\n\n* On March 31, 1909, some three months after work began on the Olympic, the keel was laid for the Titanic. The two ships were built side by side in a specially constructed gantry that could accommodate their unprecedented size. The sister ships were largely designed by Thomas Andrews of Harland and Wolff. In addition to ornate decorations, the Titanic featured an immense first-class dining saloon, four elevators, and a swimming pool. Its second-class accommodations were comparable to first-class features on other ships, and its third-class offerings, although modest, were still noted for their relative comfort.\n\n* As to safety elements, the Titanic had 16 compartments that included doors which could be closed from the bridge, so that water could be contained in the event the hull was breached. Although they were presumed to be watertight, the bulkheads were not capped at the top. The ship\u2019s builders claimed that four of the compartments could be flooded without endangering the liner\u2019s buoyancy. The system led many to claim that the Titanic was unsinkable.\n\n* Following completion of the hull and main superstructure, the Titanic was launched on May 31, 1911. It then began the fitting-out phase, as machinery was loaded into the ship and interior work began. After the Olympic\u2019s maiden voyage in June 1911, slight changes were made to the Titanic\u2019s design. In early April 1912 the Titanic underwent its sea trials, after which the ship was declared seaworthy.\n\n* As it prepared to embark on its maiden voyage, the Titanic was one of the largest and most opulent ships in the world. It had a gross registered tonnage (i.e., carrying capacity) of 46,328 tons, and when fully laden the ship displaced (weighed) more than 52,000 tons. The Titanic was approximately 882.5 feet (269 metres) long and about 92.5 feet (28.2 metres) wide at its widest point.\n    \n\n<center><img src = \"https:\/\/cdn.britannica.com\/s:690x388,c:crop\/68\/185468-050-C0D53622\/Titanic-iceberg-British-15-1912.jpg\">\n<img src = \"https:\/\/cdn.britannica.com\/s:690x388,c:crop\/00\/153200-050-73A47AB8\/Construction-shipyard-Olympic-Titanic-Harland-and-Wolff.jpg\"><\/center>\n\n<h2>Maiden Voyagee<\/h2>\n\n* On April 10, 1912, the Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage, traveling from Southampton, England, to New York City. Nicknamed the \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Special,\u201d the ship was fittingly captained by Edward J. Smith, who was known as the \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Captain\u201d because of his popularity with wealthy passengers. Indeed, onboard were a number of prominent people, including American businessman Benjamin Guggenheim, British journalist William Thomas Stead, and Macy\u2019s department store co-owner Isidor Straus and his wife, Ida. In addition, Ismay and Andrews were also traveling on the Titanic.\n\n* The voyage nearly began with a collision, however, when suction from the Titanic caused the docked New York to swing into the giant liner\u2019s path. After an hour of maneuverings to prevent the accident, the Titanic was under way. On the evening of April 10 the ship stopped at Cherbourg, France. The city\u2019s dock was too small to accommodate the Titanic, so passengers had to be ferried to and from the ship in tenders. Among those boarding were John Jacob Astor and his pregnant second wife, Madeleine, and Molly Brown. After some two hours the Titanic resumed its journey. On the morning of April 11 the liner made its last scheduled stop in Europe, at Queenstown (Cobh), Ireland. At approximately 1:30 PM the ship set sail for New York City. Onboard were some 2,200 people, approximately 1,300 of whom were passengers.\n\n<center>\n<img src = \"https:\/\/titanicfacts.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/titanic-at-southampton.jpg\">\n<img src = \"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/qew4qgvqz8q51.png\"><\/center>\n\n<h2>Titanic's Dooms day!!!<\/h2>\n\n* Throughout much of the voyage, the wireless radio operators on the Titanic, Jack Phillips and Harold Bride, had been receiving iceberg warnings, most of which were passed along to the bridge. The two men worked for the Marconi Company, and much of their job was relaying passengers\u2019 messages. On the evening of April 14 the Titanic began to approach an area known to have icebergs. Smith slightly altered the ship\u2019s course to head farther south. However, he maintained the ship\u2019s speed of some 22 knots. At approximately 9:40 PM the Mesaba sent a warning of an ice field. The message was never relayed to the Titanic\u2019s bridge. At 10:55 PM the nearby Leyland liner Californian sent word that it had stopped after becoming surrounded by ice. Phillips, who was handling passenger messages, scolded the Californian for interrupting him.\n\n* Two lookouts, Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee, were stationed in the crow\u2019s nest of the Titanic. Their task was made difficult by the fact that the ocean was unusually calm that night: because there would be little water breaking at its base, an iceberg would be more difficult to spot. In addition, the crow\u2019s nest\u2019s binoculars were missing. At approximately 11:40 PM, about 400 nautical miles (740 km) south of Newfoundland, Canada, an iceberg was sighted, and the bridge was notified. First Officer William Murdoch ordered both the ship \u201chard-a-starboard\u201d\u2014a maneuver that under the order system then in place would turn the ship to port (left)\u2014and the engines reversed. The Titanic began to turn, but it was too close to avoid a collision. The ship\u2019s starboard side scraped along the iceberg. At least five of its supposedly watertight compartments toward the bow were ruptured. After assessing the damage, Andrews determined that, as the ship\u2019s forward compartments filled with water, its bow would drop deeper into the ocean, causing water from the ruptured compartments to spill over into each succeeding compartment, thereby sealing the ship\u2019s fate. The Titanic would founder. (By reversing the engines, Murdoch actually caused the Titanic to turn slower than if it had been moving at its original speed. Most experts believe the ship would have survived if it had hit the iceberg head-on.)\n\n* Smith ordered Phillips to begin sending distress signals, one of which reached the Carpathia at approximately 12:20 AM on April 15, and the Cunard ship immediately headed toward the stricken liner. However, the Carpathia was some 58 nautical miles (107 km) away when it received the signal, and it would take more than three hours to reach the Titanic. Other ships also responded, including the Olympic, but all were too far away. A vessel was spotted nearby, but the Titanic was unable to contact it. The Californian was also in the vicinity, but its wireless had been turned off for the night.\n\n* As attempts were made to contact nearby vessels, the lifeboats began to be launched, with orders of women and children first. Although the Titanic\u2019s number of lifeboats exceeded that required by the British Board of Trade, its 20 boats could carry only 1,178 people, far short of the total number of passengers. This problem was exacerbated by lifeboats being launched well below capacity, because crewmen worried that the davits would not be able to support the weight of a fully loaded boat. (The Titanic had canceled its scheduled lifeboat drill earlier in the day, and the crew was unaware that the davits had been tested in Belfast.) Lifeboat number 7, which was the first to leave the Titanic, held only about 27 people, though it had space for 65. \n\n**In the end, only 705 people would be rescued in lifeboats.**\n\n<center>\n<img src = \"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/stairnaheireann.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/rtd_4161912_page1_closeup.jpg?fit=750%2C507&ssl=1\">\n<img src = \"https:\/\/titanicfacts.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/titanic-rescue-ship-carpathia.jpg\">\n<\/center>","45ebea40":"# Visualization for training Data","c0b7f4cc":"# Importing Liberaries","849e8bd8":"# Data Preprocessing & Data Modelling\n","5f972cf9":"# Visualization on Test Data\n","aa725874":"# Loading Data","63bab6ce":"<center><h1>Summary<\/h1>\n<h2>The Best Moder Here is LGBN with ~77.5% accuracy......<\/h2>\n<h3>Please UpVote for me<\/h3>\n<img src = \"https:\/\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/uhB0n3Eac8ybe\/200.webp?cid=ecf05e474qky63fousbga26zarrmo11lokipfmxmawpgvjrn&rid=200.webp&ct=g\">    \n"}}
