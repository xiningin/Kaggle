The need for data cleaning will arise from problems in the way that the datum are entered and stored. Data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors. Common tasks include record matching, identifying inaccuracy of data, overall quality of existing data, deduplication, and column segmentation.","f6514c6d":"### Analysing data\nData analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.\n","c6b4933e":"### Predicting Test data","6173cb04":"#### Support Vector Machine \nSVM is a widely-used supervised machine learning algorithm. It is mostly used in classification tasks but suitable for regression tasks as well. \nMost of the machine learning and deep learning algorithms have some parameters that can be adjusted which are called hyperparameters. We need to set hyperparameters before we train the models. Hyperparameters are very critical in building robust and accurate models. They help us find the balance between bias and variance and thus, prevent the model from overfitting or underfitting. To be able to adjust the hyperparameters, we need to understand what they mean and how they change a model. It would be a tedious and never-ending task to randomly trying a bunch of hyperparameter values.","55a0d2ef":"### Determine the Features and Lable","8018b536":"### Evaluating the Model","852e1b0e":"### Split the Dataset to Train and Test"}}
