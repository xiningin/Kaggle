Write a query to get the average number of riders per station for each year in the dataset and order by the year so you can see the trend. You can use the `EXTRACT` method to get the day and year from the start time timestamp.

BigQuery is especially efficient with large datasets, so you'll use BigQuery-ML (called BQML) to build your model. BQML uses a \"linear regression\" model when predicting numeric outcomes, like the number of riders.\n\n## 1) Training vs testing\n\nYou'll want to test your model on data it hasn't seen before (for reasons described in the [Intro to Machine Learning Micro-Course](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-machine-learning).

You decide to build a model to predict how many riders will start from each station during each hour, capturing patterns in seasonality, time of day, day of the week, etc.\n\nTo get started, create a project in GCP and connect to it by running the code cell below. Make sure you have connected the kernel to your GCP account in Settings.","87df11fd":"# 9) Next steps\n\nGiven what you've learned, what improvements do you think you could make to your model?

The number of rides starting at the station during the hour. Call this `num_rides`.\nSelect only the data before 2018-01-01 (so we can save data from 2018 as testing data.)","c559795e":"You should see that the r^2 score here is negative.
