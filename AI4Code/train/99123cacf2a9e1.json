This combines a `sigmoid` activation function **and** and binary cross entropy loss in one function.\n\nFor the real images, we want `D(real_images) = 1`. That is, we want the discriminator to classify the the real images with a label = 1, indicating that these are real. To help the discriminator generalize better, the labels are **reduced a bit from 1.0 to 0.9**. For this, we'll use the parameter `smooth`; if True, then we should smooth our labels. In PyTorch, this looks like `labels = torch.ones(size) * 0.9`\n\nThe discriminator loss for the fake data is similar. We want `D(fake_images) = 0`, where the fake images are the _generator output_, `fake_images = G(z)`. \n\n### Generator Loss\n\nThe generator loss will look similar only with flipped labels. The generator's goal is to get `D(fake_images) = 1`. In this case, the labels are **flipped** to represent that the generator is trying to fool the discriminator into thinking that the images it generates (fakes) are real!","053902e0":"Below I'm showing the generated images as the network was training, every 10 epochs.","03b02034":"# Generative Adversarial Network\n> The idea behind GANs is that you have two networks, a generator  \ud835\udc3a  and a discriminator  \ud835\udc37 , competing against each other. The generator makes \"fake\" data to pass to the discriminator. The discriminator also sees real training data and predicts if the data it's received is real or fake.\n\n> * The generator is trained to fool the discriminator, it wants to output data that looks _as close as possible_ to real, training data. \n> * The discriminator is a classifier that is trained to figure out which data is real and which is fake. \n\n> What ends up happening is that the generator learns to make data that is indistinguishable from real data to the discriminator.\n\nThe general structure of a GAN is shown in the diagram above, using MNIST images as data. The latent sample is a random vector that the generator uses to construct its fake images. This is often called a latent vector and that vector space is called latent space. As the generator trains, it figures out how to map latent vectors to recognizable images that can fool the discriminator.\n\nIf you're interested in generating only new images, you can throw out the discriminator after training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to define and train these adversarial networks in PyTorch and generate new images!\n","1295287f":"## Model Hyperparameters","3777158e":"These are samples from the final training epoch.

We'll use our functions `real_loss` and `fake_loss` to help us calculate the discriminator losses in all of the following cases.\n\n### Discriminator training\n1. Compute the discriminator loss on real, training images        \n2. Generate fake images\n3. Compute the discriminator loss on fake, generated images     \n4. Add up real and fake loss\n5.

Compute the discriminator loss on fake images, using **flipped** labels!\n3.
