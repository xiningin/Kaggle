It offers a great alternative to Python lists, as NumPy arrays are more compact, allow faster access in reading and writing items, and are more convenient and more efficient overall. \n\nIn addition, it's (partly) the fundament of other important packages that are used for data manipulation and machine learning which you might already know, namely, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and SciPy:\n\n* The Pandas data manipulation library builds on NumPy, but instead of the arrays, it makes use of two other fundamental data structures: Series and DataFrames,\n* SciPy builds on Numpy to provide a large number of functions that operate on NumPy arrays, and\n* The machine learning library Scikit-Learn builds not only on NumPy, but also on SciPy and Matplotlib. \n\n\nYou see, this Python library is a must-know: if you know how to work with it, you'll also gain a better understanding of the other Python data science tools that you'll undoubtedly be using. \n\nIt's a win-win situation, right?\n\nNevertheless, just like any other library, NumPy can come off as quite overwhelming at start; What are the very basics that you need to know in order to get started with this data analysis library?\n\nThis cheat sheet means to give you a good overview of the possibilities that this library has to offer. \n\nGo and check it out for yourself!\n\nClick on the link below.","af509dae":"**Import NumPy**","387833ff":"Here we are assigning all values in the array that are greater than 30 to the value of 30.","f8f59b0a":"**Convert a list to Numpy array.**\n\n**new_array = np.array(list)**","ee3fb4ba":"**Why NumPy?**<br>\n\nNumPy is an open source numerical Python library.
