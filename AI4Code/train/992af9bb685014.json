This means whether the model is able to perform well on data it has not seen before. This is a way to see if the model is overfitting.\n\n**Overfitting** is when a model is trained too well on the training data. You want to avoid overfitting, as this would mean that the model mostly just memorized the training data. This would account for a large accuracy with the training data but a low accuracy in the testing data.

The properties that made them useful in image processing makes them also handy for sequence processing. You can imagine a CNN as a specialized neural network that is able to detect specific patterns.\n\nA CNN has hidden layers which are called convolutional layers. When you think of images, a computer has to deal with a two dimensional matrix of numbers and therefore you need some way to detect features in this matrix. These convolutional layers are able to detect edges, corners and other kinds of textures which makes them such a special tool. The convolutional layer consists of multiple filters which are slid across the image and are able to detect specific features.","39feddae":"The classification model we are going to use is the logistic regression which is a simple yet powerful linear model that is mathematically speaking in fact a form of regression between 0 and 1 based on the input feature vector. By specifying a cutoff value (by default 0.5), the regression model is used for classification. ","c9b54ec5":"**Word Embeddings**\n\nThis method represents words as dense word vectors (also called word embeddings) which are trained unlike the one-hot encoding which are hardcoded. This means that the word embeddings collect more information into fewer dimensions.\n\nNote that the word embeddings do not understand the text as a human would, but they rather map the statistical structure of the language used in the corpus. Their aim is to map semantic meaning into a geometric space. This geometric space is then called the embedding space.\n\nNow you need to tokenize the data into a format that can be used by the word embeddings. Keras offers a couple of convenience methods for text preprocessing and sequence preprocessing which you can employ to prepare your text.\n\nYou can start by using the Tokenizer utility class which can vectorize a text corpus into a list of integers. Each integer maps to a value in a dictionary that encodes the entire corpus, with the keys in the dictionary being the vocabulary terms themselves. You can add the parameter num_words, which is responsible for setting the size of the vocabulary. The most common num_words words will be then kept.","621fc530":"We start by taking the Yelp data set which we extract from our concatenated data set.

This happens at every connection and at the end you reach an output layer with one or more output nodes.\n\nIf you want to have a binary classification you can use one node, but if you have multiple categories you should use multiple nodes for each category:","740e653c":"## What Is a Word Embedding?\n\nText is considered a form of sequence data similar to time series data that you would have in weather data or financial data. Now you will see how to represent each word as vectors. There are various ways to vectorize text, such as:\n\n* Words represented by each word as a vector\n* Characters represented by each character as a vector\n* N-grams of words\/characters represented as a vector (N-grams are overlapping groups of multiple succeeding words\/characters in the text)\n\nHere, you\u2019ll see how to deal with representing words as vectors which is the common way to use text in neural networks. Two possible ways to represent a word as a vector are one-hot encoding and word embeddings.\n\n**One-Hot Encoding**\n\nThe first way to represent a word as a vector is by creating a so-called one-hot encoding, which is simply done by taking a vector of the length of the vocabulary with an entry for each word in the corpus.\n\nIn this way, you have for each word, given it has a spot in the vocabulary, a vector with zeros everywhere except for the corresponding spot for the word which is set to one.","d2e2c8f0":"Create the feature vectors for each sentence of the training and testing set:","c96a264e":"OneHotEncoder expects each categorical value to be in a separate row, so you\u2019ll need to reshape the array, then you can apply the encoder:","c5681e32":"### Introducing Keras\n\nKeras is a deep learning and neural networks API by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet which is capable of running on top of Tensorflow (Google), Theano or CNTK (Microsoft). To quote the wonderful book by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, Deep Learning with Python:\n\n    Keras is a model-level library, providing high-level building blocks for developing deep-learning models. It doesn\u2019t handle low-level operations such as tensor manipulation and differentiation. Instead, it relies on a specialized, well-optimized tensor library to do so, serving as the backend engine of Keras (Source)\n\nIt is a great way to start experimenting with neural networks without having to implement every layer and piece on your own. For example Tensorflow is a great machine learning library, but you have to implement a lot of boilerplate code to have a model running.","ac0fc61b":"Extract the folder into a data folder and go ahead and load the data with Pandas:","b3382d3f":"You can see that the logistic regression reached an impressive 79.6%, but let\u2019s have a look how this model performs on the other data sets that we have.

You will need the following parameters:\n* **input_dim**: the size of the vocabulary\n* **output_dim**: the size of the dense vector\n* **input_length**: the length of the sequence\n\nWith the Embedding layer we have now a couple of options. One way would be to take the output of the embedding layer and plug it into a Dense layer. In order to do this you have to add a Flatten layer in between that prepares the sequential input for the Dense layer:","f82b4de5":"`CountVectorizer` performs tokenization which separates the sentences into a set of **tokens**.

Those parameters are called hyperparameters. This is the most time consuming part of machine learning and sadly there are no one-fits-all solutions ready.\n\nOne popular method for hyperparameter optimization is **grid search**. What this method does is it takes lists of parameters and it runs the model with each parameter combination that it can find. It is the most thorough way but also the most computationally heavy way to do this. Another common way,**random search**, which you\u2019ll see in action here, simply takes random combinations of parameters.\n\nIn order to apply random search with Keras, you will need to use the KerasClassifier which serves as a wrapper for the scikit-learn API. With this wrapper you are able to use the various tools available with scikit-learn like cross-validation. The class that you need is RandomizedSearchCV which implements random search with cross-validation. Cross-validation is a way to validate the model and take the whole data set and separate it into multiple testing and training data sets.\n\nThere are various types of cross-validation. One type is the k-fold cross-validation. In this type the data set is partitioned into k equal sized sets where one set is used for testing and the rest of the partitions are used for training. This enables you to run k different runs, where each partition is once used as a testing set. So, the higher k is the more accurate the model evaluation is, but the smaller each testing set is.","16a97661":"## Defining a Baseline Model","e13ec19f":"### First Keras Model\n\nKeras supports two main types of models. You have the Sequential model API and the functional API which can do everything of the Sequential model but it can be also used for advanced models with complex network architectures.\n\nThe Sequential model is a linear stack of layers, where you can use the large variety of available layers in Keras. The most common layer is the Dense layer which is your regular densely connected neural network layer with all the weights and biases that you are already familiar with.\n\nBefore we build our model, we need to know the input dimension of our feature vectors. This happens only in the first layer since the following layers can do automatic shape inference. In order to build the Sequential model, you can add layers one by one in order"}}
