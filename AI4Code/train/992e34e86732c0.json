Abstracts usually contain high-level information or overview of a paper, hence, they can be insufficient to answer a specific question. On the other hand, the whole body of an article can be long and cumbersome for searching an answer inside.\n2. A well-known drawback of standard BM25-based search engines is their inability to comprehend meaning (semantics) of key words, i.e. synonyms, different syntactic forms, mispellings, abbreviations, etc.\n\nTo address Point 1, I implement paragraph-level search that can give more detailed answers than abstract-level search and more succinct and readable answers than full-text search.\n\nTo address Point 2, I leverage word embeddings to expand a query with closely related terms per key word. \n\nI choose fastText as my word embedding model here (why not Word2Vec?) because fastText can handle out-of-vocabulary words naturally. This is important since questions\/queries can contain terms which are not present in the corpus. Moreover, as we will see in the following, the given corpus contains many mispellings which are naturally handled by fastText.","ce5a92f6":"Let's load and then concatenate all 4 dataframes from '\/kaggle\/input\/cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv'.

But, if the corpus is significantly extended, e.g. x10 in size, the engine is likely to go out of memory because it keeps the index in memory. More sophisticated and industry-standard search engines like ElasticSearch can be used to deal with this issue.\n\n* Instead of training word embeddings from a given corpus, one could try using a pre-trained biomedical embeddings. They might have been trained on a bigger corpus (e.g. PubMed), but they could miss or poorly encode important terms for the task at hand.\n\n* Nowadays, we have more advanced embedding models than fastText, such as ELMo, Universal Sentence Encoder, BERT, etc. In comparison to fastText, they are context-aware and take order of words into account when generating embeddings. It would be interesting in future to leverage those models for better query expnasion or even building a search engine with them alone (thus removing BM25). Their downside, however, is high computation cost and low interpretability and, hence, a slower and harder-to-debug search engine.\n\n* Here, I define \"paragraphs\" as pieces of text separated by \"\\n\". While being the simplest, it is not necessarily the best definition. It could be done based on other rules, e.g. max N sentences, or even paragraph chunking ML models.\n\n* Text preprocessing is as simple as possible here.
