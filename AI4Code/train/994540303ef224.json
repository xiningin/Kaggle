Exploring categorical features\n\nWe have 2 features which contain text:\n- Contry\n- Region\n\n### Country\n\nOur intuition is that each country is unique in our dataset (one country per row). This is what we would expect from a study of happiness levels in different countries across the worls. We can verify this assumption, to make sure we don't have errors in our data. For example, the social scientist running this study could have accidentally entered the same observation twice because she was working late to finish her data analysis.","ef71a892":"# <center>Exploratory Data Analysis for beginners","88e8ebac":"### Visualisation for categorical features\n\nSince the frequencies (the number of times they appear in our dataset) of our regions is greater than one, it invites us to look at them in a more intuitive way rather than the text displayed above.  \n\nIt is generally much better for the audience to present any data in visual form, whenever possible. For countries, nothing else made sense since each country appeared once in our data. But for regions, we can use a **bar chart**.\n\nThe bar chart below shows the same information as the table we've seen earlier.   \nBut in visual form it's so much easier to gain insights like \"Sub-Saharan Africa is present in our dataset approximately twice as much as the next region in line, Western Europe\". ","d0ef2e60":"## 3. Data types\n\nWe have some idea about or features types just by looking a the CSV file.

This would open the door for questions like: 'Are people happier in Western Europen than in Eastern Europe ?'. We don't know yet what question we can ask and exploring our data informs our next steps.\n\nBy the way, since we are dealing with long column names, it's worth mentioning that I don't have to type the whole column name. I just input the first 3 letters and press Tab for autocomplete.\n\nWe see in the output below that:\n- Europe is split into 2: 'Western Europe' and 'Central and Eastern Europe'\n- The Americas are divided into 2: 'Latin America and Caribbean' and 'North America and ANZ' (which is North America, Australia and New Zealand)\n- Africa is split into 2: 'Sub-Saharan Africa' and 'Middle East and North Africa'\n- Asia is divided into 3: 'Southeast Asia', 'South Asia' and 'East Asia'\n- There is a group of post-Soviet republics in Eurasia making up the 'Commonwealth of Independent States'","13105c42":"## 6. Bivariate analysis\n\nAll the explorations above belong to univariate analysis (that is, we looked at each variable individually).\nWe can also perform bivariate analysis - we can look at pairs of two variables to explore a possible relation between them.\n\nWhen Data Scientists perform a bivariate analysis, they look at scatterplots like the ones below and they search for clouds of dots that arrange themselves into straight diagonal lines. This is a visual representation of two variables that correlate.  \n\nHere's how to read the plots below:  \nLet's look at the **second plot on the first row**. On the **far left** of the image we see \"Logged GDP per capita\". All plots on the first row have on the y axis (the vertical axis) the Logged GDP per capita as the label of the Y axis. Now look at the bottom of the plots, all the way down, under the second column we have \"Social support\" as the name of the X axis. All plots on the second columns have the Social support on the x axis (the horizontal axis).  \n\nArmed with this information, let's look at the contents of the second plot, first row. As the 'Social support' increases, so does 'Logged GDP per capita'. What does this mean ? Nothing more than the fact that the two feature seems to be correlated (correlation, not causation). Most likely (intuition dictates) as the country gets riches it can afford to offer more social support to its inhabitants.\n\nNow look at the fourth subplot on the same row. The datapoints are all over place and there seems to be no correlation between 'GDP per capita' and 'Freedom to make life choices'.   \n\nCorrelation is not assessed only by looking at a scatterplot, but this is a good start.\n\nTake a few moments to explore the plots below. Look on the diagonal, from upper left to lower right. Do you recognize them from the univariate analysis section ?

Using pandas we can read various file formats easily into data structures specifically created for data manipulation procedures.  \n\nThe most commonly used data structures in pandas are [Series](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/series.html) and [DataFrame](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/frame.html). **Series** stores one-dimensional data (like a table with only one column) and **DataFrame** stores 2-dimensional data (tables with multiple columns).\n\nThe best place to learn pandas is the official documentation. If during or after reading this you feel like you need a more thorough  work session with pandas, have a look at this [10 minutes to pandas](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/user_guide\/10min.html) tutorial.  # Mind that it only takes 10 min if you're some species from another planet. For humans, most likely, it takes way more than that.\n\n### 2.2 Numpy\nNumpy is a library mainly used for the Mathematical functions it implements. This way we don't have to write the functions ourselves all the time.\n\n### 2.3 Matplotlib\nMatplotlib brings us data visualizations.\n\n### 2.4 Seaborn\nSeaborn takes visualisations to the next level: more powerful and more beautiful.

Observation is a fancy Statistics term, but it just means a new data point, a new measurement we did. \nIf our data is about happiness in various countries, each row contains data for a new country.  \n- **each column** is a different **feature** (or attribute) of our observations.
