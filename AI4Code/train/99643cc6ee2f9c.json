","357dec2c":"## Introduction\n\nIn R, `data.table` is the go-to package for manipulating any large tabular datasets. It is widely used for fast aggregation of large datasets, low latency add\/update\/remove of columns, quicker ordered joins, and a fast file reader.\n\n[Python datatable](https:\/\/github.com\/h2oai\/datatable) is closely related to R's `data.table` and attempts to mimic its core algorithms and API.  It is close in spirit to pandas or SFrame; however we put specific emphasis of the package is on speed and big data support. \n\nIn this notebook, let us explore the functions present in the `datatable` module and also see how it fares in speed with other modules.

It is a \"frame proxy\", as it becomes a simple way to refer to the Frame that we currently operate on. In this example, `dt.f` represents the frame `dt_df` ","5ce18fc0":"## Summary Statistics\n\nWe can also get the summary statistics like sum, mean, max, min, sd etc.\n\nLet us get the mean of the columns using both datatable and pandas","75ffc01a":"This took about ~12 seconds to read the data and create a `Frame` object.

It is the same notion as a pandas DataFrame or SQL table: data arranged in a two-dimensional array with rows and columns.\n\nNow let us read the same file in pandas as see the time difference.","dfc0a68d":"## Sorting the frame\n\nNow let us sort the dataframe by loan_amnt column.","7a48ccc4":"## Reading Data\n\nLet us first start with reading the input data from csv file. `loan.csv` file has about 2.26 million rows and 145 columns.\n\n`fread` is the fucntion to read the files in datatable module. From the documentation,fread provides fast and convenient parsing of text (csv) files.\n* Automatically detects separators, headers, column types, quoting rules, etc.\n* Reads from file, URL, shell, raw text, archives, glob\n* Provides multi-threaded file reading for maximum speed\n* Includes a progress indicator when reading large files\n* Reads both RFC4180-compliant and non-compliant files\n\n\n","c92cc10b":"P.S : I worked for H2O.ai where python data.table is getting created. The views in this article are my own. ","0f579cf4":"Overall, the `datatable` module seems to be much faster compared to the pandas dataframe operations. This will be very handy when we deal with bigger datasets.\n\nOne drawback is that `datatable` does not have all the functionalities that are there in pandas.\n\nPlease do let me know your thoughts in the comments if you get a chance to try out python `datatable`","7ec5ac9d":"## Saving the Frame\n\nNow let us look at the ways to save the frame so as to load back when needed. `datatable` has to_csv function similar to pandas.","8e84a6b7":"Now let us import the necessary modules.","53f203e1":"Python datatable is not natively present in the Kaggle environment.
