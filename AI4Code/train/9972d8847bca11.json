So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `reviews.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `reviews.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `reviews.iloc[0:1001]`.","a665dba5":"## Keep going\n\nMove on to the [**Summary functions and maps workbook**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/summary-functions-and-maps-workbook).","fb917325":"## 5.\n\nSelect the records with index labels `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, and `8`, assigning the result to the variable `sample_reviews`.\n\nIn other words, generate the following`DataFrame`:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sHZvI1O.png)","d72a3a4e":"Follow-up question: what type of object is `desc`?
