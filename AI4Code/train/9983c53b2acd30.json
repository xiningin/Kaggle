A team's offence runs through them. These are the shortest players on court. \n* Forwards: These players provide socring as well defence and are more physical than the guards.\n* Big-man: These players are the tallest on court and their main job is to secure the rebound and stop the opposing team from scoring in the paint.\n\nThroughout the years, each position had some specific skillset associated with it. But nowadays NBA is moving towards position-less basketball. Meaning, players are learning skills that were not associated with their position and are able to play in different positions as per the team requirement. This way defending a team becomes more difficult and challenging.\n\nFor example, look at the current Los Angeles Lakers team, Lebron James who is technically a forward plays the point guard and is the main ball handler of the team. Anthony Davis also sometimes plays as a Center and sometimes as a Power Forward.","b92c387e":"## Comparing Positions ","0b184828":"## Physical Aspects","3761d9d2":"This trend shows that the forwards are improving their scoring through the years, players like Lebron James and Kevin Durant are examples of high scoring forwards.","94413658":"This increasing trend corresponds to the less usage of centers, as after them Forwards are the tallest on the court."}}
