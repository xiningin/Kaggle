Let's see the most used ML frameworks among the participants.","31ccf581":"Remember when I said Python is great for its libraries? Yeah. Here, the top 3 aframeworks are Python based (even though TensorFlow is offered in other languages). Scikit-Learn offers so much in terms of Machine Learning that its #1 spot is not a surprise. When talking Neural Networks, Deep Learning or AI, TensorFlow and Keras show up.\n\nIf you would like to know some more terms to search for and study, let's take a look at some other things some respondants made sure to mention.\n","7c0f79ba":"Among the top 3 job titles, we can see that the Jupyter\/IPython notebook environment is the most used one. The R language makes another important appearance with RStudio being really used by Data Scientists and Analysts. Software Engineers tend to like Visual Studio and IntelliJ a lot, but even with them Jupyter is huge. ","713369a2":"Now, if you're into Machine Learning (and reading this post) you'd probably like to know some data visualization tools. Let's see what Kaggle users most use.\n","ec86984c":"Inside the Machine Learning Kaggle community, clearly the Jupyter environment takes the lead.\n\nMy goal with this kernel was to show Machine Learning enthusiasts what tools are important for someone in this field to learn. It's a lot of information out there and it can get quite stressful trying to know what to focus your time and energy studying.\n\nHopefully you can now see the top frameworks and libraries used by  Kaggle users and direct your studies towards whats the current trend among the Machine Learning community.\n\nI hope you liked it!","71c13f88":"Regarding data visualization, Matplotlib dominates in most job titles. Statisticians, however, tend to use ggplot2 more. Ggplot2 is an R library, which is, as said before, a statistical language. Ggplot2 is also pretty popular with Data Analysts.\n\nWhat about the work environment? IDE's (Integrated Development Environment)? What do Kaggle ML people like to code in?","59557aad":"Matplotlib and Seaborn are both Python libraries for data visualization. Considering that more than 25% of the participants use Python (although not exclusively), the top position was expected. Ggplot2 is also a library, but for the R programming language, and it is clearly used a lot aswell, right in there with Seaborn.\n\nSo now we know the most used ML frameworks and data visualization libraries by Kaggle users. If you're getting into ML, specially if you're still a student, I think you'd like to know what types of jobs can take advantage of mastering those skills. ","dcf72f11":"We can see the dominance of males and students here. Also, the amount of people that work on different job positions, some even not as \"tech-related\" as others.\nOn the map, we can also see that the US and India are two of the powerhorses currently (but let's not forget about China). Since I'm brazilian, I highlighted my homeland to show that we are not to be forgotten and have quite a lot of people working or studying to get into this field.\n\nBut okay, we're here to know more about the most used Machine Learning tools.\n\nLet's start with the programming language. The most used language is by far Python (which is the one I'm using here aswell). Python is a great language to learn, specially for someone who is just getting into programming, not to mention the amount of libraries that focus on Machine Learning. SQL is a great skill to have, because if you are interested in ML, you are interested in data. Your SQL skills will allow you to work with and store this data. In third place, R is one of the most used language for statistical computing and analisys. We can also see that a lot of people use C\/C++\/Java","0491f9ef":"**What tools to learn as a ML begginner**\n\nMachine Learning has been a big thing lately, with numerous frameworks and libraries being used all over the world. For someone who is interested in learning about ML or started studying ML, it can get quite confusing what is actually used and is considered a useful skill to know.\n\nHere, we'll try to see the most used tools on this field. Since Kaggle is a well known website among people who work with and love Machine Learning, this 2018 survey is a good way to see whats still relevant to know about. This way, someone who wants to start learning and is a little overwhelmed by all these names and programs can get an idea of whats currently dominating the industry and who's using it.
