Having a different strategy is especially essential because at least one of these 3 main OS is mobile. If the site doesn't have a good mobile version, that's a good point where to start !\n\n- Have a program to make money with non buying and returning visitors :\n\n  1) Returning visitors not buying anything are the main group on the site, so they are also the main cost. Finding a way to make money with them could be very lucrative ! Amazon prime is certainly the best example for such a program\n\n- Organizing \"special week ends\" :\n\n  1) Because the bulk of the revenues is generated during the week,it is certainly possible to incentivise customers to come back the week end,giving an additional reason to buy at this time is crucial because customers have time to compare with othe sites\n\n","cfa92121":"### Check data","aef84d93":"# Business Data Science - Online shoppers intentions","6ae1da8d":"- ### Operational side: to improve page conversion rate\n\n***Conclusion:***\n\n- **Is page value we set before reasonable ?** \n   \n  Basically Bounce Rate and Exit Rate decline when Page Value increases, which is in line with commen sense: customers who finally buy things are less likely to bounce between pages(with clearer purchase path); and of course don't exit website before payment. These group of people mainly have an average page value between [0,100].\n  \n  However, there are a wide range of customers who didn't buy anything (Revenue = False), however, show an average page value between [0,75], . This means their page value consists of only goal page values (no transaction value), i.e. some of the ideal purchase paths and goal pages we set before are not accurate, thus customers who clicked these pages didn't purchase as we expected.\n  \n- **In which range Bounce\/Exit Rates could facilitate purchase behavior?**\n  \n  We could easily see a positive linear relationship between Exit Rate and Bounce Rate, i.e. customers who visit pages of higher average bounce rates are more likely to exit the website.\n  \n  To be precise, for customers who finally placed the order, most of them visited pages of bounce rate and exit rate between [0,0.075]\n  \n- **How does number of pages visited impact purchase behavior? And in which range duration on page could facilitate purchase behavior?**\n\n  Generally speaking, both product related and administrative pages (or page duration) have a range in which they could improve purchase intention; while  informational pages have little impact.\n  \n  For customers who placed the order, the approximate range of number of product related pages they visited is [15,45], the median around 30, meanwhile, the approximate range of duration on this type of page is [500,1500]s, the median around 900s; when it comes to administrative pages, the four figures are [0,5],2.5, [0,100]s,40s.\n  \n  However, considering some customers who didn't buy anything might also visited similar number of pages and stay same duration time, we finally target a even smaller group of people -- who seem to be 100% sure will purchase: they mainly visited approximately [30,45] product related pages and have a duration time between [1000,1500]s. In fact, this group of people will help us design new purchasing paths to guide customers visit proper number of pages and stay reasonable time on our website.\n\n\n\n***Strategy:***\n- We should re-design the purchase paths through: \n\n    1) assigning new page values, \n\n    2) naming new goal pages, \n\n    3) improving UI to guide customer to high value pages etc. \n> As we are in lack of more precise information on specific webpages, we don't give our assumputions here.","4708f016":"- ### Marketing side: to improve traffic volume\n\n***Conclusion and Strategy :***\n\n* First, it is obvious that traffic types 1 to 4 are doing all the heavy lifting. We cannot explain exactly why here because we don't have the necessary data, but if there is some investment in advertising that needs to be made, it would be on the platform corresponding to these traffic types\n\n* It is also clear that traffic type depends a lot on the time dimension : some months show way stronger use of some types, the same would be true fo weekends and special days, again, this raises more questions than it answers : we need more data !\n\n* When looking at returning vs new visitors by traffic type, we cannot not notice that new visitors mainly use the traffic type #2, so, even if returning visitors make the most of the revenues, they onece were new visitors, traffic type #2 is where the most investment is needed !","42b93def":"## 0.
