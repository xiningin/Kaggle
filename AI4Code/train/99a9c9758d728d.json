The species list includes very common species like the House Sparrow (houspa), Blue Jay (blujay), or Song Sparrow (sonspa). This is not a bad selection to start experimenting.\n\n# 3. Extract training samples\n\nWe need to define a function that extracts spectrograms for a given audio file. This function needs to load a file with Librosa (we only use the first 15 seconds in this tutorial), extract mel spectrograms and save each spectrogram as PNG image in a working directory for later access.","58c18b3e":"Here we go, everything is in place, let's train a model. We'll use 20% of our training data for validation and we'll stop after 25 epochs.","67a06990":"# Model training\n\nIn this notebook, we will train our first model and apply this model to a soundscape. We will keep the amount of training samples, species and soundscapes to a minimum to keep the execution time as short as possible. Remember, this is only a sample implementation, feel free to explore your own workflow.\n\nThese are the steps that we will cover:\n\n\n* select audio files we want to use for training  \n* extract spectrograms from those files and save them in a working directory  \n* load selected samples into a large in-memory dataset  \n* build a simple beginners CNN  \n* train the model  \n* apply the model to a selected soundscape and look at the results \n\n# 1. Settings and imports\n\nLet\u2019s begin with imports and a few basic settings.","257790f1":"Nice! These are good samples. Notice how some of them only contain a fraction of a bird call? That's an issue we won't deal with in this tutorial. We will simply ignore the fact that samples might not contain any bird sounds.\n\n# 4. Load training samples\n\nFor now, our spectrograms reside in a working directory. If we want to train a model, we have to load them into memory. Yet, with potentially hundreds of thousands of extracted spectrograms, an in-memory dataset is not a good idea. But for now, loading samples from disk and combining them into a large NumPy array is fine. It\u2019s the easiest way to use these data for training with Keras.","d37a7a77":"Ok, we found a few bird species with a score above the threshold. Let's look at the results and see how well we're actually doing.","b2264afc":"Callbacks make our life easier, the three that we're adding will take care of saving the best checkpoint, they will reduce the learning rate whenever the training process stalls, and they will stop the training if the model is overfitting.","534de539":"Not too bad, we got into the 60s of our validation accuracy. But remember, we're training on focal recordings and validate on focal recordings. The scores might not tell us much about how well we will perform on soundscape data.\n\nWe'll have to check ourselves, luckily, we have some validation soundscapes.\n\n# 6. Soundscape analysis\n\nIn this tutorial, we will simply pick a soundscape from the training data, but the overall process can easily be automated and then applied to all soundscape files. And again, we have to load a file with Librosa, extract spectrograms for 5-second chunks, pass each chunk through the model and eventually assign a label to the 5-second audio chunk.\n\nLet's use a soundscape that actually contains some of the species that we trained our model for. The file \"28933_SSW_20170408.ogg\" seems to contain a lot of Song Sparrow (sonspa) vocalizations, let's try this one then.","3df0dd00":"# 2. Data preparation\n\nThe training data for this competition contains tens of thousands of audio files for 397 species. That\u2019s way too much for this tutorial, so we will limit our species selection to species that have at least 200 recordings with a rating of 4 or better.","446696ba":"Ok, we have 1,500 audio files that cover 27 species, let's extract spectrograms (this might take a while).","17435bfe":"# 5. Build a simple model\n\nAlright, our dataset is ready, now we need to define a model architecture. In this tutorial, we\u2019ll use a very simplistic, AlexNet-like design with four convolutional layers and three dense layers. It might make sense to choose an off-the-shelve TF model that was pre-trained on audio data, but we would need to adjust the inputs (i.e., the resolution of our spectrograms) to fit the external model. So we keep it simple and build our own model.","9305968c":"Ok, that's not too bad. We actually got some of these Song Sparrow (sonspa) vocalizations. Well, and we missed others... We also didn't detect the Northern Cardinal (norcar) and Red-winged Blackbird (rewbla) even though we had them in our training data.\n\nThis is a good example for the difficulties we're facing when analyzing soundscapes. Focal recordings as training data can be misleading and soundscapes have much higher noise levels (and also contain very faint bird calls).\n\nNow it's your turn to find better strategies to cope with this shift in acoustic domains. Please don't hesitate to leave a comment or start a new forum thread if you have any questions.","5ea4b755":"This is not a huge CNN, it only has ~200,000 parameters.

That's roughly 150 for each species which is not too bad.\n\nLet's make sure the spectrograms look right and show the first 12."}}
