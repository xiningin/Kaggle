It's easy to have too much data and get overwhelmed, like we were when we look at all the vehicle thefts.\n\nNext time I'm in Vancouver at 6pm I'll try to remember not to park in the Victoria Fraserview, Kitsilano or Gransview-Woodland areas.","241ab6fc":"This map has a little too much data, so let's find when most of the vehicles are stolen","34ffcbcd":"<h1>Introduction<\/h1>\nMy goal for this study was to show the data on a geographical map of Vancouver. Specifically I would like to look at:\n\n* where are car theft happening overall ?\n* when are car theft happening most often ?\n* when and where would be the worst place to park? (Good info if you're trying to get ride of your car)\n\n<h3>Getting Started<\/h3>\nAs a first step we need to remove all the rows without long\/lat information.\n\nFor this study I'll only use the latest data (2017). As a first pass let's do a heat map for all vehicle thefts in 2017.\n","27b91e7d":"So it look like most of the vehicle thefts happend at 6pm. Now let's do a map to look at where not to park your car at 6pm."}}
