A **countplot** is an easy way to visualize this type of categorical data. A table of counts and percentages can also be generated to see the numbers that go into the plot. We do this by defining a function to create the countplot and generate the table at the same time. \n   \n**Note:** When the same snippet of code is written more than once, it is time to define a function. This is a more elegant solution than duplicating code and reduces errors in copying and pasting as well.

Initially, it contains the categories \"Male\" and \"Female\", specifying the sex of the passenger. We would like to encode these categories as numbers instead of letters so we apply the pandas method `.get_dummies()` onto the Sex column. After applying the `.get_dummies()` method, we see two new columns Sex_female and Sex_male, and the original Sex column has disappeared. \n\nIn the Sex_male column, if the passenger is male, then he is encoded as 1 and if not she is encoded as 0. The same thing is repeated for the Sex_female column. However, this repetition is undesirable to have because all the required information is already captured within one column. Either keep the Sex_male column and drop the Sex_female, or keep the Sex_female and drop the Sex_male.","4164be7e":"The first plot (1,1) indicates that nearly 70% of passengers had no siblings\/spouses with them, and the rest had one or more. The second plot (1,2) counts the survived number of passengers, and the third plot (2,1) puts those counts as a fraction. Passengers having one or two sibling\/spouse had a higher survival rate (around 55%) than those with no sibling\/spouse (35%). The last plot (2,2) is the most interesting, since we can make some conjectures based on the Sex of the passenger and whether they had a spouse or not.\n   \nIn the last plot, using the expectation of 75% female survival and 20% male survival rates, we can see that 0 and 2 SibSp categories roughly align with this benchmark. The sample size for 3 or more SibSp is too small, so these categories need not adhere to the expection. The interesting bit is the higher than expected 30% survival rate for male passengers with 1 SibSp. This could occur, for instance, when both the man and his wife are 1st class passengers on the trip and they board the lifeboats together.","e5b67098":"So far, we have studied 4\/7 categorical columns (the remaining three are Name, Ticket, and Cabin, which are textual and alphanumeric data), so we now turn towards numerical data (SibSp and Parch, excluding the continuous variables Age and Fare) to see their distribution of values. \n  \nThe column SibSp specifies the number of siblings\/spouses on board the Titanic that are related to the passenger.

In both cases, the ratio of Survived to Not Survived and Female to Male is roughly similar for the Cherbourg and Queenstown ports but markedly different for Southampton. There were more than twice as many males compared to females from Southampton, which explains why the overall survival rate for Southampton is much lower, at around 34%.\n    \nIn the last barplot (2, 2), survival rates for females are around the expected 75% except for Cherbourg, where female survival rate is around 85%. For males, the unexpected survival rates are at 30% for Cherbourg and about 5% for Queenstown, compared to the expected 20%. Perhaps these anomalies can be explained by looking at column splits based on Pclass:","c3402d29":"These are the predictions of survival made by the algorithm for each of the 418 passengers in the test dataset. The values are within a numerical array, so we need to put them into a data series (one column of a data frame) before attaching it to the PassengerId column:","63454482":"A simple and easily interpretable model to use would be **logistic regression**. Import the LogisticRegression library:","878060d4":"Train model on X_train and y_train using the method `.fit()`:","c663d277":"This barplot brings us more insights: 1st and 2nd Class females were twice as likely to survive than 3rd Class females (or males of any class), and the least likeliest passengers to survive are 2nd and 3rd Class males. \n \n**Note:** When interpreting barplots showing fractional numbers\/probabilities such as this, it should be kept in mind that counts and probabilities are different from each other. For instance, consider a hypothetical case in which there are 100 females and 1000 males. The expected survival rates are 75% for females and 20% for males, indicating that about 75 females and 200 males survived. A higher count of males survived even though the survival percentage for females is higher.","2cdcb583":"We now have 5 numerical columns and one categorical column (Sex). However, we need to realize that Pclass is an ordinal categorical variable, with 1st class having a higher status than 2nd class, and so on. These categorical varibales need to be changed into numerics because the machine learning algorithm can only understand numbers.\n\nIn the case of Pclass, the classes are already represented as numbers but in the reverse order. 3rd class is represented as 3 even though it signifies a lower status than 1st class, which is represented as 1. We could reverse the order and make 3rd class 1 and 1st class 3 but it would be misleading and confusing to interpret. \n\nRepresenting ordinal categorical variables as integers depending on the order of importance assigned to them is known as **label encoding**. Label encoding can also be used for nominal variables which has no inherent order, for example, Red, Green, Blue being encoded as 1, 2, 3. The disadvantage is that the machine learning algorithm would misinterpret Blue to have a higher quantitative weight than Red even though they are supposed to be equally important.\n\nTherefore, we use **one-hot encoding** for Pclass and Sex. One-hot encoding separates categories into binary values of 0 and 1. This is best explained through writing Python code:","49f2c9ec":"Additionally, PassengerId, Name, Ticket and Embarked are going to be irrelevant for our simple analysis, so we drop those as well.","0a3b772b":"The barplot indicates above 60% survival rate for 1st Class passengers, below 50% for 2nd Classes and only about 25% for 3rd Classes, even though they were the majority. This is a non-rigorous, informal study using **data visualization** tools to confirm that survival rate is linked to passenger class.\n  \n**Note:** Care must be taken to interpret the barplot because the sum of percentages do not add up to 100%. The percentages only indicate the percentage of survivors for each passenger class.","490a6b43":"**Encode:**","53dad24c":"At this stage, the train dataset, with all its numerical columns, is ready to use as input for the ML algorithm. However, we still need to deal with the test dataset, which will be done in this section.\n\n**Read:**","3da4c1fc":"## Mode Imputation\n\nThe same procedure can be followed for mode imputation. We simply use the `.mode()` method to get the mode of the Embarked column and replace the missing values with the mode.","d533d7e4":"Only 3 columns out of 12 contain missing data. The Age column contains about 20% missing data, which can be dealt with using a technique called **imputation**, which means replacing the missing values with a known value, such as the mean, median or mode. Age is quantitative, so either mean or median imputation can be done. Embarked is a categorical variable, so mode imputation can be done. \n \nAs for the Cabin variable containing 77% missing data, we can simply delete the column. More sophisticated methods would be to see how Cabin numbers relate to the Survived or Pclass column and deal with it accordingly. For example, some of the cabins could be located near where the lifeboats are stored, so passengers residing in those cabins could have a higher chance of survival. \n \nCabin, Ticket and Name are alphanumeric variables, so extracting the important numbers or letters from them require more involved analysis, which will not be done in this Beginner's Analysis.","3b2eeecd":"Here, we have only imported the library. We still need to create an object\/function that can be used on the dataset. This is called **instantiation**, or creating an instance of the LogisticRegression function. Create an instance:","b54fdad9":"`axis=1` specifies that a column is being dropped. If we want to drop rows, we specify `axis=0`.","e8e647e9":"Make predictions on X_test using the method `.predict()`:","56e1cd31":"Again, similar to the SibSp column, passengers with no parents\/children were less likely to survive (around 35% as seen from the third plot (2,1)) than those with one or two parents\/children (around 55%). From the last plot (2,2), males with one or two parents\/children also had a higher survival rate (30%) compared to those with no parents\/children.","cba21e6e":"Only around 40% of people survived. Is there a way to find out what kinds of people are more likely to survive? Are there special features shared by survivors? To answer these questions, we need to look at the other columns and their relationships to the Survived column.\n  \nThe PassengerId column is just another index column on top of the original index starting from 0, so it cannot influence a passenger's survival. \n  \nObserve the Pclass column. There are three categories in this column: 1st Class, 2nd Class and 3rd Class passengers represented by the numbers 1, 2 and 3, respectively. We would expect 1st Class passengers to be given priority in boarding the ship and perhaps priority in being saved in the lifeboats. Hence, we could expect a higher survival rate of 1st Class passengers compared to 2nd or 3rd Class. \n  \nWe use `count_n_plot` to explore the number of passengers that survived in each class (by splitting the Pclass column based on the Survived column):","23d6a5be":"Although 65% of passengers were male (seen from the leftmost countplot), the majority of females survived, at a survival rate of 75% (from the barplot on the right) compared to the male survival rate at 20%. This confirms another link to the target column Survived: females were more likely to survive than males. To go even further, we can split the Sex columns based on Pclass by specifying the `barsplit` argument in `count_n_plot`:","39c1721b":"# Predictive Analysis\n\nIn order to make predictions about the survival rate, we first need to separate the train dataset into independent variables (all the columns except Survived) and the dependent variable (the target column Survived). The test dataset does not contain the Survived column because we are supposed to predict it. Next, we choose a machine learning algorithm and train it using the train dataset. Finally, we ask it to make predictions for the target column using the test dataset. \n\nSeparate train dataset into independent and dependent variables:","75395c56":"The code `titanic_train['Age'].isnull()` produces a list of True and False boolean values. If the Age value is missing, then the boolean is True, and vice versa. This boolean list is used as **conditional selection** to produce a subset of the dataset in which only passengers with missing Age data are shown. ","285ff2ef":"We can further differentiate the variables into nominal, ordinal, discrete and continuous data types. The method `.nunique()` can be used to count the number of unique values\/levels within in each variable, which will give us a rough idea of which variable belongs to which data type.","d94b9ed2":"An easy way to impute missing values is by using the `.replace()` method. First, we calculate the mean Age of the passengers using the available non-missing data (rounding it off to one decimal place):","a5d2cd16":"We can count 12 features describing each person on board the Titanic. Our **target** feature (also known as the **independent variable**) is the Survived column, which is 1 if the person survived and 0 if not. In this case, it is easy to infer that the Survived column only contains numerical 1's and 0's because the Kaggle description said so. For other features (or **dependent variables**) however, it may not be possible to deduce the type of data contained at first glance.  For instance, the Ticket column contains a mixture of letters and numbers for some rows but other rows contain only numbers. In order to quickly generate a table of data types contained within each column, we use the `.info()` method.","6ac00da2":"In the Pclass column, we had 3 categories: first, second and third class passengers. One-hot encoding for 3 categories works like this: if the passenger is in 1st class, `Pclass_1 = 1` and `Pclass_2 = Pclass_3 = 0`. If the passenger is in 2nd class, `Pclass_2 = 1` and `Pclass_1 = Pclass_3 = 0`, and similarly for 3rd class passengers. \n\nIn this case, all the information is captured in two columns (the irrelevant column was already dropped by specifying the `drop_first=True` argument in the previous line of code). Likewise, if we have 4 categories in a column, we create 3 dummies and drop one, and so on. ","c032da8d":"Another useful method for exploration is the `.value_counts()` method, which counts the number of occurrences for each unique category within a column. Consider the code below as an example:","183822a2":"In the first line, Python still thinks the mode-aggregated object is a DataSeries (one column of a DataFrame), so we need to select the string inside the DataSeries, hence the `[0]`.","c0f61872":"Indeed, 50% of passengers who embarked from Cherbourg were in first class, whereas 72\/77 passengers from Queenstown were in third class, thus explaining the slight deviation from the expected 20% survival rate.","a4c1a1f5":"# Exploratory Data Analysis\n  \nRefer to the data again:","ccff2ed2":"A quick way to check out the contents of a data frame is by calling the first 5 rows using the `.head()` method without specifying the argument within brackets.
