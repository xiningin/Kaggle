I never thought that trigger would be fired so fast after that .The data of death figures might be higher given a lot of cases went unreported. while some estimate it may be 4 times others estimate like this news report suggests https:\/\/www.livemint.com\/news\/india\/indias-covid-19-deaths-10-times-higher-than-reported-study-11626767976960.html) it may be 10 times .

This means over 120 million Indians have not shown up for their second dose which FYI is being at all thousands of Govt places for FREE.Paid Vaccination only take place in Private Hospitals which is miniscle in comparison . Why because cases had decreased and also misinformation regarding vaccines cannot be ignored. I prayed to god new door to door vaccination programme launced by the Govt Of India reaches all adults with both doses before it takes a deadly third turn.\n\nI wish all fellow DataNerds and everybody around the world a healthy life.

We can see that the Cases reported were nearly 1000+ by march 16th in US, when state of Emergency was issued in final states , but Full restrictions might have taken upto April 2020 by which reported case had increased to nearly 30K .(Source:https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/U.S._state_and_local_government_responses_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic)\n    * Contrast US Restriction with India's decisive March 24th Full Scale Lockdown, when reported cases was within hundreds or Less . This Lockdown slowed the spread of the disease.(Source :https:\/\/cfo.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/pm-narendra-modi-announces-lockdown-of-india-for-21-days\/74797779)\n    * But something is amiss, Why did it increase during September in India even though there was a Lockdown event?\n    * See even though community spread was there during the hard Lockdown, it had slowed the daily infection rate to a few thousands within 10k which might seem high  considering pure numbers, but in reallity are extremely low considering total population of India (1.4 bn).\n    * Then Started a series of easing of restrictions dubbed `Unlock India` that started June with `Unlock 1.0 (1\u201330 June),Unlock 2.0 (1\u201331 July),Unlock 3.0 (1\u201331 August),Unlock 4.0 (1\u201330 September),Unlock 5.0 (1\u201331 October)and finally Unlock 6.0 (1\u201330 November)` (Sources:https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/COVID-19_lockdown_in_India#Unlock_1.0_(1%E2%80%9330_June))\n    * Now as lockdown restrictions started, the numbers began to rise peaking during September 2020, But then falling steadly to pre Unlock levels by December. This article(https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/india\/why-are-coronavirus-cases-falling-in-india\/articleshow\/80705782.cms) in Times of India had said :`Scientists around the world have proposed numerous theories to explain this unprecedented fall in Covid-19 cases in India. However, none has been able to give a definite answer. Experts said that without conclusive data, it was impossible to say why India's figures had fallen so dramatically.` \n    * So we can just Speculate why it decreased . So in my opinion by just looking at the data and graph and news articles of US and India,that we had temporarily slowed the Covid-19 and the effects of lockdown  created way forward to lower transmission or infection rates because of alert audience till then . \n    * However , it was fun while it lasted, because all that changed in recent days with relaxed and `WHATEVER` attitude (https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/india\/half-of-india-isnt-wearing-masks-and-the-other-half-is-wearing-them-wrong\/articleshow\/81983995.cms#:~:text=But%20that's%20not%20what%20the,aren't%20doing%20it%20properly.) by both the govt and citizens even though health experts and Official COVID Handle repeatedly reiterated that we wont be able to dip this spread till we vaccinated at least 60 % of the population. It started Spiraling out of control by April 2021. Today as we speak the daily infection breached 350 K which is still not as high in absolute per population terms in comparision to US or Brazil, but is alarming to say the least as India's Per Capita wealth a meagre USD 6,700 (2019 est.) compared to USD 62,530 (2019 est.) in US(https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/the-world-factbook\/field\/real-gdp-per-capita\/).Therefore based on our econcomy our healthcare system which had also became somewhat complacent was not ready to handle this . \n    * Now Lets Take a Look back Second Wave and Third wave ,what happened in US Preceding to that:\n        -Note that Unlike India in initial lockdown,IN US , the Local State Authority had done lockdowns or restrictions as per their discretion . Also Politics in USA played a Significant Part in that. As there was a greater political divide between citizens . This created chaos.\n        -In June before resurgence occurred a lot of states had eased some or more restrictions or were going to reopen which further added to the increase quite possibly.(https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-health-coronavirus-usa\/reopenings-stall-as-u-s-records-nearly-50000-cases-of-covid-19-in-single-day-idUSKBN2426LN) \n         - Also the Second wave could be a By Product of Close quarter Nationwide Protests of Unarmed Black Man : George Floyd Murder that start in May 26 .(https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/may\/31\/fears-grow-of-surge-in-us-coronavirus-cases-from-george-floyd-protests). Even though masks were used in the protest,they lacked social distancing, which was why  Dr Fauci was concerned:(https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/administration\/502001-fauci-underscores-concerns-about-protests-spreading-coronavirus)\n         - Election Campaigns and rallys also attributed to this significant resurgence. For example after 30-day period 2020 Trump Tulsa rally ,the rate of new COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma more than tripled, to 513 cases per day.\n         -2nd wave decreased some what, however holding steady and increased exponentially by NOV 2020 .This can be attributed to US elections.\n    * Finally Lets Talk about the fall in cases in United States :\n      -Till Today(27 April 2021) about 140 Million(49%) people of United States were administered at least one dose and Nearly 95+(29.2) million have fully Vaccinated(two Dose or single dose of Johnson and Johnson)(As per Google Data).(https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=vaccine+tracker+covid&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN856IN856&oq=vaccine&aqs=chrome.2.69i59l5j69i60l3.4471j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)\n      -That means Vaccine has somewhat decreased the spread although it is far From over.\n     * So what about India, well India has administered nearly 140 MILLION Total doses with 12 million peole getting 1st dose and 2.38 million fully vaccinated. While this is impressive number again by sheer volume it is less than 2% percent by total Population of India which is Alarming. \n     * At Current rate `At current rate of 2.2mn doses per day, India can only cover 30% population by end-2021`\nhttps:\/\/www.firstpost.com\/india\/covid-19-vaccine-data-analysis-at-current-rate-of-2-2mn-doses-per-day-india-can-only-cover-30-population-by-end-2021-9562811.html. \n     * Although the Current rate will increase by June because both Production in The world largest Vaccine Producer(https:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/business\/indias-reputation-as-the-worlds-vaccine-hub-was-surprisingly-under-the-wraps-6335621.html) which ironically is India , has Vowed to Increased by Multifold as critical raw materials those were with held by US were just released.(https:\/\/www.cnbctv18.com\/healthcare\/us-president-biden-extends-india-help-in-covid-19-fight-but-after-criticism-9069131.htm) and because the government has allowed vaccination for all by registration starting 1st May 2021 it will still be a long time.\n     \n     \n# Now lets Add a New variable CFR=Case Fatality Rate to the Mix.\n As per this artcle: https:\/\/science.thewire.in\/the-sciences\/covid-19-pandemic-case-fatality-rate-calculation\/\n The three estimates of CFR \n i. \u2018First\u2019 way to measure: D(May 4)\/C(May 4) = 3.42%\n\nii.

The alternative way: D(May 4)\/C(April 27) = 5.14%\n\nWe will take the first one as it more simpler and total approach for a broader understanding.\nAlthough do note:\n`the actual CFR of COVID-19 could be lower. To calculate the CFR, we need to know how many people were infected \u2013 and this figure hasn\u2019t been easy to pin down with the novel coronavirus.
