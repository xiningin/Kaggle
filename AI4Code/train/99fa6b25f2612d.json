A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA). which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.

According to the United States Geological Survey, rain water seeps into the ground in a process called infiltration. Some of the water seeps deep beneath the top layers of soil where it fills up the space between subsurface rocks--it becomes ground water, also called the water table. Less than 2 percent of the earth's water is ground water, but it provides 30 percent of our fresh water. Without rain water's continued replenishment of the water table, potable water would become scarcer than it already is. [[source]](https:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/article\/179964-importance-of-rain-water\/)<br\/><br\/>\nThe Climate of India comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography, making generalisations difficult. Based on the K\u00f6ppen system, India hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. Many regions have starkly different microclimates. The country's meteorological department follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments: winter (December, January and February), summer (March, April and May), a monsoon rainy season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to November).
