Most of this pressure is due to work done by the heart by pumping blood through the circulatory system. \n\nBlood pressure is recorded as two numbers:\n\n* **Systolic blood pressure (the first number)** \u2013 indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats.\n* **Diastolic blood pressure (the second number)** \u2013 indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls while the heart is resting between beats.\n\nAccording to American Heart Association\n\n![blood_pressure](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/bwzm4sq5\/blood.jpg)\n\nFor **Systolic blood pressure** , the range should be **120 - 180 mm**.\n\nFor **Diastolic blood pressure** , the range should be **80 - 120 mm**.\n\nA study published by doctors in NCBI NLM recorded a maximum blood pressure of 370\/360 mm Hg.
