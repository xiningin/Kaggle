We hope you enjoy and learn as much as we did prepairing this competition.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the competition, it's required to predict the `Severity` of a car crash given info about the crash, e.g., location.\n\nThis is the getting started notebook. Things are kept simple so that it's easier to understand the steps and modify it.\n\nFeel free to `Fork` this notebook and share it with your modifications **OR** use it to create your submissions.\n\n### Prerequisites\nYou should know how to use python and a little bit of Machine Learning. You can apply the techniques you learned in the training program and submit the new solutions! \n\n### Checklist\nYou can participate in this competition the way you perefer. However, I recommend following these steps if this is your first time joining a competition on Kaggle.\n\n* Fork this notebook and run the cells in order.\n* Submit this solution.\n* Make changes to the data processing step as you see fit.\n* Submit the new solutions.\n\n*You can submit up to 5 submissions per day. You can select only one of the submission you make to be considered in the final ranking.*\n\n\nDon't hesitate to leave a comment or contact me if you have any question!","c6d69c06":"#### Check if the day of the accident was holiday or not","1c0e1978":"## Exploratory Data Analysis\nIn this step, one should load the data and analyze it.

Typically the dataset is split into 3 subsets, namely, the training, validation and test sets. In our case, the test set is already predefined. So we'll split the \"training\" set into training and validation sets with 0.8:0.2 ratio. \n\n*Note: a good way to generate reproducible results is to set the seed to the algorithms that depends on randomization. This is done with the argument `random_state` in the following command* ","7bbbfff0":"Now we're ready to generate the submission file.

Wait for the saved notebook to finish running the go to the saved notebook.\n4.
