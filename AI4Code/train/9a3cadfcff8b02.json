An article by BBC addresses this problem too - https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-35994601. In India, there is much more public debates around suicides by farmers than among housewives. The Agriculture sector in India is highly volatile because more than 60% of the land under cultivation is dependent on rainfall as its primary source of irrigation. Due to global warming the rainfall patterns are changing which are putting our farmers in deep distress leading to high suicide rates among them.","4fa2f997":"So we were wrong to generalise that agricultural suicides are directly proportional to rainfall patterns. The picture is not that simple. Maybe other factors such as ease of access to financial services(loans etc), medical services etc also play a role.\n\ngetting back to suicides among professionals - ","3b881db3":"I'll not be analysing further into the means of suicide as they hold less value. What is more important is to analyse the causes.","1c535fa9":"The thing that i can infer is that suicide rates are much less in students who had graduated and beyond. There is much more suicide rates among students who were still in school. Can we infer that in India the pressure a students faces is much more in school than in college. Maybe the hype around board exams and college entrance exams might be the reason for it!","77bfe11f":"Among students, suicides are much higher among boys as compared to girls. Maybe its due to the patriarchal nature of the Indian society that more is expected from a boy because he is expected to head the family and is supposed to be the sole and main financial contributor.","371b973a":"Lets just analyse if rainfall patterns influence suicides among farmers in India - ","e1e2003b":"The major causes of suicides in India are Family Problems, Prolonged and Mental Illnesses, Drug Abuse and Love Affairs -  all of which could be attended to by proper counselling. The Indian State needs to evolve institutions which can spread awareness about these issues and make psychologists accessable to anyone who is dealing with such issues.","83b36329":"The absolute suicide numbers might not be the correct measure to measure a state's ranking as they vary quite a lot in terms of population. Hence use the population data and then try to rank states.","f7565fe0":"As was the case with students, in professional front too, suicides are much more among men than women. But suicides among housewives(females) are almost double than among any other professional activity.","76973fca":"Lets break down the above chart gender wise - "}}
