When a tweet comes in, it will vectorize it by counting the number of occurrences of each word in our vocabulary.\n\nFor example, we have this two tweets: \"I learned a lot today\" and \"hahaha I got you\".\n\n|tweet \/ words| I | learned | a | lot | today | hahaha | got | you |\n|-----|---|---------|---|-----|-------|--------|-----|-----|\n| first | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| second | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nWe first extract the words present in the two tweets, then for each tweet we count the occurrences of each word in our vocabulary.\n\nThis is the simplest form of the Bag of Words algorithm, however, there is other variants, we are gonna use the TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) variant.
