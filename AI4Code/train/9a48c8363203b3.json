When it comes to what counts as a bookable offense, leading to yellow cards, one has a point, but red cards are also not being handed out more frequently now than twenty years ago. The amount of fouls given has also been decreasing.","d361bfff":"# Fourth analysis: Can corners predict goals or results?","0882bb25":"There is a common complaint that the sport has 'gone soft' referring to the fact that 'lighter' fouls are punished more harshly than before. We can't analyze severity of fouls themselves, but we can see if more fouls have been given over time (which would suggest more incidents are being called fouls), and if more yellow-or-red cards are being given relative to the amount of fouls a team makes. We're going to look at this by season, rather than individual games.","22110918":"2021 was a year of the lowest home advantage in general, due to a lack of crowds caused by the COVID pandemic; this is represented in the data by the lowest AverageHomePoints of any of the seasons we are examining. For the remainder of this analysis, we shall drop that row, as well as any refs with under 10 games for the remaining period, and calculate the average over the entire period for teams in general and for specific referees.","0bc8a6d1":"Let's do an example analysis of just the most recent season, 2020-21","06b9265b":"# Second analysis: Are some refs disproportionally biased by home crowds?","f13f37ca":"Intuitively, fouls tend to come from defensive actions. More fouls would imply more defending. More defending would imply the opposition are getting more chances, and thus goals. Let's look for a correlation.","38e42321":"We see here that home teams score less the more an away team fouls them, while away teams score more the more fouls a home team makes. The same trends persist for shots. Both, however, score\/shoot less as they themselves make more fouls.","ca3d948d":"# Third Analysis: How has shot conversion changed over time?","ac1621f8":"So, in conclusion: corners have a strong direct relationship with shots taken, both in total for the game and for each team. They have a clear relationship with goals as well, when looking at specific teams, but not at the overall game (that is, looking at away goals and away corners, not total goals and total corners). There isn't a strong relationship between final results and corners, however.","691b4fba":"# Fifth analysis: How have bookings-per-foul changed over time?","e9da8166":"Generally, teams win corners from attacking moves. Teams tend to win corners when they are on the front foot. So let's see if there are patterns we can find with them. Do teams with more corners tend to win? Do they tend to score more goals? Do they tend to have more shots? Intuitively, one would think there's some relationship here.","df24a02f":"Trends over the past 20 seasons suggest shots are less likely to be goals, but over the past 7 seasons, shots are becoming more accurate, and both shots in general and shots on target are becoming more likely to result in goals, suggesting either an improvement in strikers or a decline in the abilities of defenders and goalkeepers. The reduced volume of total shots over the more recent period, in conjunction with this, implies forwards are taking shots less frequently but more accurately. This suggests to me that players are not being as risky with their efforts over the past few years; they are preferring to wait for better chances before taking their shots."}}
