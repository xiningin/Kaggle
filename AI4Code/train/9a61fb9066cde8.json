Below mentioned is the simple explainations of them:\n\n**1) Support:**\nIt is calculated to check how much popular a given item is. It is measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. For example, there are 100 people who bought something from grocery store today, amoung those 100 people, there are 10 people who bought bananas. Hence, the support of people who bought bananas will be (10\/100 = 10%).\n\n**2) Confidence:**\nIt is calculated to check how likely if item X is purchased when item Y is purchased. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. Suppose, there are 10 people who bought apple(out of 100), and from those 10 people, 6 people also bought yogurt. Hence, the confidence of (apple -> yogurt) is: (apple -> yogurt) \/ apple [i.e. 6\/10 = 0.6].\n\n**3) Lift:**\nIt is calculated to measure how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. The formula for lift is: (lift = support (X ->Y) \/ (support(X) * support(Y)).\n\nFor further details please visit this link: https:\/\/www.kdnuggets.com\/2016\/04\/association-rules-apriori-algorithm-tutorial.html\n","a0702826":"Here, the data represents the items a customer bought at a particular time at shopping center. Dataset contains 33 columns and 9835 columns where each row represents the number of items purchased and names of items in each respective columns. \n\n**NOTE: Neglect 'NAN' in columns because if a customer bought 3 items then next 29 columns will be empty (null or NAN).**\n"}}
