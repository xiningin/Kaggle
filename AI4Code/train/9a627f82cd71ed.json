We will use SciKit Learn's [pipeline](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/pipeline.html) capabilities to store a pipeline of workflow. This will allow us to set up all the transformations that we will do to the data for future use. Let's see an example of how it works:","f1170702":"Each vector will have as many dimensions as there are unique words in the SMS corpus.  We will first use SciKit Learn's **CountVectorizer**. This model will convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.\n\nWe can imagine this as a 2-Dimensional matrix. Where the 1-dimension is the entire vocabulary (1 row per word) and the other dimension are the actual documents, in this case a column per text message. \n\nFor example:\n\n<table border = \u201c1\u201c>\n<tr>\n<th><\/th> <th>Message 1<\/th> <th>Message 2<\/th> <th>...<\/th> <th>Message N<\/th> \n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Word 1 Count<\/b><\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>...<\/td><td>0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Word 2 Count<\/b><\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>...<\/td><td>0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>...<\/b><\/td> <td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>...<\/td><td>0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Word N Count<\/b><\/td> <td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>...<\/td><td>1<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\n\nSince there are so many messages, we can expect a lot of zero counts for the presence of that word in that document.

The classification algorithms will need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the classification task. There are actually many methods to convert a corpus to a vector format. The simplest is the the [bag-of-words](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bag-of-words_model) approach, where each unique word in a text will be represented by one number.\n\n\nIn this section we'll convert the raw messages (sequence of characters) into vectors (sequences of numbers).\n\nAs a first step, let's write a function that will split a message into its individual words and return a list. We'll also remove very common words, ('the', 'a', etc..). To do this we will take advantage of the NLTK library. It's pretty much the standard library in Python for processing text and has a lot of useful features. We'll only use some of the basic ones here.\n\nLet's create a function that will process the string in the message column, then we can just use **apply()** in pandas do process all the text in the DataFrame.\n\nFirst removing punctuation. We can just take advantage of Python's built-in **string** library to get a quick list of all the possible punctuation:","1d8ce4c4":"After the counting, the term weighting and normalization can be done with [TF-IDF](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tf%E2%80%93idf), using scikit-learn's `TfidfTransformer`.\n\n____\n### So what is TF-IDF?\nTF-IDF stands for *term frequency-inverse document frequency*, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query.\n\nOne of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf-idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.\n\nTypically, the tf-idf weight is composed by two terms: the first computes the normalized Term Frequency (TF), aka. the number of times a word appears in a document, divided by the total number of words in that document; the second term is the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), computed as the logarithm of the number of the documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents where the specific term appears.\n\n**TF: Term Frequency**, which measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (aka. the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization: \n\n*TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) \/ (Total number of terms in the document).*\n\n**IDF: Inverse Document Frequency**, which measures how important a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However it is known that certain terms, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following: \n\n*IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents \/ Number of documents with term t in it).*\n\nSee below for a simple example.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider a document containing 100 words wherein the word cat appears 3 times. \n\nThe term frequency (i.e., tf) for cat is then (3 \/ 100) = 0.03. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word cat appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., idf) is calculated as log(10,000,000 \/ 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-idf weight is the product of these quantities: 0.03 * 4 = 0.12.\n____\n\nLet's go ahead and see how we can do this in SciKit Learn:","6e16c39b":"Let's do a li'l bit of EDA and visualizations before jumping to predictions.\n\nImporting some libraries for the same.","0be42c73":"There are quite a few possible metrics for evaluating model performance. Which one is the most important depends on the task and the business effects of decisions based off of the model.

Sometimes they don't work well for text-messages due to the way a lot of people tend to use abbreviations or shorthand, For example:\n    \n    'Nah dawg, IDK! Wut time u headin to da club?'\n    \nversus\n\n    'No dog, I don't know! What time are you heading to the club?'\n\nFor now we will just focus on using what we have to convert our list of words to an actual vector that SciKit-Learn can use.","ac998c19":"Currently, we have the messages as lists of tokens and now we need to convert each of those messages into a vector the SciKit Learn's algorithm models can work with.\n\nNow we'll convert each message, represented as a list of tokens (lemmas) above, into a vector that machine learning models can understand.\n\nWe'll do that in three steps using the bag-of-words model:\n\n1. Count how many times does a word occur in each message (Known as term frequency)\n\n2. Weigh the counts, so that frequent tokens get lower weight (inverse document frequency)\n\n3. Normalize the vectors to unit length, to abstract from the original text length (L2 norm)\n\nLet's begin the first step:","45a3373e":"Now we can directly pass message text data and the pipeline will do our pre-processing for us!
