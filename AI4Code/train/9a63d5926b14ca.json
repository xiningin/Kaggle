We will also take care while removing punctuation as we don't want to lose the meaning of words like (non-medical) while using the dash but we will convert it to (nonmedical) instead to keep its meaning with respect to the search algorithm","301f1d06":"Non-pharmaceutical intervention is often recommended to control the spread of pandemic[1] but it is debatable whether it is acceptable by the public or not and what barrier would we face when trying to apply concepts like social distancing, wearing masks or even convincing people to wash their hands more often to prevent the outbreak of a disease. We will discuss the details of the first results recommended by our system above.\n\nIt seems that there are many barriers that prevents some of the public to abide to some non-pharmaceutical intervention, for example: In the first paper, the study evaluates the acceptability of non-pharmaceutical interventions (as washing hands, social distancing,  as methods to fight respiratory diseases whether it was declared pandemic as H1N1 or non-pandemic. The study showed that a group of people were aware of the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions to protect themselves and the society while others saw many barriers as stigma,social interaction or even economic feasibility. to make people adopt the non-pharmaceutical interventions habits we need to increase their awareness of the importance of those methods to protect them and the ones they care for and also to break the barriers concerning them about these methods.[2]\n\nThe above discussion and results show us the importance of evaluating some Non-pharmaceutical intervention methods and try to see if they could be effective in facing influenza outbreaks, this might convince more people to follow those methods, for example: The second paper discusses the non-medical intervention in the case of Influenza outbreak in one  of the schools. Many non-pharmaceutical intervention measures were tested including the following:\n1. Closure of the school\n2. Making a field hospital to isolate influenza patients from other patients in hospitals.\n3. Public Health education campaign to increase the public awareness including instructions about:\n    ```css\n        1. Mask usage\n    2. Handshaking\n    3. Isolation of individuals \n     ```\n\nA high attack rate was found among the students maybe due to the close contact between the infected students and the rest of the students in the school although there is no mention of any obvious direct or indirect dependency between the attack rate and the close contact between the students. The study also stated that interventions could prevent the spread of the virus from the school to the outside world (other schools and places in the neighbourhood)[1]","61c7adc5":"We will need to extract the year of publication to give high priority to the papers with earlier publication data as they are more likely to be cited in newer papers and also because the might not be sufficient for today's usage (ex: papers from 1955)","06ca02cf":"It seems that the two features 'Microsoft Academic Paper ID', 'WHO #Covidence' have a very huge number of missing values as obvious from the histogram so we will remove them to regulate the scale of the histogram's frequencies","b664c300":"From the above histogram we can see there is a small number of papers with missing urls and a considerable number with missing doi and abstracts.
