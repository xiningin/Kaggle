sample process for this model would be to determine up\/down probabilities and then scale the probabilities in to bet sizes for a given day. To emulate this, the validation set will also be fit on a day by day basis. For linear and platt scaling this won't make a difference as the bet sizes are determined independently of other predictions, but ranked scaling specifically could be impacted.","05d74e4f":"Overall, despite the differences in bet sizes, we see fairly comparable performance in terms of the equity curve shape, although both Platt and Ranked scaling methods produce positive returns while the default and linear scales give disappointing results. Notably, the performance of the equity curve is defined through very significant leaps up or down. In particular, the max and minimum daily returns are around 3 standard deviations above the mean. This should motivate the need for a more sophisticated bet sizing method which tries to achieve maximum accuracy for the prediction of significant swings, while sacrificing some accuracy when movements are small.","0927a3e3":"## Introduction\n\nIn this kernel, I will be mainly looking at pre- and post-processing methods. I believe that the modeling aspects of this challenge have been exhaustively documented by other users, but any model (especially a trading model) requires adequate data preperation and postprocessing to perform well. I will first go over some data selection issues, including a brief discussion on sample selection and train\/validation splitting. I will then train a model and introduce some analytics to better examine how and why the model performs in a certain way. Finally, I will discuss some alternate validation methods that may be used to identify model false positives.\n\nMuch of the code in the first half of this kernel was adapted from other users' contributions on Kaggle. Additionally, as a disclaimer, my functions were not exhaustively tested and a few of them may be quite buggy.","c08622dc":"Finally, we can look at the feature importance of the model. The lack of predictive power among the news sentiment features is a persistent problem in this challenge, and at this stage it may be appropriate to go back and collect different data or engineer different features (note: we should always do additional feature engineering based on feature importance, rather than validation performance, to prevent a look ahead bias). Obviously for this competition additional data collection is not a possibility, and I will continue using news sentiment features out of spirit of the competition. I must stress here that many of the top kernels in this competition mentioned that they only used price history data for their features. This is not egregious from a data science perspective, but using only price history does lack theoretical foundation, see Fama (1970) \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\". Put simply, price history is easily collectible public data, and any advantage found using price history should theoretically be obtainable by many other traders as well, which is likely to eliminate any profitable opportunities. ","87f52a73":"I use a slightly tuned LightGBM model for this competition. I experimented with using ensemble models as well, but failed to see any significant change despite a far longer train time. LightGBM checks the two boxes of being generally robust, and being very fast to train allowing us to conduct repeat experiments easily.\n\nThe parameter values have been tuned based on other user kernals and my own experiments.","f237dc0b":"## Data Preprocessing","a419c4ff":"## Backtest Performance\n\nIn this section, I will show some equity curve computations. The equity curve essentially represents how a portfolio based on the model would perform. This can be more descriptive than using only a single score, for instance by examining for outliers, or stability of the returns.","f9f1e35a":"As we can see from the above, the default probabilities generally are more accurate for more extreme probabilities, which should not be surprising. The return distribution (position size * returns) is slightly positive but generally resembles a normal distribution. This is not necessarily a good sign for our model, because it shows that the majority of predictions give essentially zero returns, and there are almost as many incorrect predictions resulting in high losses as there are high return correct predictions.\n\nBoth of these effects can be explained by examining the histogram of predicted values along with the calibration curve: almost all the probability predictions are very close to 0.5, and the calibration curve indicates that the model is somewhat poorly calibrated for class prediction.\n\nAlthough having probabilities close to 0.5 may be irrelevant with some models, in this competition the confidence values are used for bet sizing, which requires some additional attention. Bet sizing is the idea that we wish to maximize the size of our correct predictions, especially when those predictions are of high returns, and minimize the size of the incorrect positions. Any trading system that cannot do this is bound to fail by attrition alone, even with a high degree of classifier accuracy.\n\nTo begin, I'll make a function that computes the competition evaluation score (roughly the Sharpe Ratio), which we can then use to assess various bet sizing techniques.","2456471e":"# Experimentation with post-processing techinques\n\nIn this section, I'll introduce a few post-processing methods to scale our predictions. Bet sizing matters as much as the accuracy of the prediction, and we ideally desire some sizing method that maximizes our correct predictions and minimizes our incorrect predictions. \n\nBelow, I'll examine the distributional properties of our predictions based on the LGB model trained above, as well as using a few different scaling methods including platt scaling, an inclusion tree, and ranked sizing, to show that bet sizing can considerably impact returns and score.","56c31678":"In this notebook, I will avoid doing much exploration of the features as this has already been poured over by other competition participants. Instead, I'll look at justifying a few filters. Firstly, I elect to remove the top\/bottom 0.01% of samples based on the `returnsOpenNextMktres10` and `returnsOpenPrevMktres10` features, just to filter significant outliers that are likely data entry errors. This is justified as the `returns` features are all in percentage terms, and removing outliers along this axis reduces the standard deviation of most of the returns series to values in the <10% range. See the descriptive output above.\n\nNext, a relevant question is whether we should limit the data universe to just the investable universe or not. In theory, it would be best to only use the same sample of securities in training data as will be used for actual prediction. However, over 40% of the sample would be excluded in this case, which could affect the accuracy of our model.\n\nIt is reasonable to expect most of the return features to have roughly similar distributions both in and out of the investable universe, as most of these features are related to returns and will be roughly symmetrical with mean = 0. The crucial piece of difference, though, is that volume for the investable universe is nearly an order of magnitutde larger on average than the volume outside of the universe. This is because the assets in the investible universe are only larger-cap US equities. Differences in volume may have a significant impact on the sensitivity of the securities to news articles, and could make the model less robust. As a result, I believe it is prudent to use only the data in the investable universe, even though this may make the model less accurate in training and validation. See the output below:","1b5db1d1":"As shown, we actually fail to reject the null of different means across all features, but there is a strong rejection of equal variance. In my opinion, I think this creates a sufficient case to consider leaving the securities outside our investing universe out of the model, but overall there probably will not be a significant difference with or without that part of the sample.\n\nMoving on the data merging, we can now combine the the news dataframe with the market dataframe. I also create a few new features here, including the intraday return `bartrend`, the intraday average, and price-volume (total number of dollars exchanged, note it is unclear to me if volume is already stated in this way or if the feature is just based on securities exchanged). \n\nAdditionally, I choose to exclude data from before 2012 for qualitative reasons. It seems likely that the 2008-9 crisis and subsequent recovery may cause the sample to behave qualitatively different. \n\nNews features are also added, including `position` which gives a number representing how early in the article the subject company is mentioned, and `coverage`, which measures the proportion of sentiment words relative to the size of the article.\n\nI previously experimented with using other conditional features, e.g. importance conditional on the news being positive, but found that decision tree models were generally unimpacted.\n\nFinally, several news features are excluded as previous tests have found very low feature importance. This is a pervasive problem in this competition, and many participants elected not to use the news data at all. In keeping with the spirit of the competition, though, I choose to retain some of the slightly more useful features.","ba832e74":"So as we can see, by using a somewhat more robust validation method, we actually can get return spreads around 5-10% in a 14 month period. This indicates that the models may be unstable, and should demonstrate the possibility of introducing false positives.","54db2c3c":"## Model Prep & Tuning\n\nFor data splitting, I drop the assetcode and time features (to avoid potential model bias by picking a successful security over and over). Additionally, I use a time based split with an 11-day embargo period, as some of the lag features are 10-days in length, to avoid any data leaking.\n\nFinally, I also store the original target variable amounts before classifying them, as these will be used later to compute train and validation scores.","87803778":"## Bet Sizing and Scaling\n\nBelow, I'll compose three different sizing functions:\n   1. Linear scaling: demean and stretch the confidence values so that most bets are sized near +-1 (the limit for this competition, leverage isn't allowed). This was very popular in this competition because its easy to implement and has seen some boost in performance.\n   2. Ranked scaling: ranks all probabilities from highest to lowest, then demeans and scales to +-1 (e.g. highest probability gets a value of 1, next highest gets a value close to 1, lowest probability gets a value of -1, etc.) \n   3. Platt scaling: uses a scaled sigmoid function, the A parameter can be tuned on the training data.","03504633":"# Additional Validation\n\nAs noted above, the overall score of the model seems to be highly dependent on the correct prediction of a few impactful days. In this final section, I will look at using a more robust cross validation method to ensure the stability of the model. Combinatorial Purged Cross Validation (CPCV) uses N partitions of the dataset in to combinations with K partitions retained for validation. Due to the combinatorial approach, the validation sets can then be used to reconstruct more than one backtesting path. The advantage of this is that we can repeatedly test a model on the same data without incurring any sort of look ahead bias, which may reduce false positives. The model also features data purging to prevent data leaking due to the lag features.\n\nThe implementation is worked out based on De Prado's *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* (2018). This particular function isn't totally tested, though, so I elected to just use the last 500,000 samples in the dataset to avoid any crashing. ","a3c72481":"As shown above, the score with the model probabilities is very poor, further showing the need to create better sizing functions.","4a9ea833":"In the code block above, we score each ranking system and examine the prediction values and calibration curve. This gives some qualitative information on the pattern of predictions. For instance, the ranked sizing will assign the bets distributed uniformly, where as linear scaling tends to concentrate bets to a small size, and Platt scaling adopts mainly extreme bet sizes. Overall, Platt scaling appears to perform the best. The return distribution achieved by using each of these scalers is shown below. As expected, the didstributions are more \"Gaussian\" shaped for scalers that give bet sizes along the entire [-1,1] range (Platt and Ranked), and these scalers tend to be more successful at achieving positing outliers.","1f8e7fa1":"# Conclusion\n\nOverall, this competition had a very exciting premise. It is difficult to produce news sentiment data, and the applications to the stock market are quite clear.\n\nIn practice, there was essentially a 0% correlation between the news sentiment features and the market price history features, feature importance corroborated that features based on news sentiment were essentially useless, and many of the top scorers report that they did not use the news sentiment data at all. So instead, we essentially have a pool of people competing to find a strategy that goes against the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis.\n\nNearly 3000 individuals or teams made submissions in this competition, if everyone submitted strategies at random then we'd still see around 150 of them outperforming at a statistically significant (5%) level, regardless of how robust to overfitting LightGBM may be. What's worse, is that the top 10 participants alone made over 500 submissions, and then picked presumably their best submission for final assessment.\n\nThankfully, this is just a competition and not legitimate academic research, but it still (in my opinion) reflects an epistemology problem in the field - overemphasis on accuracy and validation scores at all costs, and ignoring methodology to reduce false positives.\n\nI hope that my discussion of using CPCV, and examination of the model performance may inspire more rigorous investigation in to the source and stability of the performance of the features in others' models. I think areas of future research are additional feature engineering and testing the robustness of these features, as well as looking in to meta-labeling methods that may produce better bet sizing."}}
