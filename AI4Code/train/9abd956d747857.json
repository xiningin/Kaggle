OFFENSIVE LINEMEN had a higher percentage of impacts to the front than to the back of the helmet, whereas QUARTERBACKS had a higher percentage to the back than to the front of the helmet.\"\n\n\"Conclusion: The frequency of head impacts and the location on the helmet where the impacts occur are functions of PLAYER POSITION and SESSION TYPE. These data provide a basis for quantifying specific head impact exposure for studies related to understanding the biomechanics and clinical aspects of concussion injury, as well as the possible effects of repeated subconcussive impacts in football.\n\n\"Most impacts occurred to the front of the helmet for all player positions except for QUARTERBACKS , who received the most impacts to the back of the helmet.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2978006\/","a13a172f":"#Distribution of the different classes","cbb01723":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:#B8860B;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:white; padding:10px\">Finite Element Research Analysis<\/span><\/h1><br>\n\n\n\"Finite Element Research Analysis: The first group contains the research based on laboratory tests, where the helmet is subjected to either impactor or a drop impact, when researchers investigate the helmet's stress or strain distribution. The second approach is based on recreating the real-life impacts. The data are recorded during practices, games, or assumed scenarios based on observation of multiple impacts.\"\n\n\"The study proves that the POSSIBILITY of CONCUSSION VARIES between POSITIONS, for example, DEFENSIVE BACKS or WIDE RECEIVERS are exposed to a large magnitude, low-frequency impacts and LINEMAN to low magnitude, high-frequency. It was found that player position in American Football affects the magnitude of strain and strain rate across the brain, particularly in sulci. This is likely due to the effect of player position on impact kinematics.\"\n\n\"The large strain and strain rate may explain the higher concussion rate in offensive and defensive linemen positions.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11831-021-09621-7","cac7881a":"#That snippet below will take some time.

Some positions, such as WIDE RECEIVERS and RUNNING BACKS, are typified by speed and agility. Some require greater size and strength, such as seen in defensive and offensive linemen, while KICKERS, PUNTERS, and QUARTERBACKS are defined by skillset. Position may also serve as a surrogate variable for AMOUNT of TIME on the FIELD per game, career length, and training regimen.\"\n\n\"The NFL currently penalizes players for unnecessary roughness, such as using the helmet to ram another player (the \u201ccrown-of-the-helmet rule,\u201d or CHR) or hitting or launching at a defenseless player. Preliminary research on the CHR has shown a reduction in concussions but also an increase in lower extremity injuries.\"\n\n\"Injury data show patterns by position for concussion, joint injuries, and mortality. Nevertheless, some NFL studies combine positions into categories that may not align with injury data.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/2325967119829212","1a7de406":"#The hierarchy of control (adapted)\n\nThe hierarchy of control framework (left).

YEARS of PLAY, and NUMBER of SEASONS or GAMES PLAYED have also been used in analyses.

The tests are performed by a pendulum impactor with four impact locations and three velocities: 3.1, 4.9, and 6.4 m\/s. Another significant difference between the NOCSAE and STAR tests is the helmeted medium NOCSAE head custom-fit to a Hybrid III neck. The head and neck are mounted to a 5-degree-of-freedom Biokinetics slide table with a 16 kg sliding mass.\"\n\n\"The STAR value is found by multiplying the predicted on-field exposure (E) at each impact location (L) and velocity (V) by the risk of concussion (R) for that impact using the peak resultant linear acceleration (a) and rotational acceleration (\u03b1) from laboratory impacts. The STAR rating is calculated to predict concussion incidence of one player over a season.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11831-021-09621-7","bd94a098":"\"The American Football helmet history reaches back to the end of the XIX century.
