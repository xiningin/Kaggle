Let us look at how the dataframe looks like.","8b8bbd0d":"## specialisation\n\nThis column tells us about the type of MBA program the student is currently enrolled in. The value counts for each specialisation are as follows.","9c4f2a30":"As can be seen, all students scoring 80-100% in 10th grade got placed. Most students in 60-80% range did get placed while maximum students below 60% in 10th standard couldn't get placed. It shows that generally, a student who has done well in 10th grade is more likely to get placed.\n\nLet us study the same for the remaining score percentages such as 12th, UG score, MBA score and E-test score.","e813fde4":"As we can see, most students had their undergraduate degrees in commerce and management followed by science and then others. Just as we did for higher secondary subjects, we shall one hot encode the results of undergrad degrees aswell.","9b8292b7":"The graph is quite similar to what was seen for 10th board exams. Almost entire students with 80-100 % got placed. Most students in 60-80 % range also got placed. Just like in the case of 10th boards, most students could not get placed in the 0-60 % range.","f102c5d8":"## ssc_b and hsc_b\n\nHere, we are presented with the data of the 10th board. Let us check the unique entries and their counts we are presented with.","0ae22fd9":"The M\/F ratio is approximately 2. This can be interpreted as for every 1 female candiate, there are 2 male candiates sitting for placements.\n\n\nLet us check the placement percentage for each batch to understand if gender does imply better placement conversion.","74b08b8c":"## Check for feature correlations\n\nIn order to understand how strong are the features correlated to each other, let us create a heatmap of the corrplot that will let us know where the correlations are strong. From the heatmap, we can make strong arguments to remove some of the unimportant features that can be removed for our ML training and testing.","06e300a8":"As we can see, maximum students enrolled in the program were either from commerce or science background. Very few students were from Arts background.\n\nIn terms of placements, it can be seen that most students who got placed were from commerce background followed by science and then arts. This could be because both commerce and arts have great usage of mathematica and analytical skills which are quite important in finance operations. Since commerce students have economics and finance as a part of their school and UG studies, hence they are of high demand by the companies. Arts students will be a bigger asset for Human Resources department of companies as their skillsets are ideal for HR related work. Hence, students getting placed with arts background are demanded mostly for HR related roles.","e5cd85cb":"Very few students are in the 80-100 % bracket in 12th board exams. Like 10th grade, most students were in the 60-80 % range, followed by 0-60 % range.","cc786e4a":"## status\n\nThis column tells us whether the student got placed in the placement program.

This is because there will always be some dream jobs which will offer high packages. However, these packages are very few in number. Majority of the packages will be in the region of 2-4 LPA.\n\nLet us mark the mean and median salaries on the distribution curve to understand what the maximum students are earning.","d8eebd82":"The placement ratio for each of the boards is similar. Hence, we could say that 10th board of examination doesn't hold much value towards placement.","9093b535":"Hence, majority of the students were in Marketing and Finance while the remaining in Marketing and HR.\n\nWe should encode the data as \n\n**Mkt&Fin : 1\nMkt&HR : 0**","4026d403":"# 3. Data Visualisation\n\nIn this section, we shall be visualising the various features to understand if they'll have some correlation with the target feature.\n\n## Gender Vs Placed","4df51a3e":"The above graphs tell us about how the students have performed in the E-tests and what value of those have converted their offers.\n\nMost students in the class 1 category have successfully received offers from the company. It is also encouraging to see that more students in class 3 categories have also successfully converted offers.\n\nThe reason could be because E-tests are just preliminary screening tests. These tests usually don't hold much value once the student passes the test and moves ahead with further screening process that could include group discussions and interviews.\n\n\n## High school stream and degree specialisations\n\nWe are now interested to check if high school stream, UG degree specialisation or MBA degree specialisation has any particular importance with respect to placement status.","37367ced":"Unlike the case for 10th board, more students opted for state boards in their 12th examinations. The performance of state board students was better as more students from state board of 12th were placed. However, the placed\/unplaced ratio for both is nearly identical once again. Hence, 12th board is not playing a significant role once again.","1d84be30":"## SSC and HSC board\n\nLet us visualise the data for the boards of candidates who managed to get placed. This will give us an indication if board of examination has any role to play for placements.","c90406a4":"## Salary distribution\n\nLet us check how the companies are paying their freshers. We shall find the required median and mean salary of the college placements.","d5c41da7":"As we can see, maximum students fall in the range of 61-80 % followed by 0-50% and then 80-100%. Let us see how the placement status changes with the percentage range.","3c1ee82c":"## hsc_s\n\nThis column deals with the specialisation subjects taken by students when they enter 11th grade. Let us see the various entries alongwith their counts.","81be1cd8":"## Salary\n\nAs we can clearly see, the only missing values present are in the salary column. This is because the missing values are corresponding to students to did not get placed in the placement program. \n\nWe will make the assumption that the missing values are filled with 0.","ff5b52e7":"As we can see from the boxplot and violinplot, most of the candiates are within the range of 2-4 LPA. This was also established from the distribution plot.","68e090d2":"## Scores Vs Placed\n\nLet us see what is the correlation between 10th percentage of each category and placement status","cd67ebbf":"From the MBA specialisation data, it can be seen most students who were placed were in Marketing & Finance division. In Marketing & HR section, students couldn't convert as many placement opprotunities. Number of placed and unplaced students are about the same in this case.","8236e192":"Now, we can consider the data to be cleaned completely off any issues and can be safely used for visualisation and machine learning purposes. Let us take a peek at how the final dataframe looks like.","0147f7da":"As can be seen, students with commerce specialisation was highest followed by science and arts.\n\nWe shall use one-hot-encoding for this particular feature. This can be done using the pd.get_dummies function.","c912afd8":"As it can be seen, high percentage of male candidates got placed. On the other hand, comparitively lower number of female candidates got placed. This is expected as male candidates are generally higher in most brances. Hence, their chances of getting placed is normally higher as well. Let us check the male to female ratio of this branch.","71530d77":"On studying the MBA percentage data, we can see that no students crossed the 80% threshold. Hence, the data for class 1 is not available for MBA percentage. \n\nUpon studying the MBA percentage data, we can see that more students from percentage class 2 got placed as opposed to class 3. However, the difference is not as high as for board and UG percentages. Hence, we can say that MBA percentage is not as big as a factor. This could be because MBA is a branch that places much more importance on speaking skills, internships, case studies, etc rather than academic scores. Hence, the play is much more level fielded in this case. ","ea69e73a":"As we can observe, the unique entries are either Central or others. By Central, the indication must be that the board is CBSE.
