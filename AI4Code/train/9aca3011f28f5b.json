So this might be due to poor people can't afford the infrastructure required for engagement in digital learning.\n\n* Avg_black\/hispanic and avg_free_reduced_lunch have strong positive correlation.This is probably due to black and hispanic communities being financial poor compared to other communities in USA.\n\n* Avg_black_hispanic have very less engagement index\n","f2eafb01":"Avg expenditure per pupil of rural locale is highest (From *fig 26*)","7aea2630":"From *fig 9* we observe that the LC (Learning Curriculum) category has the highest percentage of products.","04edcd31":"From *fig 21* we can say that,\nThough here the graph shows that engagement of black\/hispanic people is high .\nWhen we look into the data we got to know that the data about the regions with most black\/hispanic people is less.\nSo we cannot infer that black\/hispanic students are highly engaging with e-learning products just by observing very small amount of given data ","2675099a":"Connecticut and a few other states have a lot of missing expenditure data.","21cbdff0":"---\n## **Summary of handling missing values in products data :**\n\n\n*   'Sector' and 'Primary Essential Function' column have almost all  missing  values\n\n*   Dropping the tuples having NaN values in sector attribute\n\n---","9c98ea7a":"### Q.

This is because, even before COVID-19, education technology has experienced rapid expansion and use.\n* Longer closures, uncertainty about reopening dates, a possible tightening of the academic calendar, and the resulting learning discontinuity among students forced states and educational institutions to seek alternate solutions to mitigate the various impacts. This is where digital\/online learning becomes extremely important.\n* Over the course of 2020, the engagement index improved, and the fall engagement index was higher than the spring engagement index. This is commonly acknowledged since schools, institutions, and even businesses have begun to use online platforms to learn and work from home.\n* As expected, the data clearly reveals a sharp drop in engagement index over the summer vacations.\n* There is more engagement in the beginning of the week, then it gradually decreases as the week progresses to the weekend.
