2016-10-13.  This gap appears have caused issues with the returns data.  There is a value of 240% on 2016-10-13 for the `returnsClosePrevRaw1` metric (as if the stock price jumped over night, when in fact it took 5 months to climb that high).

A quick review of Tech Data market data reveals an error in the `open` price on this date.  This error is confirmed by taking a quick look online for TECD.0's historical stock price.  The actual `open` price that day was 56.18 (not 263.8).  Using the helper functions from earlier, we can go ahead and fix the bad value, along with the returns data affected by this error.","ccf3b09a":"For example, the `open` price column has a maximum value of nearly 10,000 while the highest `close` price is only about 1578, so that's a clear red flag.  Looking at the `returnsClosePrevRaw1` column, there are assets that supposedly increased by around 4600% or lost nearly 100% their value in a single day.  Even more extreme day-over-day returns are seen in the `returnsOpenPrevRaw1` column.","1a9cf9e7":"After reviewing the data around these nine errors, each instance appeared to have the same pattern of bad data and affected rows and columns.  In each of the nine errors, I found that 32 rows of return data had at least one column that needed to be fixed.  So I created a few functions to help fix the bad data for these errors.\n\nIt isn't entirely clear to me how to properly 'fix' the `mktres` data, since this metric is calculated behind the scenes based on the overall market and an individual stock's performance.  While I haven't had much of a chance to review it, this kernel looks into what the `mktres` return actual is and suggests it is based on a stock's beta coefficient... https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/marketneutral\/eda-what-does-mktres-mean.\n\nFor now, I've opted to look at a individual stock's `raw` vs. `mktres` values for a particular return metric across a sample of days, and use a linear best fit line to approximate the `mktres` value I want to update.  Certainly far from ideal, but it's a relatively easy fix and should be good enough since the 'bad' `mktres` data I'm fixing isn't a huge part of the market training dataset anyways.  Just to show an example, here's a scatter plot showing the roughly linear relationship between `returnsClosePrevRaw1` and `returnsClosePrevMktres1` for a sample of Zynga data unaffected by the data error...","82962f30":"### Stock Splits\n---\nWhile not data errors, if you want to use the `open` and `close` columns to generate new features, you should be aware of potential issues arising from stock splits.\n\nUsing Apple's stock as an example, below is a graph of the `open` price for the `assetCode`='AAPL.O' in the `market_train_df`...","a2f7a301":"Taking another look at the HGSI.O data, we see much improved looking return data in 2009...","515ee840":"With the Oct 2016 data removed, we can see that the remaining returns data for EBR.N is in a much more reasonable range...","2a028cd8":"Finally, after the affected `PrevMktres` values were estimated, the bad `returnsOpenNextMktres10` values were updated based on the newly estimated `returnsOpenPrevMktres10` values.","7f6a3a7b":"Because the `close` and `open` prices are wrong, this has also affected many of the return columns for these stocks around the same time frame.  Both `raw` and `mktres` columns have been affected.\n\nSome of the `mktres` return data that was skewed because of the innacurate close\/open prices I wouldn't have expected.  For example, the `returnsClosePrevMktres1` column shows odd values for up to 20 days after the bad data row on 2016-07-06.  Looking at this return metric for Zynga, it has values of 249% on 2016-08-02, and -124% on 2016-08-03 which are obviously incorrect (see graph below).","78ec2ea1":"Again, at the moment I'm probably not going to leverage the market data from 2007 and 2008, so I'm not going to worry about fixing errors during that time frame.

The first record above from 2008 shows Bear Sterns stock dropping by 84%.  This jumps out as probably being accurate.

Given that the affected data is at the beginning of the available historical data for Qorvo (and some of these returns should actual just be \"N\/A\"), I've decided to delete the Qorvo data during this time frame, as opposed to trying to come up with a fix.","88be6ce2":"There are wild fluctuations for the 10-day `PrevMktres` returns metrics (including large negative values) that don't align with the price data.  It's tough to say what is causing this, but it is likely a byproduct of the large spike in price around 2009-06-20 (or perhaps the large set of missing data between March and June).  Regardless of what caused the inaccurate values, I decided to estimate the affected return data around this time.\n\nAfter some review, there also appeared to be issues with return data in Feb and Mar 2009.  Given these 13 records in early 2009 are completely isolated from the rest of HGSI.O's historical data, it would be impossible to accurately estimate new values for the prediction column `returnsOpenNextMktres10`.  So, I opted to remove these handful of data points.","d1a4f1dd":"### Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (EBR.N) bad return data in Oct 2016\n---\nAs I continued looking for outliers and bad data, I came across some return metrics that didn't make sense for the stock EBR.N.  The graph below shows the last couple years worth of data available for this stock in the training data..","f5764b4e":"From the graph above, we can see Paragon Offshore was a very volatile stock during this window.  There is a large spike in price from 0.09 to 0.736 on 2011-11-02.  So, the first spike in `returnsOpenPrevRaw1` does appear to be accurate.  However, there is another spike implying a 559% increase in `open` price on 2012-02-15 that is clearly an error.  While not as obvious, there is also an error in the raw return data on 2011-12-23.\n\nAfter further review, the raw return data errors for PGN.N on 2011-12-23 and 2012-02-15 have cause broader issues with return data in the surrounding months.  After identifying the affected rows (which spanned from 2011-10-19 to 2012-03-28), I leveraged the helper functions from earlier to correct the `raw` return data and estimate new values for the `mktres` return data.","d1c27da4":"From the graph it looks like Apple's stock plummeted in June 2014, but acutally the stock just split.  There is commentary about this event in the news data...","977a82e1":"Apple's 7-to-1 stock split occurred on 2014-06-09.  It's worth noting that while the `open` and `close` columns don't take into account the stock split, the returns columns do (see excerpt below).","c36a1e32":"There are four records fitting this criteria, including two records for Paragon Offshore PLC.  After reviewing the surrounding data it appears there are data quality issues with all three of these stocks.\n\nStarting with Paragon, I took a zoomed out  look at the `open` and `close` prices for PGN.N around these two return spikes...","f1da9d07":"After running the code above (which fixed the errors, corrected the `raw` returns, and estimated the affected `mktres` return values), the data around these errors looks much more reasonable. Revisiting the summary statistics, we've removed some of the extreme values previously seen in the `returnsClosePrevRaw1` column.","18a37868":"### Qorvo (QRVO.O) bad return data in Jan and Feb 2015\n---\nThe record with bad return data for Qorvo on 2015-01-02 is the first day of data available in the training set.  Looking elsewhere online also shows no historical stock price data available for Qorvo prior to 2015-01-02.\n\nThe graph below shows Qorvo's stock price vs. return metrics, and we can see in addition to the bad return data on 2015-01-02, return data continues to fluctuate wildly.  For example, some of the 10-day return metrics show values implying near 100% increases weeks after 2015-01-02 that are are obviously wrong when looking at the actual price data.","8526dff2":"Starting with HGSI.O, the `raw` returns data looked fine, but there were obvious issues with the `mktres` returns data.  The graph below shows the stock's price and the 10-day `PrevMktres` returns around the affected time period.","8c984059":"Looking at records with a greater than 1000% `returnsOpenPrevRaw1` metric...","2419db56":"### Errors on 2016-07-06\n---\nAfter a brief review of the data surrounding the 12 records above, it appears only four of these high negative `returnsClosePrevRaw1` values are due to data errors.  Each of the errors is for a record on 2016-07-06.  The assets `FLEX.O`, `MAT.O`, `SHLD.O`, and `ZNGA.O` are affected.  Below is a closer look at the errors...","a3ff15b7":"**This is a list of errors and issues found in the market data.  Will update if more are found.

There's a similar error for Bank of New York Mellon Corp, however, it's likely I won't be using market data from 2007 and 2008 when modeling, so for now I'm going to ignore this error.\n\nI didn't notice it initially, but there's another `assetCode` for Towers Watson, \"WW.N\" (in addition to the \"TW.N\" code).  While a single `assetName` can have multiple `assetCode`s, based on some quick searching online I don't think that is the case here.  Instead, it appears to be that the \"WW.N\" `assetCode` is an error.  So I went ahead and updated the \"WW.N\" tickers to \"TW.N\" to match the rest of the Towers Watson data.","c96289df":"### Human Genome Sciences Inc (HGSI.O) bad return data in 2009\n---\nIf you return to the summary statistics table and scroll to the far right, the minimum value for the `returnsClosePrevMktres10` and `returnsOpenPrevMktres10` metrics is less than -1.  This to me implies a decrease in price of more than 100% which doesn't make sense.","cb5e2538":"Given each of these stocks have a similar incorrect `close` price of 123.45 or 123.47, I decided to look and see if there were any more stocks with similar issues on 2016-07-06.  Searching for those specific `close` prices on that date revealed five more stocks with similar errors... `BBBY.O`, `DISH.O`, `NDAQ.O`, `PCAR.O`, & `PZZA.O`.","176eed20":"The record with the outlier ~10k `open` price is from Jan 2010.  This price error has caused issues with the returns data back to 2009-12-16, and up to 2010-01-07.  Given the data in Dec 2009 and Jan 2010 is very isolated from the rest of the Towers Watson dataset (next closest data on either side is July 2009 and June 2010), I opted to remove all the affected records due to the price error.  So records from 2009-12-16 to 2010-01-07 were removed.","7a85dad0":"### Towers Watson (TW.N) open price error & incorrect assetCode (WW.N)\n---\nNow turning to the very high `open` price of 9998.99...","03fcf503":"First I'm taking a look at assets that are showing very large drop in day-over-day close prices.

It's a little tough to see because the graphs overlap each other, but if you hover your cursor over the spike, you can see all four asset's `close` price shoots up to around 123.5 on 2016-07-06 (and then returns back to normal).","680bbaa1":"Starting out by looking at summary statistics for each of the numeric columns.  There are certainly some outliers and extreme values to check out.","0d6f6463":"Since it appears there's no issues with the return columns, if you're not planning on calculating any new features using the `open` and `close` columns, then you shouldn't need to worry about stock splits.\n\nHowever, I am interested in trying to create some new features from these columns (e.g. moving averages), so I'm looking at adjusting historical stock prices like Apple's to account for splits.
