Interestingly, there has been a significant uptick in the fraction of gold medals captured by the US female athletes at the 2012 Olympics, but this seems to be  going away and US females are again getting closer and closer to the fraction of the gold medals won by their male counterparts.","acd4c2e2":"# Tokyo 2020 from another dataset","eb38fe9b":"USA Today recently had an article about US women winning a clear majority of the US medals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. This lead me to wonder what is the evolution of this trend over time, more specifically what fraction of the gold medals was captured by the US male\/female athletes at the various Summer Olympic Games? Are there any clear trends, especially US women taking over the world or US men swiftly abandoning the forefront of the gold medal rankings?","a000cf7a":"# Olympic games up to Tokyo 2020"}}
