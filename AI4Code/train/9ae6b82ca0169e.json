However, for the most part, only titles and abstracts will interest us.","9d8d38a2":"We notice there are some clusters and some outliers. When it comes to scientific literature, one paper is rarely the final word on anything, but rather a contribution to a wider conversation. Therefore, the more papers in a cluster, the more that cluster should be paid attention to. Therefore, let's not just assign cluster numbers, but have those cluster numbers be ordered with respect to the number of papers in the cluster.","1507cf0c":"We plot the low-dimensional vectorizations interactively, so that by hovering over a point, we see the title of the paper, as well as its index in the data frame.","c85baf3e":"Since we've vectorized into a high dimension, we must do dimensionality reduction. Different techniques are appropriate for preserving different features of the data. In our case, we did the vectorization to look at semantic distance, ie which papers are \"closer together\" in some sense. If this is what we want to preserve, then t-SNE (as opposed to, say, PCA) is the way to go.","af620a46":"Now we plot interactively again, looking only at the largest clusters. We can hover over the points in a cluster to see their individual titles to confirm that they are indeed a semantic cluster.","09e1268b":"Let's now make a wordcloud for both titles and abstracts to find some common themes. ","95d924f5":"Of the titles and abstracts, it makes more sense to vectorize the abstracts as those are basically condensed versions of the whole paper. Some words are common headings of academic abstracts, e.g. Abstract, Background, Methods, so those should be considered stopwords, in addition to the usual stopwords."}}
