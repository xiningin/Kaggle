Thus the modification gives somewhat more relevant results than cosine similarity.","6c3c4f21":"The following IDF values for the words in the query was observed at the time of running this simulation.\n\n{'diabetes': 3.453179026688757, 'covid': 3.9598320012919723, '19': 1.4025946028730936, 'risk': 1.8492836902078613, 'factors': 1.6826481323365186}\n\n(These values may change as dataset changes but it should be realized that the values themselves are immaterial for the discussion here)\n\nThe cosine similarity calculates the following metric for a particular file i and the search query vector\n\nCOSINE_SIMILARITY(i) = TFIDFi(diabetes) x TFIDFq(diabetes) + TFIDFi(covid) x TFIDFq(covid) + TFIDFi(19) x TFIDFq(19) + TFIDFi(risk) x TFIDFq(risk) + TFIDFi(factors) x TFIDFq(factors)\n\nwhere TFIDFi and TFIDFq represent TFIDF values for the word in a particular file i and search query respectively\n\nSince covid has a high value of IDF it may produce a high value of cosine similarity for files with high values of term frequency for covid. Thus documents with only a high term frequency for covid might be ranked higher. This poses a problem for information retrieval relevant to all terms of the query.\n\nThe next cell plots the term frequencies of words present in query in top selected documents","1b15016b":"# Load TF-IDF model","d687babe":"# Modification to cosine similarity measure\n\nAs speculated document number 2 and 5 have term frequency of diabetes = 0. Still those documents popped up in the top 5 results for search query \"diabetes covid 19 risk factors\". From the plotted bar graphs it is evident that we will get more relevant documents to our search query if documents contain as many words in the query as possible.\n\nRewriting the cosine similarity metric from before \n\nCOSINE_SIMILARITY(i) = TFIDFi(diabetes) x TFIDFq(diabetes) + TFIDFi(covid) x TFIDFq(covid) + TFIDFi(19) x TFIDFq(19) + TFIDFi(risk) x TFIDFq(risk) + TFIDFi(factors) x TFIDFq(factors)  ---- (1)\n\nwhere TFIDFi and TFIDFq represent TFIDF values for the word in a particular file i and search query respectively.\nCOSINE_SIMILARITY(i) denotes how much file i matches with search query\n\nWe define component of cosine similarity as \n\nCOMPONENT_OF_COSINE_SIMILARITY = TFIDFi(word) x TFIDFq(word)\n\nSo equation (1) has 5 components of cosine similarity. One for \"diabetes\" one for \"covid\" etc.\n\nSo we need documents where each component of cosine similarity contributes as much as possible to the final cosine similarity metric.\n\nIn short we would prefer documents where more number of cosine similarity components are non-zero\n\nFor e.g we would prefer a document where\n\nTFIDFi(diabetes) x TFIDFq(diabetes) != 0 and TFIDFi(covid) x TFIDFq(covid) !=0 and TFIDFi(risk) x TFIDFq(risk) !=0\n\nover a document where\n\nTFIDFi(covid) x TFIDFq(covid) !=0 and TFIDFi(risk) x TFIDFq(risk) !=0\n\neven though the latter may have a higher cosine similarity value.\n\nA way to accomplish this is to calculate a metric similar to entropy over the components of cosine similarity\n\nFor e.g. \n\nCOSINE_SIMILARITY(i) = 0.7 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 \n\nAfter normalizing so that all components add to 1 we get \n\nNORMALIZED_COSINE_SIMILARITY(i) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0\n\nThe components of normalized cosine similarity are (1,0,0,0,0) . If we consider this to be a probability distribution then information entropy of this distribution is 0.\n\nConsider another cosine similarity measure\n\nCOSINE_SIMILARITY(i) = 0.3 + 0.2 + 0 + 0.2 + 0\n\nNORMALIZED_COSINE_SIMILARITY(i) = 0.428 + 0.285 + 0 + 0.285 + 0\n\nComponents of normalized cosine similarity are (0.428,0.285,0,0.285,0). Information entropy of this distribution is about 1.56\n\nSo we would like to pick the latter document over the former even if they have the same cosine similarity measure of 0.7.\n\nThe idea is to multiply the information entropy with cosine similarity and use it as a final metric to rank results of a search query. Therefore if cosine similarity is high just because of one word (such as \"covid\" in the example above) the resulting metric will still be low. Thus this method will prefer documents which have more words of the search query.\n\nNote that in practice we will use the following formula for calculating information entropy of components of normalized cosine similarity\n\nENTROPY_OF_NORMALIZED_COSINE_SIMILARITY_TERMS = SUM (Pi x log (1 + 1\/Pi)) where Pi are components of normalized cosine similarity\n\nThis formula will prevent entropy from becoming 0 when search query is a single word.\n\nThe calculated entropy metric can be refined further. \nIf entropy of normalized cosine components of 2 documents is the same then the document which has more important words should be favoured. IDF is a measure of importance of words. A higher IDF means the word is rrer and hence more important in the context of the query.\nThus entropy of normalized cosine components of documents can be weighed by the idf values of words in query.\n\nFor e.g. If a query has 3 words namely w1,w2 and w3 then \n\nSUM_OF_IDF_VALUES = IDF(w1) + IDF(w2) + IDF(w3)\n\nIf a document has w1 and w2 then WEIGHTED_ENTROPY_OF_NORMALIZED_COSINE_COMPONENTS = (IDF(w1) + IDF(w2)) * ENTROPY_OF_NORMALIZED_COSINE_SIMILARITY_TERMS\/SUM_OF_IDF_VALUES\nThis metric will improve the entropy measure of a document if more important words are present in document. \n\nThe next few cells implement the explained functionality.","b3d9602d":"# Problems faced due to using cosine similarity measure\n\nTF-IDF is usually used with cosine similarity to determine which documents match a search query the most. While trying to use this simplistic measure some problems were observed. These problems are best explained with help of an example.\n\nSuppose we require the relevant documents to the search query \"diabetes covid-19 risk factors\". The word tokens are diabetes, covid, 19, risk and factors\n\nThe top 5 documents retrieved and the top 5 lines per document only using cosine similarity are displayed below. This illustrates that just cosine similarity is not good enough for our purpose.\n\n","1df66c41":"# Queries for various tasks","dfdda917":"# Testing after modification to cosine similarity"}}
