So, Out of 25974 responses from various Nations, I am interested mainly on Data from USA and India and that too of Working Professionals(non-Students,Currently not employed)","73fb82d8":"* Interesting, most of the youngsters and 55+ Age Employees work for Start ups. \n* Let me check for this group specifically","891b9a80":"# Coding Years vs Participation Percentage","0d2dc0ed":"From above graph,\n1. Participation can be seen from various professions and highest being from Data Scientists, Software Engineers, Data Analysts, Others.\n2.  Interestingly, Research Scientists and Statisticians Percentage is higher in USA compared to that of India. \nAs it gets interesting, I would like to see data of responses with Working Professionals: Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Research Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst.","642b1512":"-> Approx 38% responses of Reseach Scientists in India have coding experience more than 5 years.

In USA, Around 65% are writing code and\/or programming from >3 years. There is a huge difference in USA and in India when it comes to coding experience. \nNow comes the intesresting part,\n1. For how many years have the Data Community Working Professionals been writing code and\/or programming? especially Data Scients","deefb475":"In this Notebook, I wanted to explore the Working Employees Data of USA and India from the 2021 Kaggle Survey Responses. I wanted to explore in different ways such as \n1. Is it real that Youngsters from India and Mid-Level,Seniors from USA are usually interested in Data Science?\n2. We usually come across \"High Experience required for Data Scientists\/ML Engineers\/Reasearch Scientists\". Can we take the results of this survey to understand that experience of Current Working Professionals? \n3. Is there any pattern in Bachelors\/Masters for Working Professionals in Data Scientists\/ML Engineers\/Reasearch Scientists?\n4. How many years of coding\/programming experience is there for these Working Professionals to land into such Data Related Jobs?\n5. How long does the ML models are in Production in Employer's Organization?\n6. Usual Age of Research Scientists in both Nations.\n7. What are the differences in India and USA Work Culture? etc...\n\n\n**Note**: All the opinions are personal and the analysis is performed on responses of Kaggle 2021 Survey. Please feel free to correct me whereever I am wrong.","d2cf44b5":"From above Graph, \n1. Around 63% of Responses are from Indians under 30 Age. Where as the responses from USA are diversified from all Age groups.\n2. Around 5% constitute of Employees > Age-45 in India compared to that of ~35% of USA. \n(Personal opinion: Not just in Kaggle Survey, This Age trend can be seen even in Whole IT Industry of INDIA with variation of Age +-5. )\n\nNow that we have seen the Graph, Let me try to guess the reasons for it. Please feel free to correct me in Comments Section.\n1. As per the Age data, Seems like in India, Students tend to do join Software Industry and become a Working Professional as early as possible(around age 25) which might be right after Bachelors Degree and seems like it might not be the same in USA. There might be a possibility of getting into jobs after Masters or Doctoral Degree and average Age might be around 28-30s as per above graph. \n\nLet's analyze the highest level of formal education that you have attained or plan to attain within the next 2 years(Q4) for further understandings","e43af4fb":"# Age vs Participation(Data Jobs)","be3b7f6c":"Based on above graph,\n1.

Working Professionals of [\"Data Scientist\",\"Data Analyst\",\"Data Engineer\",\"Machine Learning Engineer\",\"Research Scientist\"] of Indian Employees is less compared to that of USA. Also remember that experience of these Employees is less as Age is less. So, I think I can say that average Age and Experience of DataScience community is less in India compared to that of USA.","80ab6c5e":"# Size of Company vs Participation","4e1ff5b1":"# Working Profession vs Percentage Distribution","c2adf479":"So, out of 25974 responses, I left over with 5578 rows to carry on my analysis futher.
