defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services.It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.There must be a clear separation between client and server such that clients are not concerned with data storage and servers are not concerned with the User Interface.<br>\nStateless: State information is not stored on the server.  A client  request must contain all information like session to service the request.REST APIs can exchange data in either JSON or XML format, although many REST APIs send data as JSON.<br>\nIn simple words, an API is a (hypothetical) contract between 2 softwares saying if the user software provides input in a pre-defined format, the later with extend its functionality and provide the outcome to the user software.\n","66091a7b":"Comparing the actual with predicted one","23645b21":"#### FLASK\n\nFlask is a web framework. This means flask provides you with tools, libraries and technologies that allow you to build a web application. This web application can be some web pages, a blog, a wiki or go as big as a web-based calendar application or a commercial website.A framework is a code storage that should help developers achieve the required result by making work easier, scalable, efficient and maintainable web applications by providing reusable code or extensions for common operations.<br>\nFlask and connect it to HTML.
