We\u2019ll determine lung function based on output from a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. The challenge is to use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.\n\n* **Now let's move ahead and explore the data that is given to us in this competition**.\n\n### Evaluation Metric\nThis competition is evaluated on a modified version of the Laplace Log Likelihood. In medical applications, it is useful to evaluate a model's confidence in its decisions. Accordingly, the metric is designed to reflect both the accuracy and certainty of each prediction.\n\n#### What is FVC?\nLung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.\n\n\nFor each true FVC measurement, we will predict both an FVC and a confidence measure (standard deviation \u03c3). The metric is computed as:\n\n$$\\sigma_{clipped} = max(\\sigma, 70)$$\n$$\\Delta = min ( |FVC_{true} - FVC_{predicted}|, 1000 )$$\n$$metric = -   \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\Delta}{\\sigma_{clipped}} - \\ln ( \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{clipped} )$$","f9584964":"The above plot does not look very clean.

As a result, breathing becomes progressively more difficult for the patient suffering from the disease.\n* The disease may be progressing a someone's body for a long time without any warning. And then suddenly symptoms show up and can make a patient much worse.\n\n### [Causes](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pulmonary_fibrosis#Cause)\n* Most of the time, it is difficult to find the cause. And in such cases it is termed as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n* Pulmonary fibrosis can be a secondary effect to other diseases as well.  Examples include autoimmune disorders, viral infections and bacterial infection like tuberculosis which may cause fibrotic changes in both lung's upper or lower lobes and other microscopic injuries to the lung ([Source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pulmonary_fibrosis#Cause)).\n* The following image shows an chest x-ray with pulmonary fibrosis ([Source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pulmonary_fibrosis#Cause)).\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/e1\/IPF_amiodarone.JPG\/450px-IPF_amiodarone.JPG)\n* The following image is an HRCT of lung showing extensive fibrosis ([Source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Pulmon_fibrosis.PNG))\n![](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/81\/Pulmon_fibrosis.PNG\/465px-Pulmon_fibrosis.PNG)\n\n### Symptoms\n* The following are the symptoms of pulmoary fibrosis ([Source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pulmonary_fibrosis#Signs_and_symptoms)).\n    * Shortness of breath, particularly with exertion.\n    * Chronic dry, hacking coughing.\n    * Fatigue and weakness.\n    * Chest discomfort including chest pain.\n    * Loss of appetite and rapid weight loss.","0d9cf48d":"The above swarm plot shows that most of the people are aged between 63 and 73.
