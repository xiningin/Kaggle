If you can remember how to use `help()`, you hold the key to understanding just about any other function in Python.","2958fd7d":"**Common pitfall:** when you're looking up a function, remember to pass in the name of the function itself, and not the result of calling that function. \n\nWhat happens if we invoke help on a *call* to the function `abs()`?

But if we pass in a function using the optional `key` argument, it returns the argument `x` that maximizes `key(x)` (aka the 'argmax').","72c475aa":"### Lambda functions\n\nIf you're writing a short throwaway function whose body fits into a single line (like `mod_5` above), Python's `lambda` syntax is conveniently compact.","43e103fd":"But if we don't specify a value, `sep` is treated as having a default value of `' '` (a single space).","ce457163":"With judicious use of lambdas, you can occasionally solve complex problems in a single line.

First it calculates the value of `abs(-2)`, then it provides help on whatever the value of that expression is.\n\n<small>(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers!

After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the voluminous help output above will make more sense.)<\/small>\n\n`abs` is a very simple function with a short docstring. `help` shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like `print`:","efa68fe4":"Unsurprisingly, Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description. However, when I write a function, I can provide a description in what's called the **docstring**.\n\n### Docstrings","a3621878":"> **Aside: example calls**\n> The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The `>>>` is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example of, see [this docstring for the numpy function `np.eye`](https:\/\/github.com\/numpy\/numpy\/blob\/v1.14.2\/numpy\/lib\/twodim_base.py#L140-L194).","b2ded427":"Some of this might look inscrutable for now (what's `sys.stdout`?), but this docstring does shed some light on that `sep` parameter we used in one of our `print` examples at the beginning. ","ae4c4040":"# Functions and Getting Help\nIn this lesson, we'll be talking about functions: calling them, defining them, and looking them up using Python's built-in documentation.\n\nIn some languages, functions must be defined to always take a specific number of arguments, each having a particular type. Python functions are allowed much more flexibility. The `print` function is a good example of this:","d9790670":"## Functions that don't return\n\nWhat would happen if we didn't include the `return` keyword in our function?","9586fb2f":"Or maybe the `help()` function can tell us something about it.","18fb2113":"\n\nDocstrings are a nice way to document your code for others - or even for yourself. (How many times have you come back to some code you were working on a day ago and wondered \"what was I thinking?\")","c082d391":"## Default arguments\n\nWhen we called `help(print)`, we saw that the `print` function has several optional arguments. For example, we can specify a value for `sep` to put some special string in between our printed arguments:","9e918ba9":"This creates a function called `least_difference`, which takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\nFunctions start with a header introduced by the `def` keyword. The indented block of code following the `:` is run when the function is called.\n\n`return` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.\n\nIs it clear what `least_difference()` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:","02560c10":"Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of \"null\" in other languages.)\n\nWithout a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input."}}
