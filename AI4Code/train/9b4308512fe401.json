In this case this is telling us that our long answer starts in indices 1952 and end at indices 2019.\n* Also, we have a short answer that starts at indices 1960 and end at indices 1969.\n* In this example we dont have a yes or no answer\n* If you check the submission file we have 692 rows, this means that for each row in the test set we have to predict the short and long answer\n* Sometime long and short answer are not available, in this case it's possible that we have a Yes or No answer for the short answer.\n\nLets check the entire logic of the first line of our train set","72c6e8ff":"I believe this is the main question you need to respond.","8a820bec":"Great we don't have missing values.","6a934932":"* This is a sample of our training set for long answers.\n* We have 4 text answer for the first 5 question\n* For long answers we will get a probability for each question response combination. We will filter this result by each question to check if there is a hight probability for one of the answers. \n* For short answer we are going to do the same, but is harder because we only will know the long tokens. We need to figure how we can extract the short token indices.\n* The dataframe is very large so maybee we will need to remake this function so they work with a batching process.\n* We can make 2 models to resolve this problem (long answer and short answer)","81d94faa":"First let's explore if we have missing values","cd1d387e":"# Question Explorations\n\nLet's explore our question_text column which tell us the question that we want to answer with a segment of the document text\n\n* Count the number of words and check distribution\n* Most common words","091b470f":"# Logic\n\nThis extructure is not easy to understand, let's explore the first line of our train set to understand the logic of this dataset.","06ba2bd4":"> So in the first column we have a huge wikipedia text.
