The participants in the incongruent words condition spent much more time to complete the task than the second group. So, we reject the null hypothesis again. ","4cdad483":"The `histogram` shows that the distribution of the congruent group is skewed to the right while the incongruent group is skewed to the left. That means the participants in the incongruent words condition spent much more time than participants in the congruent words condition to complete the task. ","bb5583dd":"The `bar chart` presents that in all cases the participants in the incongruent words condition spend much more time than the other group. Moreover, `14` and `19` participants in the incongruent group seem to be outliers when compared with the others.","6f970121":"There are several theories used to explain the Stroop effect, such as: `Processing speed, Selective attention, Automaticity, Parallel distributed processing`. `Automaticity theory` is the most common theory of the Stroop effect. According with Wikipedia, It suggests that since recognizing colors is not an \"automatic process\" there is hesitancy to respond; whereas, the brain automatically understands the meaning of words as a result of habitual reading. This idea is based on the premise that automatic reading does not need controlled attention, but still uses enough attentional resources to reduce the amount of attention accessible for color information processing. Stirling (1979) introduced the concept of response automaticity. He demonstrated that changing the responses from colored words to letters that were not part of the colored words increased reaction time while reducing Stroop interference.<br><br>\nMoreover, I thought interesting the `Processing speed` theory that suggests there is a lag in the brain's ability to recognize the color of the word since the brain reads words faster than it recognizes colors. This is based on the idea that word processing is significantly faster than color processing. In a condition where there is a conflict regarding words and colors (e.g., Stroop test), if the task is to report the color, the word information arrives at the decision-making stage before the color information which presents processing confusion. Conversely, if the task is to report the word, because color information lags after word information, a decision can be made ahead of the conflicting information.<br><br> \nFinally, because of those theories, I strong believe that an alternative or similar task would result in a similar effect.","eb882dfc":"I will consider this dataset the all population regardless the dataset has only 23 rows. Further, I want to assume that participants in the congruent words condition spend the same time to name the ink colors in lists of equal size as the participants in the incongruent words condition, unless there is a significant difference in time spent between these two groups. I will use the mean of the both population for creating the null and alternative hypotheses. They follow below:\n\n\n ### $H_0:  \\mu_{con} - \\mu_{inc}  =  0$\nThe null hypothesis: The mean time spent for participants in both groups is equal.<br>\n\n ### $H_1: \\mu_{con} - \\mu_{inc} \\neq 0$\nThe alternative hypothesis: The mean time spent for participants in both groups is equal.<br>\n\n**terms:**<br>\n$\\mu $ is a the population mean <br>\n$con $ is congruent group <br>\n$inc $ is incongruent group<br>\n\n\nThe assumptions about the dataset and hypotheses:<br>\n\u2022 The dependent variable is continuous (time response).<br>\n\u2022 The differences between two sets of values are independent of one another.<br>\n\u2022 The dependent variable is approximately normally distributed.<br>\n\u2022 The entire population is small (23 rows).<br>\n\u2022 The dependent variable does not contain significant outliers.<br>\n\n\nBecause the assumptions mencioned above I will use a paired t-test to compare two population means where I have two samples in which observations in one sample can be paired with observations in the other sample.
