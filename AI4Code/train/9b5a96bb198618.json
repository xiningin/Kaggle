Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.\n\n## Business and Data Understanding\nSpark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:\n\nIt wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment.\n\nIt wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in.\n\n## Strategy\nSpark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing.\n\n## Business objective\nThe business objectives and goals of data analysis are pretty straightforward.\n\n__Business objective__ The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.\n\n__Goals of data analysis__ Your goals are divided into three sub-goals:\n\nInvestment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.\nCountry analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Funds\u2019 favourites as well.\n\nSector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight 'main sectors' provided in the mapping file. The two files \u2014 companies and rounds2 \u2014 have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)\n","04e1d740":"Now, we can either delete the rows having country_code missing (about 6% rows), or we can impute them by USA. Since the number 6 is quite small, and we have a decent amount of data, it may be better to just remove the rows.\n\nNote that np.isnan does not work with arrays of type 'object', it only works with native numpy type (float). Thus, you can use pd.isnull() instead.","b0df8285":"Clearly, the column funding_round_code is useless (with about 73% missing values). Also, for the business objectives given, the columns homepage_url, founded_at, state_code, region and city need not be used.","d82c97ba":"The median investment amount for type 'private_equity' is approx. USD 20m, which is beyond Spark Funds' range of 5-15m. The median of 'venture' type is about USD 5m, which is suitable for them. The average amounts of angel and seed types are lower than their range.\n\nThus, 'venture' type investment will be most suited to them.","71ab5932":"\nNow, we have to compute a representative value of the funding amount for each type of investment.

This is a part of its broader strategy to invest where most investments are occurring. \n\nSpark Funds wants to see the top nine countries which have received the highest total funding (across ALL sectors for the chosen investment type)\n\nFor the chosen investment type, make a data frame named top9 with the top nine countries (based on the total investment amount each country has received) \n\nIdentify the top three English-speaking countries in the data frame top9.","23fdefb0":"### Data inspection","958f4edb":"## Funding Type Analysis\nThis is the first of the three goals of data analysis \u2013 investment type analysis. \n\nThe funding types such as seed, venture, angel, etc. depend on the type of the company (startup, corporate, etc.), its stage (early stage startup, funded startup, etc.), the amount of funding (a few million USD to a billion USD), and so on. For example, seed, angel and venture are three common stages of startup funding.\n\nSeed\/angel funding refers to early-stage startups whereas venture funding occurs after seed or angel stage\/s and involves a relatively higher amount of investment.\nPrivate equity type investments are associated with much larger companies and involve much higher investments than venture type. Startups which have grown in scale may also receive private equity funding. This means that if a company has reached the venture stage, it would have already passed through the angel or seed stage\/s. \n\nSpark Funds wants to choose one of these four investment types for each potential investment they will make. \n\nConsidering the constraints of Spark Funds, you have to decide one funding type which is most suitable for them.\n\n1. Calculate the average investment amount for each of the four funding types (venture, angel, seed, and private equity) and report the answers in Table 2.1\n\n2. Based on the average investment amount calculated above, which investment type do you think is the most suitable for Spark Funds?","1ee5a47c":"Ideally, the permalink column in the companies dataframe should be the unique_key of the table, having 66368 unique company names (links, or permalinks).<br>\nAlso, these 66368 companies should be present in the rounds file.<br>\nLet's first confirm that these 66368 permalinks (which are the URL paths of companies' websites) are not repeating in the column, i.e. they are unique.<br>\nAlso, let's convert all the entries to lowercase (or uppercase) for uniformity.","1e3dcfb8":"Among the top 9 countries, USA, GBR and IND are the top three English speaking countries.

This is to simplify the analysis by grouping the numerous category lists (named \u2018category_list\u2019) in the mapping file. For example, in the mapping file, category_lists such as \u20183D\u2019, \u20183D Printing\u2019, \u20183D Technology\u2019, etc. are mapped to the main sector \u2018Manufacturing\u2019. \n\nAlso, for some companies, the category list is a list of multiple sub-sectors separated by a pipe (vertical bar |). For example, one of the companies\u2019 category_list is Application Platforms|Real Time|Social Network Media. \n\nYou discuss with the CEO and come up with the business rule that the first string before the vertical bar will be considered the primary sector. In the example above, \u2018Application Platforms\u2019 will be considered the primary sector.\n\nExtract the primary sector of each category list from the category_list column\n\nUse the mapping file 'mapping.csv' to map each primary sector to one of the eight main sectors (Note that \u2018Others\u2019 is also considered one of the main sectors)","4b780fd4":"## Sector Analysis\nNow you have a data frame with each company\u2019s main sector (main_sector) mapped to it.
