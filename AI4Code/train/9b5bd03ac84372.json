","e21c8ade":"Next we will train our resnet18 pretrained model and see how it compares","93e4a914":"We can see right away that the pretrained resnet converges way faster and to a lower minimum than the custom convnet.

In theory max pooling is reducing the resolution of our image, but maybe the convolutions can reformat the data to still capture accurate positions regardless. For example putting a bit in a different channel to denote if it originated from the  top-left pixel or top-right pixel in a pooling layer.","8ee696e7":"Interestingly we get a bit of a snail pattern on the custom CNN. Beyond 128 we start seeing a linear growth between label and loss. Kind of expected given that our model likely only learned to predict within the possibilities of distances for 128x128 images. \n\nWith the resnet model we see linear growth almost the whole time. very puzzling. Maybe we can inspect predictions more closely and understand what is causing that","a4c9d3e8":"We can see that the resnet pattern looks significantly different.

It would be interesting to see if the model has learned generalizable features for measuring distance or if it is specific to the resolution it was trained on. In practice I have seen models that work perfectly fine on alternate resolutions detecting cat vs dog and other tasks like that so I would assume there is still some possibility of performance. I would think beyond a certain resolution we would have problems though because the model has never learned to make predictions so high. \n\nWe can start with 256 x 256 and see what happens with our two different models","6f116169":"Resnet model we will explore in parallel.

As showing many images all at once is difficult I will limit it the visualizations to be a max of 32 channels per layer. Hopefully we can still find something amongst the incomplete set of images","ec273e69":"Interestingly the models have very different modes of failure. The resnet seems to have predictions centered around the totally wrong region, while the custom CNN is skewing its predictions to the top of the range it is capable of but cant predict beyond that range. \n\nNow on the flip side we can try predicting on smaller images. Maybe performance will work when we arent trying to extapolate beyond a known range"}}
