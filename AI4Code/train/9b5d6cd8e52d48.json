It is usually not enought to rely on hight accuracy_score to evalute your model because the score may just be illusionary and a simple reflexion of the majority class. Using other evalution metric like the roc_auc_score, f1_score, classification report etc could give us a better evalution of the performance our our model w.r.t the dataset. But it is always a good idea and safer to work with balanced datasets and balancing a dataset can be as easy as just adjusting the class_weight parameters.\n\nFor algorithms with the Class_weight parameter, it sometimes suffices to set set **class_weight = 'Balanced'** like in this case the random_forest classifier.\n\nWith some other algorithms, we may need to set the class weight parameter manually.  We set the class_weight such as to penalize mistakes on the minority class by an amount proportional to how under-represented it is. For example \n\n> class_weight = ({0 : \"0.25\", 1:  \"0.85\"}).\n\nAnother alternative to using the class_weight parameter is to creat synthetic observations of the minority class using the **SMOTE = Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique** from the sklearn.imblearn library.","f15b714b":"Lets do something else to confirm what we are already suspecting.
