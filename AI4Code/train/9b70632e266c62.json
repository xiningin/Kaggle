It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. (taken from wikipedia)","e915a452":"The Iris Dataset is Composed of 5 features (4 Numerical, 1 Categorical), Numerical features are Sepal Width, Sepal Length, Petal Width, Petal Length.and Cetegorical features are Species. Below are the Some Insights analyzed in data\n\n- Iris Setosa have very Narrow Petal Width and Short Petal and Sepal Lenght, But very Wide Sepal Width.\n- Iris virginica are just opposite of Iris Setosa, have Wide Petal, and Long Petal and Sepal Length, and Sepal Width are moderate.\n- Iris versicolor's Sepal and Petals Length and Width are Median of Both Iris Setosa and Iris virginica\n- The Distribution of Sepal Length and Sepal Width are Normal, But the Distributioin of Petal width and Petal Lenght are kind of Bi Modal, After Analyzing, why it is bi modal, I came to an conclusion that, it is due to the small petal width and length iris Setosa\n- Petal Length and Petal Width are highly Correlated -- 0.96\n- Petal Length and Sepal Length having strong Correlation -- 0.87\n- Sepal Length and Petal Width have also storng Correlation -- 0.82"}}
