Since wind turbines can start operating at wind speeds of 2 m\/s onwards (Wind turbine systems and Renewable Energy, n.d.), the wind speed in the Lamb region will be able to operate the wind turbines throughout the year. \n\n<br> Therefore, after considering both the line graphs and box plots of all 5 regions, we will focus on the **Lamb region** to further analyse its weather conditions and subsequently, conclude its feasibility.

The primary studies provide positive observations and possible positive long term benefits for both the economy and the environment, should this idea eventually come to fuition.","e7008243":"**National University of Singapore | PF3211 Project 2** <p>\n* Created by:\n<br>Isabelle Chen Jia Cin \n<br>Kang Yan Ying \n<br>Ko Jia Hui \n<br>Liao Bowei \n<br>Tang Ching Rong\n\n<br>Assistant Professor Dr Clayton Miller\n<br> Date of Submission: 8 November 2021","2867ad4a":"<a id=\"2\"><\/a> <br>\n# **How to use the data**\n<br> We will be using the following files for our analysis:\n<br> a) weather.csv\n<br> b) electricity.csv\n\nFor (a), we will study the \u201cwindSpeed\u201d column for the entire year of 2017 to determine if there is a pattern, and find the mean wind speed for the 5 regions mentioned above. This will help us to determine which region has the highest mean wind speed and if it is mostly consistent throughout the year.\n\nFor (b), we will be analysing the electrical consumption patterns of five office buildings in the Lamb region. This will help us to determine if the electricity supplied by the wind farm will be sufficient to power the buildings. \n\n","4e50ff9d":"From the line graph, the season does not greatly affect the wind speed. Even in months of summer like June or months of winter like December, there are still days with high wind speed. This means that even with the change of seasons, there is no need to take into consideration the amount of wind available as there will always be wind. This also means that electricity production will not differ significantly with the change of season.\n\n\nAt a glance, we can preliminarily make the observation that the Lamb region recorded the highest average hourly wind speed among all 5 regions. Furthermore, from the graph, we can see that there is little to no wind speed at 0m\/s. This means that generally there is wind everyday. This will ensure that the wind turbines can operate daily, and will be able to produce electricity for use by the offices. This also means that the wind turbines are used to their fullest potential, making it a worthy investment. \n\nAll in all, from our primary analysis of the data provided, it is likely feasible to gain returns from an investment in a wind farm project in the **Lamb Region of Arendale, Norway.**\n\nAfter analysing the windspeed patterns over for the year 2017, we find that all 5 regions experience similar patterns. Therefore, the next step is to analyse the box plots for each location to get a more accurate representation of the mean, 25th and 75th percentile of wind speed recorded."}}
