You can build this in to your pipeline to help with reducing the resolution of the data in later modelling iterations, and aid further feature engineering.\n\nIf this kernel gets enough votes I will apply it to adversarial validation too to see **where** in the feature space the train and test set differ the most. Perhaps this could even be integrated into an *auto-relaxing* function that buckets the data for us in a way that makes the  train and test sets more similar, without any tedious manual inspection of plots :)\n\n<font color=red>Update<\/font>: [adversarial version here][2].\n\n___\n\nA note to any n00bs reading: the original features used here are only a starting point, used just to demonstrate. If (say) `DeviceInfo` of `hi6210sft Build\/MRA58K` comes along in the training set and makes a fast burst of transactions (all marked fraud), then appears in the test set but spread out and on many separate days, it does not make sense to predict a high fraud likelihood, simply because of that one feature. Features that capture *event* timing & behaviour are needed :)\n\nFor inspiration you should check out [an **extensive** index of **winning** and high ranking Kaggle **solutions** here][1] (and upvote if this helps you find something useful &mdash; I guarantee there are useful links there ;)\n\n [1]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jtrotman\/high-ranking-solution-posts\n [2]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jtrotman\/ieee-fraud-adversarial-lgb-split-points\n","de3f00d6":"Dump all the split point data to an xlsx file (can be opened with open-source *Open Office* or *[Libre Office][1]*)\n\n [1]: https:\/\/www.libreoffice.org\/download\/download\/","03433fc7":"`V258` and `V258_count` reach high gain by 20% of the way through and are not used much after that. `card1` and `card2` are still being used with high gain throughout.","dff318bd":"# Plots For IEEE Features\n\nAll the features with 4 or more unique values are shown (to avoid \"Too many output files (max 500)\" error).\n\n## Notes\n\nMost of the split points have long decimal values like `379.00000000000006` - the LightGBM algorithm only sees binned data, so it sets split thresholds as values [halfway between neighbouring bin lower\/upper edges][6], but bumped upwards a tiny fraction using `std::nextafter` in the [C++ standard library][5], resulting in strangely precise [floating point format][1] values :)\n\nZero is checked for using a [kZeroThreshold = 1e-35f][7] variable - this comes out of the model as a split point of 1.0000000180025095e-35 &mdash; a tiny number. When you see that, think *zero*.\n\nSplit points for categorical dtypes depends on the `max_cat_to_onehot` which I have set to 128 - so categoricals in this data set are treated with a one-vs-all split. This means `feature==value` in the node split test, instead of the usual `feature<=value`. `max_cat_to_onehot` is by default set to 4, meaning categories with more values than this use splits based on target statistics, and the resulting split points have values like `1||3||5||7||8||9` which indicate which category codes go down the *left* branch. (But this is hard to show in bar charts... hence I used *one-vs-all splits*.)\n\nLightGBM keeps a separate bin for NaN values and at all node tests, records whether that bin goes left\/right separately - this is not shown here (yet! Upvote to make me attempt something!)\n\n## What to Look For\n\nIn some ways what we **don't** see is more interesting than what we **do**. As with normal feature importances: if we see a feature is not used at all it is clearly redudant and should be removed. So seeing low gain (0) is very reliable but seeing high gain can *can* be misleading - it may be fitting noise.\n\nIf there is **one prominent peak** it means the feature acts a bit like a boolean, and perhaps would be better fed into the model that way (e.g. seeing a split value of 100, for feature 'foo', you could instead change column 'foo' to `foo<=100`.)  \n\nSimilarly if there are **several prominent peaks** it could imply the feature should be discretized\/binned in a pre-processing step, as the less-often used split points may just be picking up on noise. See this [interesting old discussion thread on this subject of feature discretization][2].\n\nFor the TimeOfDay feature you may like to check out [my time series heatmaps notebook][4] that shows the density of transactions over time, and clearly indicates night time.\n\n [1]: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Double-precision_floating-point_format\n [2]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction\/discussion\/43886\n [3]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tilii7\n [4]: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jtrotman\/ieee-fraud-time-series-heatmaps\n [5]: https:\/\/en.cppreference.com\/w\/cpp\/numeric\/math\/nextafter\n [6]: https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/LightGBM\/blob\/master\/src\/io\/bin.cpp\n [7]: https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/LightGBM\/blob\/master\/include\/LightGBM\/meta.h ","f0240bd3":"Add count features...","f333c0fd":"A different plot, show the most used features at the 20% point of training, and how their gain evolves after that...","1b63e19f":"# Gain Over Time\n\nThis part is more for illustration\/teaching about gradient boosting.\n\nAs well as counting split points, we can look at how feature gain evolves as trees are added to the model.\n\nIn the gradient boosting learning process, each tree adds something to the training set predictions that moves the overall predictions closer to the target. It takes small steps towards lowering the loss function. Early trees are more like standard decision trees, fitting the big patterns. Later trees are more specialised, correcting small deviations, fine-grained wrinkles in the loss function: often little patterns, sometimes noise.\n\nAs features are incorporated into the model in early trees, their predictive power can run out, which is most notable for boolean features; at some point the existing predictions have accounted for all of the variance of the feature and they are no longer used in new trees.\n\nWe can see this by looking at gain statistics over time by passing the `iteration` parameter to the `feature_importance()` method.\n","032656ef":"# Plotting Code\n\nWarning: this only shows the 50 split points with the most gain, so the x-axis will be a bit nonlinear, some values won't appear.
