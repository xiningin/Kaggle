","8f3268af":"## MCAR\n\nData missing completely at random means that the probability of missingness in one independent variable does not depend on the other observed independent variables. In other words, the probability of missingness in an indepdent variable depends only on some external factors.\n\nFor more clarification we will attempt to construct some data with a MCAR pattern. \n\nLet us imagine that we collect a set of 3000 entry data about some employees including: Sex, Height, Weight and Salary. We suppose that all information about sex was correctly collected (with no missing data). In a first stage, the simulated dataframe has no missing data (the missing entries will be included later).","30b960ae":"This table will be fed to the Chi2 contngency test from the scipy library.

This is also an information the scipy function returns.","a875fac0":"# **Introduction** \n\nThe main objective of this notebook is to give some insights on how to deal with data in presence of missing records. Missing data could be regarded as \"records without entries\". They are often denoted by a \"na, n\/a, N\/a, N\/A (not applicable)\" or \"Nan, NaN, NAN (not a number)\". The denomination depends on the used progamming langauge (NaN is the most common in python language for machine learning). NaN values could also appear in some non authorized operation in mathematics as deviding 0 by 0 or substracting infinity from infinity (as shown in the below cell).","81475ef6":"The second method aims at replacing the missing data with some information infered from the whole data set such us the mean, the median, the mode, or simply a predefined value.\n\n<font color='red'>HERE I WOULD LIKE TO FLAG A COMMON ERROR WITH THIS METHOD.

The following commands makes the job and get the pourcentage in an ordered way. You can either use:","cd3e962a":"Or you can use the mean in order to get directly a pourcentage.","d72307ca":"Going back to my previous question whether we can perform regression or classification whitout caring too much about missing data, the answer is yes since there are some regression methods that can handle missing data because the method is built internally in a way to easily handle the missing data. The most famous method is the regression function included in the XGboost librairie. Let us check if the algorithm really can handle missing data.","e81e29bf":"Let's quickly check the size of the dataset.","356ec8b0":"Now some values of the Height column were filled with NaN Values according to an MCAR scheme. The next point is to define methods to determine of the data were missing completely at random.\n\n# **Detect the MCAR pattern**\n\nIn order to detect an MCAR pattern, we can use statistical tests. One famous statistical test for this purpose is the $\\chi^2$ test. The $\\chi^2$ could be used to test goodness of fit, homogenity test and independence test. The latter will be used in this case to figure out if the missigness of data in the Height column is dependent (or not) on the other variables (columns).\n\nThe test starts by stating a first hypothesis called (the null hypothesis) and calculates a measure of closness between the observed data and the expected data (in the case where the null hypothesis is satisfied).\n\nThe null hypothesis in this case is the following:\n\n**$H_0$:** There is no association between the missingness in the Height column and the other columns. The critical $p$-value associated to this test is equal to 0.05.\n\nLet us first define the columns \"Height_missing\" that equals to True if Height is missing and False otherwise.","ebe8bc21":"# ** Types of missing data **\n\nA previous classification of missing data was established by [Little & Rubin in 1987](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/book\/10.1002\/9781119013563) diving missing data into three categories: \n\n* MCAR : Missing completely at random\n* MAR: Missing at random\n* MNAR: Missing not at random\n\nIn order to understand the difference between the differnet types of missig data, we will try to construct them ourserlves.\n","f509f61e":"The first step is to detect if the missingness in the Height variable is relate to the Sex variable.

After dropping rows containig nan values in any of the columns we end with 269 rows. This means that 25% of data were dropped which will for sure include a bias in the final result.","8712d189":"As a conclusion, the missingness in the Height variable is not dependent on the Sex variable. Next, we should perform the same analysis for the other variables: weight and salary. This could be done in the same manner with a signle modification. Since the $chi^2$ test could not be performed between a continous and a categorical variable, the continous variables must be converted into categories by performing some binning techniques.

Let us apply this for the height variable.","f2fd98c4":"And magic!. No errors were flagged after the fitting.

Couldn't we find a way to escape dealing with missing data?","d093f5db":"Since the $p$-value is greater that 5%, not significant result, we fail to reject null hypothesis (H0) and the two variables are indepedent."}}
