Japan and India are both in Asia but are at opposite ends of the graph. Similar story for Switzerland and Russia.\n- Not much variation at the top of the list, reinforcing the idea of approaching a natural boundary.","e1f959f5":"## How has the standard deviation of life expectancy changed over time?\nGiven the previous two charts, I'm curious how countries have \"clustered\" over time. One way to check for this in a general sense is by plotting the rolling standard deviation. In years where certain countries have a much higher life expectancy than others we would expect the standard deviation to be high. Conversely, in years where countries begin to cluster together with similar life expectancies the standard deviation will be low.","26da6788":"**Observations:**\n- Data before the 1870s is likely backfilled due to the lack of variance.\n- WW1, the Spanish Flu, and WW2's impacts on life expectancy are all clearly visible.\n- Rapid progress was made in the 20th century but appears to be cooling off at the start of the 21st. Are we reaching a natural boundary?","6dff4294":"# Introduction\nHi everyone! This is my first notebook on Kaggle. This dataset doesn't contain enough information for any machine learning so the focus will be on exploring and visualizing the data. Please let me know if you have any feedback - I'm always looking to improve!","2fb21678":"**Observations:**\n- As mentioned before, the data pre-1870s was likely backfilled and has artificially low standard deviation.\n- Up to and during both world wars, the standard deviation sharply increased. This is expected and indicates that certain countries were much more damaged than others.\n- Post-WW2, the standard deviation has fallen dramatically as more and more countries close in on the natural boundary.","a9087caf":"# Imports & Settings","74f71fc0":"# Visualizations\nIn this section, I'll ask several different questions I'm curious about and then answer them with visualizations.
