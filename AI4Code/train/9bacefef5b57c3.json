This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company. \n\nThis data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.\n\nThe dataset includes information about:\n\n*   Customers who left within the last month \u2013 the column is called Churn\n*   Services that each customer has signed up for \u2013 phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies\n*   Customer account information \u2013 how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges\n*   Demographic info about customers \u2013 gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents\n\n<\/div>","2fbc80d7":"Let's first import required libraries:\n","7a8aebc0":"Let's build our model using **LogisticRegression** from the Scikit-learn package.

However, while the actual label of 9 customers was 1, the classifier predicted those as 0, which is not very good. We can consider it as the error of the model for first row.\n\nWhat about the customers with churn value 0? Lets look at the second row.\nIt looks like  there were 25 customers whom their churn value were 0.\n\nThe classifier correctly predicted 24 of them as 0, and one of them wrongly as 1. So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. A good thing about the confusion matrix is that it shows the model\u2019s ability to correctly predict or separate the classes.  In a specific case of the binary classifier, such as this example,  we can interpret these numbers as the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.\n","321042ed":"\n<h1 style=\"background-color:black;font-family:Arial Black;font-size:200%;text-align:center; color: white\"; >\n    Customer churn with Logistic Regression\n<\/h1>\nA telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors.
