Say we want to select all the values from the city column that are in rows where the country column is 'US' (for \"United States\").","bd19b3fd":"# Introduction\nNow that you know how to access and examine a dataset, you're ready to write your first SQL query! As you'll soon see, SQL queries will help you sort through a massive dataset, to retrieve only the information that you need.\n\nWe'll begin by using the keywords SELECT, FROM, and WHERE to get data from specific columns based on conditions you specify.\n\nFor clarity, we'll work with a small imaginary dataset pet_records which contains just one table, called pets.\n\n\n\n# SELECT ... FROM\nThe most basic SQL query selects a single column from a single table. To do this,\n\nspecify the column you want after the word SELECT, and then\nspecify the table after the word FROM.\nFor instance, to select the Name column (from the pets table in the pet_records database in the bigquery-public-data project), our query would appear as follows:\n\n\n\nNote that when writing an SQL query, the argument we pass to FROM is not in single or double quotation marks (' or \"). It is in backticks (`).\n\n# WHERE ...\nBigQuery datasets are large, so you'll usually want to return only the rows meeting specific conditions. You can do this using the WHERE clause.\n\nThe query below returns the entries from the Name column that are in rows where the Animal column has the text 'Cat'.\n\n\n\n# Example: What are all the U.S. cities in the OpenAQ dataset?\nNow that you've got the basics down, let's work through an example with a real dataset. We'll use an OpenAQ dataset about air quality.\n\nFirst, we'll set up everything we need to run queries and take a quick peek at what tables are in our database. (Since you learned how to do this in the previous tutorial, we have hidden the code. But if you'd like to take a peek, you need only click on the \"Code\" button below.)"}}
