Kaggle Learn, Udemy, and University Courses towards a degree followed, with Datacamp, edX, and LinkedInLearning coming in a bit behind. Kaggle Learn seemed to close the gap with Coursera a bit this year.\n\nKagglers reported trying data science courses on two platforms, on average.\n\nCoursera's popularity was high across almost education levels and job titles. Kaggle Learn's usage was fairly uniform across categories. LinkedInLearning and Udemy seem to have been popular across categories as well, noticeably more so than in the 2020 survey. Fast.ai was popular with Statisticians, Machine Learning Engineers, and Data Scientists.

R also enjoys widespread popularity across education levels and coding experience; SQL shows a high number of users overall, but they are more concentrated in people holding Master's or PhD degrees, working as Statisticians, Data Scientists and Data Analysts.\n\nKagglers reported using 2-3 languages on a regular basis.","9dec45ea":"#### *A quick look at the overall demographics, before filtering for just the US.*","3c773ec2":"*Revisting my questions from the [2020 Kaggle Survey](http:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/kaggle-survey-2020\/overview), using data from the [2021 Survey](http:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/kaggle-survey-2021\/overview).
