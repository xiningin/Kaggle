Significant textual data points can be highlighted using a word cloud.

These images can also be created using Photoshop, but using wordcloud saves a lot time and we can also save these images edit them as well. But currently it is only able to generate these WordClouds with black and white images, For generating these wordclouds with normal images we would need to preprocess the images first and then only we can apply WordCloud. I tried doing the same but the generated images were not quite sharp and easy to recognise, So I am currently working on improving the sharpness and quality of generated wordcloud.","ae6b29d1":"## [Getting words for our word cloud:](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kshitijmohan\/wine-recommendation-system-based-on-bert)","12025e55":"## Thank you for your time :)","f325dfc9":"## [Making Word Cloud:](http:\/\/)"}}
