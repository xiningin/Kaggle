In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model; it is a form of binomial regression. Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass\/fail, win\/lose, alive\/dead or healthy\/sick; these are represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled \"0\" and \"1\"","146044f1":"no see our prediction for iris","9ce90a34":"The product of the error and the slopes **reduces the error of high confidence predictions**.

In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\nIn k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\nIn k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification.

In pattern recognition, information retrieval and binary classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, \n1. **recall** : \n\n    1. recall is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. \n1. **F-score** :\n\n    1. the F1 score is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\n    <br>\n1. **What is the difference between accuracy and precision?**\n<br>\n    1. \"Accuracy\" and \"precision\" are general terms throughout science. A good way to internalize the difference are the common \"bullseye diagrams\". In machine learning\/statistics as a whole, accuracy vs. precision is analogous to bias vs. variance.","39e6c25b":"From our discussion of the XOR problem we remember that this is a *non-linear pattern*, a **one-to-one relationship between a combination of inputs**.","e7f96cd5":"The pattern here is our XOR pattern or problem: If there is a $1$ in either column $1$ or $2$, but not in both, the output is $1$ (XOR over column $1$ and $2$).","cc521ffe":"<a id=\"717\"><\/a> <br>\n## 7-17 Bagging classifier \nA Bagging classifier is an ensemble **meta-estimator** that fits base classifiers each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction. Such a meta-estimator can typically be used as a way to reduce the variance of a black-box estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it.\n\nThis algorithm encompasses several works from the literature. When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the samples, then this algorithm is known as Pasting . If samples are drawn with replacement, then the method is known as Bagging . When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the features, then the method is known as Random Subspaces . Finally, when base estimators are built on subsets of both samples and features, then the method is known as Random Patches .[http:\/\/scikit-learn.org]"}}
