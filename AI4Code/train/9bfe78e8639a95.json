Maybe this feature together with Age would tell more. Lets see next if having parents or children on board has an impact to survival.","bef80ba2":"#### There is power in the family, however, we must notice that the difference in the sizes of these 2 bins is noticeable.","5315bdce":"#### Since a vast majority of passengers travels without parents or children, we will divide the passengers to 2 bins in order to have a better idea of the impact of having family onboard.","580ed478":"#### Since this is a classification problem, we will use Random Forest Classifier for our model.","91c7db22":"#### Below we see a histogram of survival probabilities for all passengers.","6a0e1c1c":"#### From mutual information (see more info from [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mutual_information)) we see that Embarked_Q and TitleMaster are the least significant and Age and TitleMr. the most.

Let's take a closer look with 3 bins (0, 1 or more siblings\/spouse).","7529cfe2":"#### One could easily think that the name of the passenger does not have any effect on his\/hers survival. Nevertheless, the (relationship) status might have, and therefore we will take a closer look to the feature 'Name'. Indeed, at a glimpse, it looks like all passengers have a title (Mr.\/Mrs.\/Master.\/Miss.\/Don.). Recall that \"Master.\" was used for underage boys.","78f1e90f":"#### The cross validation scores correspond pretty much in average our accuracy score which means that our model does not over\/underfit. To improve our model we could test different hyperparameters in our random forest classifier. Also survival probabilities could be analyzed more carefully, for instance, by adjusting the threshold.","67a548a4":"#### Let us check if the Ticket numbers are unique...","9e11c77f":"#### From the confusion matrix we see that in the test set there were 145 true negatives (not survived and predicted to not survive), 15 false positives (not survived but predicted to survive), 34 false negatives and 74 true positives.","31954771":"#### Dividing feature Fare to quantiles shows clearly that the higher the price of the ticket, the better chance the passenger has for surviving.","b782ab62":"#### Let us see if there are any common features in the cases where our model did not succeed to predict right.

Predictions","91ab2cbc":"#### There is only 1 person having title Don. so we can just as well drop the TitleDon column away.","8918bc0e":"#### As we see, more than half of the children (16 years or less), around one third from young adults, around 40% of both adults (30-45 yrs) and middle-aged (45-60yrs), and around one fifth from older people (60-80 yrs) survived. In the data set there seems to be a couple of hundred people with unknown age, but since we don't want to drop Age out, we will impute the data later.","e68eec41":"#### As expected, the higher the class (i.e., the lower the Pclass number), the better is the survival rate. Since the correspondence is linear, there is no need for changing the numeric values or one-hot-encoding at this point (*).\n\n##### (*) It could be that Pclass together with some other feature (e.g. Sex) doesn't have linear correspondence to survival, but for the sake of simplicity we ignore this possibility at least for now.","f29473f8":" ### 2. Predictions\n \n #### In this section we predict the survivors and analyze our model in terms of its reliability.","c57f32a4":"#### There is no point in analyzing Age with all different values separately, so let's divide the passengers to somewhat suitable bins by their age for the crosstab.","ba07ceed":"#### Our dataframe looks pretty good at this point, however, we must change the categorical values in Sex to numerical ones and one-hot-encode the Embarked column. We could also one-hot-encode Sex, but since there are only 2 possible values, we can just as well replace 'female' by 1 and 'male' by 0. Let's not forget that we must impute the data (since there are lots of missing values in Age) but we'll get back to this later.","59fedf39":"#### To get a better feeling which kind of values the features have in the data, we take a look at the first 50 rows of the dataframe.\n","72b14e05":"#### Let us check the confusion matrix and try to analyze where the model did wrong.","e355fa41":"#### For final feature selection we will check the mutual infos and the correlations.","2ed74a82":"#### So, our target is 'Survived' and for the model(s) we will drop the columns 'Name', 'Ticket' and 'Cabin' altogether from the data. Since there are not too many features left (12 to be exact), we will keep them at least at this point and, if necessary, see more closely correlation values later.","01eefac7":"#### Before imputing the data, we will split the data to train and test sets. This is done in this order to avoid any leakage from the test set to train set since Imputer uses mean as a default strategy.","f915f05c":"#### It really does seem that the sex of the passenger is a strong indicator for one's survival. However, we must change the categorical values (male, female) to numerical ones. We will do this later.","eeb91f59":"#### The accuracy score with this model is around 80%. One reason for our model not to perform better is perhaps that the data set is relatively small. Also, one must take into account that in this type of case\/scenario there is certainly some natural randomness whether person survives or not. Next we see how well our model predicts one's probability to survive.","761869db":"#### If we look at the impact of each feature to the target, the features SibSp and Embarked_Q have the smallest correlation. These features have also really small impact given by the mutual information so we will drop these two as well as TitleMaster and Parch.","b381b9a1":"### In this notebook we study Titanic survival data (from [Kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic)) and try to predict who will survive and who won't. ","89d574bc":"#### In order to find out which features are significant in predicting whether a passenger survived (having 1 in the 'Survived' column) or not (0) let us inspect some crosstables and their countplots. Since, presumably, for each name there is exactly one passenger and from above we see that ticket numbers are almost one-to-one, we leave Name and Ticket out. On the other hand, cabins are missing from most of the passengers so we will exclude Cabin also. From the known facts of Titanic's story, we expect that the Sex and Pclass will have significant effect on one's survival."}}
