frame.","c07623ee":"If instead you're willing to play the long game, these degree majors might interest you as they tend to be the highest earners once getting to mid-stage of their careers. Most of them tend to have very low unemployment rates, although one might want to consider taking a look at majoring in physics as this might be a little riskier than others!","62c89389":"If we wish to look at a specific major we can. My wife studied Fine Arts in undergraduate and I studied Mathematics so those are the two I chose:","73b8d85c":"Once again we can see the high rate of unemployment for those that majored in Physics, along with Mass Media, Misc. Technologies, and Anthropology. There are very low levels of unemployment for those that majored in education, medical technicians, civil engineering, and theology.","7e63e564":"**Format the data for time-series analysis:**","c00e556d":"Underemployment rates seem to have gone up after both the dot com and the 2008 financial crisis but it seems the recent graduates were effected the more.","aad62b38":"First we take a look at all the degree majors listed in the dataset.","c6ed07e7":"We can sort the early career stage annual income and add some color. We can then do the same for the mid-stage level of those careers.","6492d3b0":"# 2. Visualizing the Degree Majors\n\nFirst let us take a look at all the majors offered and their median annual income early in the career vs mid-stage of their career.\nThe graph is interactive so please feel free to zoom in or hover over specific degree majros.\n\nSome degree majors of interest are Pharmacy, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering as they all have extremely high earnings potentials ($100k+). Pharmacy in particular is interesting as it has such a wide gap in early stage and mid stage career earnings.","813e7938":"I hope you enjoyed and possibly learned something from this notebook!\n\nPlease like and\/or leave a comment if you can.\n\nThanks for reading!","7b8ff537":"Seems like the dot com era had a bit of a negative effect on wages, but overall not much growth has occurred over the last 15 years, although the top 75th percentile seem to have gained the most during that time frame.","a33db473":"# 4. Wages over time\n\nNow let's take a look at a comparison of wages for college graduates and high school graduates over the last few decades.

The effects of the financial crises of the Dot com boom, the 2008 financial crash, and the more recent Covid-19 pandemic are looked at in comparison to wage growth, underemployment and unemployment for all workers.\n","56d44453":"Education might not make you the most money but it does seem to have little very low rates for unemployment.

Unemployment and Underemployment\n\nNow let's take a closer look at unemployment and underemployment.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.investopedia.com defines underemployment as:\n\n\"Underemployment is a measure of employment and labor utilization in the economy that looks at how well the labor force is being utilized in terms of skills, experience, and availability to work. People who are classified as underemployed include those workers who are highly skilled but working in low paying or low skill jobs, and part-time workers who would prefer to be full-time.\"\n\nI took that to mean those that are underemployed tend to have a hard time finding a job within their field of study, not being able to apply their skills learned in university to their daily work.","b1611f3b":"# 1.

We can see if the financials crises along with the Covid-19 pandemic had any effect on unemployment. It seems the two drivers of employment over the last 15 years were in fact the 2008 financial crisis along with the Covid-19 pandemic. These two effected all levels of employment, while the dot com bubble didn't seem to effect unemployment much if at all.","a1e96985":"For underemployment it seems Criminal Justice, Performing Arts, Leisure and Hospitality and Liberal Arts tend to have the highest rates. On the low end is educational fields, engineering fields, and Nursing."}}
