","8042f6cd":"Mrs. Taylor: I like the idea of your project. \n\n3\/10 **Planning & Reflection**: No planning document turned in (0\/4 pts), Yes - Peer Feedback (3\/3), No response to the Reflection statements on the project description (0\/4). \n\n10\/10 **Code compiles** without fault\n\n10\/10 **Comments**: Yes! Comments introduce the start of the program and breaks each fucntional section of the program into parts.\n\n10\/10 **Difficulty & Effort**: \n\n10\/10 **Idea** has sufficient scope, but not fully carried out to include the mathematical operations in a way that adds value to the program. \n\n8\/10 **Print statement(s)** included in meaningful way and works.  Print command is missing which is why the output is not presented like a dialogue to the user. Use punctuation and capitalization as required in written language skills. Syntax to include strings and variables structured correctly. \n\n10\/10 **User input** included in meaningful way and works. \n\n0\/10 An **int\/float variable** is appropraitely created and used. Good job converting your inputs into integers for math operations.\n\n5\/20 **Math Operators**: At least one +, -, *, \/ and one \/\/, % are included and used properly. * is used but has no meaning within the program; \/\/ or % is not used","316ae902":"Donnovan Shifflett 9\/20\/21 4a"}}
