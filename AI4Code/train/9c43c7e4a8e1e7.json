From what I can see, information about what turn a move was taken is incorrect therefore not possible to use to get more in-depth stats\/train an ML model. Let me know if what I'm doing is incorrect, it doesn't make sense that turn information is incorrect if this is the data used by the game to remember the correct state from turn to turn, as the game itself doesn't seem to show many problems with remembering states.\n\nI'm going to use an example from the game, \"jsnell19\" (https:\/\/terra.snellman.net\/game\/jsnell19), using round 2 data (as round 1 data includes game set-up). Let's focus on turn 3 as it starts getting a bit more simple, then:\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)"}}
