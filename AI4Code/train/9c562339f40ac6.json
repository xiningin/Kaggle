A positive expected trend would trigger the action to take the trade opportunity. The chosen model is a fully connected neural network with a cross-entropy loss function classifying opportunities with positive or negative trends. A more statistical model could also have been a good choice given the nature of the problem.\n\nThe **target** in the classification could be response > 0, however the response has a fragile relationship with the features and this relationship is constantly changing over time, so using too much information from the response could lead to overfitting easily. In order to mitigate this I used instead the mean of the responses from all the time horizons provided. This value will be less noisy as it includes shorter time horizons easier to predict.\n\nPCA and an encoder\/decoder network to **denoise** and compress the original features were tested but with no significant change in the results so I decided to use the original features (scaled) straight away to avoid wasting the limited time per inference iteration. It seems that the network deals with noise and collinearity well.\n\n**Feature engineering** is not obvious with anonymized data. I end up feeding the model with a few pairs of features multiplying each other. The idea is to help the learning with significant feature interactions. To select the pairs I trained several TabNet models. Interactions with the highest coefficients in TabNet explanations were selected (6 in total). The addition of these interactions seemed to help with the score a bit in both local CV and public score.\n\n**Generalization** is always key in any prediction problem, but performance will be specially sensitive to overfitting with financial data. Some decisions to take care of generalization were:\n\n* The model limited to 3 layers with the following setup:\n\n```\nbatch_norm -> fully_connected -> leaky_relu -> dropout\n```\n\n* Dropout set to high rates (0.35 in the 1st layer, 0.4 in the 2nd layer, 0.45 in the 3th layer). The same setup has been tested with lower dropout rates (0.2) and the validation score was just slightly better, so I kept the extra regularization.\n\n\n* Blending of pairs of data points as proposed in the paper [mixup: BEYOND EMPIRICAL RISK MINIMIZATION](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1710.09412v2.pdf). This way the new data points fill the \"empty\" space in the training data, which helps to soft the fitting. Also, with this technique is possible to learn the information in data points with weight=0. The blending proportion follows a beta distribution. I chose parameter values to make the distribution close to a uniform in order to increase the level of \"mixup\".","dd9185e1":"* With a time pattern (feature 64 seems to represent time - note that the opening and the closing of the market are busier): 60-68","be1fb36d":"In summary, picking up profitable trades is not good enough to get a high score, it's also important that the profit is evenly distributed across time.

To soften the influence of the response values which would introduce quite a lot of overfitting, the utility score function is modified to randomly pick the response from different time horizons. This avoids overfitting in two ways: more predictable shorter time horizons and more time variability in the response.\n\nOn top of that, noise was added to the response in proportion to its magnitude (standard deviation = response\/2).\n\nSame layers, dropout rates and data blending technique used in the classification network is applied here, but in another attempt to make this model different and still reduce overfitting, the following features were used instead of the original ones:\n\n* A prediction of the general market direction of the day.\n\n\n* A prediction of the general volatility of the day.\n\n\n* Z-scores of the original features of the trade opportunity in regard to the means of the features of the previous 100 opportunities (for the same side, buy or sell).\n\n\nTo get the market trend\/volatility of the day I fit linear models to the means\/stds of the responses grouped by day.","791c47af":"[Jane Street](https:\/\/www.janestreet.com\/), the sponsor of this [competition](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/jane-street-market-prediction), is a *quantitative trading firm with a unique focus on technology and collaborative problem solving*. The challenge is to build a model that receives short-term trade opportunities and decides for each one whether to act and execute the opportunity or to dismiss it.\n\nIt's a tough forecasting problem given..\n\n\n* the fact that a strategy that works well with past data is unlikely to do so in the future.

Different volatility regimes require different strategies.\n\n\n* a low signal-to-noise ratio and multicollinearity that could hinder the learning process.\n\n\n* a time constraint during inference.

The goal is to avoid day information leakage, since each day has its own particular mood and is impacted by financial news that only apply to that day. The model should not rely on the particular information of the day because it won't probably reproduce again in the future.\n\nBetween keeping training and validation days as much as isolated as possible (first x days are for training, last y days are for validation) and trying to include as much time variance in the validation set as possible (spreading validation days across the whole period) I went for the latter. In my experiments I didn't find obvious overfitting caused by mixing validation days with training days. The critical part is to avoid trade opportunities from the same day on both training and validation.\n\n```\n1st partition:\ntraining days: 0, 1, 2,  4, 5, 6,  8, 9, 10, ...\nvalidation days: 3, 7, 11, ...\n\n2nd partition:\ntraining days: 1, 2, 3,  5, 6, 7,  9, 10, 11, ...\nvalidation days: 0, 4, 8, ...\n\netc\n```\n\n","c798c874":"* With trend and heteroscedasticity: 53-59, 84, 89, 90, 95, 96, 101, 102, 107, 108, 110, 111, 113, 114, 116-121"}}
