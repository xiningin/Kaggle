As the years go by, different societies and countries have made accessing, bartering and using weapons more accessible. \n\nBy referring to the data below its certain to say that after 2010 there were major increases in planned incidents.\n\nOr sometimes unorthodox methods are revealed to cut costs such as suicide bombers.","1c77af86":"# *Background:*\ud83d\udca5\n\n*International terrorism*: Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and\/or groups who are inspired by, or associated with, designated foreign terrorist organizations or nations (state-sponsored).\n\n*Domestic terrorism:* Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and\/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\n\nThe current threat that national security faces narrows down to two things - [Lone offenders](http:\/\/) and [**The Internet and social media**](http:\/\/).\n\nLone offenders are individuals often radicalize online and mobilize to violence quickly. Without a clear group affiliation or guidance, lone offenders are challenging to identify, investigate, and disrupt.\n\nInternational and domestic violent extremists have developed an extensive presence on the Internet through messaging platforms and online images, videos, and publications.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/investigate\/terrorism","befa3e4a":"Explanation: You could maybe say that there is an easy\/illegal way of obtaining firearms and explosives in those countries.

Also areas that are corrupt, 3rd world or are struggling also tend to influence the masses.","2dda24be":"![ncc.png](attachment:ncc.png)","d9e6e384":"# EXTRA ANALYSIS DOWN BELOW ------>>>>>","20bffeba":"its supposedly very wide for each day, its not too consistent to know what day they most likely attack with suicides.\nDays that typically have 200-225 suicides are more likely to be targetted days.\nAlthough we would see a sudden surge if it was a planned and organised attack.","783b0f3a":"# Interpreting:\ud83d\udca5\n\n1. It makes sense that Iraq has one of the highest terror attacks since most of them originated from the middle east. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq.\n\n2. The main targets also make sense since property gets damaged from fire and explosions, and military are more likely to get attacked since its a war between groups and countries. \n\n3. Whats interesting is that explosives were the main type of weapon used in these attacks, although its clear to see that only a relatively small proportion are suicide attacks. So its highly unlikely to ever find a suicide bomber in a long drawn out war. It might pertain to the fact that terrorists are more willing and wanting to live."}}
