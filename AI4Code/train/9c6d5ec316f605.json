Predictive analysis<a id = \"18\"><\/a>\n**Q.** Why we are using Naive Bayes?\n\nNaive Bayes is commonly applied to text classification. Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.\n\nThe \u201cNaive\u201d assumption that the Naive Bayes classifier makes is that the probability of observing a word is independent of each other. The result is that the \u201clikelihood\u201d is the product of the individual probabilities of seeing each word in the set of Spam or Ham emails.","0d724e91":"### Counting values in `label`<a id=\"6\"><\/a>","4af89338":"## 10. Conclusion<a id='21'><\/a>\nWe\u2019ve come a long way in your journey to learn about Spam Classification using NLTK(natural language toolkit). Here we are using the Naive Bayes Classification and extracting the word using word-count algorithm. After calculation we find that  Naive Bayes' Classification has more accuracy support. The error rate is very low when we are using the Naive Bayes Classification. Thus, using naive bayes algorithm we can classify ham and spam messages with the accuracy of 97%.","3673d64b":"### Tokenzation<a id='12'><\/a>\nWe will tokenize our dataset using some techniques. Tokenization basically refers to splitting up a larger body of text into smaller lines, words or even creating words.\n\nPunctuations are the unnecessary symbols that are in our corpus documents.\n\nStop words are the most commonly occurring words which don\u2019t give any additional value to the document vector. in-fact removing these will increase computation and space efficiency.","bde6f496":"## 4.
