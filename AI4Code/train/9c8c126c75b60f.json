If you haven't yet, let me explain. The goal of the game is predict a famous character, based of bunch of questions which asked to us. After the each answer, questions are getting more relevant to famous person which is in our mind. Finally, akinator shows his predict. Mostly, he justifies about the prediction.\n\nDecision tree algorithm works behind the akinator. There are splits which decides to person to based on the answers. For example if we are looking for a person which is blonde then it redirects the future predictions to \"blonde\" people. \"Blonde\" input is given by the user as an answer for a question.\n\nIf you want to play the game, the link is below.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.akinator.com\/","704c8aad":"Here is the another probabilstic approach for machine learning.

In order to reduce our prediction to a singe class, we will use \"Majority Voting\".
