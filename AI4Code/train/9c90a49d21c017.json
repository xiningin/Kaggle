So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `reviews.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `reviews.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `reviews.iloc[0:1001]`.","dcec30e7":"# Exercises","145ebbc3":"Look at an overview of your data by running the following line","75cfcd15":"## 6.\n\nCreate a variable `df` containing the `country`, `province`, `region_1`, and `region_2` columns of the records with the index labels `0`, `1`, `10`, and `100`.
