The lowest prices have cars manufactured in 80s and 90s and the highest after 2015 and before 1939.\n\nAlthough there are various definition, cars due to their age can be divided into four main categories: classic, old-timers, young-timers and modern cars. \n* Classic cars were built between 1915 and 1948.\n* Old-timers are cars that are at least 25 years old. In our analysis, these cars are produced between 1949 and 1994. \n* Young-timers are cars 25-15 years old. Inour case, these cars would be manufactured between 1995-2004.\n* The last group are modern cars that are younger than 15 years old it means manufactured after 2004.\n\nUsing these criteria, we can observe that the most expensive are classic and modern cars. The lowest price have young timers. \n","9cfcda27":"As we can see the first and the second place are taken by american companies (Ford and Chevrolet).
