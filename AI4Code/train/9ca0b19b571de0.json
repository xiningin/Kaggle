I see a lot of kernels that are actually blends of blends, and this is for the most part not a good idea.  \n\nA blended solution works best if you **use models that are diverse** as well as give a good score.  So for example, don't blend 2 solutions that both use the same features and the same modeling technique.  A good way to start is to go to the kernels, sort them by best score, then look at each one and find the 2 or 3 top kernels that are not blends themselves.  Preferably choose solutions that use different features and a different modeling approach.  \n\nI did that, and what I see are these 3 amazing kernels:\n\nDistance - is all you need.\nby Sergii\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/criskiev\/distance-is-all-you-need-lb-1-481\n\nLGB public kernels plus more features\nby marcelotamashiro \nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/marcelotamashiro\/lgb-public-kernels-plus-more-features\n\nMPNN\nby fnands\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/fnands\/1-mpnn\n\nPlease go and give each of these kernels an upvote.  \n\nThe the next step is to blend their solutions together using a weighted average approach.  There is some trial and error here to determine the best weights to use for each solution.  We have 5 submissions per day here so you have a lot of tries to get the best weights possible.\n\nOnce you download the solutions provided by other folks, the code is trivial.","1c47df07":"Then just submit and bask in the glory of these other people's work."}}
