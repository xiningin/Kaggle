Provisional Scores Distinction.\n\n***Abstract***\nThis study develops the question about rising suicide rates among young women in the Republic of Korea. There is various feature selection has considered in data processing. With a focus on universal relationship between predictors (gender, age) and the ratio of suicidal deaths, socioeconomic attributes are added to identify significant attributes.\nIn addition to the weak correlation between indicators(population and economic index) and target value, the simplest regression model has emphasized the feature enforcement in expectation. According to the list of coefficient values, the richer dataset is significant to improve the regression model accuracy.\nThe research would eventually help leaders of countries to prevent acceleration on suicide increasement.\n\n***Keywords\u2014suicides rates, regression prediction model***\n\n**Please reach out to me on Unibuddy if you have questions in City's MSc Data Science programme!**\nhttps:\/\/www.city.ac.uk\/study\/ask-a-student?unibuddy=buddies\/students\/5e21c2fcd16678055b9fac23","6c7871a6":"***missingness of HDI is across all years, ages and countries, so not biased towards a particular demographic!***","c776f507":"***the overview after processing***","ee5f5984":"***are there columns with high missingness?***","3c5c70d5":"## Part4.
