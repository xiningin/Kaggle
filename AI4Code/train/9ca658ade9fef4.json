The two-pronged plan, which aligns with federal and state plans, focuses on scaling up specific COVID-19 related interventions, mainly by reinforcing healthcare services, while maintaining critical programmes and activities within the 2020 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).\n\nSomalia has so far recorded five cases and has instituted measures to contain the possible spread of COVID19 including closing schools, banning large gatherings and suspending international and domestic passenger flights. Preventing deaths and debilitating illness are the prime concerns, humanitarian partners are also concerned about the possible impact of the virus on the livelihoods of vulnerable populations in Somalia including internally displaced people, food insecure communities, and people living in locust infested or floodprone areas. The reliance on remittance by relatives in the diaspora is also likely to diminish as bread winners outside the country see their economic opportunities reduced.\n\nGiven the current global context of the outbreak, including the exponential reporting of confirmed cases, the risk of COVID-19 spreading remains high because of crowded living conditions in urban centres and poor hygiene practices.\n\nAccording to WHO, countries in fragile, conflict and vulnerable settings like Somalia are especially at risk for wide-spread community transmission should an imported case go undetected among the general population.\n\n`Somalia\u2019s capacities to prevent, detect and respond to any global health security threat scored 6 out of 100` as measured by the Health Emergency Preparedness Index in 2016.https:\/\/www.africanews.com\/2020\/04\/04\/coronavirus-somalia-somalia-humanitarian-bulletin\/","445b0ad5":"![]()","a853c1d9":"#OCHA AND COVID-19 \n\nThe coronavirus now has a foothold in 216 countries, areas or territories. Some of these are countries that are already in crisis due to conflicts, natural disasters and climate change. They are home to a large number of people in need of emergency assistance.\nThrough these challenging times, OCHA is determined that its crucial life-saving work is sustained. More than 100 million people already rely on support from the United Nations\u2019 humanitarian agencies.\n\nOCHA\u2019s top priority is to ensure that we do the best we can to keep providing life-saving help for those people, while supporting the wider system\u2019s response to COVID-19.\nThe international humanitarian community responding to COVID-19 comprises a vast number of international and local organizations.
