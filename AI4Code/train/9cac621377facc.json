Previously in the NBA, the top picks almost always become NBA superstars and ended up being inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, for example - Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Tim Duncan etc., however, in recent years, this trend has taken a turn. In the last 8 years, the top picks have been a series of busts, for example - the 2013 #1 pick by Cleveland Cavaliers, Anthony Bennett was passed on to various teams and waived off after 4 years in the NBA. Similarly, Josh Jackson who was the 4th Overall pick by Phoenix Suns was passed around 4 teams in 4 years.\n\n#### These incoherent decisions could gravely impact an NBA franchise as most of the player trades include these draft picks as a part of the trade. One of the worst decisions in the history of professional basketball is probably the Charlotte Hornets trading the legendary shooting guard, Kobe Bryant to the Los Angeles Lakers on the day of the draft itself. One irrational decision like this could change the history of the franchise forever. This is exactly why data driven decisions could be better when it comes to drafts. This is why we have decided to break down the process of the draft and allow data to make decisions. We will gather insights from previous draft data and suggest changes to one of the most popular NBA drafts of 2019. This draft class had one of the elite, history-making players the NBA has seen and is compared to the legendary draft class of 2003 with Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Every year, 60 players are drafted into the NBA from various colleges or high schools across the USA but recently the flow of international players has increased with Giannis Antetokounmpo being the first international player with a finals MVP, finals ring, 2x regular season MVPs and Defensive player of the year from Greece.","c5d66e24":"# 2.
