Many methods has been tried to get the best output. One of them is AB Test, which for decades is being used by companies to solve the \"scientific difference\" problems.\n\nBut what is AB Test at all?\n\nAB Test is considered as the first step toward understanding the path of our business. Recently names also as a \"bucket testing\" and \"split-run testing\", AB Test is a user experience research methodology. With this, we can compare statistically the meaning of using or not the new approach of our business; the impact of the new design of our website; the difference of outcome of our employeer and many more.","124138ec":"![AB Report EN.png](attachment:1651909e-1b63-45ca-af5f-e65a0f305332.png)","a87d1600":"**Hypothesis of the AB Test:**\n\nH0 is rejected if **p** < 0.05\nH0 cannot be rejected if **p** isn't < 0.05\n\n**H0**: M1 = M2 - There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups\nIn other words, it did not make a significant difference to our revenues between the use of maximum bidding and average bidding.\n\n**H1**: M1 != M2 - There is a statistically significant difference between the two groups\nIn other words, it has created a significant difference in our revenues between the use of maximum bidding and average bidding.","a1e288fc":"For more descriptive statistics, I will be writing below some percentages useful for any case:","f1198c56":"We need descriptive statistics for both datasets to check the mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.\n\nAlso it's quiet helpful searching for NaN values.

Let's write the report of AB test.**\n\nWe have found the statistical results, so the scientific results are done. But now it's time to write the report and provide our customer with this report of AB testing results in the way the business world can understand.\n\nWriting the report with all necessity informations given would make your work worth more and satisfy your customer. So with that you will define your data analysis services with more qualitative presentation.","e986104d":"**Which statistics are included in AB Test?**\n\nAB Test includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or better said \"two-sample hypothesis testing\". That means AB Test is used to compare the difference between two samples considering two assumptions.\n\nFirst assumption of parametric AB Test is Normal distribution (Normality test) and the second is Homogeneity of variances (homoscedasticity).\n\nNormality test - Calculates if dataset is well-modeled by a normal distribution.\nHomogeneity of variances - Means that if all of it's random variables have the same finite variance.","495fe1e3":"This work has been done with the support of [VBO](https:\/\/www.veribilimiokulu.com\/).\n\nThank your for your reading."}}
