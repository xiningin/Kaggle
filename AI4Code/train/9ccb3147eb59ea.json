Now let's split our data for validation and use random forest classifier to predict our mushroom class.","1ff3bb6d":"WHAT!!! 100% precision in our model! I honestly didn't think that just making dummies would make so much difference. I guess it could be just coincidence, but still it is 100%. Honestly I thought that I would just try to get a brief idea about the model after the first trial and then maybe move onto something more like PCA. But I guess I'll just stop here.(XD) Do let me know what you think about this in the comments and also leave an upvote.\n# Thanks!","ae580080":"Let's now replace all the columns in our data with their respective dummies. The loop below will do that.(I have replaced all except the 'class' feature because it has only 2 values and it won't make any difference even if we dont replace it.)"}}
