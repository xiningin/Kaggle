Lets name it back as **df_test**.","a1ca117e":"Which of the features are more influencing the target variable?\nBy understanding this insted of using all 76 feature, we can use the top most influencing features to train the model.\n\n*We will use a random forest regressor to do that.*","d5fd1188":"Pandas **dataframe.corr()** is used to find the *pairwise correlation* of all columns in the dataframe. Any **na values are automatically excluded.** For any *non-numeric data type columns in the dataframe it is ignored*.\n\n> **Syntax: DataFrame.corr(self, method=\u2019pearson\u2019, min_periods=1)**","f1d8c167":"# Observations:\n\nFrom describe()\n---\n* No NaN(Null) Values.
