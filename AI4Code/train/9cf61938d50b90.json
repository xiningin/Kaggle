Please upvote.","ae1ed2ee":"To estimate the optimal amount of candidates we are going to multiply ```amount_of_tags``` by ```average \/ 5 - 1```.  We divide by 5 because the amount of common tags that we are going for is 5 to check that  take away 1 so that we don't count the slide that we are finding the best match.","494b6ede":"Create a dictionary of tags to see how many ids there are for each tag.","60dfd451":"I think an EDA would be helpful in this competition so I decided to create an extremely basic EDA where you can estimate the optimal amount of candidates to use in a greedy solution."}}
