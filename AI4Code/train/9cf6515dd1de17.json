We can easily see that the petal.length of the setosa variety or species is very less as compared to other  species(versicolor and virginica).Also,setosa petal length ranges from 1 to 2.\n\n2. The petal length of Versicolor variety ranges from 3 to 5.About 20 percentile of the versicolor is having petal length in the range 3 to 4. ALso there is a outlier in the lower extreme of the box plot which states some versicolor have petal length less than 3.\n3. One more thing here is to notice that, versicolor upper extreme is equal to the first quantile range of the virginica variety. from first to second quantile majority of the values are there as it is more broader in shape.This further conclude that there is overlap between the virginica and versicolor species or variety.\n\n4. If we see the virginica box plot wrt to petal length in above cell. We can say that it ranges from 5 to 7.\n   its third quantile lies close to 6.","ff8dee3e":"Let see this value counts on pie chart","f20d3ab5":"There are no missing values for the given dataset.
