For instance, the pipeline below will use [`SimpleImputer()`](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html) to replace missing values in the data, before using [`RandomForestRegressor()`](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) to train a random forest model to make predictions.  We set the number of trees in the random forest model with the `n_estimators` parameter, and setting `random_state` ensures reproducibility.","60d62ec9":"In this exercise, you have explored one method for choosing appropriate parameters in a machine learning model.  \n\nIf you'd like to learn more about [hyperparameter optimization](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hyperparameter_optimization), you're encouraged to start with **grid search**, which is a straightforward method for determining the best _combination_ of parameters for a machine learning model.  Thankfully, scikit-learn also contains a built-in function [`GridSearchCV()`](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) that can make your grid search code very efficient!\n\n# Keep going\n\nContinue to learn about **[gradient boosting](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/xgboost)**, a powerful technique that achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets.","3e74ccda":"You will work with the [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/home-data-for-ml-course) from the previous exercise. \n\n![Ames Housing dataset image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lTJVG4e.png)\n\nRun the next code cell without changes to load the training and validation sets in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`.
