We need to make an effort over a short period of time, otherwise there would be a lockdown,\" Vujnovic said on the Soloviev Live YouTube show.\n\nShe explained that vaccination is essential because it lowers the probability of spreading the virus and lowers the risks of severe disease. However, \"additional measures\" will probably be required as well, Vujnovic warned.\n\nEarlier in June, the WHO included the Delta variant in its list of coronavirus variants of concern as the strain had become prevalent and has caused a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some countries, including Russia. India has also reported multiple cases of the Delta Plus strain, which was first discovered in March.\n\"\"\"\nmodel.predict(text_to_summarize)","2cbb4bb2":"text_to_summarize=\"\"\"summarize: Travellers vaccinated with Covishield may not be eligible for the European Union\u2019s \u2018Green Pass\u2019 that will be available for use from July 1.
