As a lot of articles saying, Kaggle is a great place for people who want to be a data scientist or data analyst to have some experience to meet the requirements of the positions. Me, myself, also made a lot of kernels to be my side projects and portfolio. And they do get me some offers and a great job recently.","a638f05f":"Well, I believer there are more people with more salaries here. I believe those people are hiding in those prefer not to disclose haha","5a97efec":"Most of the people on Kaggle are students. I guess it's because Kaggle is really good for learning and earning experience to be prepared for jobs.  The following three are just classic. A lot of Data Analyst, Scientist and Engineer practice code and join machine learning competitions here. We all know that.","ce5e13cf":"Most of the Kaggler are between 18 and 34 years old, especially 22 to 29.","4158b477":"I think it's not surprised that a lot of users here use Jupyter notebook. And quiet some people use Rstudio as well. However, it's pretty surprised to me that most people use Text and Notepad++. But, to be honestly, I personally use these two tools to edit my codes every now and then to replace all or check some syntax","f06f63bb":"Over 80% of the people here are Male. ","88340cb5":"We can see that the amount of American and Indian are way bigger than that of others. Well, if you stay here for long enough, you can see there are really some great Kagglers from these two countries with some prestigiuos Kagglers from the other countries. In my opinion, I saw some outstanding Kaggler, like [Janio Alexander Bachmann](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/janiobachmann), [Bojan Tunguz](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tunguz), [Erik Bruin](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/erikbruin), [Sang-eon Park](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/caicell), and [Siddharth Yadav](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/thebrownviking20) are all my favorite. They all come from different corner around the world.","8e262030":"### Introduction\n\nThis is a playground for me to have some basic plots here to explore first, also for other people to check up some basic distributions here. I'll also put some notes of my observation. I'll have my analysis in another kernel after finishing here.","11f0cbff":"I'm not surprised that a great amount of Kaggler have Academia or Education backgrounds. A lot of kernels I read are really good for learning and well-organized. I love them. And that's why there are so many students here.","4f97f562":"As I mentioned, I think a lot of students and fresh graduates like me accumulate their works and practice here to be prepared for their first data science job. ","14d95c46":"Since this community is for data science, we can see that Python is dominant here, while followed by R and SQL but way less than the Python users.","a70e91ee":"Well, as we known, most people own a CS degree here. However, I frequently saw outstanding analysis or models made by people with a Physics degree or a Linguistics degree. As a Business major person, I think it has a significant impact on the way I think and how I analyze my data. In the last summer, I was a Product Manager Intern at HTC VIVE. I cowork with people all over the world. And it empowered my capability of defining questions, managin to meet business requirements, and convey how I solve the other people's problems. So, in my opinion, I think people with different degrees and different backgrounds all have their unique way to think.      \n   \n     \nData Scientist Nanodegree of Udacity said there are three elements of being a data scientist: Statistics, Computer Science, and own domain. I can't agree more. I think how a person be a special and outstanding data scientist is to apply his or her own domain to solve the problem with data science in his or her own way."}}
