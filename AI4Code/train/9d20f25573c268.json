Create a new dataframe `IMDb_Top_250` and store the top 250 movies with the highest IMDb Rating (corresponding to the column: `imdb_score`). Also make sure that for all of these movies, the `num_voted_users` is greater than 25,000.\nAlso add a `Rank` column containing the values 1 to 250 indicating the ranks of the corresponding films.\n    2. Extract all the movies in the `IMDb_Top_250` dataframe which are not in the English language and store them in a new dataframe named `Top_Foreign_Lang_Film`.","aa071797":"**Checkpoint 1:** You might have noticed that we still have around `77%` of the rows!","a6442613":"**Checkpoint 3:** Can you spot `Veer-Zaara` in the dataframe?","69377cf2":"-  ### Subtask 2.5: Fill NaN values\n\nYou might notice that the `language` column has some NaN values.

You can let these columns as it is for now. Check the number and percentage of the rows retained after completing all the tasks above.","e6fc2607":"- ### Subtask 3.5: Find the best directors\n\n    1. Group the dataframe using the `director_name` column.\n    2. Find out the top 10 directors for whom the mean of `imdb_score` is the highest and store them in a new dataframe `top10director`. ","eaa38d48":"**Checkpoint 6:** `Leonardo` has aced both the lists!","9fc953ff":"-  ### Subtask 3.3: Drop duplicate values\n\nAfter you found out the top 10 profiting movies, you might have notice a duplicate value. So, it seems like the dataframe has duplicate values as well. Drop the duplicate values from the dataframe and repeat `Subtask 3.2`.","419368a0":"## Task 3: Data Analysis\n\n-  ### Subtask 3.1: Change the unit of columns\n\nConvert the unit of the `budget` and `gross` columns from `$` to `million $`.","12d80c6c":"## Task 2: Cleaning the Data\n\n-  ### Subtask 2.1: Inspect Null values\n\nFind out the number of Null values in all the columns and rows. Also, find the percentage of Null values in each column. Round off the percentages upto two decimal places.","b1716aeb":"## Task 1: Reading and Inspection\n\n### Subtask 1.1: Import and read\n\nImport and read the movie database. Store it in a variable called `movies`.","dcc494be":"-  ### Subtask 3.2: Find the movies with highest profit\n\n    1. Create a new column called `profit` which contains the difference of the two columns: `gross` and `budget`.\n    2. Sort the dataframe using the `profit` column as reference.\n    3. Extract the top ten profiting movies in descending order and store them in a new dataframe - `top10`","69c631ad":"-  ### Subtask 3.7: Find the critic-favorite and audience-favorite actors\n\n    1. Create three new dataframes namely, `Meryl_Streep`, `Leo_Caprio`, and `Brad_Pitt` which contain the movies in which the actors: 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' are the lead actors. Use only the `actor_1_name` column for extraction. Also, make sure that you use the names 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' for the said extraction.\n    2. Append the rows of all these dataframes and store them in a new dataframe named `Combined`.\n    3. Group the combined dataframe using the `actor_1_name` column.\n    4. Find the mean of the `num_critic_for_reviews` and `num_user_for_review` and identify the actors which have the highest mean.","076cdb9f":"-  ### Subtask 2.4: Drop unecessary rows\n\nSome of the rows might have greater than five NaN values. Such rows aren't of much use for the analysis and hence, should be removed.","11bcfcb9":"-  ### Subtask 1.2: Inspect the dataframe\n\nInspect the dataframe's columns, shapes, variable types etc.","8c6aa95a":"-  ### Subtask 2.3: Drop unecessary rows using columns with high Null percentages\n\nNow, on inspection you might notice that some columns have large percentage (greater than 5%) of Null values. Drop all the rows which have Null values for such columns.","73ccad71":"-  ### Subtask 2.2: Drop unecessary columns\n\nFor this assignment, you will mostly be analyzing the movies with respect to the ratings, gross collection, popularity of movies, etc. So many of the columns in this dataframe are not required. So it is advised to drop the following columns.\n-  color\n-  director_facebook_likes\n-  actor_1_facebook_likes\n-  actor_2_facebook_likes\n-  actor_3_facebook_likes\n-  actor_2_name\n-  cast_total_facebook_likes\n-  actor_3_name\n-  duration\n-  facenumber_in_poster\n-  content_rating\n-  country\n-  movie_imdb_link\n-  aspect_ratio\n-  plot_keywords","399c9472":"-  ### Subtask 3.6: Find popular genres\n\nYou might have noticed the `genres` column in the dataframe with all the genres of the movies seperated by a pipe (`|`). Out of all the movie genres, the first two are most significant for any film.\n\n1. Extract the first two genres from the `genres` column and store them in two new columns: `genre_1` and `genre_2`. Some of the movies might have only one genre. In such cases, extract the single genre into both the columns, i.e. for such movies the `genre_2` will be the same as `genre_1`.\n2. Group the dataframe using `genre_1` as the primary column and `genre_2` as the secondary column.\n3. Find out the 5 most popular combo of genres by finding the mean of the gross values using the `gross` column and store them in a new dataframe named `PopGenre`."}}
