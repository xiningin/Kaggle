Each image has at least one cloud formation, and can possibly contain up to all all four.\n- **Data**\n    - An image might be stitched together from two orbits. The remaining area, which has not been covered by two succeeding orbits, is marked black.\n    - **train.csv** contains the run length encoded segmentations for each image-label pair in the train_images\n- Task is to predict the segmentations masks of each of the 4 cloud types (labels) for each image. (Your prediction masks should be scaled down to 350 x 525 px).\n\n# Notes\n- Shallow clouds play a huge role in determining the Earth's climate."}}
