This forest, is a set of decision trees, most of the times trained with the bagging method. The essential idea of bagging is to average many noisy but approximately impartial models, and therefore reduce the variation. Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:\n\n* Let $N$ be the number of test cases, $M$ is the number of variables in the classifier.\n* Let $m$ be the number of input variables to be used to determine the decision in a given node; $m<M$.\n* Choose a training set for this tree and use the rest of the test cases to estimate the error.\n* For each node of the tree, randomly choose $m$ variables on which to base the decision. Calculate the best partition of the training set from the $m$ variables.\n\nFor prediction a new case is pushed down the tree. Then it is assigned the label of the terminal node where it ends. This process is iterated by all the trees in the assembly, and the label that gets the most incidents is reported as the prediction. We define the number of trees in the forest in 100.
