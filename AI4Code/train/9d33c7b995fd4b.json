So open a new window by clicking on [this link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/epf-3a).  Then click on the **Submit Submission** button.\n\nNext, follow the instructions below:\n1. Begin by clicking on the blue **COMMIT** button in the top right corner of this window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n2. After your code has finished running, click on the blue **Open Version** button in the top right of the pop-up window.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n3. Click on the **Output** tab on the left of the screen.  Then, click on the **Submit to Competition** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n\nYou have now successfully submitted to the competition!\n\n4. If you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the blue **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your model and repeat the process. There's a lot of room to improve your model, and you will climb up the leaderboard as you work.\n\n# Continuing Your Progress\nThere are many ways to improve your model, and **experimenting is a great way to learn at this point.**\n\nThe best way to improve your model is to add features.  Look at the list of columns and think about what might affect home prices.  Some features will cause errors because of issues like missing values or non-numeric data types. \n\nThe **[Machine Learning course](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intro-to-machine-learning)** micro-course will teach you basic notion in machine learning."}}
