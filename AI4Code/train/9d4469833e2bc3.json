There can be several reasons to interactions between an officer and a citizen and it is not necessary that all these interactions lead to escalations. But, we all know that some of these do.  \n\nWhile the two main popular theories in the media suggest either bad people or racist officers, there might be a need to understand this in a broader tone. Usually, there are 3 main problems flagged of by popular media and reports(some of these can be accessed [from here](https:\/\/mappingpoliceviolence.org\/)) =>\n* **Police officers are racially biased:** This general school of thought has been a pivotal motivation for the creation of the socially relevant and internationally discussed #BlackLivesMatter movement. One of the most pressing examples proving this idea is the [Stop and Frisk Initiative](https:\/\/www.nyclu.org\/en\/publications\/stop-and-frisk-during-bloomberg-administration-2002-2013-2014). \n* **Present policies do not penalise \"unacceptable\" behaviour from officers:** Officers are supported by laws and unions that protect them even if they have been reckless.\n* **Social Perception that \"Black is dangerous\":** This is prevalent behaviour in communities even today. It's very disturbing to know this. However, with a newer world and smarter people, things are far better than they once were.\n\nThese points above are more likely to act as catalysts to an escalation between officers and common people, especially if they are from a minority section.  ","157c6ea8":"<div class=\"subsection\">Are shootings affected by the racial status of people?<\/div>\n<br><br>\n\nIn recent times, there have been several discussions on the media about police violence and the detrimental effects it has on people, especially the minorities. While most demonstrations against the forces are based on the grounds of racism(such as [#BlackLivesMatter](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Black_Lives_Matter)), it is also important to analyze if the police shootings are driven by racism alone or if there are other factors.  \n\nFor example, it was noticed above how the majority of those shot by the officers were in posession of a firearm. In such situations, officers might have very little choice about what they should do. Such cases necessarily need not be catalysed by racism. However, killing an unarmed person even though there was little threat from the situation does indicate a possible bias.  ","8a1b7ddb":"<div class='section'>Main Points of Interest<\/div>\n<br><br>\n\nA few important but often rarely considered points of views have been explored in this notebook. These themes definitely require further probing and more specific data(if available) in order for policy makers to come to conclusive decisions.  \n\nHowever, here is a summary of the most salient points of this analysis:\n* The United States of America's significant usage of guns and firearms is a factor that could be acting as a major catalyst in the large number of gun-related violence. Most articles talk only about the **uncontrolled use of arms by officers** or the **mass shootings**. Yet, the most important point to discuss has to be reducing the posession of firearms.\n* In majority of the cases when an officer has shot a person, the officer's life or a bystander's life has been under immediate danger\n* People have been shot and killed in encounters with officers even if they were unarmed and fleeing or carrying a toy weapon. Such killings seem very unnecessary on the outlook(yet, a further understanding is required to understand the truth)\n* **Every time an officer shoots a person belonging to the minority, it is not necessarily racial bias. But, bias is not absent.** In fact, it is very much visible in how officers perceive minorities. To be more clear, **\"There was a higher chance of a firearm being present with a shot white person than a black person. Yet, more unarmed black people were shot when compared to the whites.\"**. In the states of California, Texas and Florida that registered the most shooting deaths for the last 5 years, the above statement indicating possible bias holds very true.\n* Most people killed in police encounters are teenagers or young adults. Among young adults, most people killed belong to the minority. But in older age groups, more whites are killed than the minorities. This indicates that minorities need not always be problematic as a race. Maybe the youth in these are caught up on the wrong side of things because of the lack of opportunities they have. It's definitely worth a thought!\n* Police officers have always had a difficult life when it comes to maintaining law and order in the streets in the US as indicated by the number of fallen officers every year since the 18th century. However, things are getting better for them now. But, there needs to be more research to understand if cops shoot becuase of the fear of them losing their lives when encountering a person(who may or may not be potentially dangerous). Especially the history of a cop and his or her victim will help see things way more clearly as to why a shooting happened in the first place.","076eb0d3":"<h1><center>Understanding the Extent of Police Abuse in the United States of America<\/center><\/h1>\n<center><i>Reviewing both sides of the coin with the help of publicly available data<\/i><\/center>\n<br> <br>\n<p>Policing is no-doubt a difficult job.

If this was to be taken as face value representation of the general ideology of cops in the US, there are a couple of important things to takeaway from it - A shot is a death sentence and it is to be issued only when all other doors have been shut.

Of the over 25,000 deaths that have resulted from citizen-police interactions, 78% of these have seen an involvement of a gun. This is rather intuitive to understand because the dataset does account for only deaths due to interactions with the police(who do have access to firearms).  \n\nHowever, [this report](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2019\/08\/16\/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s\/) by the Pew Research Centre published in 2019 provides a very disturbing scenario of gun-related deaths. In 2017 alone, close to 40,000 deaths were registered as gun deaths. This is a big number. 3\/4th of all murders in the US in 2017 involved a firearm. The report also suggests an increase in mass shooting incidents over the past decade or so([Source](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2019\/08\/16\/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s\/ft_19-08-14_gundeaths_4\/)).  \n\nTherefore, it does seem as if gun-related violence is too easy to come by(based on the data provided). Of course, there have been very significant and important measures taken up by policy makers and law enforcers to curb the nuinsance of gun violence([Source](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2019\/08\/16\/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s\/ft_19-08-14_gundeaths_2\/)). Yet, there is no looking away from the fact that the problem still persists. It becomes important to realise that so many deaths courtesy firearms depicts an **easy access to the same**. As per [this](https:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/2013\/05\/07\/chapter-2-firearm-deaths\/), from 2000-2010, around 16,000-19,000 gun-related homicides have happened in the US **per year**. Even if we extrapolate the lower 16,000 per year for the next decade(2010-2020), we see a staggering figure of atleast **320,000 gun-related deaths** between 2000-2020. In contrast to this, the recorded figures as per the data by [Fatal Encounters.org](https:\/\/fatalencounters.org\/) for gun-deaths with police involved is around 25,000 from 2000-2020.  \n\n**Only 8% of all gun-caused deaths are due to involvement with police officers.** So, maybe the real thing to consider is \"How to regulate gun control and violence in the country?\". Also with so much gun violence around, it is to be acknowledged that policing will be a tough job. It might become difficult to understand who is a threat and who is not.  \n\n**But, is that a reason strong enough to get away with killing innocent people? I am afraid not.**","b8bca2cb":"\ud83d\udca1 **INSIGHTS**\n\n* 57% of all fatal shootings by a police officer in the line of duty include the deceased being armed with a gun\n    * In such a scenario, it is very difficult for an officer to make a decision whether to shoot or not\n    * If a suspect is threatening an officer, the officer's options are obviously very limited\n* Another 14% of the times, the deceased had a knife\n    * Again, if the situation is dangerous for a police officer there is little he or she can do to keep things under control\n    * Probably the only way is to use their firearm\n* But, it is an alarming case to see that 6.5% i.e 350 people were **unarmed** at the time they were shot\n    * Why were they shot if they didn't pose a real threat?
