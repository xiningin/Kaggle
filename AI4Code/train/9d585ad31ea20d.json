The data starts to get a little more interesting. I think the noise in the data may be causing some subtle anomolies, but it's pretty interesting that the Oilers are no longer the clear cut leader based on their #1 overall picks, which is actually the opposite of what I was expecting based on the new scoring system.","cb29fe78":"## Need a Better Scoring System\n\nNo surprise that the oilers come out on top, and teams like the Caps would come last. I would have guessed Coyotes and Sabres would be high as well, but I'm a little surprised to see Chicago as high as it is.\n\nObviously the real value of draft picks shouldn't be linear like that since there's a pretty quick dropoff in the players ability to make the NHL if they aren't taken in the first round.\n\nI wanted to examine that, and I think the graph below show just how far and fast it drops off when we look at average NHL games played over the years by each pick. I think it's fair to say that 20+ years of data would probably smooth this out quite a bit, but the distribution seems fine.","bcba0f14":"# Draft Pick EDA\n\nI started by looking at NHL draft data from the last 10 years. Here is a sample of what we have to work with for each year (with some additional stats removed).","bd0f97df":"## Scoring Value of Draft Picks by Team\n\nBeing an Edmonton Oilers fan, I wanted to see just how their high draft picks actually compared to other teams if I applied a points value to each pick. I started with a linear scoring system that assumes the #1 draft pick is worth the most, and the last draft pick is basically worthless.\n\nObviously this system doesn't represent the value of high draft pics very well, but I thought it would be interesting to compare."}}
