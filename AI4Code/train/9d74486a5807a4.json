Attrition is also correlated with OverTime\n\n- As expected, JobLevel is perfectly correlated with monthly income. It is also highly correlated TotalWorkingYears, i.e. work experience.\n\n- Job satisfaction seems to have no correlation with any of the other features.\n\n- Performance Rating is highly correlated with PercentSalaryHike, i.e. high performance earn better raises.","cbb849c4":"Here we observe that using SMOTE actually made our accuracy worse and only slightly improved our True Negative classifications.

I am hoping that through creating these notebooks for datasets that I find on Kaggle I can improve my python, data analysis, and machine learning algorithm skills. \n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNow onto the actual project.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMost, if not all companies invest significant resources into acquiring and training their employees, thus it is always important for them to retain the talent they have invested so much in. Having employees leave your company would mean that even more resources need to be poured into their replacements, who also face the same risks. \n\nThus, it is important for companies to be able to predict employee attrition in order to develop strategies to reduce the phenomena. \n\nIn this kaggle notebook, we will do the following:\n\n* **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Exploring the data and how features correlate to one another.\n* **Feature Engineering** - in order to prepare our categorical data for our machine learning model.\n* **Machine Learning Model Implementation** - Implementing a Random Forest Classifier model for our data.\n\n\n","bd2f0000":"### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nThe first step when tackling any dataset. We must first take a look at our data, explore the relationship between its features, and make some observations.","eba755de":"### Machine Learning Model Implementation\n\nNow that we've explored our data and converted categorical data into numerical data, we can now move forward with the implementation of our ML model.\n\nfor the puropose of this classification task, I've opted for the implementation of a Random Forest Classifier, as it combines the predictive powers of decision trees in order to create a more accurate model.","4745ceea":"Now, we can carry on with our EDA","907b5de1":"Some observations that can be made:\n\n 1. Almost 50% of employees who work overtime end up leaving the company.\n 2. JobLevel = 1 has the highest percentage of attrition (Approx. 26%).\n 3. Almost 50% of employees with TotalWorkingYears = 1 end up leaving the company.\n 4. Laboratory Technicians have the highest percentage of attrition.\n 5. Single employees are more likely to leave the company.\n 6. Employees with a lower JobSatisfaction level are more likely to leave the company.","5ecfd6fb":"### Conclusion\n\nIn this notebook, we implemented a  simple pipeline of predicting employee attrition. We went over some EDA, Feature Engineering, and implemented a straightforward Random Forest Classifier with an 85% accuracy score (though I'm sure it can be improved).\n\nOn that note, more features can be derived from the data that might also help improve the model. I will be coming back to this notebook to give it another go as I improve my python skills."}}
