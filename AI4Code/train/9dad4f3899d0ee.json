Popularity of paid apps vs free apps\nFor apps in the Play Store today, there are five types of pricing strategies: free, freemium, paid, paymium, and subscription.\nLet's focus on free and paid apps only. Some characteristics of free apps are:\n\nFree to download.\nMain source of income often comes from advertisements.\nOften created by companies that have other products and the app serves as an extension of those products.\nCan serve as a tool for customer retention, communication, and customer service.\nSome characteristics of paid apps are:\n\nUsers are asked to pay once for the app to download and use it.\nThe user can't really get a feel for the app before buying it.","c03e1b02":"6. Relation between app category and app price\nSo now comes the hard part. How are companies and developers supposed to make ends meet?\nWhat monetization strategies can companies use to maximize profit? The costs of apps are largely based on features,\ncomplexity, and platform.\n\nThere are many factors to consider when selecting the right pricing strategy for your mobile app.\nIt is important to consider the willingness of your customer to pay for your app.\nA wrong price could break the deal before the download even happens.\nPotential customers could be turned off by what they perceive to be a shocking cost,\nor they might delete an app they\u2019ve downloaded after receiving too many ads or simply not getting their money's worth.\n\nDifferent categories demand different price ranges. Some apps that are simple and used daily,\nlike the calculator app, should probably be kept free. However,\nit would make sense to charge for a highly-specialized medical app that diagnoses diabetic patients.\nBelow, we see that Medical and Family apps are the most expensive. Some medical apps extend even up to $80!\nAll game apps are reasonably priced below $20.","05ecd88e":"\nSize and price of an app :\nHow can we effectively come up with strategies to size and price our app?\n\nDoes the size of an app affect its rating?\nDo users really care about system-heavy apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps?\nDoes the price of an app affect its rating?\nDo users always prefer free apps over paid apps?\n","02674e52":"7. Filter out \"junk\" apps\nIt looks like a bunch of the really expensive apps are \"junk\" apps.\nThat is, apps that don't really have a purpose.\nSome app developer may create an app called I Am Rich Premium or most expensive app (H)\njust for a joke or to test their app development skills. Some developers even do this with malicious intent\nand try to make money by hoping people accidentally click purchase on their app in the store.\n\nLet's filter out these junk apps and re-do our visualization. The distribution of apps under $20 becomes clearer.","32b3edaa":"user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, \nThe text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features:\nSentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), \nSentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.\n","bc6799fc":"9. Sentiment analysis of user reviews\u00b6\nMining user review data to determine how people feel about your product, brand,\nor service can be done using a technique called sentiment analysis.\nUser reviews for apps can be analyzed to identify if the mood is positive, negative or neutral about that app.\nFor example, positive words in an app review might include words such as 'amazing', 'friendly', 'good', 'great', and 'love'. \nNegative words might be words like 'malware', 'hate', 'problem', 'refund', and 'incompetent'.\n\nBy plotting sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps,\nwe observe that free apps receive a lot of harsh comments, as indicated by the outliers on the negative y-axis.\nReviews for paid apps appear never to be extremely negative. This may indicate something about app quality, i.e.,\npaid apps being of higher quality than free apps on average.\nThe median polarity score for paid apps is a little higher than free apps, thereby syncing with our previous observation.\n\nIn this notebook, we analyzed over ten thousand apps from the Google Play Store.\nWe can use our findings to inform our decisions should we ever wish to create an app ourselves.","1802f7d7":"\nData cleaning \nThe four features that we will be working with most frequently henceforth are Installs, Size, Rating and Price. \nThe info() function (from the previous task) told us that Installs and Price columns\nare of type object and not int64 or float64 as we would expect.\nThis is because the column contains some characters more than just [0,9] digits.\nIdeally, we would want these columns to be numeric as their name suggests.\nHence, we now proceed to data cleaning and prepare our data to be consumed in our analyis later.\nSpecifically, the presence of special characters (, $ +) in the Installs and Price columns\nmake their conversion to a numerical data type difficult.\n","4469d911":"\n Distribution of app ratings:\nAfter having witnessed the market share for each category of apps,\nlet's see how all these apps perform on an average. App ratings (on a scale of 1 to 5) impact the discoverability,\nconversion of apps as well as the company's overall brand image. Ratings are a key performance indicator of an app.\n\nFrom our research, we found that the average volume of ratings across all app categories is 4.17.\nThe histogram plot is skewed to the right indicating that the majority of the apps are highly rated with only \na few exceptions in the low-rated apps.\n "}}
