Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a \"dock\" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.\n\n\nA US bike-sharing provider BikeIndia has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. \n\n\nIn such an attempt, **BikeIndia** aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.\n\n\nThey have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:\n\nWhich variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.\nHow well those variables describe the bike demands\nBased on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. \n\n#### Business Goal:\n\nWe are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

This indicates, season can be a good predictor for the dependent variable.\n\n- **mnth**: Almost 10% of the bike booking were happening in the months 5,6,7,8 & 9 with a median of over 4000 booking per month.

This indicates, weathersit does show some trend towards the bike bookings can be a good predictor for the dependent variable.\n- **holiday**: Almost 97.6% of the bike booking were happening when it is not a holiday which means this data is clearly biased. This indicates, holiday CANNOT be a good predictor for the dependent variable. \n- **weekday**: weekday variable shows very close trend (between 13.5%-14.8% of total booking on all days of the week) having their independent medians between 4000 to 5000 bookings. This variable can have some or no influence towards the predictor.
