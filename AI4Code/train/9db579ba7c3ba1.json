The python libraries required are :\n1. pandas \n2. matplotlib\n3. geopandas \n\n> We know that pandas and matplotlib are commmonly used python libraries for data analysis and plotting graphs. Now lets see what is *geopandas*? \n\n> **GeoPandas** is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by **'pandas'** to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by **'shapely'**. Geopandas further depends on 'fiona' for file access and **'descartes'** and **'matplotlib'** for plotting. More details can be found [here](https:\/\/geopandas.org\/)\n\n> How to install geopandas : \n> pip install geopandas\n\n> Don't forget to install all other dependencies required for geopandas!\n\n> Now that we are all set one more thing that we require is a *shape file*. \n> > A **shapefile** is a simple, nontopological format for storing the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features. Geographic features in a shapefile can be represented by points, lines, or polygons (areas)\n\n> > You can download the shape file to plot the map of India with state boundaries from [this link](https:\/\/map.igismap.com\/share-map\/export-layer\/Indian_States\/06409663226af2f3114485aa4e0a23b4)\n\n> We are going to plot on the map - the number of **Paramedical Staffs** available at various district hospitals in India as of 31st March 2019. The data was collected from Open Goverment Data, India.
