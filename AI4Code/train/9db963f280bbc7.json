For example, you might write a query you expect to run only once, and it might be working on a small dataset. In this case, anything that gives you the answer you need will do.\n\nBut what about queries that will be run many times, like a query that feeds data to a website? Those need to be efficient so you don't leave users waiting for your website to load.\n\nOr what about queries on huge datasets? These can be slow and cost a business a lot of money if they are written poorly.\n\nMost database systems have a **query optimizer** that attempts to interpret\/execute your query in the most effective way possible. But several strategies can still yield huge savings in many cases.\n\n# Some useful functions\n\nWe will use two functions to compare the efficiency of different queries:\n- `show_amount_of_data_scanned()` shows the amount of data the query uses.\n- `show_time_to_run()` prints how long it takes for the query to execute.","91a6690e":"In this case, we see a 1000X reduction in data being scanned to complete the query, because the raw data contained a text field that was 1000X larger than the fields we might need.","066638ed":"# Learn more\n\nThese strategies and many more are discussed in [this thorough guide](https:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/library\/view\/google-bigquery-the\/9781492044451\/) to Google BigQuery.  If you'd like to learn more about how to write more efficient queries (or deepen your knowledge of all things BigQuery), you're encouraged to check it out!\n\n# Your turn\nLeverage what you've learned to **[improve the design](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/5045822)** of several queries.","82f8ab54":"### 2) Read less data.\n\nBoth queries below calculate the average duration (in seconds) of one-way bike trips in the city of San Francisco.","fa288ff2":"# Strategies\n\n### 1) Only select the columns you want. \n\nIt is tempting to start queries with **SELECT * FROM ...**. It's convenient because you don't need to think about which columns you need. But it can be very inefficient.\n\nThis is especially important if there are text fields that you don't need, because text fields tend to be larger than other fields.","5b2697b1":"Since there is a 1:1 relationship between the station ID and the station name, we don't need to use the `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` columns in the query.  By using only the columns with the station IDs, we scan less data.\n\n### 3) Avoid N:N JOINs.\n\nMost of the JOINs that you have executed in this course have been **1:1 JOINs**.  In this case, each row in each table has at most one match in the other table.\n\n![JOIN](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fp7oMLq.png)\n\nAnother type of JOIN is an **N:1 JOIN**.  Here, each row in one table matches potentially many rows in the other table.  \n\n![JOIN](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7PxE0Mr.png)\n\nFinally, an **N:N JOIN** is one where a group of rows in one table can match a group of rows in the other table. Note that in general, all other things equal, this type of JOIN produces a table with many more rows than either of the two (original) tables that are being JOINed.\n\n![JOIN](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UsNZZoz.png)\n\nNow we'll work with an example from a real dataset.  Both examples below count the number of distinct committers and the number of files in several GitHub repositories.","9b9ebf3d":"The first query has a large N:N JOIN.  By rewriting the query to decrease the size of the JOIN, we see it runs much faster."}}
