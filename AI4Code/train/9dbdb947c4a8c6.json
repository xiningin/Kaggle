In the code block below, we will execute the `DynamicLogTransformation` class, which, in turn, has the role of applying the logarithmic transformation in a database in a preparation pipeline. The advantage of this class is the previous definition of a list of features to which the transformation will be applied, which is defined by the user.","208afa55":"As mentioned earlier, the shap analysis allows to cross the value of each feature and its respective in the final answer of the model. As a reading example, the result obtained for the variable `Sex_male` indicates that the higher its value (red spot), the less its impact on the model result (left side of the x axis). In a more technical and summarized analysis, it is possible to say that the higher the value of `Sex_male` (that is, the closer to the male gender), the less the value of the probability (low chance of survival).\n\nSimilarly, the reading for the variable `Sex_female` indicates the opposite: female passengers had a greater chance of survival, which, in fact, was investigated and surveyed in the exploratory phase of the project.","98433531":"To validate the impact of the logarithmic transformation on candidate predictive models, we will optionally propose a step in the pipeline that applies this procedure to the numerical features present in the base. With this, we can validate whether the final performance of the model is sensitive to this type of transformation.","ef606b6a":"Overall, the graph above does not show a clear relationship between the influence of age on passenger survival. However, it is possible to highlight some subtle points on the graph, for example, the elevation of the curve at ages \"close to 0\", thus indicating a possible rescue priority given to the youngest children.\n\nThis scenario is also repeated, even more subtly, in a portion of passengers over 80 years old.","004609db":"<a id=\"3.4\"><\/a>\n<font color=\"dimgrey\" size=+2.0><b>3.4 Complete Pipelines<\/b><\/font>\n\n<a href=\"#top\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" role=\"button\" aria-pressed=\"true\" style=\"color:white\" data-toggle=\"popover\">Go to TOC<\/a>","4197ff21":"Throughout the entire project, and especially in this modeling session, the powerful tools of the `mlcomposer` package were used, thus allowing a quick and rich analysis of candidate models, from training to performance evaluation and several other relevant parameters for a more assertive decision on the best model for a given task.\n\nThroughout sections 4.2 and 4.2, each method of the `mlcomposer.trainer` module was executed individually in order to provide a specific analysis on each of the fronts involved. In practical terms, it is not always desirable to separate the analysis individually for each of the available methods and graphs, but to perform all analyzes at once.\n\nWith that in mind, two methods responsible for carrying out all the steps above in a consolidated manner were built within the classifierBinary class. They are: `training_flow()` and `visual_analysis()`. The big difference is due to the need to inform only a few essential arguments so that training, evaluation and generation of analysis graphs can be carried out. Results can be saved in specific user-defined directories.\n\nIn the cell below, we will simulate the execution of these two methods.","e66733b8":"<a id=\"2.5\"><\/a>\n<font color=\"dimgrey\" size=+2.0><b>2.5 The Age Factor<\/b><\/font>\n\n<a href=\"#top\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" role=\"button\" aria-pressed=\"true\" style=\"color:white\" data-toggle=\"popover\">Go to TOC<\/a>","0bf07f06":"Finally, concluding the performance analysis block of the trained models, there is the `shap` analysis as a powerful way to analyze the impact of each of the base features on a given predictive model.

In other words, it can be seen whether a high (or extremely low) value for a given feature can significantly impact the model's output.\n\nFor this rich analysis, we can use the `plot_shap_analysis()` method of the `trainer` object, passing, as main argument, the name of a model already trained by the class and present in the `classifiers_info` attribute.","6d213170":"Analyzing the curves, it is possible to conclude that the models do not suffer from serious overfitting problems, given that the error in the training and validation data is very similar at the end of the 500 samples.

When training a predictive model, we will verify that these features are relevant to the modeling as a whole.\n\nIn addition, it is possible to analyze that, considering a predictive bias, not all columns of the base will be used to predict the survival of the ship's passengers. In practice, columns such as `Cabin`, `PassengerId`, `Ticket` and `Name`, for example, have no practical significance for predictive modeling, being responsible only for key passenger information or unique record indicators. Thus, as a next step, we will apply a feature selection process to choose only the candidate variables within a modeling context.","76f12010":"In some cases, datasets with an unbalanced target variable, that is, an extremely small amount of records for a given class, may present high biases for the classical metrics for the evaluation of classification models.
