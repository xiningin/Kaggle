My short answer would be simple: just continue on your course, you got a great start! By the time you go through Intermediate ML course, you will naturally rank higher.\n\nMy long answer is this notebook. For your convenience (and to substantiate my claim) I shared a version of my notebook on the exercise in the Intermediate ML course that scored me top 13 % in the comp. I left all the code as in the exercise other than adding a few comments for you to see exactly where and how I went a bit further than what was needed to complete the exercise.\n\nMy advice to you and all beginners like me is to try to go a bit further. If you see your score in a comp being the same as the score of thousands of other participants you were likely just following a template. If you see your score as a unique value, however \"good\" or \"bad\", forget about the rank it got you and just be pleased that you did something differently than all the others.
