Most popular encoding schemes are ASCII, Unicode,      ISCII etc.\n \n 1. **ASCII CODE**\n \n   * The most widely used alphanumeric encoding scheme, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), is      used in most microcompute and minicomputers, and in many mainframes. The ASCII code (pronounced \" askee\") is a 7-bit      code, and so it has 27 = 128 possible code groups.\n   \n   * [Partial listing of ASCII Code](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Partial+listing+of+ASCII+Code&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjCmpvIg5_yAhXTo0sFHSB9D1MQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=Partial+listing+of+ASCII+Code&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQgAQ6BwgjEOoCECdQw6w9WJWzPWDktT1oAXAAeACAAa0CiAGtApIBAzMtMZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nsAEKwAEB&sclient=img&ei=FYwOYYK8LdPHrtoPoPq9mAU&bih=722&biw=1536&rlz=1C1RXQR_enIN928IN928#imgrc=ac2pFmEsMdWRIM)\n   \n 2. **ISCII CODE**\n \n   *  With the advent of computerization considerable work has been undertaken to facilitate the use of Indian languages         on computers. These activities were generally limited to specific languages and were independent exercises of             various organizations, thus, making data-interchange impossible. In such a scenario, it was important to have a           common standard for coding Indian scripts. In 1991, the Bureau of Indian Standards adopted the Indian Standard Code       for Information Interchange (ISCII), the ISCII standard that was evolved by a standardization committee. This is an       eight-bit code capable of coding 256 characters. ISCII code retains all ASCII characters and offers coding for             Indian scripts also. Thus, it is also called Indian Scripts Code for Information Interchange.\n     \n  *  [Example of ISCII CODE table Gujarati](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=iscii+code+table&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiEyfeoh5_yAhWPs0sFHcC2CIIQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=ISCII+&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBggAEAoQGDIGCAAQChAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYOgcIIxDqAhAnOgQIIxAnOggIABCABBCxAzoICAAQsQMQgwE6BAgAEEM6CwgAEIAEELEDEIMBOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOgcIABCxAxBDOgQIABAeOgYIABAFEB5Qw4ATWMCXE2CtpRNoAXAAeACAAY0CiAGVCpIBBTAuMi40mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWewAQrAAQE&sclient=img&ei=BZAOYcSyNo_nrtoPwO2ikAg&bih=722&biw=1536&rlz=1C1RXQR_enIN928IN928#imgrc=PE6CFhhWSenu5M)\n  \n3. **UNICODE** \n  \n    * Unicode is developed as a universal character set with an aim:\n\n     1.
