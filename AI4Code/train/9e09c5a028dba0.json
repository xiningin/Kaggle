Central tendency measures like, mean, median, or measures of the spread, etc are used for statistical analysis. To better understand Statistics lets discuss the different measures in Statistics with the help of an example.\n\nHere is a sample data set of cars containing the variables:\n\n* Cars\n* Mileage per Gallon (mpg)\n* Cylinder Type (cyl)\n* Displacement (disp)\n* Horse Power (hp)\n* Real Axle Ratio (drat).\n\nBefore we move any further, let\u2019s define the main Measures of the Center or Measures of Central tendency.","d823232c":"### Plot a Histogram\nThe Histogram is used to display the frequency of data points:","3b4e16e3":"## Measures of the Spread:\n\nMeasures of spread describe how similar or varied the set of observed values are for a particular variable (data item). Measures of spread include the range, quartiles and the interquartile range, variance and standard deviation. And they are as follows:\n\n* **Range**: It is the given measure of how spread apart the values in a data set are.\n\n$$range = x__max - x__min$$\n\n* **Inter Quartile Range (IQR)**: It is the measure of variability, based on dividing a data set into quartiles.\n\n$$Inter Quartile Range (IQR) = Q_3 - Q_1$$\n\n* **Variance**: It describes how much a random variable differs from its expected value. It entails computing squares of deviations.\n    * **Deviation** is the difference between each element from the mean.\n    \n    * **Population Variance** is the average of squared deviations.\n    \n        $$ S^2 = \\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\bar{x})}{N} $$\n        \n    * **Sample Variance** is the average of squared differences from the mean.\n    \n        $$ S^2 = \\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\bar{x})}{n-1} $$ \n        \n* **Standard Deviation**: It is the measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.\n\n    $$ \\sigma = \\sqrt(\\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\mu)}{N}) $$\n\nNow that we\u2019ve seen the stats and math behind Descriptive analysis, let\u2019s try to work it out in **Python**\n","613c71e1":"### What is Descriptive Statistics?\n\n    Descriptive Statistics uses the data to provide descriptions of the population, \n    either through numerical calculations or graphs or tables. \n    \nDescriptive Statistics helps organize data and focuses on the characteristics of data providing parameters. By taking same example from previous example of Alkaline level in water. Using the Descriptive Statistics Analysis Technique, we will measure the minimum, maximum and average level of alkaline in water bodies like lake, well, ponds, ground water pump or river. \n\nAlso presenting the collected information graphically we could get the overall information about the level of alkaline in water.","200b354d":"### Measure of spread:\n\n* Range\n* Inter Quantile Range(IQR):\n* Variance:\n    * Deviation:\n    * Population Variance:\n    * Sample Variance:\n * Standard Deviation:","39472f98":"### Descriptive Statistics in Python\n\nIt\u2019s always best to perform practical implementation to better understand a concept. In this section, we\u2019ll be executing a small demo that will show you how to calculate the Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation and how to study the variables by plotting a histogram. This is quite a simple demo but it also forms the foundation that every Machine Learning algorithm is built upon.","4af46153":"In This Kernel we will cover Descriptive Statics topics using Python on Gap Minder Datasets. We will cover practical implementation of it using python.\n\n**Data Sets Information** : This datasets provides data about the population, life expectancy and GDP in different countries of the world from 1952 to 2007.

In this case, we\u2019ll take the sum of the Alkaline level from various water bodies   for particular region or take average of all region for particular water bodies like, well or lake,       river etc.\n\n**Mean**  60+79+49+45+59+55+50+77+57+39+32+65\/12 = 55.5833\n\n* If we want to find out the center value of Alkaline level datasets, we will arrange the alkaline level   values in ascending or descending order and choose the middle value. In this case, we have 8 values       which is an even entry. Hence we must take the average of the two middle values. \n\nAlkaline level if water dataset : 21,21,21.3,22.8,23,23,23,23\n\n**Median** : (22.8+23 )\/2 = 22.9\n\n* If we want to find out most common number of Burger eaten on Retaurent we will check the Burger name     which is repeated nost mumber of times. Here we can see that the Burger come in two values, 4 and 6.     Take a look at the data set, you can see that the most recurring value is 6. Hence 6 is our **Mode**.","575a4fa2":"## A Complete Guide To Descriptive Statistics.\n\nIn Previous [Kernel](http:\/\/https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abkedar\/a-complete-guide-to-statistics-for-data-science-1), we cover Introduction of \n* What is Statistics? \n* How it is use in the Data Science?\n* Catrgories of Statistics.\n* And Brief Explanation of Inferencial Statistics with Code.\n\nIn this Kernel we will cover the Following Points:\n\n* Understanding Descriptive Analysis\n* Inferential Statistics In Python","c3986483":"### Measures Of The Center:\n\nA measure of central tendency (measure of center) is a value that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position of the data set (as representative of a \"typical\" value in the set).

Mean: Measure of average of all the values in a sample is called Mean.\n2. Median: Measure of the central value of the sample set is called Median.\n3. Mode: The value most recurrent in the sample set is known as Mode."}}
