If you run into any issues then up subdivisions to 32.\n\nMake the rest of the changes to the cfg based on how many classes you are training your detector on.\n\nNote: I set my max_batches = 6000, steps = 4800, 5400, I changed the classes = 1 in the three YOLO layers and filters = 18 in the three convolutional layers before the YOLO layers.\n\nHow to Configure Your Variables:\n\nwidth = 416\n\nheight = 416 (these can be any multiple of 32, 416 is standard, you can sometimes improve results by making value larger like 608 but will slow down training)\n\nmax_batches = (# of classes) * 2000 (but no less than 6000 so if you are training for 1, 2, or 3 classes it will be 6000, however detector for 5 classes would have max_batches=10000)\n\nsteps = (80% of max_batches), (90% of max_batches) (so if your max_batches = 10000, then steps = 8000, 9000)\n\nfilters = (# of classes + 5) * 3 (so if you are training for one class then your filters = 18, but if you are training for 4 classes then your filters = 27)\n\nOptional: If you run into memory issues or find the training taking a super long time. In each of the three yolo layers in the cfg, change one line from random = 1 to random = 0 to speed up training but slightly reduce accuracy of model. Will also help save memory if you run into any memory issues.","161c664b":"Copy configuration file to root after change it","dbdc480b":"# This step involves properly configuring your custom .cfg, obj.data, obj.names, train.txt and test.txt files.\n\n# It is important to configure all these files with extreme caution as typos or small errors can cause major problems with your custom training.","d4c9c87f":"# You will also create a obj.data file and fill it with \n1.
