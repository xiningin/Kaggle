So it is advised to drop the following columns.\n-  color\n-  director_facebook_likes\n-  actor_1_facebook_likes\n-  actor_2_facebook_likes\n-  actor_3_facebook_likes\n-  actor_2_name\n-  cast_total_facebook_likes\n-  actor_3_name\n-  duration\n-  facenumber_in_poster\n-  content_rating\n-  country\n-  movie_imdb_link\n-  aspect_ratio\n-  plot_keywords","ab74e2dc":"## Task 2: Cleaning the Data\n\n-  ### Subtask 2.1: Inspect Null values\n\nFind out the number of Null values in all the columns and rows. Also, find the percentage of Null values in each column. Round off the percentages upto two decimal places.","73821a8f":"-  ### Subtask 3.6: Find popular genres\n\nYou might have noticed the `genres` column in the dataframe with all the genres of the movies seperated by a pipe (`|`). Out of all the movie genres, the first two are most significant for any film.\n\n1. Extract the first two genres from the `genres` column and store them in two new columns: `genre_1` and `genre_2`. Some of the movies might have only one genre. In such cases, extract the single genre into both the columns, i.e. for such movies the `genre_2` will be the same as `genre_1`.\n2. Group the dataframe using `genre_1` as the primary column and `genre_2` as the secondary column.\n3. Find out the 5 most popular combo of genres by finding the mean of the gross values using the `gross` column and store them in a new dataframe named `PopGenre`.","5017047e":"**Checkpoint 1:** You might have noticed that we still have around `77%` of the rows!","5cf8e564":"-  ### Subtask 2.4: Fill NaN values\n\nYou might notice that the `language` column has some NaN values.

Group the dataframe using the `director_name` column.\n    2. Find out the top 10 directors for whom the mean of `imdb_score` is the highest and store them in a new dataframe `top10director`.  Incase of a tie in IMDb score between two directors, sort them alphabetically. ","69c9b5c8":"**Checkpoint 6:** `Leonardo` has aced both the lists!","ff3faf8e":"-  ### Subtask 3.4: Find IMDb Top 250\n\n    1. Create a new dataframe `IMDb_Top_250` and store the top 250 movies with the highest IMDb Rating (corresponding to the column: `imdb_score`). Also make sure that for all of these movies, the `num_voted_users` is greater than 25,000.\nAlso add a `Rank` column containing the values 1 to 250 indicating the ranks of the corresponding films.\n    2. Extract all the movies in the `IMDb_Top_250` dataframe which are not in the English language and store them in a new dataframe named `Top_Foreign_Lang_Film`.","23b4098e":"## Task 3: Data Analysis\n\n-  ### Subtask 3.1: Change the unit of columns\n\nConvert the unit of the `budget` and `gross` columns from `$` to `million $`.","0902d02a":"-  ### Subtask 1.2: Inspect the dataframe\n\nInspect the dataframe's columns, shapes, variable types etc.","59a431db":"-  ### Subtask 3.7: Find the critic-favorite and audience-favorite actors\n\n    1. Create three new dataframes namely, `Meryl_Streep`, `Leo_Caprio`, and `Brad_Pitt` which contain the movies in which the actors: 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' are the lead actors. Use only the `actor_1_name` column for extraction. Also, make sure that you use the names 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' for the said extraction.\n    2. Append the rows of all these dataframes and store them in a new dataframe named `Combined`.\n    3. Group the combined dataframe using the `actor_1_name` column.\n    4. Find the mean of the `num_critic_for_reviews` and `num_users_for_review` and identify the actors which have the highest mean.\n    5. Observe the change in number of voted users over decades using a bar chart. Create a column called `decade` which represents the decade to which every movie belongs to. For example, the  `title_year`  year 1923, 1925 should be stored as 1920s. Sort the dataframe based on the column `decade`, group it by `decade` and find the sum of users voted in each decade. Store this in a new data frame called `df_by_decade`.","ba900b3a":"**Checkpoint 4:** No surprises that `Damien Chazelle` (director of Whiplash and La La Land) is in this list.","418ac534":"-  ### Subtask 3.2: Find the movies with highest profit\n\n    1. Create a new column called `profit` which contains the difference of the two columns: `gross` and `budget`.\n    2. Sort the dataframe using the `profit` column as reference.\n    3. Plot `profit` (y-axis) vs `budget` (x- axis) and observe the outliers using the appropriate chart type.\n    4. Extract the top ten profiting movies in descending order and store them in a new dataframe - `top10`","8f5697a5":"## Task 1: Reading and Inspection\n\n-  ### Subtask 1.1: Import and read\n\nImport and read the movie database. Store it in a variable called `movies`.","8d718eb0":"-  ### Subtask 2.5: Check the number of retained rows\n\nYou might notice that two of the columns viz. `num_critic_for_reviews` and `actor_1_name` have small percentages of NaN values left. You can let these columns as it is for now. Check the number and percentage of the rows retained after completing all the tasks above.","e355b7aa":"-  ### Subtask 3.3: Drop duplicate values\n\nAfter you found out the top 10 profiting movies, you might have noticed a duplicate value. So, it seems like the dataframe has duplicate values as well. Drop the duplicate values from the dataframe and repeat `Subtask 3.2`. Note that the same `movie_title` can be there in different languages. "}}
