The learning rate $\\alpha$  determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may \"overshoot\" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.\n\nLet's compare the learning curve of our model with several choices of learning rates. Run the cell below.
