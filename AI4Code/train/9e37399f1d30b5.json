(You can see how the number of fits can grow pretty quickly as we increase the number of parameters!)   \n\nThe good news is that SkLearn's grid search allows us to run the job in parallel. Including the `n_jobs=-1` argument below let's grid search run on all of the available cores on the host machine.","ca31d7ed":"# Titanic challenge part 2\nIn this kernel, we will be covering all of the steps required to train, tune and assess a random forest model. \n\n[**Part 1**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jamesleslie\/titanic-eda-wrangling-imputation\/notebook) of this series dealt with the pre-processing and manipulation of the data.

Cross-validation\nKeeping a separate validation set means that we have less data on which to train our model. Cross-validation allows us to train our model on _all_ of the data, while still assessing its performance on unseen data.\n\nK-folds cross validation is the process of creating *k* different train\/validate splits in the data and training the model *k* times.\n\n![CV](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1c\/K-fold_cross_validation_EN.jpg)   \n\nIn the image above, k=4. This means that the model will be trained 4 times, each time using 1\/4 of the data for validation. In this way, each of the four 'folds' takes one turn sitting out from training and is used as the validation set.   \n\nLet's combine our train and validation sets back into one training set, and then use cross-validation to assess our model:","bc36da42":"<a id=\"grid-search\"><\/a>\n## 3.3. Hyperparameter tuning\nOur first model didn't do too badly! It scored over 80% on the CV score.

Encode categorical variables\nWe need to convert all categorical variables into numeric format.

Regular label encoding assigns some category labels higher numerical values. This implies some sort of scale (Embarked = 1 is not **more** than Embarked = 0 - it's just _different_). One Hot Encoding avoids this problem.   \n\nWe will assume that there is some ordinality in the `Pclass` variable, so we will leave that as a single column.","ef991c48":"### Validation set\nSince we can't use our test set to assess our model (it doesn't have any labels), we will create a separte 'validation set'.

We will select a few different parameters that we want to tune, and for each one we will provide a few different values to try out. Then grid search will fit models to every possible combination of these parameter values and use **cross-validation** to assess the performance in each case.   \n\nFurthermore, since we are using CV, we don't need to keep a separate validation set.","ba1d82be":"Now we have all of training data again.
