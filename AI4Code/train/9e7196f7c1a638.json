","ffe364d6":"This code creates titles for the subplots that we will create to visualize the top hashtags.  \nThe hashtags will be counted twice for each account. Once using a normal count 'Absolute Freq' and once using a weighted count 'Wtd. Freq'. The weighted frequency takes into consideration the number of retweets a tweet got when it contained that particular hashtag. This is usually more interesting because some hashtags get used a lot but don't generate a lot of retweets and vice versa. The best is to get both counts and see how they compare. ","b7db74a6":"This give a better view of what is happening, and I think it would be better to dig deeper into each account and see if there are other patterns.  \nIt could be that the use of the other accounts started recently? This can easily be explored by changing some parameters in the previous visualization.  \nLet's see what languages are used the most. The `tweet_lang` column shows this, but it is not 100% accurate, and in some cases you have 'und' for undefined values. ","4bfd7eed":"<a id='hashtags'><\/a>\n## Top Hashtags","c9a5bd79":"This mapping shows the main user account (not club name), mapped to its sub-accounts. What we need is to invert this mapping (have the handles as keys, and club names as the values). \nWe will also need to use a dictionary that maps the main Twitter handles to their respective club names to do the mapping.  \nThe `defaultdict` data structure is perfect for this kind of task, and the following code achieves this. ","516fabd8":"As you can see above, the account @FCBarcelona used the hashtag #messi 349 times and #for\u00e7abar\u00e7a 681 times (on the Absolute Freq side). However, looking at the weighted frequency, you will see that tweets containing #messi generated a total of 1.55M retweets.\n\n<a id='mentions'><\/a>\n## Top Mentions\nWe can do the same and see who are the accounts that are mentioned the most, and which accounts when mentioned generate the most retweets. Again you can weight by something else like the number of favorites for example. ","df87c5cd":"## Getting the Sub-accounts\nUsually on Twitter profiles, users list other accounts that they are affiliated with. In this case the clubs have links (as mentions) to all the other accounts they have. Sub-accounts are typically for other languages, but not all of them.  \n`advertools.extract_mentions` can get us the mentions in any text list, together with some summary statistics about those mentions.  \nHere we extract the mentions, and then put them together with the main accounts in one list. ","05bd2e75":"The original size of this DataFrame is around 66MB, and there are many duplicated values. A good strategy is to convert the columns that have a few values repeated many times to the `category` data type. This way they are represented as integers, and take up much less memory.  \n\nThe following code identifies the columns where the number of unique values is less than 250 (out of 131k), which means there are many repetitions.  \nAfter that `category_cols` become keys in a dictionary, whos values are all 'category'.  \nOnce this is done, we can simply change the data types by running `astype` on the DataFrame, and passing our dictionary as the argument.  \nThis reduced the size of the DataFrame to almost half its original size.","df1359ba":"Around 8% of tweets contain questions. Not massive, but not negligible either. ","161c510f":"Because we have several accounts that belong to the same club, I think it would be useful to map the handles to their respective clubs, and add them as a column to our DataFrame.   \nWe first create a dictionary with the keys being the `screen_name`s of our `user_dfs` DataFrame, and the values as the extracted mentions from their descriptions. As a result we can see a list of sub-accounts corresponding to each main account.\n","fdfade5f":"Now we can simply use the `map` method on the `club_tweets['user_screen_name']` to achieve this.

For example, the word \"goal\" would almost certainly outperform any other word on engagement, simply because this is what people are waiting for, and it is is by definition the highlight of the match.  \nIn this case however, because the dots are essentially meaningless, and if I understood correctly, they are mainly for attracting people's attention, then I think it makes sense to look at the numbers in this way. \n\n\n## Further Information\/Resources\n- [Documentation for the `advertools.twitter` module](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/eliasdabbas\/twitter-in-a-dataframe)\n- [A tutorial on some concepts in analyzing text, especially for social media](https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/text-analysis-for-online-marketers\/)\n- [Extracting entities from social media posts](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/eliasdabbas\/extract-entities-from-social-media-posts)","31366e4f":"Feel free to modify this visualization with more\/fewer hashtags, other clubs or weighting by other criteria.

","c56f769b":"English is not surprising, but it's really interesting that Arabic is the second most used language.  \nIt would be interesting to figure out why. It might be because the Arabic script is unambiguous, whereas the Latin script can be used for all the Latin languages, so it's not always easy for Twitter algorithms to detect if a Tweet is in Spanish or Italian for example?\nAs an example what language is this tweet in?\n\n>15.

It seems engagement rates on tweets containing \ud83d\udd34 are higher when you don't use it.

What do they mean?  \nFirst, let's see if using those dots increases engagement.  \nWe can `describe` the DataFrame containing only the favorites and retweet counts to see the effect of the red dot.  \nThis code does this for tweets containing it, and the following code does the same for tweets _not_ containing it.
