We will be working with stock data from Google, Apple, and Amazon. All the stock data was downloaded from yahoo finance in CSV format. In your workspace you should have a file named GOOG.csv containing the Google stock data, a file named AAPL.csv containing the Apple stock data, and a file  named AMZN.csv containing the Amazon stock data. (You can see the workspace folder by clicking on the Jupyter logo in the upper left corner of the workspace.) All the files contain 7 columns of data:\n\n**Date Open High Low Close Adj_Close Volume**\n\nWe will start by reading in any of the above CSV files into a DataFrame and see what the data looks like.","a2f099db":"You can check that the dataframes have been joined correctly by displaying the `all_stocks`  dataframe","eac2abb2":"Now that you have eliminated any *NaN* values we can now calculate some basic statistics on the stock prices.

However, for each stock data you will only be interested in loading the `Date` and `Adj Close` columns into the Dataframe. In addtion, you want to use the `Date` column as your row index. Finally, you want the DataFrame to recognize the dates as actual dates (year\/month\/day) and not as strings. For each stock, you can accomplish all theses things in just one line of code by using the appropiate keywords in the `pd.read_csv()` function. Here are a few hints:\n\n* Use the `index_col` keyword to indicate which column you want to use as an index. For example `index_col = ['Open']`\n\n* Set the `parse_dates` keyword equal to `True` to convert the Dates into real dates of the form year\/month\/day\n\n* Use the `usecols` keyword to select which columns you want to load into the DataFrame. For example `usecols = ['Open', 'High']`\n\nFill in the code below:","59e24c22":"We can also visualize the rolling mean by plotting the data in our dataframe. In the following lessons you will learn how to use **Matplotlib** to visualize data. For now I will just import matplotlib and plot the Google stock data on top of the rolling mean.

We can calculate for example the rolling mean (moving average) of the Google stock price by using the Pandas `dataframe.rolling().mean()` method. The `dataframe.rolling(N).mean()` calculates the rolling mean over an `N`-day window. In other words, we can take a look at the average stock price every `N`  days using the above method.

However, before you do this, it is necessary that you change the name of the columns in each of the three dataframes. This is because the column labels in the `all_stocks` dataframe must be unique. Since all the columns in the individual dataframes have the same name, `Adj Close`, we must change them to the stock name before joining them. In the space below change the column label `Adj Close` of each individual dataframe to the name of the corresponding stock. You can do this by using the `pd.DataFrame.rename()` function. ","71772370":"You will now join the three DataFrames above to create a single new DataFrame that contains all the `Adj Close` for all the stocks. Let's start by creating an empty DataFrame that has as row indices calendar days between `2000-01-01`  and `2016-12-31`. We will use the `pd.date_range()` function to create the calendar dates first and then we will create a DataFrame that uses those dates as row indices:"}}
