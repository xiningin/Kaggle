The same amount has been sold, but with many differences. The average price of organic was higher, but Total Volume was significantly higher in conventional than organic The average price ranged from 0.5 to 2.5, where 2017 was the year in which the average price was higher than usual, while 2018 was the year in which the maximum value of the average price decreased As for the months, the month 9 was the owner of the largest price There was a strong relationship between all the data, so the lower the average price, the more the rest of all the elements decreased. For Large Bags and Small Bags, the less the relative proportions of organic The country with the lowest Total Volume is (\"Albany\") with value (\"32374.756449704146\") The country with the highest Total Total is (\"WestTexNewMexico\") with value (\"17351302.31301776\") The country with the lowest AveragePrice is (\"Albany\") with value (\"1.0479289940828398\") The country with the highest AveragePrice is (\"WestTexNewMexico\") with value (\"1.8186390532544363\")"}}
