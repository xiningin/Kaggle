Maximum use of force incidents are centered in district 1 where approximately 4,000 incidents occured in last 5 years. While in District 2 and District 3, only about 1000-1200 incidents occured.  \n- This data suggests that about use of force on Blacks was 3 times that of Whites. The percentage of Blacks being targeted equals 60% on an average which is quite higher than the other races, espicially Whites.  \n- About 71% of the police incidents are targeted on Blacks (population : 20%) while only, 27% incidents are targeted on Whites (population : 72%). Similarly, Asian population proportion is very low (about 1.5%) in all districts, but the use-of-force on them is higher (6.5% incidents).  \n- In three districts (1, 3, and 4), the subjects, the proportion of blacks being injured is very high ( about 50% in Dist 1, and 3, and about 80% in dist 4). However their population proportion in these districts is only (26%, 17%, and 40% respectively)  \n- Though the aggregted black's population is only 18% in all the districts, but the different use-of-force by police is on-an-average about 60% on blacks.  \n- While in districts 2 and 5, surprizingly a higher percentage of white population is stopped for vehicle checks. This also aligns with the subject injuries insights that we saw were higher among whites in district 2 and 5.  \n\n\nAll insights are obtained from the analysis framework and the detailed explanaions are provided in section 2. \n\n<a id=\"2\"><\/a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.

There are two main datasets : Enriched district level data and processed Police Incidents Data. ","7c108f09":"**Interpretations** \n\n> - Unlike the trends obtained about use-of-force incidents, vehicle stops are highest in district 5 (equal to 1743 in the year 2017). District 1 which had the maximum use of force incidents in 2012 - 2017 had lower vehicle stops incidents equal to 1098 in the year 2017. \n\n<a id=\"2.7\"><\/a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.7. Vehicle Stops : Is there any Racial Bias ? <hr><\/font>\n\nIt will be interesting to see how vehicle stops are distributed by Race (espicially Blacks and Whites) across different districts of this department. ","d2da0766":"**Graph Interpreatation** \n\n*Every bar represents the percentage of use-of-force used on a particular race in a particular year.* \n\n**Inferences**  \n> - The plot shows clear **disproportionate numbers related to police activity** among different races.  About 60% of the times, use of force was used on Black individuals.   \n> - In comparison with White Subjects, the use of force on Blacks was **3 times that of Whites**.  \n\n**Controlled Analysis:** \n\nCurrently, these plot only shows the absolutes, we need to first control these numbers according to the population proportion. So we plot the comparative charts of police activity and population porportion. Due to data availability, we focus on three main races of the district : blacks, whites, and asians. ","128c520b":"**Graph Interpretations**\n\n*Every subplot represents a type of use-of-force distriction by race. Size of every bubble represents the percentage of respective race on which the force was used.* \n\n**Inferences**\n\n> - The above plot also depicts that, by comparing the porportion of black population, irrespective of type of use of force, the activity has always been higher on blacks. Though the **total black population is only about 18%** , the use-of-force by police is always much higher than any other race. \n> - On an average black subject's are victim of force used for about 60% of the time.    \n> -  Crowd Control Mace, Compliance, and Conscious Neck Restraint are the force types in which blacks are targeted the highest.  \n\n<a id=\"2.5\"><\/a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.5 Not all age groups are targeted similarly !  <hr><\/font>\n\nLet's look at how these incidents are distributed by different age-groups and by race. ","f8c76a20":"<a id=\"2.1\"><\/a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.1 Overview : Use-of-Force (2012-2015) <hr><\/font>\n\nLet's look at an high level overview of the police activity (use of force) in different districts. The following plot shows the aggregated police activity in different districts served by the department. The leged of the graph is explained in following representations:  \n\n- Department Districts :  <font color=\"blue\">blue polygons<\/font>  \n- Aggregated Total incidents : <font color=\"green\">green circles<\/font>  \n- 2015 Use-of-Force incidents : <font color=\"red\">red points<\/font>","ddd3c657":"**Inferences**\n\n> **Ideal Scenario :** More Crime Means More Vehicle Stops and More Use of Force   \n> ie. Radius :  RedCircle (crime) < GreenCircle (VehicleStops), GrayCircle (Use of Force) \n\nHowever,  From this graph, we can note following points: \n\n> - In District 1 and District 4, the use of force incidents are much higher than the aggregated crime in the districts. Though the vehicle stops are lesser.  \n> - District 2, 3, and 5 tells a different story, the relative propotion of crime incidents is very high however the use-of-force and vehicle stops are much lower in these districts. Also, we established earlier that in district 3, their exists racial disparity. \n\n#### Black Population Proportions in respective districts\n\nLet's add another important information in this graph : the proportion of black population. Here, we want to check if the crime rate is higher where black population is higher. "}}
