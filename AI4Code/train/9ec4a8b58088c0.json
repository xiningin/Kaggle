Some examples of A\/B testing include:\n* Testing two soil treatments to determine which produces better seed germination.\n* Testing two therapies to determine which supresses cancer more effectively.\n* Testing two prices to determine which yields more net profit.\n* Testing two web headlines to determing which produces more clicks.\n* Testing two web ads to determine which generates more conversations.","46518c41":"# Introduction","d64851cd":"# A\/B Testing","1fa6515b":"A proper A\/B test has subjects that can be assigned to one treatment or another. The subject might be a person, a plant seed, a web visitor, etc.; the key is that the subject is exposed to the traetment. Ideally, subjects are randomized (assigned randomly) to treatments. In this way, you know that any difference between the treatment groups is due to one of two things:\n* The effect of the different treatments.\n* Luck of draw in which the naturally better-perfoming subjects being concentrated in A or B.\nYou also need to pay attention to the test statistic or metric you use to compare group A to group B. Perhaps the most common metric in data science is a binary variable: click or no click, buy or don't buy, fraud or no fraud, and so on.Those results would be summed up in a 2x2 table.

Companies\nlike Twitter and Facebook use this strategy to test\nmajor interface changes by only rolling out the new\nversion to a segment of their visitors and measuring\nhow that group reacts.\nA\/B test results are influential in making good\ndecisions in site redesign because they help you see\nwhat elements are important for your audience\nand customers in a controlled environment. Once\nyou have seen the results of a test you can take the\nnew knowledge to your site wide design.\nOne of the best things about A\/B testing is that it can\nbe very fast and dramatic.

When you have a control group, it is subject to the same condition (except for the treatment of interest) as the treatment group. If you simply make a comparison to \"baseline\" or prior experience, other factors, besides the treatment, might differ.","605746fd":"**What about examples?** <br>\nExamples of the concepts covered in this kernel will be included in the further projects.","14bfd7dc":"An A\/B test is an experiment with two groups to establish which of two treatments, products, procedures, or the like is superior. Often one of the two treatments is the standard existing treatment, or no treatment. If a standard (or no) treatment is used, it is called the *control*. A typical hypothesis is that the treatment is better than control.","13e4168a":"**Multi-Armed Bandit Testing** <br>\nRecently a new type of testing has appeared on the\nscene. It\u2019s called the multi-armed bandit. This type\nof testing is essentially the same as an A\/B split test\nand works very much the way that Google Adwords\nad delivery works. It starts with an experimental\nphase where it gives an even split of traffic across\nall versions of the page and then it goes into an\nexploitation phase where it give more traffic to\nthe version that is currently performing the best.\nOver time if the winner starts to decline in\nconversion the system automatically gives\ntraffic to another version. The drawback to\nautomated systems like this is that they can\nmake counterproductive decisions, especially if\nthey have a short experimental phase or choose\na conversion event that is not on target for your\nbottom line needs.","e6716b1a":"**Key Terms**\n* Treatment\n> Something (drug, price, web headline, etc.) to which a subject is exposed.\n* Treatment group\n> A group of subjects exposed to a specific treatment.\n* Control group\n> A group of subjects exposed to no (or standard) treatment.\n* Randomization\n> The process of randomly assigning subjects to treatments.\n* Subjects \n> The items (web visitors, patients, etc.) that are exposed to treatments.\n* Test statistic\n> The metric used to measure the effect of the treatment.","68b31c55":"**Multivariate Testing** <br>\nWhen you run a multivariate test you use one\npage and dynamically supply multiple versions of\nmultiple elements. For instance, testing 3 versions\nof your headline, 2 versions of your call to action,\nand 3 button colors simultaneously. That would give\nyou 18 versions (3-headlines x 2-CTA x 3-buttoncolor) of the page that you are testing.\nAs you can see, with each successive element and\nvariation on an element you multiply the number of\nversions that you are testing. This means that the\namount of traffic required to reach confidence\nincreases. If you are testing 2 versions of 3 elements\nyou have 8 variations (2 x 2 x 2) and if you have 3\nversions of 3 elements you have 27 variations (3 x 3 x\n3), adding extra tests adds up very fast.\nThe purpose of multivariate testing is to refine\npages that already perform well by looking for\ncompounding effects between elements.\nMultivariate testing is something that you should\nonly be looking at if you have large amounts of\ntraffic."}}
