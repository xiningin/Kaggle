Actually pretty interesting, as ranger, paladin, and artificer have many lower level spells available, but no higher level spells. Wizards, warlocks, and sorcerer have fewer spells per level, but access to higher level spells. This makes sense within the idea of exposure to magic for each class, which is especially cool!","1ace8062":"This is a breakdown of spells per school. Interestingly, Illusion is the least common school of magic in dnd, and Evocation is the most common type of spell. Evocation makes sense, because most combat spells that involve creating an effect are going to be evocation.","a7fc9840":"# Distribution of spells by school","dcf9a4ae":"# Spell availability per level by class"}}
