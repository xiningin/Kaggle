So the last order of the user has been taken out and divided into train and test sets. All the prior order informations of the customer are present in order_products_prior file.  We can also note that there is a column in orders.csv file called eval_set which tells us as to which of the three datasets (prior, train or test) the given row goes to.\n\nOrder_products*csv file has more detailed information about the products that been bought in the given order along with the re-ordered status.\n\nLet us first get the count of rows in each of the three sets.","03f07c6d":"A right tailed distribution with the maximum value at 5.!\n\nBefore we explore the product details, let us look at the other three files as well.

The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.\n\nFor each user, 4 and 100 of their orders are given, with the sequence of products purchased in each order\n\nLet us start by importing the necessary modules.","4d680541":"About 12% of the orders in prior set has no re-ordered items while in the train set it is 6.5%.\n\nNow let us see the number of products bought in each order.","51d0aa5e":"**Add to Cart - Reorder ratio:**\n\nLet us now explore the relationship between how order of adding the product to the cart affects the reorder ratio."}}
