I suppose there will be **7** files. \n\nThe train set includes annotations in both RLE-encoded and unencoded(JSON) forms. The annotations denote segmentations of glomeruli.\n\nBoth training and public test sets include anatomical structure segmentations.

Note that these fields are the same between all files and do not offer signal.\n* A `geometry` containing a `Polygon` with `coordinates` for the feature's enclosing volume\n* Additional `properties`, including the name and color of the feature in the image.\n* The `IsLocked` field is the same across file types (locked for glomerulus, unlocked for anatomical structure) and is not signal-bearing.","720e8453":"* The data used in this competition includes 11 fresh frozen and 9 Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) PAS kidney images. \n* Glomeruli FTU annotations exist for all 20 tissue samples; some of these will be shared for training, and others will be used to judge submissions.","00c2caca":"# Understanding RLE","d9dc7629":"The masks provided in the `train.csv` is in Running Length Encoding format. This encoding comes in pairs of pixel values as follows:\n1. The starting pixel.\n2. Number of pixels from the starting pixel. \n\nSo, to specify 10 pixels starting from pixel number 200 would be written as:\n>200 10\n\nAlso, the pixels are numbered from top to bottom and the left to right.
