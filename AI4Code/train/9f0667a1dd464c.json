Let's further examine this correlation:","ffe429d3":"Similar to Sales, we witness a non-normal and left-tailed distribution for Units","7ce9d2b5":"Let's similarly break down our analysis:\n1. Firstly, this feature is left skewed. This should be accounted for when modelling. Possibly a log\/sqrt transformation may be required.\n2. The Normal q-q plot is a plot that helps us assess if a set of data plausibly came from some theoretical distribution such as a Normal or exponential. Essentially, it helps us determine of data came from a normal distrubution or not, and shows us if our data is skewed. So we can say that the normal distribution is not present in our feature and it is indeed a left tailed distribution with a heavy tail.\n\nTo read more, follow [this link](https:\/\/data.library.virginia.edu\/understanding-q-q-plots\/)","7041d8eb":"# Analysing the categorical feature: Segment Category","a1aa3026":"Our assumption holds true!","0cd8fa2e":"Let's begin by exploring the sales feature in more depth:","f53d58ce":"# Comparing correlations(Do not always rely on the Pearson correlation coefficient!)\n\nFirst, let's plot `Rank` against `Sales`","f62a1c38":"# Now that we have done correlation 101, it's time to get dirty with data!","078044bb":"Now, let's call `the plot_correlation` method of from `dataprep.eda` to gain some valuable insights:","c1eacf69":"<h1 style='text-align:center; background: lightgreen; font-size: 2vw'>Top 250 - EDA<\/h1>","8bb6ce74":"So now it is clear to see that you should not drop a feature just because it has a low Pearson correlation.\nAlways make sure to check the Spearman coefficient, but only when:\n1. There is a non-linear relationship between at 2 features, and 1 feature is an ordinal feature\n2. The data is non-parametric(not assumed to come from prescribed models that are determined by a small number of parameters)\n\nRemeber than Spearman considers the ranks of the features, so essentially it is calculating the Pearson coefficient on ranked data.","da8e87d5":"After our analysis, let's take away some key insights:\n\n1. We have linear relationships between key features, as well as non-linear relationships as well.\n2. We have data of different scales, so we should rescale features if using linear models.\n3. We should also transform a few features using log transformations and other transformations to try transform our data into a normal distribution.\n4. We should also encode the Segment category to see if it positiely benefits our model","0b66e927":"First, I am going to drop the `Headquarters` and `Content` features, as they simply have too many missing values to be of any real use","5b4e1738":"Ok, so `pandas-profiling` has given us some really interesting insights about the data! While there is a lot, and I do recommend you to look over them yourselves, Here are the key points:\n\n1. **We have 9 features, with 6 being categorical and 3 being numeric.**\n\n   **Insight**: They make require further investigation, possibly using feature engineering tools to encode the values into numeric values that \n   can be interpreted by the model(or just use CatBoost :] )\n   \n\n2. **We have missing values in the Content and Headquarters features**\n\n\n3. **We have some strong linear(and non-linear) correlations**\n\n   In the interactions section, there seems to be high **linear** correlation between the Sales and Units features, according to the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n   However, note that just because something does not have a high Pearson correlation coefficient, it does not mean that it is not correlated. How so?\n>    change the filter from Pearson's R to Spearman's P\n\n   If you have 2 numeric features that are not linearly correlated, and if one(or both) of your features are ordinal features(E.g ranking, hierarchical class),\n   Then you can measure the strength and relationship between them using a correlation statistic.   \n   The most common is Spearman's Rank,which considers the ranks of the values for the two variables\n   \n   Spearman\u2019s correlation is equivalent to calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient on the ranked data. So \u03c1 will always be a value between -1 and 1. The further away \u03c1 is from zero, the stronger the relationship between the two variables. The sign of \u03c1 corresponds to the direction of the relationship. If it is positive, then as one variable increases, the other tends to increase. If it is negative, then as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n\n You might want to use Spearman\u2019s correlation if your data have a non-linear relationship (like an exponential relationship) or you have one or more outliers. However,  Spearman\u2019s correlation is only appropriate if the relationship between your variables is monotonic, meaning that as one variable increases, the other tends to either increase or decrease (not both)\n \n![](http:\/\/sites.utexas.edu\/sos\/files\/2017\/06\/Monotonic_both.png) \n\nSource: [UT Austin](http:\/\/sites.utexas.edu\/sos\/guided\/inferential\/numeric\/bivariate\/rankcor\/)\n\n**Why does Spearman's correlation coefficient work with our data?**\n\n1.
