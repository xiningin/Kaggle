For example, if a query is formed that scans all of the data in a particular column, given how large BigQuery datasets are it wouldn't be too surprising if it burns through a large chunk of that monthly quota!\n\nFortunately, the bq_helper module gives us tools to very easily estimate the size of our queries before running a query. Start by drafting up a query using BigQuery's Standard SQL syntax. Next, call the estimate_query_size function which will return the size of the query in GB. That way you can get a sense of how much data is being scanned before actually running your query.","d8ebcf55":"Interpretting this number, this means my query scanned about ~0.9 GB (or 900 MB) of data in order to return a table of 20 unique patent countries of origin from the dataset.","a5cad904":"# How to Query Google Patents Research Data (BigQuery)\n[Click here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mrisdal\/safely-analyzing-github-projects-popular-licenses) for a detailed notebook demonstrating how to use the bq_helper module and best practises for interacting with BigQuery datasets.","1b3c9582":"## Example SQL Query\nWhat countries do some of these patents belong to?"}}
