Our goal is to create a classifier capable of identifying the species of a crop given an image of it.\n\nI already did the setup, evaluation and prediction, so that you can get right into the training of the CNN.\n\nTo learn more about the fast.ai library check out the [documentation](https:\/\/docs.fast.ai) and the [fast.ai course 'Practical Deep Learning for Coders'](https:\/\/course.fast.ai\/)","b18e4f28":"Load in the data","971a634c":"Save the train and test directories"}}
