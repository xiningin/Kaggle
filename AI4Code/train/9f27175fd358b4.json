The StackingCVRegressor extends the standard stacking algorithm (implemented as StackingRegressor) using out-of-fold predictions to prepare the input data for the level-2 regressor.\n\nIn the standard stacking procedure, the first-level regressors are fit to the same training set that is used prepare the inputs for the second-level regressor, which may lead to overfitting. The StackingCVRegressor, however, uses the concept of out-of-fold predictions: the dataset is split into k folds, and in k successive rounds, k-1 folds are used to fit the first level regressor. In each round, the first-level regressors are then applied to the remaining 1 subset that was not used for model fitting in each iteration. The resulting predictions are then stacked and provided -- as input data -- to the second-level regressor. After the training of the StackingCVRegressor, the first-level regressors are fit to the entire dataset for optimal predicitons.\n\n\nMore : http:\/\/rasbt.github.io\/mlxtend\/user_guide\/regressor\/StackingCVRegressor\/\nI encourage that you read more about stacking.\n\n![](http:\/\/rasbt.github.io\/mlxtend\/user_guide\/regressor\/StackingCVRegressor_files\/stacking_cv_regressor_overview.png)\n\n\n### In simple words , Stacking helps avoid fitting on the same data twice , and is effective in reducing overfitting.\n","2767b7ed":"* K-Folds cross-validator\n\n* Provides train\/test indices to split data in train\/test sets.
