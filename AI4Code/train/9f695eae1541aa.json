Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn\u2019t make enough\u2014or any\u2014insulin or doesn\u2019t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn\u2019t reach your cells.\n\n## Types of diabetes\n\n### Type 1 diabetes\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.\n\n### Type 2 diabetes\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.\n\n\n### Gestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you\u2019ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes.\n\n## What health problems can people with diabetes develop?\n* heart disease\n* stroke\n* kidney disease\n* eye problems\n* dental disease\n* nerve damage\n* foot problems\n\n\nsource - https:\/\/www.niddk.nih.gov\/health-information\/diabetes\/overview\/what-is-diabetes","04ef5a7e":"As blood with high glucose levels travels through the body, it can cause widespread damage, including to the blood vessels and kidneys.
