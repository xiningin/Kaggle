Hierarchical clustering is a type of clustering, that starts with a single point cluster, and moves to merge with another cluster, until the desired number of clusters are formed. It is used for identifying the spherical and non-spherical clusters. It is useful for discovering groups and identifying interesting distributions in the underlying data.\n\nInstead of using one point centroid, as in most of data mining algorithms, CURE uses a set of well-defined representative points, for efficiently handling the clusters and eliminating the outliers."}}
