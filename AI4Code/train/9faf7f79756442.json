For example, an easy way of combining country and region information in the dataset would be to do the following:","2392c689":"`map` takes every value in the column it is being called on and converts it some new value using a function you provide it.\n\n`map` takes a `Series` as input. The `DataFrame` `apply` function can be used to do the same thing _across_ columns, on the level of the entire dataset. Thus `apply` takes a `DataFrame` as input.","91f2dd40":"## Summary functions\n\n`pandas` provides many simple \"summary functions\" (not an official name) which restructure the data in some useful way. For example, consider the `describe` method:","b52e56a3":"To see a list of unique values we can use the `unique` function:","5a69f554":"If you want to get some particular simple summary statistic about a column in a `DataFrame` or a `Series`, there is usually a handful `pandas` function that makes it happen. For example, to see the mean of the points allotted (e.g. how well an averagely rated wine does), we can use the `mean` function:","59286969":"# Summary functions and maps reference\n\nThis is the reference component to the \"Summary functions and maps\" section of the Advanced Pandas tutorial.

For example, here's a faster way of remeaning our points column:","9f9167d9":"## Maps\n\nA \"map\" is a term, borrowed from mathematics, for a function that takes one set of values and \"maps\" them to another set of values. In data science we often have a need for creating new representations from existing data, or for transforming data from the format it is in now to the format that we want it to be in later. Maps are what handle this work, making them extremely important for getting your work done!\n\nThere are two mapping functions that you will use often. The `Series` `map` is the first, and slightly simpler one. For example, suppose that we wanted to remean the scores the wines recieved to 0. We can do this as follows:","ae7f5a46":"This method generates a high-level summary of the attributes of the given column. It is type-aware, meaning that its output changes based on the `dtype` of the input. The output above only makes sense for numerical data; for string data here's what we get:"}}
