Each row in the test set represents a trading opportunity for which you will be predicting an action value, 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. Each trade j has an associated weight and resp, which represents a return.\n\nFor each date i, we define:\n\n$$\np_i = \\sum_j(weight_{ij} * resp_{ij} * action_{ij}),\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\sum p_i }{\\sqrt{\\sum p_i^2}} * \\sqrt{\\frac{250}{|i|}},\n$$\nwhere \\(|i|\\) is the number of unique dates in the test set. The utility is then defined as:\n$$ u = min(max(t,0), 6) \\sum p_i. $$","3025f2aa":"1. **Background of the competition**\n   \n  Developing trading strategies to identify and take advantage of inefficiencies is challenging. Even if a strategy is profitable now, it may not be in the future, and market volatility makes it impossible to predict the profitability of any given trade with certainty. As a result, it can be hard to distinguish good luck from having made a good trading decision.\n\nIn the first three months of this challenge, you will build your own quantitative trading model to maximize returns using market data from a major global stock exchange. Next, you\u2019ll test the predictiveness of your models against future market returns and receive feedback on the leaderboard. ","07f64e91":"# Jane Street Market Prediction EDA","cf9d465d":"The basic answer is that your model should be able to predict the right decisions and we can tell if the decission is right or not using the future stock market if the model performs well your ranking will get increased .

To use the API, follow the following template in Kaggle Notebooks:","30be77fe":"**1.1 The Challenge**\n\nYour challenge will be to use the historical data, mathematical tools, and technological tools at your disposal to create a model that gets as close to certainty as possible. You will be presented with a number of potential trading opportunities, which your model must choose whether to accept or reject.\n\nIn general, if one is able to generate a highly predictive model which selects the right trades to execute, they would also be playing an important role in sending the market signals that push prices closer to \u201cfair\u201d values. That is, a better model will mean the market will be more efficient going forward. However, developing good models will be challenging for many reasons, including a very low signal-to-noise ratio, potential redundancy, strong feature correlation, and difficulty of coming up with a proper mathematical formulation. ","8df44398":"1.2 **Important Dates to remember**\n\nThis is a forecasting competition with an active training phase and a second period where models will be run against real market returns.\nTraining Timeline:\n\n    February 15, 2021 - Entry deadline. You must accept the competition rules before this date in order to compete.\n\n    February 15, 2021 - Team Merger deadline. This is the last day participants may join or merge teams.\n\n    February 22, 2021 - Final submission deadline.\n\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.\nForecasting Timeline:\n\nStarting after the final submission deadline there will be periodic updates to the leaderboard to reflect market data updates that will be run against selected notebooks.\n\n    August 23, 2021 - Competition End Date\n"}}
