We can use the `subplots` method to create a figure with multiple subplots. `subplots` takes two arguments. The first one controls the number of *rows*, the second one the number of *columns*.","ed00414c":"To put your design skills to the test, try forking this notebook and replicating the plots that follow. To see the answers, hit the \"Input\" button below to un-hide the code.","c64ef8e6":"(Hint: use `figsize=(8, 8)`)","c9f9eb8d":"# Why subplot?\n\nWhy are subplots useful?\n\nOftentimes as a part of the exploratory data visualization process you will find yourself creating a large number of smaller charts probing one or a few specific aspects of the data. For example, suppose we're interested in comparing the scores for relatively common wines with those for relatively rare ones. In these cases, it makes logical sense to combine the two plots we would produce into one visual \"unit\" for analysis and discussion.\n\nWhen we combine subplots with the style attributes we explored in the previous notebook, this technique allows us to create extremely attractive and informative panel displays.\n\nFinally, subplots are critically useful because they enable **faceting**. Faceting is the act of breaking data variables up across multiple subplots, and combining those subplots into a single figure. So instead of one bar chart, we might have, say, four, arranged together in a grid.\n\nThe recommended way to perform faceting is to use the `seaborn` `FacetGrid` facility. This feature is explored in a separate section of this tutorial.\n\n# Exercises\n\nLet's test ourselves by answering some questions about the plots we've used in this section. Once you have your answers, click on \"Output\" button below to show the correct answers.\n\n1. A `matplotlib` plot consists of a single X composed of one or more Y. What are X and Y?\n2. The `subplots` function takes which two parameters as input?\n3. The `subplots` function returns what two variables? ","8620e2c8":"We are of course not limited to having only a single row. We can create as many subplots as we want, in whatever configuration we need.\n\nFor example:","21b490dd":"If there are multiple columns *and* multiple rows, as above, the axis array becoming a list of lists:","350b484a":"## Subplots\n\nIn the previous section, \"Styling your plots\", we set the title of a plot using a bit of `matplotlib` code. We did this by grabbing the underlying \"axis\" and then calling `set_title` on that.\n\nIn this section we'll explore another `matplotlib`-based stylistic feature: **subplotting**.","960f1976":"Notice that the bar plot of wines by point counts is in the first row and first column (the `[0][0]` position), while the bar plot of wines by origin is in the second row and second column (`[1][1]`).\n\nBy combining subplots with the styles we learned in the last section, we can create appealing-looking panel displays.","bfafd5ff":"# Conclusion\n\nIn the previous section we explored some `pandas`\/`matplotlib` style parameters. In this section, we dove a little deeper still by exploring subplots.\n\nTogether these two sections conclude our primer on style. Hopefully our plots will now be more legible and informative.\n\n[Click here to go to the next section, \"Plotting with seaborn\"](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/plotting-with-seaborn).","d66c7693":"Since we asked for a `subplots(2, 1)`, we got a figure with two rows and one column.\n\nLet's break this down a bit. When `pandas` generates a bar chart, behind the scenes here is what it actually does:\n\n1. Generate a new `matplotlib` `Figure` object.\n2. Create a new `matplotlib` `AxesSubplot` object, and assign it to the `Figure`.\n3. Use `AxesSubplot` methods to draw the information on the screen.\n4. Return the result to the user.\n\nIn a similar way, our `subplots` operation above created one overall `Figure` with two `AxesSubplots` vertically nested inside of it.\n\n`subplots` returns two things, a figure (which we assigned to `fig`) and an array of the axes contained therein (which we assigned to `axarr`). Here are the `axarr` contents:","7d4adc5e":"To tell `pandas` which subplot we want a new plot to go in&mdash;the first one or the second one&mdash;we need to grab the proper axis out of the list and pass it into `pandas` via the `ax` parameter:"}}
