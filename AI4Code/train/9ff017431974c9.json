Typically it would be of interest to investigate the possible association between the two variables.\r\n\r\n>Bivariate analysis is one of the simplest forms of quantitative (statistical) analysis. It involves the analysis of two variables (often denoted as X, Y), for the purpose of determining the empirical relationship between them.\r\n\r\n## Multivariate\r\n>Multivariate statistics is a subdivision of statistics encompassing the simultaneous observation and analysis of more than one outcome variable. The application of multivariate statistics is multivariate analysis.\r\n\r\n>Multivariate analysis is based on the principles of multivariate statistics, which involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time.\r\n\r\n![picture](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=view&id=1ors5QRIf6ISa-aidarRJ6A0-ueY31hk9)","dd3c103e":"* [Python Guide](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/tutorial\/index.html)  \r\n[Python Guide](https:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/python\/)\r\n* [Data Cleaning Guide](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/data-cleaning-in-python-the-ultimate-guide-2020-c63b88bf0a0d)\r\n* [Pandas Guide](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/docs\/user_guide\/index.html)\r\n* [Matplotlib Examples](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/gallery\/index.html)\r\n\r\n* [Seaborn Examples](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/examples\/index.html)\r\n\r\n","1b604d3d":"> Write the structure  of your dataset here \r\n\r\n\r\n","1f4aa1a0":">here write your summery about dataset","5e3f2f81":"**it** **is** **clear** **that** **we expend most of our budget on comdy** **films but most revenue comes from drama ones** ","1d28489e":"------","66a71747":"----","bb5fc9f3":"### ```\r\n\r\n# (IMDd-Movie-Database)\r\n## by (Abdallah Mohamed Amdek)\r\n\r\n>The movies dataset includes 3,726 movies with attributes such as movie average rating, number likes for fb of film makers, genre,The names dataset includes cast members.etc \r\n","6bf517ef":"### ```\r\n# import libraries\r\n```\r\n\r\n","2e3e7cfa":"**Find the number and position of missing values**","3813c89c":"**Find the mean, median, standard deviation**","3096555b":"# SUMMERY\r\n \r\n\r\n","90ed1907":"----","16c34e36":"**Find the unique values and the count of unique values**","5bca1bac":"**it is clear that most films in our data set are english**","d21f7a2d":"# Univariate\r\n> Make at least one chart\r\n,write your observation under every chart","debb793a":"**Find the most frequent value of dataset**","1d232b1c":"# Bivariate\r\n> Make at least one chart\r\n,write your observation under every chart","27ba86e4":"# Multivariate\r\n> Make at least one chart\r\n,write your observation under every chart","5ca17234":"------","d0c3e742":"----\r\n","39725fbe":"**Compute the softmax score**","4b911a12":">List at least three insights.\r\n\r\n1. most of it on english films \r\n1. most revenue comes from drama films \r\n1. cinema makers expend most of the budget on comdy films\r\n\r\n\r\n","eb575140":"###  #import your dataset``"}}
