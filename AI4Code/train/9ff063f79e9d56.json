Water Scarcity. Water Risk<\/b><\/i><\/h1><\/center>\n\nAuthor: PETER SCHULTE, PACIFIC INSTITUTE - JANUARY 17, 2017\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:180%; color:orange;\"><i><b>Water Stress<\/b><\/i><\/h1>\n\n\u201cWater stress\u201d refers to the ability, or lack thereof, to meet human and ecological demand for fresh water. Compared to scarcity, \u201cwater stress\u201d is a more inclusive and broader concept. It considers several physical aspects related to water resources, including water availability, water quality, and the accessibility of water (i.e., whether people are able to make use of physically-available water supplies), which is often a function of the sufficiency of infrastructure and the affordability of water, among other things. Both water consumption and water withdrawals provide useful information that offers insight into relative water stress.\"\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:180%; color:orange;\"><i><b>Water Scarcity<\/b><\/i><\/h1>\n\n\"\u201cWater scarcity\u201d refers to the volumetric abundance, or lack thereof, of freshwater resources. \u201dScarcity\u201d is human-driven; it is a function of the volume of human water consumption relative to the volume of water resources in a given area. As such, an arid region with very little water, but no human water consumption would not be considered \u201cscarce,\u201d but rather \u201carid.\u201d Water scarcity is a physical, objective reality that can be measured consistently across regions and over time. Water scarcity reflects the physical abundance of fresh water rather than whether that water is suitable for use. For instance, a region may have abundant water resources (and thus not be considered water scarce), but have such severe pollution that those supplies are unfit for human or ecological uses.\"\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:180%; color:orange;\"><i><b>Water Risk<\/b><\/i><\/h1>\n\n\"\u201cWater risk\u201d refers to the possibility of an entity experiencing a water-related challenge (e.g., water scarcity, water stress, flooding, infrastructure decay, drought). The extent of risk is a function of the likelihood of a specific challenge occurring and the severity of the challenge\u2019s impact. The severity of impact itself depends on the intensity of the challenge, as well as the vulnerability of the actor.\"\n\n\"Water risk is felt differently by every sector of society and the organizations within them and thus is defined and interpreted differently (even when they experience the same degree of water-related challenges). That notwithstanding, many water-related challenges create risk for many different sectors and organizations simultaneously.\"\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:180%; color:orange;\"><i><b>Water Risk for Businesses<\/b><\/i><\/h1>\n\n\u201cWater risk for businesses\u201d. It is commonly categorized into three inter-related types:\n\n\"Physical \u2013 Having too little water, too much water, water that is unfit for use, or inaccessible water.\"\n\n\"Regulatory \u2013 Changing, ineffective, or poorly-implemented public water policy and\/or regulations.\"\n\n\"Reputational \u2013 Stakeholder perceptions that a company does not conduct business in a sustainable or responsible fashion with respect to water.\"\n\n\u201cWater risk for businesses\u201d is also sometimes divided into two categories:\" \n\n<font color=\"#F39C12\">Water Risk due to Company Operations<\/font>\n\n\"Risk due to company operations, products, and services \u2013 A measure of the severity and likelihood of water challenges derived from the way in which a company or organization, and the suppliers from which it sources goods, operate and how its products and services affect people and ecosystems.\"\n\n<font color=\"#F39C12\">Water Risk due to Basin Conditions<\/font>\n\n\"Risk due to basin conditions \u2013 A measure of the severity and likelihood of water challenges derived from the watershed\/basin context in which a company or organization and\/or its suppliers from which it sources goods operate, which cannot be addressed through changes in its operations or its suppliers and requires engagement outside the fence.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/ceowatermandate.org\/posts\/water-scarcity-water-stress-water-risk-actually-mean\/","58819a31":"#If I didn't run the 2 snippets above I would NOT get the Top Ten Exactly.
