They differ on the observations and specific values in the variables. If you fit the model on the training dataset, then you implicitly minimize error or find correct responses. The fitted model provides a good prediction on the training dataset. Then you test the model on the test dataset. If the model predicts good also on the test dataset, you have more confidence. You have more confidence since the test dataset is similar to the training dataset, but not the same nor seen by the model. It means the model transfers prediction or learning in real sense.\n\nSo,by splitting dataset into training and testing subset, we can efficiently measure our trained model since it never sees testing data before.Thus it's possible to prevent overfitting.\n\nI am just splitting dataset into 20% of test data and remaining 80% will used for training the model.","48e3ab0d":"It is evident from the above output that females have overall less default payments wrt males","68ac2590":"**STEP 4. Finding Correlation**","a5499a24":"**Interpretation of the Validation Curve**\n\nif the number of trees are around 10, then the  model suffers from high bias. Two scores are quite close,but both the scores are too far from acceptable level so I think it's a high bias problem.In other words, the model is underfitting. \n\nAt a maximun number of trees of 250, model suffers from high variance since training score is 0.82 but validation score is about 0.81.In other words, a model is overfitting. Again, the data points suggest a sort of graceful curve. However, our model uses a very complex curve to get as close to every data point as possible. Consequently, a model with high variance has very low bias because it makes little to no assumption about the data. In fact, it adapts too much to the data.\n\nAs we see from the curve, max trees of around  30 to 40 best generalizes the unseen data. As max trees increases, bias becomes lower and variance becomes higher. We should keep the balance between the two. Just after  30 to 40 number of trees training score increase upwards and validation score starts to goes down, so I it begins to suffer from overfitting. So that's why any number of trees between 30 and 40  should be a good choice.","1f2aa88c":"**Distribution of Male and Female according to their age**","a38456b9":"**STEP 9. Model Optimization**","5baf1c85":"Random search outperformed grid search on this dataset across every number of iterations. Also random search seemed to converge to an optimum more quickly than grid search, which means random search with fewer iterations is comparable to grid search with more iterations.\n\nIn highdimensional parameter space, grid search would perform worse with the same iterations because points become more sparse. Also it is common that one of the hyperparameters is unimportant to finding the optimal hyperparameters, in which case grid search wastes a lot of iterations where as random search does not waste any iteration.\n\nNow we will optimize models accuracy  using Randomsearch cv.As shown in above table Adaboost performs best in this dataset. So we will try to further optimize adaboost and SVC by fine tuning its hyperparameters.","bccbf944":"**STEP 7: Applying Machine Learning Models**","8776c954":"Means there are 30,000 entries with 25 columns","29efcb4f":"**STEP 6: Normalizing the data : Feature Scaling** <br>\n\nFeature scaling through standardization (or Z-score normalization) can be an important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms.
