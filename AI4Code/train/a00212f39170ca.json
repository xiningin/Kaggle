Let's leave only data since 2010 year, this way we will get rid of the data of the biggest crisis.","b3d7ca30":"Now let's take a look at out target variable.","95f2f321":"![](http:\/\/fintechnews.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Deutsche-Bank-Survey-87-of-Financial-Market-Participants-Say-Blockchain-Will-Disrupt-The-Industry-1440x564_c.jpg)","f2f7cc25":"For a quick fix I'll replace outliers in these lines with mean open or close price of this company.","10857c76":"Another case is with cost equal to 999, such numbers are usually suspicious. Let's look at Archrock Inc - no spikes there as well.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KYZKkSd.png)","e3b1c267":"Let's look at the target variable now.","5916b252":"I think it is quite funny that Apple is a company with most both negative and positive sentiments.","4f63ecd9":"Now the graph is much more reasonable.","4a0cafd7":"There are some big outliers, but sentences mostly have 15-25 words in them.","c80b7e6e":"Well, this isn't much considering we have more than 4 million lines and a lot of these cases are due to price falls during market crash. Well just need to deal with outliers.","a7729de8":"### Getting data and importing libraries","e39e9f72":"The file is too huge to work with text directly, so let's see a wordcloud of the last 100000 headlines.","30b805df":"Now let's remember the description:\n```\nThe marketdata contains a variety of returns calculated over different timespans. All of the returns in this set of marketdata have these properties:\n\n    Returns are always calculated either open-to-open (from the opening time of one trading day to the open of another) or close-to-close (from the closing time of one trading day to the open of another).\n    Returns are either raw, meaning that the data is not adjusted against any benchmark, or market-residualized (Mktres), meaning that the movement of the market as a whole has been accounted for, leaving only movements inherent to the instrument.\n    Returns can be calculated over any arbitrary interval. Provided here are 1 day and 10 day horizons.\n    Returns are tagged with 'Prev' if they are backwards looking in time, or 'Next' if forwards looking.\n```\n\nLet's have a look at means of these variables.","865921fb":"![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/C3COWfe.png)","ba93e975":"## General information\n\nTwo Sigma Financial News Competition is a unique competitions: not only it is a Kernel-only competition, but we aren't supposed to download data and during stage two our solutions will be used to predict future real data.\n\nI'll try to do an extensive EDA for this competition and try to find some interesting things about the data.\n\nP. S. I'l learning to use plotly, so there will be interactive charts at last!","6d0988c1":"At first let's take 10 random assets and plot them.","82982ede":"So price of \"Towers Watson & Co\" shares was almost 10k... I think this is simply an error in data.\n\nBut what about Bank of New York Mellon Corp?\n\nLet's see data by Yahoo:","83600244":"## Market data\n\nWe have a really interesting dataset which contains stock prices for many companies over a decade!\n\nFor now let's have a look at the data itself and not think about the competition. We can see long-term trends, appearing and declining companies and many other things.","a8065f22":"Now let's try to build that graph again.","e717476d":"There were no spikes.","f3028ed4":"Well, most news are tagless.","cf54d8f7":"It is cool to be able to see how markets fall and rise again.\nI have shown 4 events when there were serious stock price drops on the market.\nYou could also notice that higher quantile prices have increased with time and lower quantile prices decreased.\nMaybe the gap between poor and rich increases... on the other hand maybe more \"little\" companies are ready to go to market and prices of their shares isn't very high.","b1a3b365":"We have two datasets, let's explore them separately.","94ef2d08":"I plot data for all periods because I'd like to show long-term trends.\nAssets are sampled randomly, but you should see that some companies' stocks started trading later, some dissappeared. Disappearence could be due to bankruptcy, acquisition or other reasons.","05129f8f":"Well, it seems that in fact urgency \"2\" is almost never used.","e7ec9685":"It isn't surprising that Reuters is the most common provider :)","65965335":"Now, let's look at these price drops in details.","3f1f437d":"At first I was sad that we don't have access to the texts of the news, but I have realized that we won't be able to use them anyway due to kernel memory limitations.","0bdd22a7":"We can see huge price fluctiations when market crashed. Just think about it... **But this is wrong!** There was no huge crash on January 2010... Let's dive into the data!","77d32160":"## Modelling\n\nIt's time to build a model!\nI think that in this case we should build a binary classifier - we will simply predict whether the target goes up or down.","0354dc61":"Fluctuations seem to be high, but in fact they are lower that 8 percent. In fact it looks like a random noise...","097fb5fd":"Well, for me it is difficult to interpret this, but it seems that returns for previous 10 days fluctuate the most.","a5cf011f":"So, let's try to find strange cases."}}
