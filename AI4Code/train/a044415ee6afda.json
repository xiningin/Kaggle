distribution of the white, black and hispanic victims.","48854559":"Following is a graph representing the shootings by state.","04a17a7d":"As per the heat map above, it can be observed that there is a positive correlation between white victims and mentall ilness and on the contrary, a negative correlation between mental illness and, black and hispanic victims. That is, more white victims were showing signs of mental illness than any of the other races.\n\nAlso, a negative correlation between armed=True and race_B suggests that there were fewer black victims who were armed.","a6f9d4ec":"For better understanding, here is a pie chart for comparison.","4b8e1909":"## States and Cities","871b1c67":"From the above graph, it can be interpreted that for the state of california, the median age and the range of age of the white victims was higher than that of both black and hispanic victims. The same can be done for all the states respectively.","8f3a5c8f":"The most number of shootings took place in May 2020.","07755b7d":"Here, we will try to determine how the male and female victims who either showed signs of mental illness or didn't are distributed accross the age range.","27fbc219":"It is clear from the above violin plot that median age of the men showing signs of mental illness was higher than that of the women. Albeit, the median of ages of both men and women who showed signs of mental illness is late fourties.\n\nAnother interesting observaton is that the interquartile range of men showing signs of mental illness is lower than that of the women. In layman's terms, the ages of women showing signs of mental illness were more spread out from the median than the men.\n\nThe first quartile is the median of the lower half of the data and the third quartile is the median of the upper half of the data. Therefore, about 50% of the women who showed signs of mental illness were between 29 to 50 years of age and the men who showed signs of mental illness were between 31 to 49 years of age.","0be6c093":"# Visualising the given data","2884e357":"With the following bar graph we will try to determine the faction of people who did not try to flee from the police and were shot or shot and tasered.","5e2824ff":"The victims were either shot or shot and tasered.","967c083d":"To put the above numbers in perspective, following is a graph showing the percentages of victims of each race being shot when the body camera was on and when the body camera was off.","330e494e":"## Body Camera"}}
