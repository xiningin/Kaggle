It seems overall, users are pretty generous in their ratings\n2. There are many more free games than paid games however, it is also the case that many free games contain in-app purchases, as indicated in the plots\n3. It seems also that most games are rated for ages 4+\n4. Our log size seems to be working nicely, and perhaps there is something we can do with the description length.\n5. As can be expected, very few games have a lot of languages listed\n6. More games than expected have a subtitle. Perhaps developers know something about subtitles and downloads or ratings.\n7. Again, from a marketing standpoint, it makes sense to list many genres on your app so it shows up in more places.\n8.
