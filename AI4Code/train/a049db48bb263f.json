probably reasonable to simply impute all missing BMI values as the median. Conversely, if we wanted something more sophisticated than this we could create a model to predict the BMI missing values using regression.","14801cdd":"As shown, we have less than 5% data that is for those that had a stroke. For instances like this, we need to be careful on the training and evaluation of models, due to the severe data imbalance that we have.","49d66732":"Still not amazing, but definitely a bit better... \n\nIn contrast to the KFolds cross validation scores obtained earlier after SMOTE oversampling, this model performs much worse. Hopefully this highlights how performing incorrect KFolds cross validation with oversampled data can provide over-optimistic estimations on how well our model will perform.\n\nInstead, we should always perform SMOTE within each fold of cross validation, rather than beforehand on the entire training split.","019e3e91":"We can overcome this issue partially through simply training on the oversampled training set, and making predictions on the non-oversampled validation set. If our performance on this is still terrible, it gives us an idea of how effective our models actually are.\n\nLets try the random forest model again, and evaluate our predictions on the validation split:","c345f661":"Good, we've dealt with all missing values within our dataset. Now lets proceed onwards to some exploratory data analysis.","a0a7aa31":"This seems pointless (and it kind of is), since I have done this purely for convenience, so that we identify our categorical columns as those that are object dtypes later during preprocessing.","fdfc42a7":"Good, we've now got a balanced number of samples.

Since we would much rather spot someone who might have a stroke (minimise false negatives) rather than trying to avoid inadvertently classifying a healthy person as a risk of stroke (minimising false positives), we should prioritise our recall, rather than precision.\n\nWe can do this type of analysis better through the use of precision-recall curves and Reciever Operator Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC).","6dc70401":"Check for missing values within our data:","697a2c65":"<a id=\"load\"><\/a>\n## 1.

Lets try and improve this through some application of imbalanced data techniques.","1a0ea2d8":"Lets transform our data into a form suitable for training various models. This includes encoding our categorical variables, and standardising our numerical variables.\n\nWe can either encode our categorical feature values, or one-hot encode them. Our preprocessing function supports whichever we want, through simply setting the one_hot_encode argument as true (one-hot encoding) or false (simple numerical encoding). We obtain a larger number of feature columns if we one-hot encode, and therefore introduce more complexity. However, many models perform better with one-hot encoding, so it is worth trying both techniques for our range of models.\n\nWe'll be using mainly tree-based methods in this notebook, and as such one-hot encoding and simple encoding of features does not actually make any noticeable difference (as demonstrated through years of empirical research and comparisons). Therefore, we'll keep our dataset simpler and just use categorical encoding.","2cd41ca7":"<a id=\"model-exploration\"><\/a>\n## 4.

We'll add these to our list so we've got them all...","7f9a4943":"It appears our BMI column is missing a fair number of values within the dataset. We'll have to implement some means of either imputing approximate values, or dealing with the missing values in some way.","73999b74":"We have a fairly good balance of categorical feature values across our data, with exception to one or two minorities. For example, we have a very low number of cases of hypertension (1) and heart_disease (1). In addition, our target variable (stroke) seems to be extremely imbalanced. As such, we should consider applying some techniques to help work with imbalanced data, otherwise we will have poor generlisation in our models.","3644eeff":"Well, not too shabby... but then again, definitely room for improvement. There are a huge range of additional techniques we can apply to improve this performance for imbalanced binary classification, but we'll leave these for another time.\n\nMany thanks for reading through this notebook!

HOWEVER - through performing k-folds cross validation like we have in this regard we have actually introduced a huge amount of DATA LEAKAGE.\n\nSince we've duplicated a huge number of stroke instances in the dataset, when we form training and validation splits as part of kfolds cross validation we are actually including a large number of duplicates in both training and validation partitions. This means our model can just memorise instances from the training set, and score perfectly on these same instances in the validation set. \n\nTherefore, the scores obtained above need to be taken with a massive pinch of salt! To get a much better idea of the generalisation performance of our models, we should perform manual kfolds cross validation that oversamples the training splits using SMOTE on each fold. This ensures no data leakage between our training and validation splits whilst evaluating performance.","d0878ea9":"### 2.2 Analysis of Numerical Features","679d9bf8":"<a id=\"EDA\"><\/a>\n## 2.

If we had a huge number of features, with many being very highly correlated, it could be worth eliminating some to reduce redundancy. In this case we have nothing to worry about, since we have a few low number of variables in the dataset.","0db3fa79":"Not too shabby, but we could certainly improve this further before settling on a final model.\n\nLets also see how our precision recall curve looks using these predictions on the validation set:","e243ff00":"### Analysing the ROC AUC","c8ed4c37":"<a id=\"oversampling-data\"><\/a>\n## 5.

We can inspect the underlying decision trees within our random forest model using the estimators_ array, like so:","67e04f3e":"A key feature of Random Forest models is the ability to ability to compute feature importances. We can grade this feature importance in multiple ways. The popular way (used by Scikit-Learn) is to measure how much a feature reduces the impurity on average across all trees in the forest. For our model, this would equate to measuring on average how strongly each feature reduces the cost function across all our tree models.","5991f8ac":"These metrics are hard to appreciate from the values alone, however they do highlight a severe limitation of our model. Lets plot a confusion matrix, which will help illustrate what this is.","9515bf77":"<a id=\"test-predictions\"><\/a>\n## 6. Predictions on the test sets ","495c4076":"All things considered, the model performs terribly in terms of recall. Even through adjustment of thresholds, there is no easy way to increase its performance in reducing false negatives. We can only achieve a high recall by completely diminishing precision, which is not ideal and eliminates any intelligence from our model.\n\nIt seems to improve this we need to significantly tune the model, or choose a more appropriate model for this problem.","798d1f97":"Its important that we handle our numerical and categorical features appropriately prior to producing our models.\n\nWe'll put together some preprocessing functions to encode our categorical features and standardise our numerical features. Whilst doing this, we'll also add support for producing additional dimensionality-reduced features (using PCA) to our dataset.\n\nThese extra features will allow us to experiment and tune to find the best combinations of feature engineering to perform for this problem.","4430bb16":"Oh dear, our model doesnt even predict one instance correct for when our data corresponds to a stroke. This highlights the severe data imbalance problem highlighted during our exploratory data analysis earlier.\n\nThis is why accuracy is such a poor metric for imbalanced classification problems such as this one - we score 95% accuracy by simply predicting 0 everytime. Since we've made this so easy for our model with such imbalanced data, you cant blame it for taking the easy option and simply predicting 0 all the time.\n\nTo overcome this we should always make use of better metrics for such problems, such as precision, recall, f1 score, and various other available metrics.","84c1eade":"# Stroke predictions and analysis"}}
