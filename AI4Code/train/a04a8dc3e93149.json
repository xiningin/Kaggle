My idea is applying **Coulomb Interaction** which force is propotional to inverse squared distance (1\/r^2). I guess inverse distance (1\/r) can be also applicable when focusing on potential. Anyway, i've considered inversed squared distance, here. If we want to use inverse distance, preprocessed data can be converted easily.\n\n1. get assigned atoms from train data which are included 'atom_index_0' or 'atom_index_1' of molecule\n2. get distances from each atom belonging to the molecule and pickup 'num = 5' nearest regarding to each atom [H, C, N, O, F]. Though in this competition we focus on bondings of H-H, H-C, H-N, properties of bondings are strongly affected by O, F atoms. That's why I'd like to consider interaction as I mentioned.\n3. mearge distance array according to atom_index_0 and atom_index_1 then dimension of feature of bonding is 50 = num x atoms x 2.\n4. feed the feature into model. model can be built for each bonding type, 1JHH, 1JHC, 2JHC etc."}}
