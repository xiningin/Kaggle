I have not figured a way to label particular data points without bogging down the runtime of creation of the animation. My assumption of 22 players across all timestamps fails at times :(. I could probably make my scripts more dynamic to account for the changing number of players being tracked throughout the play, but I'm tired :P.\n- <b>Hopefully checking game animations can help folk see how some plays panout<\/b>\n- I'll try updating in a future version to have little sticks with player facing directions","ca292663":"## Preprocessing\n- So in order to create animations, the data must be pretty structured at least for my scripts. If you run the next two blocks with a particular event on the play you may get <b>widely varied number of players on the field<\/b> from the standard (22) especially towards the beginning and end of a particular play.\n    - This also means that my code isn't overly robust. It works for most cases if you have already filtered your plays based on ones that are actual punt returns\n- For example, even during the play if you look up the event 'line_set', 79.8% of the time 22 players are on the field. For this particular event some plays have from 22 up to 34 players being tracked. This deeply complicates the labeling of players on the field.\n- As a result, I will perform some preprocessing to try to ensure only plays that have 22 players on the field are able to be viewed. As a result I will filter first by 'line_set' and keep plays where there are 22 players and then filter by some ending event ('tackle', 'out_of_bounds', etc.).\n    - Note: Even with this filtering there can be timestamps between the two events where there are less than 22 players being logged for each timestamp.","7fa4b4c3":"- We'll need play_player_role data and playdescription from play dataset for the scripts below so we'll concatenate them with a particular NGS dataset","ae6fb22f":"- Let's indicate what team the player is playing on based off player role","30a357e4":"## Animations","4d3aad3d":"### Notes on NGS dataset\n- Count of events with 22 Players:\n    - 'line_set': 79\n    - 'tackle': 29\n    - 'out_of_bounds': 18\n    - 'punt_downed': 6\n    - 'touchback': 4\n    - 'touchdown': 0\n    \n### Course of Action:\n- Filter by a particular play (GameKey, PlayID)\n- Check if it meets the 22 player requirement on events ('punt_play' and 'tackle'\/'out_of_bounds')\n- Break play down further to only include data between the events ('line_set' and some end event)\n- Order by Time and then GSISID to prevent flickering\n- Create animation of play","3c2a7a10":"### Goal: Create animations of the NGS gameplay data\n- Ideally have animations that also show which way a player is facing\n    - <b>CURRENTLY WORKING ON UPDATING SCRIPT TO INDICATE PLAYER FACING DIRECTION<\/b>"}}
