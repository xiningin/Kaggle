This is because you haven't commited your notebook yet. To do that, click the Commit button - as I write it, this is a light-blue button in the top-right corner of my notebook page, in the main pane. (There is also a right pane with Sessions, Versions etc. You can ignore it for now). It may take a minute for the Kaggle server to publish your notebook.\n\nWhen this operation is done, you can go back by clicking '<<' button in the top-left corner. Then you should see your notebook with a top bar that has a few tabs: Notebook, Code, Data, Output, Comments, Log ... Edit Notebook. Click the Output tab. You should see your output csv file there, ready to download and submit on Kaggle!"}}
