Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.\n\nFor example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:\n\n- 1, 1, 1, 1\n- 2, 1, 1\n- 1, 2, 1\n- 1, 1, 2\n- 2, 2\n\nWhat if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.","b50aaf88":"# Appendix"}}
