For working hours, there appears to be only a slight downward trend for these countries over the same time period (Plot 3). However, when plotted together, the data show a fairly strong downward trend in life expectancy as hours worked increases (Plot 6).  These findings confirm the prior research I discussed in the previous assignment and my hypothesis before plotting the data.\n\nGoing back to my original questions as seen in the Overview, I was able to answer most of them but not all of them due to not being able to figure out how to color code the different countries in the scatterplot.  After much experimentation with groupby, legends, lists and for loops and other methods found online, I was unable to differentiate the different \"lines\" in the scatterplots.  This made it difficult to compare specific countries to one another. If I learn how to do this in the future, I would like to explore the specific countries' data further and see which had the lowest working hours, the highest life expectancy, etc. I was still able to see general trends however and answer some of my top level questions regarding the relationship of hours worked to life expectancy. ","fb34a0cc":"**Analysis**","576336f9":"**Data Profile & Cleaning**\n\nBecause the columns and rows weren't set up quite right and there was a ton of data, I needed to do a significant amount of cleaning for both data sets.  Each one had one column for all the countries (over 150 each data set) and then one long row across the top for the years.  To make things as simple and comparable as possible, I decided to transpose each year under one new column titled \"year,\" and then transpose the hours worked and life expectancy data into their own columns as well.  I also decided to combine the data sets because they both had the country and year data in common. The final result is one csv file with 4 columns total with Country, Year, Hours Worked, and Life Expectancy across the top. \n\nBecause I was doing a significant amount of transposing in Excel across two data sets and then combining them, I decided to cut down on the amount of data as well.  I started in the Hours Worked set because that had the most missing data, and cut all the countries with missing cells spanning more than a few years. I decided to focus on the countries that had the most data across the longest period of time, and that ended up only including 9 countries and the years 1982-2017.  After I had completed that, I trimmed the life expectancy data to match the same 9 countries and time period.\n\nAfter cleaning, these are the statistics on the final data set I used for this assignment:\n* Type: CSV\n* Size: 12 KB\n* Columns: Country, Year, Hours Worked, Life Expectancy\n* Countries: Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Israel, Philippines, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and USA\n* Years: 1982-2017\n\n","d44cde70":"**Overview**\n\nThe two sources I\u2019ve chosen for this project come from the gapminder.org website.  One provides information on the average working hours of countries around the world, and the other provides information on the average life expectancy for countries around the world.\n\nI\u2019m interested in this data because although I am not currently working over 40 hours a week, I have done so in the past, and have many coworkers and friends that work 50-60 hour workweeks.  I am curious about the effect this can have and about differences between countries, as I plan to live outside of the US again sometime in the future.\n\nSome of the questions I'm hoping to answer include:  \nHow has life expectancy changed over time by country?\nHow has hours worked changed over time by country?\nHow does the US compare to other countries?\nHow do the two compare? Is there a trend?  If so, are there any exceptions to this trend?\n\n\n"}}
