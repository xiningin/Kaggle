Before continuing, I'd like to remove that row. I also want to preserve this dataset as is, so I will make a copy.","f8033b52":"# Insights Gained\n\nLet's try to summarize what we've learned from these Data Scientists, and how we can apply these discoveries to our own studies. Remember, we filtered our data to contain only responses from USA and Data Scientists that earned a master's or bachelor's degree for their highest degree.\n\n**Programming:**\n* As Data Scientists, we need to program! Most Data Scientists have programmed for about 3-4 years. Start small, make coding fun, and learn from others.\n\n* Python, SQL, or R? Python is a crowd favorite, but the order that you learn these languages in does not matter too much. Flip a coin or learn all at once! If you want to learn Python (the most used programming language among these Data Scientists), I recommend this book: https:\/\/www.oreilly.com\/library\/view\/python-for-data\/9781119547624\/c00.xhtml . You can also try the daily challenges from https:\/\/leetcode.com or https:\/\/www.hackerrank.com .\n\n**Machine Learning:**\n* I was amazed to see how many of our Data Scientists had less than 1 year of Machine Learning experience. What does that mean for a new Data Scientist? It means that if you start your Machine Learning journey today, you'd be with the majority! Reinforce your Machine Learning knowledge with projects that use Linear\/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees\/Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Bayesian Appoaches.\n\n* Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras are popular Machine Learning Frameworks. Lucky for us, there is a book for learning all three of these frameworks!

Personally, I have used edX and completed a Professional Data Science Certificate to get a better understanding of Data Science (check it out here: https:\/\/www.edx.org\/professional-certificate\/harvardx-data-science). \n","1a5df7a3":"# Exploring the Data\n\nLet's first take a look at the first 5 rows of the data.","526deb33":"### Programming Experience\nLet's take a look at the programming experience and the first programming language for these Data Scientists. ","3de8e49c":"About 22.4% of master's degree Data Scientists share their work on GitHub. An interesting observation to be made is that about 22.1% and 19% of master's and bachelor's degree Data Scientists, respectively, do *not* share their work! I am shocked at this discovery, but it may be that this question is referring to their professional work and not their personal work. There may be some privacy violations that can occur if someone were to share the company's work online. I'd like to think that these Data Scientists *do* share their personal work online.","53876906":"We have some interesting results here!\n\n26% of Data Scientists with a masters degree and 26% of Data Scientists with a bachelor's degree have been coding for 3-5 years. \n\nPython is a popular first language! 79% and 73% of Data Scientists with a master's and bachelor's degree, respectively, learned python for their first language.\n\nWould these Data Scientists recommend others to learn Python first? Let's find out!","c9da95aa":"### Sharing Projects\/Work\n\nI believe all Data Scientists could benefit from sharing their work! It is important to let others see your discoveries but also to allow others to criticize your work so that you are continually improving.\n\nLet's take a look at how these Data Scientists share their work.","196ae0cb":"Wow! India has a lot of Data Scientists. (It's important to remember that this is a survey that was conducted by Kaggle. This does not represent the entire Data Science community. A better phrase may be \"Data Scientists in India participated the most in the survey\"). India represents about 29% of the responses and USA represents about 11% of the responses.","f11a7b1f":"## Exploring US Data Scientists\n### Age\/Gender\/Pay\nLet's get to know the difference between bachelor's and master's US Data Scientists.\n\nFirst, we take a look at their age and gender.","4762a4cd":"# Introduction\n\nI began my Data Science journey at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. I was completing my final quarter at the University of California - Santa Barbara as a Mathematical Sciences major and my curiosity for Data Science was growing. Now, I am enrolled in a Masters of Science in Data Science program at Cabrini University and I am hopeful to gain enough experience to finally break into the industry! My goal for this project is to discover the most valuable skills that Data Scientists in the United States have. Specifically, I will be comparing the Data Scientists whose highest degree achieved is bachelor's or master's. I hope to learn more about what Data Scientists are doing so that I could focus my own studying on relevant skills.","6c64a58b":"Coursera takes the lead for both master's and bachelor's Data Scientists. Even though Coursera is the most used among these Data Scientists, all resources are helpful!","94bffbcf":"What frameworks do these data scientists use to apply these algorithms? Let's take a look.","dee76591":"Generally, Data Scientists get paid well and we can clearly see that above. For both master's and bachelor's degree Data Scientists, there is a spike at 100k-125k.\n\nOver 50% of master's degree Data Scientists make between 70k-250k. For bachelor's degree Data Scientists, the range is greater, with over 50% making between 50k-250k.\n\nThis makes sense, a lot of jobs that require a master's degree offer a high yearly compensation compared to jobs that don't require a master's degree.","f742f9e4":"About 70% of master's and 67% of bachelor's recommended learning Python as a first programming language. The next most recommended languages are R and SQL.","1d11bea2":"This is interesting. My intuition was incorrect. Most Data Scientists in India have a bachelor's degree over a master's but the reverse is true in the USA. In my personal experience applying to Data Science jobs in the US, many of the job postings require a master's degree which correlates with the US graph seen above (I'm not sure if the same is true for India).","0e6b0c35":"For master's degree Data Scientists, the 63% majority use Linear\/Logistic Regression. The next two most used algorithms are Decision Trees\/Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines.\n\nFor bachelor's degree Data Scientists, the 47% majority use Linear\/Logistic Regression. The next two most used algorithms are Decision Trees\/Random Forests and Bayesian Approaches.","dfedd2ad":"My intuition is correct! A large number of Data Scientists have a Bachelor's or Master's Degree. The next highest education is a Doctoral degree.\n\nNext, I would like to see the distribution of Data Scientists by country.","a254e63e":"### Machine Learning Experience\nWhat else do these Data Scientists have in common? Let's take a look at their Machine Learning experience. ","76ebcee9":"### Learning More\nAs Data Scientists, we are constantly learning. This is the part that makes the field fun and challenging. How do these Data Scientists further their understanding and sharpen their skills? What resources should we be focusing on?

Let's take a look at the most used Data Visualization tools.","9c50b350":"It looks like most bachelor's degree Data Scientists are between 18-39 years old and most of the master's degree Data Scientists are between 22-39 years old. There is an interesting increase at ages 60-69 for both bachelor's and master's degrees.\n\nWe can also notice that most Data Scientists are male.\n\nNow, let's take a look at their annual pay.","51a1f77a":"To me, Machine Learning is a big part of Data Science and it is interesting to see that about 20% and 30% of master's and bachelor's degree holders, respectively, have less than 1 year of Machine Learning experience.\n\nThere are many Machine Learning algorithms out there. Which algorithms are used most? Which ML algorithms should an aspiring Data Scientists focus on? Let's take a look.","9afd82f4":"Maybe most of the respondents in India have master's degrees and that is skewing our data? Maybe the US Data Scientists have more bachelor's degrees than master's degrees! To find out, we'll plot the highest education achieved once more by India and the USA.","aa268355":"Both master's and bachelor's Data Scientists have the same top three Data Visualization tool preferences: Matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot\/ggplot2. The first two tools are Python Data Visualization tools while the final, ggplot\/ggplot2, belongs to R."}}
