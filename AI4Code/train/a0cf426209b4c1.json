characteristics do they have ?\n\nAs we have seen when analyzing the \"*nametype*\" feature of our meteorite dataset, the vast majority of the listed meteorites are intact as they may either have been found soon after they reached Earth (mostly, we are talking about \"*fell*\" type of meteorite) or they have been very well preserved in the ice of Antarctica. But what about the relict meteorite ? How could they have been found and classified ? \n\nTo know more about this, we will link this feature to the others available.","88e5b886":"As seen here, Antarctica has, without any competition, the highest amount of found meteorites. All of them are \"*found*\" and not seen as there is not that many people in Antarctica actually being able to see this. As we could think, there must be a reason why so many meteorites are found in Antarctica. \n\n#### Analysis conclusion\n\nFirst thought that could come in mind is that more meteorites are actually falling in Antarctica. However, there is nothing indicating that meteorites tend to fall in Antarctica more often than anywhere else. What the data say is that it is more common to find a meteorite in Antarctica and this for three main reasons:\n   - Antarctica is a snow-white land where any piece of brown-ish material will easily be spotted by anyone, including satellite or aerial imagery.  \n   - The date of discovery of meteorite differs from the date of fall. Antarctica has existed for such a long time that there exist a very long timespan of eventual meteorite falls.\n   - Linked to the last fact, Antarctica is cold. Ice-like cold. These conditions are perfect to preserve the quality of the meteorites and to protect them from Earth weather.\n   \nThis last fact is then leading us to a new interrogation:\n> Where do relict meteorites most often come from and what characteristics do they have ?\n\nWe will see this in the following part.","6cd068f3":"This world map seems very stretched and Antarctica might not be of the outmost usefulness but we will still keep it, as some meteorite might have landed here.\n\nFirst thing to do is then to link each coordinate with a country in the map: this process is called **reverse geocoding**. For this, we will use the following package ([link](https:\/\/github.com\/thampiman\/reverse-geocoder)).","dada4348":"As we can see here, most of our stones are of the \"*Stony*\" kind. However, there are still a couple of misclassified stones under the \"*Other*\" category.

Reports of said \"fell\" meteorites go back to before 1500 and up to the late 80s\/90s. \nTwo meteorites stand out particularly from this subdataset:\n   - The oldest \"fell\" one\n   - The heaviest \"found\" one\n   \nWe will now analyze both of them to try pulling out as much infomartion as possible.\n\n#### Oldest unclassified stone","8bf67c39":"First step would be to get a shapefile of a world map such as this one:\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;display: table; max-width: 30%; margin: 10px auto;\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/image.freepik.com\/free-vector\/grey-world-map_1053-431.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n    <figcaption >\n        World map vectorized (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/\">link<\/a>)\n    <\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\nSuch a file is not too hard to find and ESRI happens to offer one ([link](https:\/\/www.arcgis.com\/home\/item.html?id=2ca75003ef9d477fb22db19832c9554f))","9d10cc2d":"Let's now recheck our meteorite dataset: ","a0dc981c":"As we can see here, most of the unclassified stones are of *LL* or *H* type, which always make reference to chondrite meteorite, themselves belonging to the *Stony* category.\n\nOne important class to notice is \"**Stone-uncl**\" which literally means \"*Unclassified stone*\". These rocks are meteorites that are yet to have been classified between the already 3 existing class. It could be interesting to focus on them in further analysis to try to draw conclusion on what they are and if we can get a specific pattern to explain why they are unclassified.\n\n#### mass\nThis column relates to the mass of the given meteorite. This mass is in grams. We could think that the heaviest the meteorite is, the most likely it is to have been observed. \nFirst, let's observe the mass distribution using an histogram. As ds_mass is a numeric column, there might be some \"*NaN*\" values laying out in the column. It would seem logical to find some as not all meteorite ever found could have been weighted or at least that their weight was registered.","26aa6450":"Based on this process, we will alter our original dataset to provide it with a new column: country_code. To name it correctly, we will use the same name as in the GEOdataframe (i.e *ISO2*). For this intent, we will apply the following procedure.","aab8d256":"#### Fell meteorites\nLet's first analyze more in details which country has seen the most meteorites falling and check if it is

Some places were more prone to finding meteors (e.g Antarctica) but that was not because of higher chances of receiving a meteorite. \nbased on these observations, we can clearly state that no one is safe from meteorite falls and an worldwide detection system could be a very good way to prevent the event of the 2010 Chelyabinsk meteor.","8aad7daf":"Let's first plot a map of all our unclassified meteorite to see any pattern.","b8ff377e":"As we can here see, both Australia and Antarctica have a few relict meteorites (1 for Australia, 3 for Antarctica).

Each of these columns are explained to contain the following information:\n\n   - **name**: the name of the meteorite (sometimes just its location, modified with numeric data or composition)\n   - **id**: a unique identifier of each meteorite\n   - **nametype**: one of:\n      - *valid*: a typical meteorite\n      - *relict*: a meteorite that has been highly degraded by weather on Earth\n   - **recclass**: the class of the meteorite (meteorite classification is a vast field of study that you can learn more about in [this wikipedia article](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Meteorite_classification))\n   - **mass**: the mass of the meteorite, in grams\n   - **fall**: one of:\n      - *Fell*: the meteorite's fall was observed\n      - *Found*: the meteorite's fall was **not** observed\n   - **year**: the year the meteorite fell, or the year it was found (linked with the \"*fall*\" column)\n   - **reclat**: the latitude of the meteorite's landing\n   - **reclong**: the longitude of the meteorite's landing\n   - **GeoLocation**: a parentheses-enclose, comma-separated tuple that combines reclat and reclong\n    \n\nAs we can see, our categorical columns could be the bearing points for a more exhaustive search on what properties could be typical for each category of meteorite, especially when differentiating *fallen* from *found* meteorites.\n\nWe will use this analysis to answer the following question: \"*Is there any geographical distribution difference between the observed falls and the found meteorite, and do they have different properties?*\".\n\nTo answer this, we will first introduce each columns independently, giving insights on their values and properties. Then, we will focus on answering the question by drawing the good visuals for this problematic. Then we will draw our conclusion.\n\n","cbf872dd":"Meteorites finding are as ancient as 301 AC, and the median year is right before the 21st century.

Let's plot an histogram of the years and we will figure out after about this impossible date.","c40c5c80":"This small amount of unique values is very beneficial for us as we could easily draw an histogram of the values and analyse its distribution. Let's, for example draw an histogram of the 20 most common meteorite names:","ebee978b":"### What characterizes unclassified stones ?\n\nAnother question that we raised was about the unclassified stones.

They give the position of the meteorite landing. Somewhat important to precisely localize the meteorite, satellite location may not have always been recorded precisely.","7849a821":"We obtain here the two following results. However, meteorite classification is a very serious and almost flawless process. Every meteorite registered in our dataset should exist or any entry should at least have sense. Let's explore this more in details by analyzing each case with the help of an external source: [the Meteoritical Society (TMS) DataBase](https:\/\/www.lpi.usra.edu\/meteor\/metbull.php)\n\n**1. \"Northwest Africa 7701\" meteorite**\n\nThis meteorite seems very legitimate as it contians a name following the usual pattern of \"<place_description> <number>\" and it also contains a class as well as a mass. \n\nWhen searching for it in the TMS DB, the following entry appeared:\n\n![alt text](static\/meteor_na.PNG \"Northwest Africa 7701 meteorite\")\n\nAs we can see, both recclass and mass columns are matching. Also, it is clear that now have a plausible year. \"*2010*\" being 'close' character-wise to 2101, we could think of a human mistake when completing this dataset. Further details about the meteorite explain it was discovered in Agadir, Morocco.

When plotted, we obtain this:","a1f0deb2":"We can here see that the same positively skewed type of data appear with our plot. This is a sign that the overall dataset mainly consists in, as said earlier, of very lightly weighted meteorites. \n\n### \"Other\" features\n\n#### fall\nThis categorical feature is highly useful and is the main point of interest of this dataset: it specifies wether or not a meteorite has been seen falling.\nI takes two values: \n   - *Fell*: the meteorite's fall was observed\n   - *Found*: the meteorite's fall was **not** observed\n   \nLet's explore how both are distributed:","9a9f12d4":"### \"Physical properties\" feature\n\nWe have pointed out, for the moment, that most meteorites seem to be located in Antarctica (or at least the ones we find). We will now explore in more details what comes to meteorites composition and properties. After this, we will eventually link our result and do some multifeature analysis in order to answer our problematic.\n\n#### nametype\n\nAs a reminder, nametype column can take two values; one of:\n   - *valid*: a typical meteorite\n   - *relict*: a meteorite that has been highly degraded by weather on Earth\n   \nWhat are the distribution of each feature ? How could we interpret this ?\nTo start, let's just have a barplot (circle plot are not convenient at all to notice small differences, this is why barplot is always to be considered instead of circle plot).","032bf504":"However, before calculating the density, we need to take care of countries such as Australia that are separated in different instance in this dataset (one per island). We need to set the SQKM to be the sum of all and distribute it evenly between the island.","e3f14487":"## Features Analysis\n\nAs explained before, each line of our dataset is made of 10 columns. We will analyze and give insights on each and every single one of them.\n\nA first distinction we could make in those features is about how they describe the meteorite. Indeed, some columns seem to go along describing the positio where the meteorite fell whereas others describe more its physical properties. We could then group them as followed:\n\n| Localisation | Physical properties | Others |\n|:------------:|:-------------------:|:------:|\n|     name     |       nametype      |   id   |\n|    reclat    |       recclass      |  fall  |\n|    reclong   |         mass        |  year  |\n|  GeoLocation |                     |        |\n|              |                     |        |\n\nTherefore, we should see some sort of redundancy between features, especially the ones targeting the localisation.","29e74254":"Then it appears clearly that the most common place of meteorite landings is called \"*Yamato*\". After research, it appears that this name is a reference to the Yamato Glacier which is a glacier about 6 miles (10 km) wide, flowing west between Mount Fukushima and Mount Eyskens in the Queen Fabiola Mountains of Antarctica (source: [link](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yamato_Glacier)).\n\nInterestingly, other names also make reference to places in **Antarctica** such as \"*Queen Alexandra Range*\" which is a Mountain range that have multiple peaks more than 4000m high (source: [link](https:\/\/www.peakbagger.com\/range.aspx?rid=8122)).\n\nTherefore, it seems interesting to point this area as, potentially, receiving a lot of meteorites.","2764dbe8":"To see how we will use this package, let's take the first line of our meteorite dataset as an example.","1250fef5":"Apparently, our dataset does not contain it. Anyway, this meteorite is worth studying as it is unique in its kind compared to other meteorites. Talking about unique meteorites, a bunch of them are yet to be classified. Which are they ? What are their characteristics ? This is our next analysis.","5bbdd8a8":"This meteorite appears to have been found near by Milano, in the year 1490. When searching for it on different ressources, we obtain the following information:\n>*A stone the size of a man's head, light grey with a \"burnt\" surface, was seen to fall near Crema, E.F.F. Chladni, Die Feuer-Meteore. This was clearly a true meteorite.
