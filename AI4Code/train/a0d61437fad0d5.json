I laugehed way too hard whenever Joe Biden says malarkey.\n* What was the hardest part of this project? getting the messages to work\n* What was the easiest part of this project? importing random numbers\n* How did you utilize your peer feedback? Dlyon helped me on the stuff I was stuck on. He helped with with the varaibles and stuffl\n* What was different between your plan and the  final project?\n* How well did you plan? Was your idea too easy? Too hard? Just right? It took me an embrassingly long time to get this project to work because I could not figure out how to put in the random number generator, It was harder than it should have been.\n* If you had unlimited time, what would you add to this project? I wanted to figure out how to get memes of Joe biden to play if you got a certain numbers of malarkey.","30d20ffc":"# Make a Plan","5be7f704":"#Unit 1 Project: Basic Programming\nType your name here","8781a66f":"Create a plan using the planning document on paper.
