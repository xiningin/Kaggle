Further there are a lot of additional costs depending on the model, the millage, the fuel consumption etc.\nUsually the older the car is, the less it will be worth. For example, a new car might lose 20-30% of its value in only 1-2 years, but later the diminution might be slower. A car loses less or more value every year depending of its type. Sometimes it can even increase in value.\n\n<strong>In the analysis we will focus on the best time to buy and to sell a car to minimize the value lost. <\/strong>\n","b20b2bc3":"<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/K5zuZGG.png\"\/> ","c152fbe9":"<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lwTcFMl.png\" align = \"left\">","32e02519":"## Condition & Status:\n","39b30a17":"# Find the best time to buy or sell a car","9e111f88":"As we can see most of the vehicle are between 0 and 20 years old.","4bffcf46":"We can see that the price is usually between 100 and 40.000\\$ with a lot of outliers.","3261a554":"Finally we come to the most interesting part, the price by age of the vehicle depending on the vehicle type.
