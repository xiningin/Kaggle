Second, you also have another column `IMDb_rating` which tells you the IMDb rating of a movie. This rating is determined by taking the average of hundred-thousands of ratings from the general audience. \n\nAs a part of this subtask, you are required to find out the highest rated movies which have been liked by critics and audiences alike.\n1. Firstly you will notice that the `MetaCritic` score is on a scale of `100` whereas the `IMDb_rating` is on a scale of 10. First convert the `MetaCritic` column to a scale of 10.\n2. Now, to find out the movies which have been liked by both critics and audiences alike and also have a high rating overall, you need to -\n    - Create a new column `Avg_rating` which will have the average of the `MetaCritic` and `Rating` columns\n    - Retain only the movies in which the absolute difference(using abs() function) between the `IMDb_rating` and `Metacritic` columns is less than 0.5.

As a part of this subtask, you need to aggregate a few values over these 3 columns. \n1. First create a new dataframe `df_by_genre` that contains `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` and all the columns related to **CVotes\/Votes** from the `movies` data frame. There are 47 columns to be extracted in total.\n2. Now, Add a column called `cnt` to the dataframe `df_by_genre` and initialize it to one. You will realise the use of this column by the end of this subtask.\n3. First group the dataframe `df_by_genre` by `genre_1` and find the sum of all the numeric columns such as `cnt`, columns related to CVotes and Votes columns and store it in a dataframe `df_by_g1`.\n4. Perform the same operation for `genre_2` and `genre_3` and store it dataframes `df_by_g2` and `df_by_g3` respectively. \n5. Now that you have 3 dataframes performed by grouping over `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` separately, it's time to combine them. For this, add the three dataframes and store it in a new dataframe `df_add`, so that the corresponding values of Votes\/CVotes get added for each genre.There is a function called `add()` in pandas which lets you do this. You can refer to this link to see how this function works. https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/version\/0.23.4\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.add.html\n6. The column `cnt` on aggregation has basically kept the track of the number of occurences of each genre.Subset the genres that have atleast 10 movies into a new dataframe `genre_top10` based on the `cnt` column value.\n7. Now, take the mean of all the numeric columns by dividing them with the column value `cnt` and store it back to the same dataframe. We will be using this dataframe for further analysis in this task unless it is explicitly mentioned to use the dataframe `movies`.\n8. Since the number of votes can't be a fraction, type cast all the CVotes related columns to integers.

Since we have the vote counts for both males and females, across various age groups, let's now see how the popularity of genres vary between the two genders in the dataframe. \n\n1. Make the first heatmap to see how the average number of votes of males is varying across the genres. Use seaborn heatmap for this analysis. The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for males, i.e., `CVotesU18M`,`CVotes1829M`, `CVotes3044M`, and `CVotes45AM`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-male group. \n\n2. Make the second heatmap to see how the average number of votes of females is varying across the genres. Use seaborn heatmap for this analysis. The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for females, i.e., `CVotesU18F`,`CVotes1829F`, `CVotes3044F`, and `CVotes45AF`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-female group. \n\n3. Make sure that you plot these heatmaps side by side using `subplots` so that you can easily compare the two genders and derive insights.\n\n4. Write your any three inferences from this plot. You can make use of the previous bar plot also here for better insights.\nRefer to this link- https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.heatmap.html. You might have to plot something similar to the fifth chart in this page (You have to plot two such heatmaps side by side).\n\n5. Repeat subtasks 1 to 4, but now instead of taking the CVotes-related columns, you need to do the same process for the Votes-related columns. These heatmaps will show you how the two genders have rated movies across various genres.\n\nYou might need the below link for formatting your heatmap.\nhttps:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/56942670\/matplotlib-seaborn-first-and-last-row-cut-in-half-of-heatmap-plot\n\n-  Note : Use `genre_top10` dataframe for this subtask","8a3adf24":"**`Checkpoint 3:`** Most of the movies appear to be sharply 2 hour-long.","f9d3cc7f":"-  ###  Subtask 3.4: US vs non-US Cross Analysis\n\nThe dataset contains both the US and non-US movies.

The column `IFUS` should contain the value \"USA\" if the `Country` of the movie is \"USA\". For all other countries other than the USA, `IFUS` should contain the value `non-USA`.\n\n\n2. Now make a boxplot that shows how the number of votes from the US people i.e. `CVotesUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Make use of the column `IFUS` to make this plot. Similarly, make another subplot that shows how non US voters have voted for the US and non-US movies by plotting `CVotesnUS` for both the US and non-US movies. Write any of your two inferences\/observations from these plots.\n\n\n3. Again do a similar analysis but with the ratings. Make a boxplot that shows how the ratings from the US people i.e. `VotesUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Similarly, make another subplot that shows how `VotesnUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Write any of your two inferences\/observations from these plots.\n\nNote : Use `movies` dataframe for this subtask.

Let's add a small condition to it and make sure that all three actors are popular. The condition is **none of the three actors' Facebook likes should be less than half of the other two**. For example, the following is a valid combo:\n- actor_1_facebook_likes: 70000\n- actor_2_facebook_likes: 40000\n- actor_3_facebook_likes: 50000\n\nBut the below one is not:\n- actor_1_facebook_likes: 70000\n- actor_2_facebook_likes: 40000\n- actor_3_facebook_likes: 30000\n\nsince in this case, `actor_3_facebook_likes` is 30000, which is less than half of `actor_1_facebook_likes`.\n\nHaving this condition ensures that you aren't getting any unpopular actor in your trio (since the total likes calculated in the previous question doesn't tell anything about the individual popularities of each actor in the trio.).\n\nYou can do a manual inspection of the top 5 popular trios you have found in the previous subtask and check how many of those trios satisfy this condition. Also, which is the most popular trio after applying the condition above? Write your answers in the markdown cell provided below.","48d2c4e1":"If you take a look at the final dataframe that you have gotten, you will see that you now have the complete information about all the demographic (Votes- and CVotes-related) columns across the top 10 genres. We can use this dataset to extract exciting insights about the voters!","573a19b3":"- ### Subtask 2.7: R-Rated Movies\n\nAlthough R rated movies are restricted movies for the under 18 age group, still there are vote counts from that age group. Among all the R rated movies that have been voted by the under-18 age group, find the top 10 movies that have the highest number of votes i.e.`CVotesU18` from the `movies` dataframe. Store these in a dataframe named `PopularR`.","2a8a3d0f":"## Task 2: Data Analysis\n\nNow that we have loaded the dataset and inspected it, we see that most of the data is in place. As of now, no data cleaning is required, so let's start with some data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation to get various insights about the data. ","20703a8c":"**`Inferences:`** Write your two inferences\/observations below:\n- Inference 1:\n- Inference 2:","a933b2df":"## Task 3 : Demographic analysis\n\nIf you take a look at the last columns in the dataframe, most of these are related to demographics of the voters (in the last subtask, i.e., 2.8, you made use one of these columns - CVotesU18). We also have three genre columns indicating the genres of a particular movie. We will extensively use these columns for the third and the final stage of our assignment wherein we will analyse the voters across all demographics and also see how these vary across various genres. So without further ado, let's get started with `demographic analysis`.","c539ede1":"**`Checkpoint 1:`** Can you spot the movie `Tangled` in the dataset? You may be aware of the movie 'Tangled'. Although its one of the highest grossing movies of all time, it has negative profit as per this result. If you cross check the gross values of this movie (link: https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0398286\/), you can see that the gross in the dataset accounts only for the domestic gross and not the worldwide gross. This is true for may other movies also in the list."}}
