","6ece7430":"Let's look at the Genre column once closely to see if we can find some meaningful information. From the earlier output of sample rows, we could see that keywords like \"pop\" which is a very casual nature of music is available in many Genres of many songs but is represented in different ways. We can perform some data cleaning there to get the actual Genre of the song, wherever applicable\/possible. ","304bb1e4":"We have quite a good model now. Only in 3 cases we have considerable differences in the predictions out of 15 cases, while the rest of the cases are almost a near to accurate match to the actual target variable. Hence, we are able to quite accurately predict the popularity of the song at least from the top 50 songs list extract out of Spotify. Needless to say, if we input more data and improve our model further, we may have very good predictions as well, as compared to the current model. \n\nLooking at the coefficients of our Model, again, it is evident that Accousticness and Speechiness and Energy of the song effect the Popularity of our songs very much positively. Valence and Length of the song effects the popularity of the song negetively. \n\nFurther, let's perform Variance Inflation Factor analysis, to see if we can find a better model yet again by removing such features, which are inter-correlated with each other, so that we can explain the maximum possible variance in our data.

","e4921603":"Overall now we have seen the patterns in Genre of our Data. It is clear that Pop Genre is the most liked songs in the Top 50 songs list. \n\nNow let's try to see the distributions of the numerical variables\/features, and then, further, combine the numerical and categorical variables . ","f94687e3":"We have now created the Linear Regression Model with all variables. Note that the features Accousticness and Speechiness of a song contributes most to the Popularity of the song. The model has done a good job, but not great, in predicting the outcomes as we can see from comparing the Predictions and Actuals. However, we have a big intercept value of 88, I.e,, without the effect of any variable, our model suggest a value of 88 for the popularity score of a song on Spotify, which does not look good. It seems we may have to further do some preparations\/cleaning of our data to get rid of unwanted features, by means of VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) analysis &\/or PCA, so that we can get a better model, post which we can try out other modelling options like Lasso and Ridge. ","f9e59e3a":"Finally, we have much more stable model without any inflation factors or inter-correlations between the features themselves. \n\nPart of the model's output, we find that Accousticness and Speechiness is highly positively correlated with the Popularity of the song, while the Valence and Length of the song reduces the Popularity of the song. \n\nFinally, let's check our linear predictions by plotting the Actuals and Predictions on Test set and also if our error terms have normal distribution or not. ","992ce500":"Overall it seems that other than the Speechiness of any song, there is no linear relationship with any other features\/columns with the Popularity of the song. We may later try to fit a Multiple Linear regression problem to find a model for predicting the Popularity of a song and the variables effecting or resulting into Popularity of a song. Also, we can shorten the dataset with only the top 4 Genres of songs (Pop, Latin, Hip-Hop and Rap) and try to fit a Clustering algorithm to see the clusters of data, but since we have 23 Pop songs in the top 50 songs, that'd not be a good model. \n\nIn lieu of this, let's try and build a Multiple Linear Regression Model and see how it works with this data. We will prepare a different dataframe with the Numeric fields, while converting the text fields into Numerical fields (excluding the obvious fields like Track Title and Artist Name), followed by dividing the data into Training and Testing sets, and then we will fit our model. Finally, we will try to find our model's performance, and then try other forms of Regression (Lasso &\/or Ridge) to find better results, wherever applicable. Definitely, we will have to check the distribution of the variables\/features and scale them wherever appropriate. ","596ddce6":"Which song is the most Lively? "}}
