I guess the reason is that it does not change the vocabulary at all, and does not change the word order very much. Thus it does not provide much diversity to the data.","dc8bcf48":"Orginally want to try back-translation, but that requires internet connection which is not allowed if I want to submit. So instead, I tried the data augmentation method metioned here https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jpmiller\/extending-train-data-with-markov-chains-auc. It is using markov chain to learn the word sequence and generate new ones. However, I saw huge overfiting on my own validation set. So I didn't continue on this method, but still, it is interesting to see the machine generated sentences."}}
