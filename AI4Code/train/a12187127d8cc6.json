I'm actually quite surprised that the Olympics would have such a huge effect on a site like Wikipedia. I would say that the Japanese, Spanish, and media data differ the most. For media pages, this is expected since most people will access pages via links from other sites rather than through the main page or search function. The fact that some of the languages show large differences between the main page and the aggregated data suggests that the dataset is perhaps not very representative of all traffic to Wikipedia.\n\n\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8b\u60c5\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u975e\u5e38\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u6211\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u60ca\u8bb6\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u5bf9\u5965\u8fd0\u4f1a\u6709\u8fd9\u4e48\u5927\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u65e5\u672c\u3001\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u548c\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5dee\u5f02\u6700\u5927\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5a92\u4f53\u9875\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9884\u671f\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u9875\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u9875\u6216\u641c\u7d22\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u6240\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002","db5cb6ea":"So then how does the total number of views change over time?\nI'll plot all the different sets on the same plot.
