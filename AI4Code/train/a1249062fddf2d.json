Here I will try to to map key features that can lead to a win.  Special thanks to [Dr. Penguin](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/xiyuewang\/lol-how-to-win) as I modified from his notebook.","ac39bf5b":"# Conclusion","287b9c85":"# EDA","7671f6dd":"Dataset is pretty clean so, I'm not gonna remove any features for now except for gameId.","3dd560a2":"Based on the minimally tuned gradient boosted trees, the prediction accuracy is roughly 73%.  I think that's not too bad, since most League win rates hover around 50% anyway.  Based on the feature importance, we can see that acquiring gold is the largest benefit to winning a game.  But that really isn't too suprising, since gold is an indirect measure of how well a team is doing.  \n\nThe next big advantage is getting dragons.  Now this makes sense due to dragons giving permanent buffs. Also having good dragon control from my experience means that you have a good jungler with a strong enough bot lane to secure the buff.  Closely tied to dragons is the jungle minions killed.  I think this makes a sense too due to a stronger jungler tends to have better items that lead to more successful ganks.\n\nThe last key feature I want to discuss is vision.  Vision is key, since if you know where the enemy is then you can make proper plans to avoid deaths and plan for objectives.\n\nIn summary, LoL is a pretty complex game and, based on this simple analysis, that there are many factors that come into play for a victory.  If I had to sum it up in three points to help you win more games is get dragons, CS well, and maintain vision control to reduce deaths.  Hope you liked it for my first shared kernel\/notebook and comments are welcome!","2e53b834":"We can see co-linearity between variables.  I am going to go with a tree based method.  Luckily, tree algorithms are immune to multicollinearity by nature, since the tree will choose only one of the perfectly correlated features.","f62801fc":"## Gradient Boosting"}}
