Members of each team are stored in a list. The Coach is the first name in the list, the captain is the second name in the list, and other players are listed after that. \nThese lists are stored in another list, which starts with the best team and proceeds through the list to the worst team last.  Complete the function below to select the **captain** of the worst team.","ff5a29b8":"## 3.\n\nThe next iteration of Mario Kart will feature an extra-infuriating new item, the *Purple Shell*.

If you have any questions or feedback (or just want to argue about whether Pluto should be a planet), head over to the [forums](https:\/\/kaggle.com\/learn-forum).\n\nRemember that your notebook is private by default. To share it with other people or ask for help with it, you'll need to make it public. First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also let's you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n\nI'll see you tomorrow for day 5, when we'll talk about loops (finally!).","514157dd":"## 1.\n\nComplete the function below according to its docstring.","20f36ea3":"## 5. <span title=\"A bit spicy\" style=\"color: darkgreen \">\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f<\/span>\n\nWe're using lists to record people who attended our party and what order they arrived in.

However, they must not be the very last guest (that's taking it too far). In the above example, Mona and Gilbert are the only guests who were fashionably late.\n\nComplete the function below which takes a list of party attendees as well as a person, and tells us whether that person is fashionably late.","1f3d340b":"## 6. <span style=\"color: firebrick\" title=\"This is an optional extra-spicy question\">\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f<\/span>\n\n*This question is intended more as a fun riddle than a test of your programming prowess :)*\n\nImplement the body of the following function **using only tools we've covered so far - NO LOOPS!**","7830eab5":"## 4.\n\nWhat are the lengths of the following lists?
