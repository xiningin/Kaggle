started around two years ago at a workshop where 12 cloud experts came together to discuss shallow clouds over the ocean. These clouds look benign compared to big thunderstorms but, in fact, for the Earth\u2019s climate they play a huge role. The reason is that they reflect a lot of sunlight back into space, thereby cooling our planet, while only contributing marginally to the greenhouse effect. This means that it\u2019s really important to figure out how these clouds will change as our planet warms. Current climate models, however, struggle with that. They do not even agree whether there will be more or less of these shallow clouds.\n\n\nPart of the reason is that shallow clouds aren\u2019t just the result of the global circulation of the atmosphere. Rather, they have a life of their own and arrange themselves in a variety of patterns. For many of these patterns, the basic mechanisms behind them are poorly understood. This brings us back to our group of scientists. As they were looking through hundreds of satellite images like the ones shown on this page, they noticed that some structures occur more often than others. After some discussion, they agreed on four common patterns and called them Sugar, Flower, Fish and Gravel.\n\n![](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1050\/1*Wz8Rosw9W0VDorCwcLIxkg.png)\n\nSource: Awesome article by Stephan Rasp https:\/\/medium.com\/@raspstephan","d8a815ab":"# Images with class 1","f9b2563f":"# Images with class 4","751286c5":"I devote the credits for the code of this kernel to @GoldFish kernel at [https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/go1dfish\/clear-mask-visualization-and-simple-eda](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/go1dfish\/clear-mask-visualization-and-simple-eda)","35476e15":"## Figuring out the total number of images having empty masks.","a7ed0bc5":"## Label wise breakdown of empty masks.","e540a579":"## Checking image size for train and test","2d8236b1":"# Images with multiple classes","58f0ad5a":"**Dice Coefficient (F1 Score)**\n\nDice coefficient is a statistic used to gauge the similarity of two samples.\n\nSimply put, the Dice Coefficient is 2 * the Area of Overlap divided by the total number of pixels in both images.
