One way to initialise is to set all the parameters to 0. This is not a considered a good strategy as all the neurons will behave the same way and it'll defeat the purpose of deep networks. Hence, we initialize the weights randomly to very small values but not zeros. The biases are initialized to 0. Note that the **`initialize_parameters`** function initializes the parameters for all the layers in one `for` loop. \n\nThe inputs to this function is a list named `dimensions`.
