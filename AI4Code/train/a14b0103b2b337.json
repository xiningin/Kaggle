Inexpensive low-power public charging stations will also provide AC power, known as \"AC charging stations\". To facilitate higher power charging, which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters, the converter is built into the charging station instead of the vehicle, and the station supplies already-converted DC power directly to the vehicle, bypassing the vehicle's onboard converter. These are known as \"DC charging stations\". Most fully electric car models can accept both AC and DC power.\n\nCharging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to be able to supply a wide variety of vehicles. Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas.\n\n\n","342a9e13":"**Putting an index**","3d46d039":"**Charge Fee of charging an Ev**","cd894ac3":"**Finding out the type and number of entries**","05a7135a":"**Regression line of Chargers  to Ports**","763ed384":"**Number of charging stations in a Facility**","4048cd62":"**Importing the Dataset**","ced2dd41":"1.
