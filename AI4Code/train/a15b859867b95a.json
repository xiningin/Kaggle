The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.\n\nThe health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. Refer to Technical notes for more details.\n\nThe HDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security, empowerment, etc. The HDRO offers the other composite indices as broader proxy on some of the key issues of human development, inequality, gender disparity and poverty.\n\nReference :http:\/\/hdr.undp.org\/en\/content\/human-development-index-hdi","28bf0dcd":"A basic  graph from the total cases vs total deaths also the STI with green","792c50e4":"# The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic of each country","0f6c12af":"## GDP Per Capita\nA country's GDP or gross domestic product is calculated by taking into account the monetary worth of a nation's goods and services after a certain period of time, usually one year. It's a measure of economic activity.\n\n### How Does GDP Per Capita Work?\nEssentially, GDP per capita acts as a metric for determining a country's economic output per each person living there. Often times, rich nations with smaller populations tend to have higher per capita GDP. Once you do the math, the wealth is spread among fewer people, which raises a country's GDP.\n\nThe fact that the GDP per capita divides a country's economic output by its total population makes it a good measurement of a country's standard of living, especially since it tells you how prosperous a country feels to each of its citizens.","6e166f8e":"> This is not really helpful so I looked for an other grouping method","4100edcb":"This dataset contains at least 210 countries, it presented below on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy of each country.\n\nNote :\n\n* CODE\n* COUNTRY\n* DATE\n* HDI : human_development_index\n* TC : total_cases\n* TD : total_deaths\n* STI : stringency_index\n* POP : population\n* GDPCAP : gdp_per_capita","b9e30fe6":"The correlation between the total cases and deaths","f9f176b3":"Sorry, u need to rerrun the code if you want to see the iPython widgets","b0d372d5":"Much better, but it's still fuzzy.
