The information contained into an image is the intensity of each channel color into the width and height of the image, just like this:\n\n<img src='https:\/\/ibm.box.com\/shared\/static\/xlpv9h5xws248c09k1rlx7cer69y4grh.png'>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/windows\/desktop\/dn424131.aspx\">Image Source<\/a>\n\nSo the intensity of the red channel at each point with width and height can be represented into a matrix, the same goes for the blue and green channels, so we end up having three matrices, and when these are combined they form a tensor. \n","d750c0dc":"Annotating the python functions with **tf.function** uses TensorFlow Autograph to create a TensorFlow static execution graph for the function.   tf.function annotation tells TensorFlow Autograph to transform function _add_ into TensorFlow control flow, which then defines the TensorFlow static execution graph. \n","8110934d":"* * *\n","a6969ef6":"We now create a python method _increment_by_one_.

This allows TensorFlow code to be executed and evaluated line by line. Before version 2.x was released, every graph had to be run wihthin a TensorFlow session. This only allowed for the entire graph to be run all at once. This would make debugging the computation graph each time. \n","d168d3f1":"<a id=\"ref3\"><\/a>\n\n# tf.function and AutoGraph\n","ce34821d":"<b>tf.shape<\/b> returns the shape of our data structure.\n","e514967b":"As mathematical objects: <br><br>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/ibm.box.com\/shared\/static\/kmxz570uai8eeg6i6ynqdz6kmlx1m422.png\">\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/book.mql4.com\/variables\/arrays\">Image Source<\/a><\/div>\n","b68af179":"Now that you understand these data structures, I encourage you to play with them using some previous functions to see how they will behave, according to their structure types:\n","36e92937":"Summarizing:<br><br>\n\n<table style=\"width:100%\">\n  <tr>\n    <td><b>Dimension<\/b><\/td>\n    <td><b>Physical Representation<\/b><\/td> \n    <td><b>Mathematical Object<\/b><\/td>\n    <td><b>In Code<\/b><\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n  \n  <tr>\n    <td>Zero <\/td>\n    <td>Point<\/td> \n    <td>Scalar (Single Number)<\/td>\n    <td>[ 1 ]<\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>One<\/td>\n    <td>Line<\/td> \n    <td>Vector (Series of Numbers) <\/td>\n    <td>[ 1,2,3,4,... ]<\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n  \n   <tr>\n    <td>Two<\/td>\n    <td>Surface<\/td> \n    <td>Matrix (Table of Numbers)<\/td>\n       <td>[ [1,2,3,4,...], [1,2,3,4,...], [1,2,3,4,...],... ]<\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n  \n   <tr>\n    <td>Three<\/td>\n    <td>Volume<\/td> \n    <td>Tensor (Cube of Numbers)<\/td>\n    <td>[ [[1,2,...], [1,2,...], [1,2,...],...], [[1,2,...], [1,2,...], [1,2,...],...], [[1,2,...], [1,2,...], [1,2,...] ,...]... ]<\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n  \n<\/table>\n","1ce9b63b":"Let's first create a simple counter, by first initializing a variable _v_ that will be increased one unit at a time:\n","6ac9a845":"<a id=\"ref2\"><\/a>\n\n<h2>How does TensorFlow work?<\/h2>\n\nTensorFlow defines computations as Graphs, and these are made with operations (also know as \u201cops\u201d). So, when we work with TensorFlow, it is the same as defining a series of operations in a Graph.\n\nFor example, the image below represents a graph in TensorFlow. _W_, _x_ and _b_ are tensors over the edges of this graph. _MatMul_ is an operation over the tensors_W_ and _b_, after that _Add_ is called and add the result of the previous operator with _b_. The resultant tensors of each operation cross the next one until the end where it's possible to get the wanted result.\n","2a5e3264":"* * *\n","5c1a70bf":"### References:\n","4835d3a6":"<h3>What is the meaning of Tensor?<\/h3>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success alertsuccess\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n<font size = 3><strong>In TensorFlow all data is passed between operations in a computation graph, and these are passed in the form of Tensors, hence the name of TensorFlow.<\/strong><\/font>\n<br>\n<br>\n    The word <b>tensor<\/b> from new latin means \"that which stretches\".
