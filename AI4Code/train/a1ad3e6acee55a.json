(by the numbers)","623a43d7":"Moving on from pies (so to speak!), we make use of the column names and the data contained in the columns to figure out how many people replied yes to using a certain language. If you look at the quetion bank, We have question starting from the index 3 that asks, \"Java:What other language(s) do you use?\" . The interesting thing about this is that the pattern remains the same until column 24. We have a pattern and the pattern is that \"whatever is left of the colon is the programming language name , hence the question is being asked about that programming language! i.e. besides Python, Do you use X language? We use this pattern and extract our data to see which language stands out besides Python.\""}}
