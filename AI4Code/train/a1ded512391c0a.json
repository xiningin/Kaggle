Thanks to this simple technique, most of the characteristics of living plants are visible on the dried plant. The few that are not (e.g. flower colour, scent, height of a tree, vegetation type) are written on the collection label by the collector. Most importantly, the label should tell us where and when the specimen was collected.\n\nA working reference collection\nA herbarium acts like a plant library or vast catalogue with each of our three million specimens providing unique information \u2013 where it was found, when it flowered, what it looks like and it\u2019s DNA, which remains intact for many years. DNA is now routinely extracted from herbarium specimens. The most important specimens are called 'types'. The type specimen, chosen by the author of the species name, becomes the physical reference for the new species.\n\nThis unique working reference collection brings species from all over the world together into one place to be discovered, described and compared. The work is disseminated through the writing of Floras (a description of all the plants in a country or region), monographs (a description of plants or fungi within a group, such as a family) and scientific papers. This fundamental research provides an essential baseline for other plant-based research and helps inform conservation practices.\n\n[Click here for further details.[](http:\/\/)](https:\/\/www.rbge.org.uk\/science-and-conservation\/herbarium\/)","862a8e0d":"# **Top 100 categories**"}}
