You can follow this steps in AWS Sagemaker or other Jupyter Notebook Environment. Just remember route the right address of the files **.csv**.\nI hope you can enjoy it as i enjoy coding it.\n\n## Index\n1. Importing needed libraries\n2. Create the merge function\n3. Saving the final csv\n\n### 1. Importing needed libraries\nHere we work with Pandas, a Python based library that helps us with the hard work with data. Yes, that type of work like generate grouping or aggregations or simply generate Descriptive Statistics with few commands.","ba73df34":"Yeah.
