This looks quite weird and probably some external factor is impacting this data point. \n\nLet us also check CO2 levels with the familiar heatmap:","353b7ea0":"Here we study Weather Data from Beutenberg Campus situated in Southern Jena, Germany. \nI downloaded 2 Years worth of weather data from Jan 2017 - Dec 2018 sampled every 10 minutes. \nYou can download the data from here (https:\/\/github.com\/HimanshuGautam17\/Personal-Data-Repo). \n\nLet us start with some exploratory analysis to understand the Data. ","bbb01455":"As per standards CO2 levels upto 350 ppm are fine. This suggests the region is in compliance with pollution standards. Interestingly some very low values ~0 (probably due to sensor issues) puts the heat map in a dark perception. Also a very interesting phenomenon is seen, where CO2 concentration is much higher in Night time as compared to Day time. With my limited understanding of the environment science i would attribute this difference to the photosynthesis process in plants during day time. \n\nPlease share your feedbacks\/suggestions.

Also it is easily seen that Feb 2018 was the coldest month and July 2018 was the hottest month. Also Temperature varies between 11 degree to ~20 degrees during summer months and stays between ~0 degree to 9 degrees during winter months. \n\nLet us see some other variable in a similar plot to know more:"}}
