This problem is extremely common in practice and can be observed in various disciplines including fraud detection, anomaly detection, medical diagnosis, oil spillage detection, facial recognition, etc.\n\n* Why is it a problem?\nIf there is a dataset consisting of 10000 genuine and 10 fraudulent transactions, the classifier will tend to classify fraudulent transactions as genuine transactions. The reason can be easily explained by the numbers. Suppose the machine learning algorithm has two possibly outputs as follows:\n    \n        * Model 1 classified 7 out of 10 fraudulent transactions as genuine transactions and 10 out of 10000 genuine transactions as fraudulent transactions.\n        * Model 2 classified 2 out of 10 fraudulent transactions as genuine transactions and 100 out of 10000 genuine transactions as fraudulent transactions.\n \n \nIf the classifier\u2019s performance is determined by the number of mistakes, then clearly Model 1 is better as it makes only a total of 17 mistakes while Model 2 made 102 mistakes. However, as we want to minimize the number of fraudulent transactions happening, we should pick Model 2 instead which only made 2 mistakes classifying the fraudulent transactions. Of course, this could come at the expense of more genuine transactions being classified as fraudulent transactions, but will be a cost we can bear for now. Anyhow, a general machine learning algorithm will just pick Model 1 than Model 2, which is a problem. In practice, this means we will let a lot of fraudulent transactions go through although we could have stopped them by using Model 2. This translates to unhappy customers and money lost for the company."}}
