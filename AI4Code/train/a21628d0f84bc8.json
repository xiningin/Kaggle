I wanted to give it a try in this dataset just for fun.\n\n### What are Chernoff faces?\n#### Chernoff faces, invented by Herman Chernoff in 1973, display multivariate data in the shape of a human face. The individual parts, such as eyes, ears, mouth and nose represent values of the variables by their shape, size, placement and orientation. The idea behind using faces is that humans easily recognize faces and notice small changes without difficulty. Chernoff faces handle each variable differently. Because the features of the faces vary in perceived importance, the way in which variables are mapped to the features should be carefully chosen (e.g. eye size and eyebrow-slant have been found to carry significant weight) ([paper]( http:\/\/www.research.ibm.com\/people\/c\/cjmorris\/publications\/Chernoff_990402.pdf)). Following is an example for the famous iris dataset ([source](https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets\/iris)) where features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) are presented as Chernoff faces and the colour marks each of the species (i.e. the target: setosa, versicolor, virginica) ([source](https:\/\/github.com\/antononcube\/MathematicaForPrediction\/blob\/master\/MarkdownDocuments\/Making-Chernoff-faces-for-data-visualization.md)):\n\n![Chernoff faces](https:\/\/camo.githubusercontent.com\/ced6cd0923a923aade542c33f9ccc86614049e30ab7c0c1085ee7823752ce858\/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7550425a4a75666c2e676966)\n\n#### It can be seen that different species have different characteristic facial features that let their indentification visually very easily.\n#### Let's take a look now at how the Chernoff faces look like for the numerical features of this competition and whether the resultant faces can help to discriminate the target classes in some way.","0321b7f1":"#### I leave it to you to find the characteristic facial features (if any) of each class!","b25c4904":"#### Let's plot some faces at random for each of the classes (background color salmon:0, backgorund color turquoise:1):"}}
