That is exactly what we are going to do in this section. We are going to build a recommender based on the following metadata: the 3 top actors, the director, related genres and the movie plot keywords.\n\nFrom the cast, crew and keywords features, we need to extract the three most important actors, the director and the keywords associated with that movie.

The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n\n","a3b9ef8b":"Next, we'll write functions that will help us to extract the required information from each feature.","c172bf82":"> *  **Content Based Filtering**- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.","7ca4aac8":"For any of you who has done even a  bit of text processing before knows we need to convert the word vector of each overview.\nNow we'll compute Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors for each overview.\n\nNow if you are wondering what is term frequency , it is the relative frequency of a word in a document and is given as\n   **(term instances\/total instances)**.\nInverse Document Frequency is the relative count of documents containing the term is given as \n**log(number of documents\/documents with term)**\nThe overall importance of each word to the documents in which they appear is equal to **TF * IDF**\n\nThis will give you a matrix where each column represents a word in the overview vocabulary (all the words that appear in at least one document) and each column represents a movie, as before.This is done to reduce the importance of words that occur frequently in plot overviews and therefore, their significance in computing the final similarity score.\n\nFortunately, scikit-learn gives you a built-in TfIdfVectorizer class that produces the TF-IDF matrix in a couple of lines.","30be5d23":"We see that our recommender has been successful in capturing more information due to more metadata and has given us (arguably) better recommendations. It is more likely that Marvels or DC comics fans will like the movies of the same production house.

Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play.

One important difference is that we use the **CountVectorizer()** instead of TF-IDF. This is because we do not want to down-weight the presence of an actor\/director if he or she has acted or directed in relatively more movies. It doesn't make much intuitive sense.","a4558a2b":"# **Collaborative Filtering**\n\nOur content based engine suffers from some severe limitations. It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.\n\nAlso, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who she\/he is.\n\nTherefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers.\nIt is basically of two types:-\n\n*  **User based filtering**-  These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity.\nThis filtering technique can be illustrated with an example. In the following matrixes, each row represents a user, while the columns correspond to different movies except the last one which records the similarity between that user and the target user. Each cell represents the rating that the user gives to that movie. Assume user E is the target.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*9NBFo4AUQABKfoUOpE3F8Q.png)\n\nSince user A and F do not share any movie ratings in common with user E, their similarities with user E are not defined in Pearson Correlation. Therefore, we only need to consider user B, C, and D. Based on Pearson Correlation, we can compute the following similarity.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*jZIMJzKM1hKTFftHfcSxRw.png)\n\nFrom the above table we can see that user D is very different from user E as the Pearson Correlation between them is negative. He rated Me Before You higher than his rating average, while user E did the opposite. Now, we can start to fill in the blank for the movies that user E has not rated based on other users.\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*9TC6BrfxYttJwiATFAIFBg.png)\n\n\n\n","47fba94b":"We see that over 20,000 different words were used to describe the 4800 movies in our dataset.\n\nWith this matrix in hand, we can now compute a similarity score. There are several candidates for this; such as the euclidean, the Pearson and the [cosine similarity scores](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cosine_similarity). There is no right answer to which score is the best. Different scores work well in different scenarios and it is often a good idea to experiment with different metrics.\n\nWe will be using the cosine similarity to calculate a numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies. We use the cosine similarity score since it is independent of magnitude and is relatively easy and fast to calculate. Mathematically, it is defined as
