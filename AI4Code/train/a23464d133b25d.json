Defining Survival as an Outcome Measure in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Arch Neurol. 2009;66(6):758\u2013761. doi:10.1001\/archneurol.2009.1\n\n\"Tracheostomy and permanent assisted ventilation are not equivalent to death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The use of respiratory interventions differs between centers, leading to variability in combined outcome assessments. The time to the end point can differ significantly depending on its definition, and combining outcomes does not reduce the estimated sample size of a trial. The death rate alone is the least variable and most easily identifiable measure of survival rate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\"\n\n\" Many patients who undergo PAV (permanent assisted ventilation) die when they decide to stop the ventilation, but patients with ALS also die of cardiac infarction, pulmonary embolism, or other events. Overall, approximately 18% of the participants died of causes other than a clear respiratory insufficiency, usually termed \u201csudden death.\u201d These data indicate that death is not necessarily related to the function of the respiratory muscles and that the time to administration of respiratory life support cannot be assumed to be equivalent to the time to death.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamaneurology\/fullarticle\/797270","d001cb45":"EvalML is an AutoML library that builds, optimizes, and evaluates machine learning pipelines using domain-specific objective functions.\n\nCombined with Featuretools and Compose, EvalML can be used to create end-to-end machine learning solutions for classification and regression problems.\n\nhttps:\/\/evalml.featurelabs.com\/en\/v0.9.0\/"}}
