Players choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory. **The objective of this study is to try different models to predict, based on game data of the first 10 minutes, whether the winner is the blue team or not.** This dataset contains the first 10min. stats of approx. 10k ranked games (SOLO QUEUE) from a high ELO (DIAMOND I to MASTER). Players have roughly the same level.\n\n### Glossary\n\n* Warding totem: An item that a player can put on the map to reveal the nearby area. Very useful for map\/objectives control.\n* Minions: NPC that belong to both teams. They give gold when killed by players.\n* Jungle minions: NPC that belong to NO TEAM. They give gold and buffs when killed by players.\n* Elite monsters: Monsters with high hp\/damage that give a massive bonus (gold\/XP\/stats) when killed by a team.\n* Dragons: Elite monster which gives team bonus when killed. The 4th dragon killed by a team gives a massive stats bonus. The 5th dragon (Elder Dragon) offers a huge advantage to the team.\n* Herald: Elite monster which gives stats bonus when killed by the player. It helps to push a lane and destroys structures.\n* Towers: Structures you have to destroy to reach the enemy Nexus. They give gold.\n* Level: Champion level. Start at 1. Max is 18.","8b2e2a00":"### Confusion Matrix","8237d44c":"### The models I have created work successfully at a rate of 70-73%. However, the data can be considered in more detail to increase accuracy. As a former League of Legen player, I know that there are many different parameters that determine the course of the game, and perhaps more optimized results can be obtained by studying the weights of these parameters.","fe32673c":"### Stochastic Gradient Descent","ab156c09":"### LogisticRegression","cb386dfd":"### Classification Report"}}
