Basic Data Cleaning","cc1efe36":"## 1.1. Investigating Missing Values\n\nHere are the columns that contain missing values: age (4.3%), race (9.6%), flee (4.6%), gender (0.03%).\n\nThese aren't a lot of missing values. Let's see if we can tackle them individually. \n\nArmed: In my opinion, I think we can assign the value 'unarmed' to all these values. My reasoning behind this is simple: In cases where the victim was armed, the police has an overwhelming desire to get this fact out there. Since the suspect being armed diminishes the blame for the shooting officers. Hence, if this information is unknown to us, we can assume that police weren't able to find any evidence of the suspect being armed.\n\nRace: This is a tricky one. Since we want to investigate racism and prejudice, I don't think we should impute the missing values here. So we will drop all values that don't contain information about the victim's race.\n\nAge: Like race, I will drop the missing values here. Very hard to impute them.\n\nFlee: I will apply the 'armed' logic here as well. I believe if the victim was fleeing, the police would've logged that into the report and it would've made its way into this dataset.\n\nGender: The missing values for this only constitute 0.03% of the values. We can look at these observations individual and impute the gender by the victim's name. If it isn't possible, we will drop the value.","3a5265e0":"## 2.3. Distribution by States\n\nWe plot the % of total shootings in the Top 20 most trigger-happy states on the left side of the graph. On the right side, we have the actual proportion of the total US population representated by the state. This gives us some interesting insights.\n\n1. States like California, New Mexico and Arizona are very trigger happy. Their proportion of shootings is much higher than their actual proportion of the population. It is interesting to note that all three of these states lie along the border with Mexico. Maybe there is a relationship there. We know Arizona's police\/sherrif force is extremely conservative and trigger happy. In California, LAPD has a similar reputation. \n\n2. New York surprisingly fares better. Although it has had some really high-profile shooting cases (i.e. Eric Garner), it generally fares better proportionally. It constitutes 6% of the US population by only over 2% of the shootings. This can be explained by the fact that NYPD places a greater importance on body-cams. Moreover, relatively speaking, it is a much liberal city. Same can be observed for Pennsylvania and Illinois.\n\n3. Oklahoma is very trigger happy. For a relatively small population proportion, it does have a lot of police shootings.","78656d25":"# 3. Conclusion\n\nFrom the basic analysis, we can see that there is definitely a racist bent in law enforcement in the United States. Proportionally speaking, black people are much more likely to be shot, no matter how you slice it. \n\nHowever, there are some caveats here.\n\n1. We require much more data to effectively make a conclusion.\n2. Black people are more likely to be suspected by the police. That obviously contributes to the higher shooting rate. However, we cannot quantify these biases effectively unless we have data regarding police searchers.\n\n\nNOTE: I will update the notebook. This was just a very basic rudimentary analysis.","91136563":"Let's look at unarmed shootings.","02a6786a":"## 2.2. Distribution by Age\n\nLet's look at the distribution of shootings by age.\n\nFirst, we plot the distribution for the entire dataset. From this we observe that the most victims are between 25 and 40 years old. The distribution has long right tail but the left tail is much thicker comparatively.\n\nSecondly, we subset the distribution for only black victims and we plot the age distribution for this. From this we observe that the distribution is relatively similar. However, we look at the lower end of the distribution (for victims under 20), we can see that young black people are slightly more likely to be shot by the police.","8868da11":"# 2. EDA\n\n## 2.1. Racial Distribution of Police Shootings\n\n\nThere are six different racial classifications in the data: 'W' = White, 'A' = Asian, 'B' = Black, 'H' = Hispanic', 'N' = Native American and 'O' = Others.\n\nFirst, we plot all shootings by race. The histogram represents the total count for each race.\n\nThen, using the 2015 census data regarding actual racial distribution in the US, we determine how many shootings will take place for each race if members of that race were shot according to ther proportion in the population. This number is represented by the scatter line.\n\nFor the first graph, we can see that Black people are much more likely to be shot by the police while White and Asian people are less likely to be shot by the police. The difference is astounding.\n\n\nThen, we specifically look for the distribution of police shootings in cases where the victim was 'unarmed'. We discover a similar pattern here but the differences are even more pronounced. Black people are much more likely to be shot by the police in cases where they are unarmed.","3e762c9c":"## 2.4. Shootings Over Time\n\nLet's look at the trend over time.\n\nGenerally, there is a slight drop in the total number of police shootings over time. However, the racial breakdown is much more interesting. If you look at police shootings of black people, it dropped between 2015 and 2016 but from 2015 to 2019, it steadily increased. We can't say anything yet about 2020 since the year isn't done yet. However, hopefully, given the popular protest movement, I hope we see a decrease. "}}
