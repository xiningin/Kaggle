On Wednesday, Parliament handed he prime minister two stinging defeats.It first blocked his plans to leave the union with or without an agreement.

For example, \n- what\u2019s it about? <br>\n- What do the words mean in context? <br>\n- Who is doing what to whom? <br>\n- What companies and products are mentioned? Which texts are similar to each other? <br>\n\nspaCy is designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and \u201cunderstand\u201d large volumes of text. It can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning.\n\n# What spaCy isn\u2019t\n\n**spaCy is not a platform** or **\u201can API\u201d**. Unlike a platform, spaCy does not provide a software as a service, or a web application. It\u2019s an open-source library designed to help you build NLP applications, not a consumable service.\n\n**spaCy is not an out-of-the-box chat bot engine**. While spaCy can be used to power conversational applications, it\u2019s not designed specifically for chat bots, and only provides the underlying text processing capabilities.\n\n**spaCy is not research software**. It\u2019s built on the latest research, but it\u2019s designed to get things done. This leads to fairly different design decisions than NLTK or CoreNLP, which were created as platforms for teaching and research. The main difference is that spaCy is integrated and opinionated. spaCy tries to avoid asking the user to choose between multiple algorithms that deliver equivalent functionality. Keeping the menu small lets spaCy deliver generally better performance and developer experience.\n\n**spaCy is not a company**. It\u2019s an open-source library. Our company publishing spaCy and other software is called Explosion AI.\n[Reference: Spacy.io](https:\/\/spacy.io\/usage\/spacy-101)","22164203":"# spaCY Library Architecture\nThe central data structures in spaCy are the **Doc** and the Vocab. The **Doc** object owns the sequence of tokens and all their annotations. The Vocab object owns a set of look-up tables that make common information available across documents. By centralizing strings, word vectors and lexical attributes, we avoid storing multiple copies of this data. This saves memory, and ensures there\u2019s a single source of truth.\n\nText annotations are also designed to allow a single source of truth: the **Doc** object owns the data, and Span and Token are views that point into it. The Doc object is constructed by the Tokenizer, and then modified in place by the components of the pipeline. The Language object coordinates these components. It takes raw text and sends it through the pipeline, returning an annotated document. It also orchestrates training and serialization.\n\n![architecture](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/7pPtMcf\/sp.png)","7489bda4":"The following are three most frequent tokens.","d651272c":"Using spaCy\u2019s built-in **displaCy visualizer**, here\u2019s what the above sentence and its dependencies look like:","7fba2287":"Excellent classification Minorities repreents Person Police represents ORGANIZATION (ORG), Natives, literal meaning is group of local residents which is somewhat similar to ORG and atlast one is numerical which is CRADINAL GREAT !!!!!!","c1e1fba4":"Racists is NORD (nationalities or religious or political groups), 150 is a number hence Cardinal and here is the funny part Math is represented as Person ):","5cf18c12":"There are 3 entities in the article and they are represented as 3 unique labels:","c2d69149":"# Token\nBelow I am explaining the token-level entity annotation using the **BILUO** tagging scheme to describe the entity boundaries.\n![](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/sJ3rcpc\/spacy.png)","430c9ebc":"Lets Explore some other sentences for more fun.","505e19be":"# Extracting named entity from an article\n\nNow let\u2019s do some serious stuff  with SpaCy and extracting named entities from toxic comments"}}
