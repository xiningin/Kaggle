An [embedding layer](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html#embedding) that converts our word tokens (integers) into embeddings of a specific size.\n2. An [LSTM layer](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html#lstm) defined by a hidden_state size and number of layers\n3. A fully-connected output layer that maps the LSTM layer outputs to a desired output_size\n4. A sigmoid activation layer which turns all outputs into a value 0-1; return **only the last sigmoid output** as the output of this network.\n\n### The Embedding Layer\n\nWe need to add an [embedding layer](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html#embedding) because there are 74000+ words in our vocabulary. It is massively inefficient to one-hot encode that many classes. So, instead of one-hot encoding, we can have an embedding layer and use that layer as a lookup table. You could train an embedding layer using Word2Vec, then load it here. But, it's fine to just make a new layer, using it for only dimensionality reduction, and let the network learn the weights.\n\n\n### The LSTM Layer(s)\n\nWe'll create an [LSTM](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/nn.html#lstm) to use in our recurrent network, which takes in an input_size, a hidden_dim, a number of layers, a dropout probability (for dropout between multiple layers), and a batch_first parameter.\n\nMost of the time, you're network will have better performance with more layers; between 2-3. Adding more layers allows the network to learn really complex relationships. \n\n> **Exercise:** Complete the `__init__`, `forward`, and `init_hidden` functions for the SentimentRNN model class.\n\nNote: `init_hidden` should initialize the hidden and cell state of an lstm layer to all zeros, and move those state to GPU, if available.","61a99bb7":"---\n## Padding sequences\n\nTo deal with both short and very long reviews, we'll pad or truncate all our reviews to a specific length. For reviews shorter than some `seq_length`, we'll pad with 0s. For reviews longer than `seq_length`, we can truncate them to the first `seq_length` words. A good `seq_length`, in this case, is 200.\n\n> **Exercise:** Define a function that returns an array `features` that contains the padded data, of a standard size, that we'll pass to the network. \n* The data should come from `review_ints`, since we want to feed integers to the network. \n* Each row should be `seq_length` elements long. \n* For reviews shorter than `seq_length` words, **left pad** with 0s. That is, if the review is `['best', 'movie', 'ever']`, `[117, 18, 128]` as integers, the row will look like `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 117, 18, 128]`. \n* For reviews longer than `seq_length`, use only the first `seq_length` words as the feature vector.\n\nAs a small example, if the `seq_length=10` and an input review is: \n```\n[117, 18, 128]\n```\nThe resultant, padded sequence should be: \n\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 117, 18, 128]\n```\n\n**Your final `features` array should be a 2D array, with as many rows as there are reviews, and as many columns as the specified `seq_length`.**\n\nThis isn't trivial and there are a bunch of ways to do this. But, if you're going to be building your own deep learning networks, you're going to have to get used to preparing your data.","30ee2295":"---\n## DataLoaders and Batching\n\nAfter creating training, test, and validation data, we can create DataLoaders for this data by following two steps:\n1. Create a known format for accessing our data, using [TensorDataset](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html#) which takes in an input set of data and a target set of data with the same first dimension, and creates a dataset.\n2. Create DataLoaders and batch our training, validation, and test Tensor datasets.\n\n```\ntrain_data = TensorDataset(torch.from_numpy(train_x), torch.from_numpy(train_y))\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=batch_size)\n```\n\nThis is an alternative to creating a generator function for batching our data into full batches.","fe3adcd0":"## Training, Validation, Test\n\nWith our data in nice shape, we'll split it into training, validation, and test sets.\n\n> **Exercise:** Create the training, validation, and test sets. \n* You'll need to create sets for the features and the labels, `train_x` and `train_y`, for example. \n* Define a split fraction, `split_frac` as the fraction of data to **keep** in the training set. Usually this is set to 0.8 or 0.9. \n* Whatever data is left will be split in half to create the validation and *testing* data.","d8f5607e":"### Inference on a test review\n\nYou can change this test_review to any text that you want. Read it and think: is it pos or neg? Then see if your model predicts correctly!\n    \n> **Exercise:** Write a `predict` function that takes in a trained net, a plain text_review, and a sequence length, and prints out a custom statement for a positive or negative review!\n* You can use any functions that you've already defined or define any helper functions you want to complete `predict`, but it should just take in a trained net, a text review, and a sequence length.\n","4c9a2c42":"# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n\nIn this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. \n>Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. \n\nHere we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by sentiment labels: positive or negative.\n\n<img src=\"assets\/reviews_ex.png\" width=40%>\n\n### Network Architecture\n\nThe architecture for this network is shown below.\n\n<img src=\"assets\/network_diagram.png\" width=40%>\n\n>**First, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer.** We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the Word2Vec lesson. You can actually train an embedding with the Skip-gram Word2Vec model and use those embeddings as input, here. However, it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn a different embedding table on its own. *In this case, the embedding layer is for dimensionality reduction, rather than for learning semantic representations.*\n\n>**After input words are passed to an embedding layer, the new embeddings will be passed to LSTM cells.** The LSTM cells will add *recurrent* connections to the network and give us the ability to include information about the *sequence* of words in the movie review data. \n\n>**Finally, the LSTM outputs will go to a sigmoid output layer.** We're using a sigmoid function because positive and negative = 1 and 0, respectively, and a sigmoid will output predicted, sentiment values between 0-1. \n\nWe don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the **very last one**; we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the loss by comparing the output at the last time step and the training label (pos or neg).","058c82f2":"## Data pre-processing\n\nThe first step when building a neural network model is getting your data into the proper form to feed into the network. Since we're using embedding layers, we'll need to encode each word with an integer. We'll also want to clean it up a bit.\n\nYou can see an example of the reviews data above. Here are the processing steps, we'll want to take:\n>* We'll want to get rid of periods and extraneous punctuation.\n* Also, you might notice that the reviews are delimited with newline characters `\\n`. To deal with those, I'm going to split the text into each review using `\\n` as the delimiter. \n* Then I can combined all the reviews back together into one big string.\n\nFirst, let's remove all punctuation. Then get all the text without the newlines and split it into individual words.","0e466d17":"---\n## Testing\n\nThere are a few ways to test your network.\n\n* **Test data performance:** First, we'll see how our trained model performs on all of our defined test_data, above. We'll calculate the average loss and accuracy over the test data.\n\n* **Inference on user-generated data:** Second, we'll see if we can input just one example review at a time (without a label), and see what the trained model predicts. Looking at new, user input data like this, and predicting an output label, is called **inference**.","445e5e38":"### Removing Outliers\n\nAs an additional pre-processing step, we want to make sure that our reviews are in good shape for standard processing. That is, our network will expect a standard input text size, and so, we'll want to shape our reviews into a specific length. We'll approach this task in two main steps:\n\n1. Getting rid of extremely long or short reviews; the outliers\n2. Padding\/truncating the remaining data so that we have reviews of the same length.\n\n<img src=\"assets\/outliers_padding_ex.png\" width=40%>\n\nBefore we pad our review text, we should check for reviews of extremely short or long lengths; outliers that may mess with our training."}}
