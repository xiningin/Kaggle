Very noticeably is the shorter timeframe from country to country. This is to be expected in other world regions due to the close proximity and people passing from a country to another.\u00b6\n\n#### Switzerland shows a lot lower cases than for example Germany. The case per inhabitant in Switzerland is almost as high as in Italy and that is although the Italian outbreak happened 10 days earlier than the Swiss and although testing capabilities in Switzerland are limited.\n\n#### Koreans suffered from the virus about 5-10 days earlier than the European countries. The outbreak, however, seems to be under control now. \n<br>\n<br>","7c8606f5":"### How are the countries currently doing?","7833642d":"## Does this help us?\n### YES, absolutely! We can and should implement the systems & measures that helped Korea.\n#### In the EU many argue that data protection hinders us from following what Korea does. It does not. Anonymized data can be well shown and also analyzed. The Robert Koch Institut in Germany for example looks at mobility data to see if lockdown measures work as expected. Data protection does certainly slow our efforts down due to misunderstandings but it does not block us in any other way. \n###### source: https:\/\/www.welt.de\/vermischtes\/article206812919\/Auswirkungen-der-Corona-Massnahmen-So-drastisch-nimmt-der-Verkehr-ab.html\n#### We have a very rigid lockdown at the moment, is that the right thing to do? Maybe butw e must expect that there is a second wave of infections coming once we release the shutdown rules. It does however protect us from an initial strong hit that medical facilities cannot cope with. And most importantly it gives us time now to prepare for said second wave of infections.\n#### Korea did not stop foreigners from entering the country even thuogh 1 Million Chinese students came in March 2020.

This might be due to a long time of unawareness or to a rise of testing possibilities for the residents. It might also be a combination of both.\n#### Following are Italy and China\n#### Korea has the lowest overall case number and that is although Switzerland has only about 16% of the Korean population!\n#### During this time period Korea has performed about 300'000 tests. Only about 8'000 were positive. Switzerland performed about 50'000 tests, that means that the true number of positive cases is expected to be even higher.\n###### sources: https:\/\/nzzas.nzz.ch\/wissen\/coronavirus-ueber-50000-tests-in-der-schweiz-ld.1547810?reduced=true ; https:\/\/www.cdc.go.kr\/board\/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030\n#### Another important fact to understand is that before a positve test result is recognized about 8-12 days pass.

The country had a church-like cult community that could potentially spread the virus in the entire country. Several days have already passed and the government had to act quickly. Weeks after, we know that their efforts completely stopped the outbreak and the pandemic is as much under control as possible. \n#### There were no travel bans or long-lasting curfews put in place.
