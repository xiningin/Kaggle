This gives the final rise to the Tweedie distribution we saw.","efb8753b":"# WindGustDir can be easily incorporated into the final model because it is not imbalanced and only has ~7% data missing. But, rather than label encoding (which would turn them into numbers and act as a problem for the model), it would be better to one-hot encode them since there aren't many unique values for this variable.","87015e4b":"# We see in the above graph, that the data for locations Nhil, Katherine and Uluru is quite less as compared to other locations. \n# As rainfall is a local phenomenon. If we train a model with this data, the model will not be robust enough to predict rainfall for these locations. \n# One has to take that into account. This again is important while thinking about the model even more than the date issue.","6db7eefb":"# In the case of Pressure3pm variable, we again see a normal distribution with left-skew. With only 10% data, this is a good candidate for the model. Here, we don't see clear bins like in Pressure9am variable. Let's see its countplot to eliminate the possibility of this variable being used a categorical variable.","b197d59b":"# In the dendrogram, we see the columns divided into two sets. One set is of the columns, we saw had the highest number of missing values and other set which is more complete.  \n# The nearer the leaf, the lesser the number of missing values in the column. We see RainTomorrow, RainToday, Rainfall, Date and Location at zero which means they have 0 missing values. The closer the branch to zero, the lesser missing values they have.\n# The most intact set of columns for predictions by observation is (Humidity 9 am, Wind Speed 9am, Temp 9 am, MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, Date, RainTomorrow, RainToday). For any other column, we'll have to fill more data.","0bedffdd":"# Given the discrete values, the variable Cloud3pm takes, it will be good idea to use this a  categorical variable. But, with ~40% data missing, the decision to whether drop this variable is to be considered. \n# Or the missing values can be handled by adding a 'Missing' category in this variable (when the variable is treated as categorical). But, that again, will introduce a major class imbalance.\n# Also, imbalance in there in the variable. This again makes a case to not use it.","c2a8d0dd":"# Let's see some rows of the data.","7a2f9d64":"# Let's see the datatypes and number of non-null values in the data.","fa284d77":"# We see above that a large amount of values are missing in the column Evaporation, Sunshine, Colud9am and Cloud3pm.\n# Let's go deeper and see what is effect of these null values on the whole data and how it would affect our predictions. For this, we plot dendrogram for the data (based on heirarchial clustering).","3fd3c81c":"# Look at **each Location separately** to get an idea of the local distribution. *Double click on a location toggles the plot to show just that one location to showing everything. So, after double-clicking on one location, to see other location, you have to do the double-click two times on the new location.*\n# One would observe that the global distribution right-skewed (which we solved by the Box-Cox transform).\n# But, here we observe that at the local level, there are all kind of beasts (left-skewed, symmetric and right-skewed). We also get a visual proof of central limit theorem because the global statistic follows the normal distribution (though we are not sampling the means) while the local statistic runs helter-skelter.","1dfad880":"# The variable Pressure9am has a left-skewed normal distribution. Also, we can observe that there are clearly 6 groups emerging in the histogram. Thus, we can also do binning and then, treat this variable as a categorical variable. With ~10% data missing, this variable should be a candidate for the final model.","3c678fce":"# We see that we can do binning and use it a categorical variable. We can have three categories (Low, Medium, High) or just two categories (Low, High). And one other to handle missing values (we can set the threshold for the categories such that finally there would be no imbalance).","d30dfd96":"# We see that we can do binning and use it a categorical variable.

It also shows us the missing value problem is quite pronounced in WindGustDir and WindDir9am.","b6c4abe2":"# We again get a Tweedie distribution. This builds a strong case about using a technique that is robust to variables not belonging to the normal distribution. Also, given this variable has only ~1% missing data, this variable is important to include in the model.","2e0313b6":"# This variable conforms to the normal distribution with a right skew. With ~37% missing data, this variable again should be taken with a pinch of salt. Or a model such as decision tree should be used which can handle missing values.\n# One other thing to consider is whether this variable can be used a categorical variable (since that would make it robust to the future values). Let's see its countplot to get a better view. ","4a0d7d01":"# Usually rainfall follows a [Tweedie distribution](https:\/\/rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/joc.2162). But, here we see it is again a right skewed normal curve. We can again apply Box-Cox transform to fix this while feature pre-processing.\n# Let's also take a look at rainfall data conditioned on Location.","190874cf":"# We see there is a positive correlation between RainToday and RainTomorrow. But, it can still be dropped since the correlation is not high enough.","a0ce08d9":"# Now, let's see the distribution for all the data columns we have. We'll go according to the order of columns set by Pandas.","2f98cddb":"# As we saw above that WindGustSpeed takes discrete values. After further analysis, we can see it only takes 67 different values. This also gives us the option of treating this variable as categorical. One may choose to bin these value to reduce the number of categories.","5e4b6f0f":"# We also confirm the behaviour of the variable at the local level. The variable is well-behaved over all the locations.","35b1451e":"# Even at the local level, the distribution are well-behaved. All are left-skewed. This variable will be a good addition for any kind of model.","4113bd7d":"# We see that there are multiple values for each date. The reason is that for each date, the data from multiple locations is there. \n# It also shows us for **some dates we don't have the data from all locations**. This fact is important to consider while creating a model for the data.","d478e61f":"# By observing the values for MinTemp, we see that the distribution for it is right-skewed normal. This means it would be a good idea to standardize it while preprocessing for model. But, what if it was not? Then, you we can use **Box-Cox transform** to convert our data to fit a normal distribution.\n# Also, let's check out the effect of doing Box-Cox transform on MinTemp."}}
