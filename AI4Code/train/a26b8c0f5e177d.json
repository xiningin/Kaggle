The data was collected for an article by The Pudding, and further details of that article and the data can be found by checking out the dataset's page. I hope to explore two topics in particular:\n<ol>\n    <li>The types of chocolate chips used among these recipes and how popular each is.<\/li>\n    <li>Any correlation between the sweetness of a recipe and how highly it is rated.<\/li>\n<\/ol>","9fdc5e0b":"## Second Visualization: How Much Sugar in the Best Recipes?"}}
