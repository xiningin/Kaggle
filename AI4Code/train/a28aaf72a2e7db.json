Let's look:\n1. Choose a data frame subset based on what values you want to see in result -  **nodup_poke[['Type 1','Total']]**\n2. Choose a column you want the table to be grouped by. To group values means put all rows with the same value of selected column into one row. - **groupby(nodup_poke['Type 1'])**\n3. Now that we have many values in the same row, we need to transform them into one value with aggregation function. Typical examples are *count, average, sum, max* - **mean()**\n4.
