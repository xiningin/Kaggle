The objectives of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on a certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients, here, are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n\n## Content\n\nThe datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, `Outcome`. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSmith, J.W., Everhart, J.E., Dickson, W.C., Knowler, W.C., & Johannes, R.S.
