You do not have to understand Python programming to use the code but it should give you an appreciation of why code is a useful tool for working with data.\n\nThe activity uses the data from the Edexcel large data set which features weather data for 1987 and 2015 at 8 locations.\n\nThis activity contains additional guidance about how to use notebooks in Kaggle. When using these notebooks you should be able to:\n\n* Run ready-made Python code in the notebook\n* Make changes to the code and see the effects","2613bc29":"## Analysing the data\n\nIn this section you can decide which fields to analyse so that you can answer the original question. \nThe code below will take data from a CSV file called heathrow-2015. It stores it as a data set called heathrow_2015 data. It then prints out:\n\n* Summary values for Daily Mean Temperature\n* Value counts for Mean Cardinal Direction\n\nBy making changes to this code load other data sets and explore the data in the different fields. You can see the other sheets saved as csv files by expanding the \"Data\" panel in the right-hand column and clicking on the \"ldsedexcel\" folder.","97b8e3da":"## Problem\n> *What were the main differences in weather between 1987 and 2015 at the locations in the dataset?*","3e29c72f":"Many of the values you might expect to see (such as 'mean') are not calculated for Daily Total Rainfall. That is because the field includes data of several different types:\n* floating point numbers such as 3.2\n* integers such as 7 or 0\n* text such as 'tr'\n\nThe computer can't create summary values from a mixture of data types. So you need to clean the data before you can see summary values. The code in the two boxes below cleans the data for Heathrow 2015.\n* The first box Replaces \u201ctr\u201d with 0.025 (The value of \"tr\" represents a trace amount of rain less than 0.05mm therefore we are replacing it with a value in the middle of the range 0-0.05).\n* The second box changes every value to \u201cfloat\u201d data type\n\nRun the code in both boxes to clean the Heathrow 2015 data.\nMake changes to the code and run it again to clean the Heathrow 1987 data.","50b172bf":"### *Displaying the field names, data types and size of a data set*\nIn the previous tasks you looked at a table of data.

Each field holds a different data value.\n* Each row of the table represents one record.

Summary values such as mean cannot be calculated for non-numeric fields. However we can still produce useful summary values for these fields. \n\nAn example is wind direction. This is stored in the field called 'Mean Cardinal Direction'. The value is given as a compass direction such as 'S' (South) or 'SSW' (South-South-West). One way to summarise this data for a whole year is to count the number of times each value was recorded. \n\nThe code below outputs the summary data and value counts for Heathrow 2015.

In other cases the values might be obviously incorrect. For example in a list of temperatures you might see a single value higher than 1000.
