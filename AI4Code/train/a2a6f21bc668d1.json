If not attacked, the player would end with 4000 Halite at the end of the game. He won many games, despite other players seemingly controlling the entire board.\n\nSince then, the effectiveness of such a bot has dropped. The idle bot should still easily rack up 800 points today.\n\nI think this is an important idea: unless you end the game with lots of Halite, expansion is pointless.\n\nMake sure your bots are capable of beating this idle bot."}}
