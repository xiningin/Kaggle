We may examine the case that has that high residual and see if there are problems with it (the easiest would be if it is a data entry error).\n\n2.\tAssuming there is no good reason to remove that observation, one can run the regression with and without it and see if there are any large differences in the parameter estimates; if not, you can leave it and note that removing it made little difference.\n\n3.\tIf it makes a big difference, the choice of the OLS model itself may be entirely wrong for this data set. It may be needed to look at alternate models. One could try robust regression, which deals with outliers or quantile regression or any other regression model that make no assumptions about the distribution of the residuals.\n\n4.\tSome key explanatory variables might have been left out which is causing some signal to leak into the residuals in the form of autocorrelations. If one can use one residual to predict the next residual, there is some predictive information present that is not captured by the predictors. Typically, this situation involves time-ordered observations. For example, if a residual is more likely to be followed by another residual that has the same sign, adjacent residuals are positively correlated. One can include a variable that captures the relevant time-related information or use a time series analysis.\n\n5.\tMaybe one can transform the response variable to make the distribution of the random errors approximately normal, fit the model, transform the predicted values back into the original units using the inverse of the transformation applied to the response variable.\n","e4565a39":"**Again, the average fare over the week is more or less the same.
