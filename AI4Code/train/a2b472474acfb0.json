For more info use `help()` function","1eff5cb6":"# Poisson distribution\n\n> A Poisson distribution is a distribution that models the number of events that occur over\na given interval (usually of time, but can also be an interval of distance, area, or volume).\n\nThe PMF for a Poisson distribution is given by the following equation:\n\n![poisson](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jjFgGr2V\/image.png)\n\nWhere:\n- `P(x=r)` is the probability of the event occurring r number of times, r is the\n  number of occurrences of the event, and \u03bb^r\n  represents the average\/expected number of\n  occurrences of that event.\n\nShape of Poisson distribution:\n![poissonpng](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/J0FK2fQ6\/image.png)\n\nThe Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the number of occurrences that occur\nover a given period, for instance:\n- number of arrivals at a market per hour\n- number of study-related accidents occurring at a school over a year\n- number of customer complaints at a call center in a week\n\nProperties of a Poisson distribution:\n1. `Mean=variance=\u03bb`. In a Poisson distribution, the mean and\n   variance have the same numeric values.\n2. The events are independent, random, and cannot occur at the\n   same time.\n3. When `n` is >20 and `p` is <0.1, a Poisson distribution can\n   approximate the binomial distribution. Here, we substitute `\u03bb = np`.\n4. When the value of `n` is large, `p` is around 0.5, and np > 0.5, a\n   normal distribution can be used to approximate a binomial\n   distribution.\n   \nSolved example for the Poisson distribution:\n\nIn a train station, the average number of ticket-vending machines out of operation\nis three. Assuming that the number of machines out of operation follows a Poisson\ndistribution, calculate the probability that a given point in time:\n1. Exactly two machines are out of operation\n2. More than two machines are out of operation\n\nSolution:\n1. We can either use poisson formula\n   or solve it in Python as follows:"}}
