And, IGN agrees with you that it is a great game -- their rating for this game is a whopping 8.9!  Inspired by the success of this game, you're considering creating your very own racing game for the Wii platform.\n\n#### Part A\n\nCreate a bar chart that shows the average score for **racing** games, for each platform.  Your chart should have one bar for each platform. ","cc1f9b01":"**This notebook is an exercise in the [Data Visualization](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/data-visualization) course.  You can reference the tutorial at [this link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/bar-charts-and-heatmaps).**\n\n---\n","7970526e":"## Step 1: Load the data\n\nRead the IGN data file into `ign_data`.  Use the `\"Platform\"` column to label the rows.","b7bb02a4":"The questions below will give you feedback on your work. Run the following cell to set up our feedback system.","e21d317d":"The dataset that you've just printed shows the average score, by platform and genre.  Use the data to answer the questions below.","4ddc2da8":"In this exercise, you will use your new knowledge to propose a solution to a real-world scenario.  To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **bar charts** and **heatmaps** to understand patterns in the data.\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou've recently decided to create your very own video game!  As an avid reader of [IGN Game Reviews](https:\/\/www.ign.com\/reviews\/games), you hear about all of the most recent game releases, along with the ranking they've received from experts, ranging from 0 (_Disaster_) to 10 (_Masterpiece_).\n\n![ex2_ign](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Oh06Fu1.png)\n\nYou're interested in using [IGN reviews](https:\/\/www.ign.com\/reviews\/games) to guide the design of your upcoming game.  Thankfully, someone has summarized the rankings in a really useful CSV file that you can use to guide your analysis.\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.","66fc8736":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

Which combination receives the lowest average rankings?","5c213a9e":"#### Part B\n\nBased on the bar chart, do you expect a racing game for the **Wii** platform to receive a high rating?  If not, what gaming platform seems to be the best alternative?","f53bb8db":"## Step 2: Review the data\n\nUse a Python command to print the entire dataset.","19b0e7df":"# Keep going\n\nMove on to learn all about **[scatter plots](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/scatter-plots)**!","c9eaecf0":"## Step 4: All possible combinations!\n\nEventually, you decide against creating a racing game for Wii, but you're still committed to creating your own video game!  Since your gaming interests are pretty broad (_... you generally love most video games_), you decide to use the IGN data to inform your new choice of genre and platform.\n\n#### Part A\n\nUse the data to create a heatmap of average score by genre and platform.
