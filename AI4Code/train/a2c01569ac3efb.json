The events become a dynamic session for Apple to convey its ideas, innovations, and strategies towards its products & services. Earlier the events were anchored by co-founder, chairman and CEO Steve Jobs, and post his death; Tim Cook took the reins in his hands.\"\n\n\"There are several arguments in favor and against both CEOs, who have done the excellent job; in fact, Tim Cook is holding the position with much appreciation from the employees of Apple.\"\n\nProduct Innovation, Marketing Strategy and Customer Satisfaction: This is Apple. \n\n\"With Cook, Apple began to upgrade the existing product line instead of releasing revolutionary products.\"\n\n\"Tim Cook looks calm and composed, and this posture has shifted the company to gentler.\"\n\n\"Cook became the change agent in marketing & cost-cutting strategies. With his experience at IBM, where he expedited supply chain management, Cook introduced some drastic changes in integrated marketing, product design, and manufacturing in Apple. His idea was to offer \u201csimple solutions to complex problems\u201d and to make it possible, he launched grand marketing campaigns, colossal engineering feats, and cost-saving methods.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.igeeksblog.com\/steve-jobs-vs-tim-cook\/"}}
