Correlation is a statistical technique that can show whether and how strongly pairs of features(columns) are related to each other. The relationship isn't perfect. Houses of the same area (square metre) vary in price, and you can easily think of two houses you know where the narrower one is more expensive than the larger one.  Because it does not consist of only two features. Correlation can tell you just how much of the variation in houses'' price is related to their quantitative of living area.\n\nAlthough this correlation is fairly obvious your data may contain unsuspected correlations. You may also suspect there are correlations, but don't know which are the strongest. An intelligent correlation analysis can lead to a greater understanding of your data.\n\n~(-1) represents: Negative correlation\/\tDirect proportion \n\n0 represents: No relations\n\n~(+1) represents: Positive correlation\/\tInverse proportion ","5095ab44":"Describe method gives us numerical and statistical  informations about our data frame like mean,median, standart deviation.","7f4917b4":"I am creating new data frames from our default data set and I am giving new frame names for each country.","ac8187ce":"I made a fresh start to Data Science and this is my first ever kernel on Kaggle.
