Here is a classic example, known as *'Anscombe's quartet'*, as to just why the use of graphical techniques to inspect the data before proceeding with any further action, such as [feature selection](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feature_selection) etc. is so crucial.\nThis notebook reproduces the four [scatter plots](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scatter_plot) as well as the regression analysis of the data provided in the famous paper by the statistician [Frank J. Anscombe](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frank_Anscombe) titled [\"Graphs in Statistical Analysis\"](https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00031305.1973.10478966) which was published in 1973.\n\nFirst we shall perform an [ordinary least squares regression](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Simple_linear_regression) on the aforementioned [four sets of data points](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/carlmcbrideellis\/data-anscombes-quartet). The model that we use is that of a straight line; $ y = mx + c $, where $m$ represents the slope and $c$ is the intercept on the $y$-axis.","27f07700":"Thus, despite the four scatter plots being completely different in nature,  from the standpoint of numerical analysis alone and with no visualisation one would could be led to think one was looking at pretty much same data each and every time. \n\nThe moral of the story is ***look before you leap!***\n\n### Further reading\n\n* John W.
