The number of claps for many articles is around 0, so you need not worry much, if you are not getting the required claps.\n\n### 2.

The average reading time of the articles is around 5-6 mins, make sure to keep your articles short and crisp, usually people like to jump to the part where they find the most valuable information.","69d605cd":"## Article with the Highest Claps with the values","3938edc8":"### Medium is a place to read articles on the Internet.
