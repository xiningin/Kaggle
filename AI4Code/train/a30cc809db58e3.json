So, energy production from nuclear sources can be low for China then Russia. However, China's electricity production from renewable sources is higher then Russia and very fast chasing production of USA. Also, the line chart of <b>\"Access to Electricity (% of population)\"<\/b> shows that China achieved 100% electricity in country by the end of 2012. So, In that sense also China competes both countries.<\/p>","3eef0a2d":"We have data for inidcators and countries over several years. Which means continuous data.

From this data we can infere that this can be the reason behind low infant mortality rate in USA then China and Russia. However, more important thing to notice over here is, in 2015 all three countries have almost same infant mortality rate. Which suggest that there are other factors too effecting infant mortality for example, Birth attended by skilled health staff.<\/p>","fa9eeaae":"## 4) Energy","572bff73":"#### Overall Analysis (Part 1):\n\n<p>Here you will notice that CO2 Emissions per capita in Russia and USA has higher then China.
