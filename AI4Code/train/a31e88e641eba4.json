Here's your coding interview problem for today.\n\nThis problem was asked by Pinterest.\n\nGiven an integer list where each number represents the number of hops you can make, determine whether you can reach to the last index starting at index 0.\n\nFor example, [2, 0, 1, 0] returns True while [1, 1, 0, 1] returns False."}}
