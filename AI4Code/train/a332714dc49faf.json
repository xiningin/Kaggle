I will count 1 medal for a hockey team instead of medal of every player of the team.\n\n### There are two ways to solve this medal problem of team. The easy way is to divide the total number of medal won in hockey by team size (i.e. 14). However, I will be solving it by other way so that where this dividing rule doesn't apply, people can use this method.\n\nLet's draw this graph according to year.","d4ecbade":"It seems like Indians loved Gold.","fe474a16":"# 1.
