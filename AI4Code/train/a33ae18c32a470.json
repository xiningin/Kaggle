Every week, we publish a new issue containing curated articles, videos, job listings and community events.\n\nHere's [an example of one of our newsletter issues](https:\/\/sendy.elixir-radar.com\/w\/BNoHZTqLnAByWgOl6x892ZRw\/J8921cxQ4jeEDmbVKDWh02aw\/mAWw9YlMu2az2nE2BcrTXw).\n\nMy motivations with this Kaggle Notebook are:\n* share some insights based on our data that I find interesting\n* see what our community can do with that data\n\nHope you like it.\n\nI'm looking forward to receive new data analysis from our you based on our data.","4234a66c":"# Next steps\n\nI have more ideas about interesting analysis we can do with that data. Such as:\n\n* top authors by number of curated content\n* top domains by unique clicks\n* is there any relationship between the article title and the number of clicks it gets? (**this is the one I'm more curious about**)\n\nFeel free to copy that notebook or use that data and do your analysis. I'd also be happy if you can send me what you did: https:\/\/twitter.com\/elixir_radar","b60258ed":"It's interesting to notice that some authors that were popular in the past are not that popular anymore.\n\nIt's also interesting (and kinda expected) to notice how Jos\u00e9 Valim appears a lot! That may indicate that besides being a prolific \"code writer\", he's also a prolific \"content writer\". That's great, becase we need as much content as we need code to keep educating, nurturing and growing our community.","87e092b3":"# Top authors\n\nThe first question I was curious about was:\n\n> What are the authors that are more popular with our newsletter subscribers?\n\nTo answer that question, I analyzed the number of unique clicks received by the author's curated content.","9548054e":"## Top authors per year\n\nI was also curious about top authors per year. So, here's what we have for every year, since 2015.","324cbf96":"## Top authors - all time\n\nFirst, I wanted to have an idea of top authors considering all the data we have.\n\nThe first Elixir Radar issue was published on February 2015. We've been collecting and documenting our data since May 2015.\n\nLet's see who got more attention from our readers, considering all data we have since 2015."}}
