The ROC_AUC score is 0.5 indicating that the Random Forest is as good as randomly guessing whether a row belongs to train or test.\n\nThe results might look different if we joined all tables together and do the same analysis. But doing this quick-and-dirty exercise goes a long way of sense checking whether or not train and test data are similar. We wouldn't want to train the model on youn professionals and then test our predictions on pensioners. We would most likely get a pretty bad prediction.\n\n**I hope you found this useful and I would like to hear from whether you use a similar approach or whether there are bits that I can improve.**","6e690471":"## Feature Enginerring","38111305":"## Run the Model","5dfe386b":"I will run a simple RandomForestClassifier using cross-validation.","8412ffd1":"What does the ratio of train to test set look like?

In particular they should have the same characteristics. In this competition this could mean that the same kinds of customers and merchants appear in both train and set set. If that is not the case then we'd do a poor job at predicting outside the training set. We would be training the model on a fundamentally different kind of data than the one against which we will be testing it. We wouldn't want to train the model on young professionals and then test our predictions on pensioners. \n\nWhat I want to do in this kernel is to test this assumption by using a simple RandomForestClassifier to check whether there is something particular about the train and test set.
