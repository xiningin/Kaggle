Hence, the results are statistically significant.\n\n(2) The value R2 is **0.56**.

This implies that students might be physically attending classes without any mindful academic engagement.   Also, the absolute value of t-statistic for slope is below one which is tiny to indicate a linear relationship. Further, the p-value for slope is > 0.05, showing no statistically significant relationship between attendance and ESE marks. \n\nHence, in the context of this dataset, attendance is a bad predictor for end semester performance.

It checks the existence of linearity between input variables(MSE, Attendance) and output variables (ESE)."}}
