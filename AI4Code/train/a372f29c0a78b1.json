The more an attribute is used to make key decisions with decision trees, the higher its relative importance.","3a396dad":"## 1.

Recursive Feature Elimination with CV\n\nThe Recursive Feature Elimination (or RFE) works by recursively removing attributes and building a model on those attributes that remain. The model uses CV for finding the  optimal number of features and the important features.\n\nIt uses the model accuracy to identify which attributes (and combination of attributes) contribute the most to predicting the target attribute."}}
