These 2 grades are added to yield the Gleason score (also called the Gleason sum).\n\nThe first number assigned is the grade that is most common in the tumor. For example, if the Gleason score is written as 3+4=7, it means most of the tumor is grade 3 and less is grade 4, and they are added for a Gleason score of 7.\n\nAlthough most often the Gleason score is based on the 2 areas that make up most of the cancer, there are some exceptions when a biopsy sample has either a lot of high-grade cancer or there are 3 grades including high-grade cancer. In these cases, the way the Gleason score is determined is modified to reflect the aggressive (fast-growing) nature of the cancer.\nIn theory, the Gleason score can be between 2 and 10, but scores below 6 are rarely used.\n\nBased on the Gleason score, prostate cancers are often divided into 3 groups:\n\n* Cancers with a Gleason score of 6 or less may be called well-differentiated or low-grade.\n* Cancers with a Gleason score of 7 may be called moderately-differentiated or intermediate-grade.\n* Cancers with Gleason scores of 8 to 10 may be called poorly-differentiated or high-grade.\n\nGrade Groups\n\nIn recent years, doctors have come to realize that the Gleason score might not always be the best way to describe the grade of the cancer, for a couple of reasons:\n\nProstate cancer outcomes can be divided into more than just the 3 groups mentioned above. For example, men with a Gleason score 3+4=7 cancer tend to do better than those with a 4+3=7 cancer. And men with a Gleason score 8 cancer tend to do better than those with a Gleason score of 9 or 10.\nThe scale of the Gleason score can be misleading for patients. For example, a man with a Gleason score 6 cancer might assume that his cancer is in the middle of the range of grades (which in theory go from 2 to 10), even though grade 6 cancers are actually the lowest grade seen in practice. This assumption might lead a man to think his cancer is more likely to grow and spread quickly than it really is, which might affect his decisions about treatment.\nBecause of this, doctors have developed Grade Groups, ranging from 1 (most likely to grow and spread slowly) to 5 (most likely to grow and spread quickly):\n\n* Grade Group 1 = Gleason 6 (or less)\n* Grade Group 2 = Gleason 3+4=7\n* Grade Group 3 = Gleason 4+3=7\n* Grade Group 4 = Gleason 8\n* Grade Group 5 = Gleason 9-10\n","51b7f836":"* ISUP Grade 0 and 1 are more provided by Karolinska\n* ISUP Grade 3,4,5 are more provided by Radbound\n* Isup 2 in training set has come almost equal from the both data provider","8fc0c1f8":"#### Let's check the ISUP Grdes of different Gleason Scores  ","fccc9f3f":"So, till now we are we gained the knowledge about this disease. Now let's explore the Diagnosis of this disease and come to our problem statetemt of how we can use Gleason Score.\n\n\n### Q(6) How is it Diagnosed ?\nScreening : \"Screening\" means testing for a disease even if you have no symptoms. The two main types of screenings are:\n\n* PSA Blood Test : The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test is one way to screen for prostate cancer. This blood test measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a protein made only by the prostate and prostate cancers. Very little PSA is found in the blood of a man with a healthy prostate. A low PSA is a sign of prostate health. A rapid rise in PSA may be a sign that something is wrong. Prostate cancer is the most serious cause of a high PSA result. Another reason for a high PSA can be benign (non-cancer) enlargement of the prostate. Prostatitis, inflammation of the prostate, can also cause high PSA results. A rise in PSA level does not tell us the type of cancer cells present. The rise tells us that cancer may be present.\n\n* DRE :The digital rectal examination (DRE)   helps your doctor find prostate problems. For this exam, the healthcare provider puts a lubricated gloved finger into the rectum. The man either bends over or lies curled on his side on a table. During this test, the doctor feels for an abnormal shape or thickness to the prostate. DRE is safe and easy to do. But the DRE by itself cannot detect early cancer. It should be done with a PSA test.\n\n### Q(7) What are the benefits and risks of screening?\n\nThe PSA test and DRE are very important tools. They help to find prostate cancer early, before it spreads. When found early, it can be treated early which helps stop or slow the spread of cancer. This is likely to help some men live longer.\n\nA risk of a PSA test is that it may miss detecting cancer (a \"false negative\"). Or, the test may be a \"false positive,\" suggesting something is wrong when you are actually healthy. A false positive result may lead to a biopsy that isn't needed. The test might also detect very slow growing cancer that will never cause problems if left untreated.\n\n\n","f107f7a0":"##### Few Insights:\n\n* The image dimensions are quite large (typically between 5.000 and 40.000 pixels in both x and y).\n* Each slide has 3 levels you can load, corresponding to a downsampling of 1, 4 and 16. Intermediate levels can be created by downsampling a higher resolution level.\n* The dimensions of each level differ based on the dimensions of the original image.\n* Biopsies can be in different rotations. This rotation has no clinical value, and is only dependent on how the biopsy was collected in the lab.\n* There are noticable color differences between the biopsies, this is very common within pathology and is caused by different laboratory procedures.","c99f3704":"# Now, let's deep dive into the Data","f525216e":"# Domain Knowledge\nlet's start with some basic questions that should come to everyones mind before getting your hands on dataset given for this Competition. \n\n### Q(1) What is Prostate?\nThe prostate is a part of the male reproductive system. The prostate is about the size of a walnut and weighs about one ounce.\n### Q(2) Where is it located?\nThe prostate is below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate surrounds the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder out through the penis.\n### Q(3) What is the job of Prostate?\nThe main job of the prostate and seminal vesicles is to make fluid to bathe semen. During ejaculation, sperm is made in the testicles, and then moves to the urethra. At the same time, fluid from the prostate and the seminal vesicles also moves into the urethra. This mixture of semen and fluid from the prostate and seminal vesicles forms the ejaculate that passes through the urethra and out of the penis.\n### Q(4) What is Prostate Cancer?\nProstate cancer is a form of cancer that develops in the prostate gland. It is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths for men in the U.S. About 1 in 9 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. When prostate cancer occurs, it starts in the prostate gland and occasionally spreads to the seminal vesicles.\n\nProstate cancer cells can spread by breaking away from a prostate tumor. They can travel through blood vessels or lymph nodes to reach other parts of the body. After spreading, cancer cells may attach to other tissues and grow to form new tumors, causing damage where they land.\n\nWhen prostate cancer spreads from its original place to another part of the body, the new tumor has the same kind of abnormal cells and the same name as the primary (original) tumor. For example, if prostate cancer spreads to the bones, the cancer cells in the bones are actually prostate cancer cells. The disease is metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer. For that reason, it's treated as prostate cancer in bone.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/cancer\/prostate-cancer\/about\/what-is-prostate-cancer\/_jcr_content\/par\/textimage\/image.img.jpg\/1568058472882.jpg\" height=\"100px\">\n\n### Q(5) Causes?\nNo one knows why or how prostate cancer starts. Autopsy studies show 1 in 3 men over the age of 50 have some cancer cells in the prostate. Eight out of ten \"autopsy cancers\" found are small, with tumors that are not harmful.\n\nEven though there is no known reason for prostate cancer, there are many risks associated with the disease like Age,Ethnicity, Family History, Smoking, Diet etc.\n\n","465a9636":"### Let's see the test Data","92d94cf7":"### Overlaying masks on the slides\n\nAs the masks have the same dimension as the slides, we can overlay the masks on the tissue to directly see which areas are cancerous. This overlay can help you identifying the different growth patterns. To do this, we load both the mask and the biopsy and merge them using PIL.\n\nTip: Want to view the slides in a more interactive way? Using a WSI viewer you can interactively view the slides. Examples of open source viewers that can open the PANDA dataset are ASAP and QuPath. ASAP can also overlay the masks on top of the images using the \"Overlay\" functionality. If you use Qupath, and the images do not load, try changing the file extension to .vtif.","4ef7c1a6":"#### Now, let's check the number of images, types of data provider, ISUP Grades and Gleason Scores.","81469f9a":"## Now, let's check the Image ","0e3f3017":"Two things we see:\n\n* Here, we see that \"negative\" and \"0+0\" Gleason Scores have some ISUP Grade which is '0'.

Since we know that the correct ISUP Grade for Gleason Score is '3', we need to find the one which is labeled as Gleason Score as '2' and remove that.","0ee78280":"Upon seeing any abnormality in the PSA and DRE test results, doctor recommends Prostate biopsy.\n\n### Q(8) So, what is Prostat biopsy and how it is done?\n\nThe decision to have a biopsy is based on PSA and DRE results. Your doctor will also consider your family history of prostate cancer, ethnicity, biopsy history and other health factors.\n\nA biopsy is a type of minor surgery. For a prostate biopsy , tiny pieces of tissue are removed from the prostate and looked at under a microscope. The pathologist is the doctor who will look carefully at the tissue samples to look for cancer cells. **This is the only way to know for sure if you have prostate cancer.**\n\nIt looks scary!!! don't be scared watch this video:\n\n\n\n","b8066601":"#### Displaying an image with it's Zoomed version","968b4301":"### Exploring images with pen markers\n\nIt is mentioned that in training dataset, there are few images with pen markers on them.

These masks directly indicate which parts of the tissue are healthy and which are cancerous. The information in the masks differ from the two centers:\n\n* Radboudumc: Prostate glands are individually labelled. Valid values are: 0: background (non tissue) or unknown\n1: stroma (connective tissue, non-epithelium tissue)\n2: healthy (benign) epithelium\n3: cancerous epithelium (Gleason 3)\n4: cancerous epithelium (Gleason 4)\n5: cancerous epithelium (Gleason 5)\n* Karolinska: Regions are labelled. Valid values:\n0: background (non tissue) or unknown\n1: benign tissue (stroma and epithelium combined)\n2: cancerous tissue (stroma and epithelium combined)\nThe label masks of Radboudumc were semi-automatically generated by several deep learning algorithms, contain noise, and can be considered as weakly-supervised labels. The label masks of Karolinska were semi-autotomatically generated based on annotations by a pathologist.\n\nThe label masks are stored in an RGB format so that they can be easily opened by image readers. The label information is stored in the red (R) channel, the other channels are set to zero and can be ignored. As with the slides itself, the label masks can be opened using OpenSlide.","8a9a34b3":"#### Let's see the training data","4b32183f":"### Now, it's time for presenting our Data in a beautiful way which is often called EDA","9b424206":"Finally, I would like to thank the authors of following kernels.

Prior to scanning, the tissue is stained with haematoxylin & eosin (H&E). This is a standard way of staining the originally transparent tissue to produce some contrast. The samples are made up of glandular tissue and connective tissue. The glands are hollow structures, which can be seen as white \u201choles\u201d or branched cavities in the WSI. The appearance of the glands forms the basis of the Gleason grading system. The glandular structure characteristic of healthy prostate tissue is progressively lost with increasing grade. The grading system recognizes three categories: 3, 4, and 5. \n\n* [A]Benign prostate glands with folded epithelium :The cytoplasm is pale and the nuclei small and regular. The glands are grouped together.\n* [B]Prostatic adenocarcinoma : Gleason Pattern 3 has no loss of glandular differentiation. Small glands infiltrate between benign glands. The cytoplasm is often dark and the nuclei enlarged with dark chromatin and some prominent nucleoli. Each epithelial unit is separate and has a lumen.\n* [C]Prostatic adenocarcinoma : Gleason Pattern 4 has partial loss of glandular differentiation. There is an attempt to form lumina but the tumor fails to form complete, well-developed glands. This microphotograph shows irregular cribriform cancer, i.e. epithelial sheets with multiple lumina. There are also some poorly formed small glands and some fused glands. All of these are included in Gleason Pattern 4.\n* [D]Prostatic adenocarcinoma : Gleason Pattern 5 has an almost complete loss of glandular differentiation. Dispersed single cancer cells are seen in the stroma. Gleason Pattern 5 may also contain solid sheets or strands of cancer cells. All microphotographs show hematoxylin and eosin stains at 20x lens magnification.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-media\/competitions\/PANDA\/GleasonPattern_4squares%20copy500.png\" height=\"100px\">","36f4e706":"#### Dropping the image having incorrect ISUP Score from the train set","ba94370c":"Karolinska has provided more images than Radbond.","3c2e5145":"### Displaying Images and it's Mask Side by Side ","30d00ab1":"#### Converting negative Gleason Score to \"0+0\"","0d7f0555":"Note: In the example above you can also observe a few pen markings on the slide (dark green smudges).
