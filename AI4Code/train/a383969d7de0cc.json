The size and characteristics of the water footprint vary across animal types and production systems. This study provides a comprehensive account of the global GREEN, BLUE and GREY WATER FOOTPRINTS of different sorts of farm animals and animal products, distinguishing between different production systems and considering the conditions in all countries of the world separately.\"\n\n\"The following animal categories were considered: beef cattle, dairy cattle, pig, sheep, goat, broiler chicken, layer chicken and horses. The study shows that the water footprint of meat from beef cattle (15400 m3\/ton as a global average) is much larger than the footprints of meat from sheep (10400 m3\/ton), pig (6000 m3\/ton), goat (5500 m3\/ton) or chicken (4300 m3\/ton). The global average water footprint of chicken egg is 3300 m3\/ton, while the water footprint of cow milk amounts to 1000 m3\/ton.\"\n\n\"Per ton of product, animal products generally have a larger water footprint than crop products. The same is true when we look at the water footprint per calorie. The average water footprint per calorie for beef is twenty times larger than for cereals and starchy roots. When we look at the water requirements for protein, we find that the water footprint per gram of protein for milk, eggs and chicken meat is about 1.5 times larger than for pulses. For beef, the water footprint per gram of protein is 6 times larger than for pulses. In the case of fat, they find that butter has a relatively small water footprint per gram of fat, even lower than for oil crops. All other animal products, however, have larger water footprints per gram of fat when compared to oil crops.\"\n\n\"The study shows that from a freshwater resource perspective, it is more efficient to obtain calories, protein and fat through crop products than animal products.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/254859487_The_green_blue_and_grey_water_footprint_of_farm_animals_and_animal_products","607899dd":"#The Standard international trade classification, abbreviated as SITC","a64b6277":"<center style=\"font-family:verdana;\"><h1 style=\"font-size:200%; padding: 20px; background: #001f3f;\"><i><b style=\"color:orange;\">Wasted Food. Wasted Resources. How big is Our Water Footprint?<\/b><\/i><\/h1><\/center>\n\n\n\"Because it takes so much water to produce food, food waste has some pretty big implications. According to the NRDC (The Natural Resources Defense Council), \u201cforty percent of the food in the United States is never eaten.\"\n\n\"Wasted food means wasted resources, including water. This is why work is being done at every level \u2013 from local to federal \u2013 to reduce food waste. Activities like taking a refrigerator inventory before you shop, meal planning, using leftovers and composting can make a huge dent in the amount of food (and water) that is wasted on a daily basis.\"\n\n\"How Big Should My Food Water Footprint Be? Nobody will have a water footprint of zero from food because everybody has to eat. Still, choices about how and what to eat can help reduce daily water impacts from your diet.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.watercalculator.org\/footprint\/foods-big-water-footprint\/"}}
