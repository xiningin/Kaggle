It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.\n\nAlso, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who she\/he is.\n\nTherefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers. It is basically of two types:-\n\n**User based filtering**- These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity\n\n**Item Based Collaborative Filtering** - Instead of measuring the similarity between users, the item-based CF recommends items based on their similarity with the items that the target user rated. Likewise, the similarity can be computed with Pearson Correlation or Cosine Similarity. The major difference is that, with item-based collaborative filtering, we fill in the blank vertically, as oppose to the horizontal manner that user-based CF does\n\nPlease once check out the following link to get better idea of gist i explained:-\n\n[basics on User based and Item based filtering](https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/introduction-to-recommender-system-part-1-collaborative-filtering-singular-value-decomposition-44c9659c5e75)\n\nPlease look at the tables explained in link for better understanding.\n\nAfter checking out the link:-we can proceed further now....\n\nItem based CF successfully avoids the problem posed by dynamic user preference as item-based CF is more static. However, several problems remain for this method. First, the main issue is scalability. The computation grows with both the customer and the product. The worst case complexity is **O**(mn) with m users and n items. In addition, sparsity is another concern.In extreme cases, we can have millions of users and the similarity between two fairly different movies could be very high simply because they have similar rank for the only user who ranked them both.\n\n**SINGLE VALUED DECOMPOSITION**\n\nOne way to handle the scalability and sparsity issue created by CF is to leverage a **latent factor model** to capture the similarity between users and items. Essentially, we want to turn the recommendation problem into an optimization problem. We can view it as how good we are in predicting the rating for items given a user. One common metric is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The lower the RMSE, the better the performance.\n\nNow talking about latent factor you might be wondering what is it ?It is a broad idea which describes a property or concept that a user or an item have. For instance, for music, latent factor can refer to the genre that the music belongs to. SVD decreases the dimension of the utility matrix by extracting its latent factors. Essentially, we map each user and each item into a latent space with dimension r. Therefore, it helps us better understand the relationship between users and items as they become directly comparable.\n\nHere what it does is it coverts the matrix users vs products into two:-\n\nIt divides into two matrices in such a way that users will mapped into some r factors and the products is also mapped to same r factors\nso they are going to map to same\n\nplease check the following link of **MIT LECTURE** of just 11min you will get complete idea about it:-\n\n[Latent factor model](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E8aMcwmqsTg&list=PLLssT5z_DsK9JDLcT8T62VtzwyW9LNepV&index=55)\n\nNow enough with this discussion .... let's dive into learning.....\n\n Since the dataset we used before did not have userId(which is necessary for collaborative filtering) let's load another dataset.

These are the following steps we'll follow :-\n\n* Get the index of the movie given its title.\n* Get the list of cosine similarity scores for that particular movie with all movies. Convert it into a list of tuples where the first element is its index(index of movie) and the second is the similarity score.\n* Sort the aforementioned list of tuples based on the similarity scores; that is, the second element.\n* Get the top 10 elements of this list. Ignore the first element as it refers to self (the movie most similar to a particular movie is the movie itself).\n* Return the titles corresponding to the indices of the top elements.","6688d050":"**Credits, Genres and Keywords Based Recommender**\n\n   It goes without saying that the quality of our recommender would be increased with the usage of better metadata(information about actors,film etc..,). That is exactly what we are going to do in this section. We are going to build a recommender based on the following metadata: the 3 top actors, the director, related genres and the movie plot keywords.\n\nFrom the cast, crew and keywords features, we need to extract the three most important actors, the director and the keywords associated with that movie.\n\nRight now, our data is present in the form of \"stringified\" lists , we need to convert it into a safe and usable structure","28a4c52e":"Let us now train on our dataset and arrive at predictions.","2a0efaff":"   In this kernel we'll be building a baseline Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset.\n            \n   **Lets start**\n           There are mainly three kinds of recommender systems:-\n           \n  **1)<h1>Demographic Filtering<\/h1>**- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and\/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n           When we open some app in our phone it asks to access our location.Based on our location and people around it will recommend the things which we may like and this is basic recommender present in any application.\n           \n  **2)<h1>Content Based Filtering<\/h1>**- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n            This can be seen in applications like Netflix,Facebook Watch etc..,. which recommend us the next movie or video based on the director,hero etc..,.\n            \n  **3)<h1>Collaborative Filtering<\/h1>**- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.\n            This is the most sophisticated personalized recommendation that means it takes into account what user likes and not likes.\n            The main example for this is Google Ads.\n","19a4ee16":"**RECOMMENDER SYSTEM BASED ON METADATA** \n\nWe are now in a position to create our \"metadata solution\", which is a string that contains all the metadata that we want to feed to our vectorizer (namely actors, director and keywords).\n\n**NOTE**:-here we can prepare the solution with only genre or actors or keywords or combination of any two etc..,.Those are helpful when we are building recommender system based on certain creteria like based on genre or based on actors etc..,.But for now we are building the recommender system based on everything","9f241ca0":"Now let's apply this to our data","99ab105d":"1.
