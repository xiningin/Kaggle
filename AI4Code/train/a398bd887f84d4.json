A joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission estimated that the epidemic in China peaked between late January and early February 2020. The majority of reports have been from Hubei and surrounding provinces, but numerous cases have been reported in other provinces and municipalities throughout China. \n\n<br>\n<br>\nTo get to know this virus better, I think it's important that we all invest the effort and resources we have.

This information is expected because the unknown virus(later known as COVID19) was reported on December 31. in Wuhan, a port city of 11 million people in the central Hubei province. Several of those infected worked at the city's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was shut down on January 1. \n<br>\n\nLet's take a closer look at how the virus spread in Hubei.","63709177":"As we can see, Henan seems to be the state with most confirmed deaths. But, the thing is Henan has population 94 million people. But if we compare it to Guangdong(114 million population), it seems Guangdong is holding better with 8 deaths and 1313 recoveries.","2a2a393f":"<h3>I will continute to do analysis on this topic if you like it.
