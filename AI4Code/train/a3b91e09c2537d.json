It is not possible for anyone to remember all the functions, operations and formulas of each concept. That\u2019s why we have cheat sheets. But there are a plethora of cheat sheets available out there, choosing the right cheat sheet is a tough task.\n\n[Top 28 Cheat Sheets for Machine Learning](https:\/\/www.analyticsvidhya.com\/blog\/2017\/02\/top-28-cheat-sheets-for-machine-learning-data-science-probability-sql-big-data\/)\n<br>\n###### [Go to top](#top)","a47740a3":"<a id=\"74\"><\/a> <br>\n## 7-4 Accuracy and precision\nWe know that the titanic problem is a binary classification and to evaluate, we just need to calculate the accuracy.\n\n1. **accuracy**\n\n    1. Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known simply as \"accuracy\u201d.\n\n1. **precision** : \n\n    1. In pattern recognition, information retrieval and binary classification, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, \n1. **recall** : \n\n    1. recall is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. \n1. **F-score** :\n\n    1. the F1 score is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\n\n1. **What is the difference between accuracy and precision?**\n    1. \"Accuracy\" and \"precision\" are general terms throughout science. A good way to internalize the difference are the common \"bullseye diagrams\". In machine learning\/statistics as a whole, accuracy vs. precision is analogous to bias vs. variance.","f3d3a94b":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a> <br>\n## 6- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)\n In this section, you'll learn how to use graphical and numerical techniques to begin uncovering the structure of your data. \n \n* Which variables suggest interesting relationships?\n* Which observations are unusual?\n* Analysis of the features!\n\n ><font color=\"red\"><b>Note:<\/b><\/font>\n You can read more about [EDA](https:\/\/www.datacamp.com\/community\/tutorials\/kaggle-machine-learning-eda)\n\nBy the end of the section, you'll be able to answer these questions and more, while generating graphics that are both **insightful** and **beautiful**.  then we will review analytical and statistical operations:\n\n*   5-1 Data Collection\n*   5-2 Visualization\n*   5-3 Data Preprocessing\n*   5-4 Data Cleaning\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s9.picofile.com\/file\/8338476134\/EDA.png\">\n\n ><font color=\"red\"><b>Note:<\/b><\/font>\n You can change the order of the above steps.","7c5396a5":"To pop up 5 random rows from the data set, we can use **sample(5)**  function","41407f8d":">  <font color=\"red\"><b>Note:<\/b><\/font>\nfor getting some information about the dataset you can use **info()** command","3c7c6f63":"> jupyter notebook\n> ","c3f1ab60":"<a id=\"631\"><\/a> <br>\n## 6-3-1 Features\nFeatures:\n* numeric\n* categorical\n* ordinal\n* datetime\n* coordinates\n\n### Find the type of features in titanic dataset:\n<img src=\"http:\/\/s9.picofile.com\/file\/8339959442\/titanic.png\" height=\"700\" width=\"600\" \/>","f2263935":"You can Fork and Run this kernel on Github:\n> ###### [ GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/mjbahmani\/Machine-Learning-Workflow-with-Python)\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n **I hope you find this kernel helpful and some <font color=\"red\"><b>UPVOTES<\/b><\/font> would be very much appreciated** ","0c41e647":"Seperating the data into dependent and independent variables.","fbc129aa":"If you want to remove all the null value, you can uncomment this line.","b9f44a8b":"<a id=\"624\"><\/a> <br>\n### 6-2-4 Multivariate Plots\nNow we can look at the interactions between the variables.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at scatterplots of all pairs of attributes.
