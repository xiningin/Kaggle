While this model fares much better than the baseline, as we can see from the scatterplot, the optimization process doesn't seem to be improving the F1 scores significantly.","15b5468e":"Given that the encoding of missing values as equivalent to unknown origin is reasonable, \"0\" is promising.

However, we also see that when the conflict rates of exons and introns are compared, they don't differ substantially. A natural next question is whether the number of HIGH-IMPACT variants is large enough that this different misclassification rate might make a significant difference. We see below that the number of HIGH-IMPACT variants is relatively low, but hardly negligible - 4752 out of 65188.","a90f9e90":"Better, although still not as good as the best decision tree without PCA.","7567361c":"Next let's check chromosomes.","e9b9c9f6":"Now, what to make of the \"Indel\"\/\"SNV\" dichotomy? In Kevin's kernel we saw that the length of REF or ALT could be used to classify variants as indels or SNVs. But we also see these two categories as dummy variables from CLNVC, and it turns out that not every variant is classified as one or the other in this set of columns. Rather, \"Indel\" is evidently used to mark variants that are either insertions or deletions, but *not* definitely known to be one or the other. Unfortunately, while we do indeed see that Indels are less likely to have conflicts than SNVs, they're exceptionally rare; almost all of the variants in the dataset are SNVs.","523c76dc":"I apply the optimization algorithm to the decision tree, given the search space \"space_tree,\" and print the best hyperparameters.

PCA doesn't help.\n\n# Decision Trees\n\nHow will adjusting the hyperparameters of a decision tree affect performance? Here I try both Bayesian optimization and randomized search to tune the hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization searches for the best hyperparameters by using information from previously tested hyperparameters, rather than simply checking a random combination of hyperparameters from a given search space. We need to define an objective function to be minimized for this search method, so the natural choice is [1 - average F1 score across the 10 folds].","e0a162b4":"Welcome to my kernel for the prediction of conflicts in classification of genetic variants! I'm relatively new to data science, so I welcome any constructive feedback you'd like to offer. This is an updated version of the kernel, after I did some debugging of some errors in use of PCA.\n# Feature Selection and Engineering\n\n\nFirst I'd like to examine the most promising columns of the data set to determine which features would most likely be relevant to prediction of conflicts, and convert them to workable formats.\n\nThe reference point I'll be using to ascertain the \"relevant\" features is to check the base rate of conflict: the prior probability of any variant having a conflicting classification is 25.21%. Comparing this rate to the rate of conflict among samples with a given value for a binary feature - which, as we'll see, are the predominant useable features in this dataset - should help illuminate which features will have predictive power. This isn't perfect, since of course some patterns may arise only among subsets of samples filtered by *multiple* features,  but if we retain enough features for our training set, such interactions will likely be revealed in the machine learning models themselves.\n\nOne very important lesson I learned far too late - if you're going to use cross-validation, split your data into the k folds *before* you select your features! This has been detailed before in sources such as [this one](https:\/\/github.com\/mottalrd\/cross-validation-done-wrong\/blob\/master\/Cross%20Validation%20done%20wrong.ipynb), but it's actually an embarrassingly simple concept. If you choose your features based on their correlations with the classification variable in the entire dataset, or the distribution of that classification variable among samples of a given feature value in the entire dataset, then you're including information that will bias your model when you evaluate its performance on different folds of the training set! This consideration led me to exclude certain chromosome dummy variables whose conflict rate estimates became less significant when I corrected this potential source of bias.","ae88c6c3":"More variants have non-missing data in the INTRON column than have \"1\" for a value in the intron_variant column. To get to the bottom of this, we have to examine the intersection of cases with \"0\" for variant_exon and \"1\" for variant_intron. This number is smaller than the number fulfilling either of these conditions separately, which is unexpected unless some variants are neither introns nor exons. Evidently at most 133 variants cannot be classified as either, based on the recoded EXON and INTRON columns, although some may simply be missing cases. Unfortunately, there's no CLNVC category for exons, so we can't do a direct comparison.\n\nThere are a lot more variants with missing EXON values *and* a \"0\" for intron_variant (as opposed to variant_intron, which was made from the INTRON column), so I'm inclined to think that every variant with non-missing INTRON data must actual be an intron, and it's more likely that the cases labeled 0 in intron_variant but 1 in INTRON are false negatives. So the conflict rate for variant_intron will be more useful:","89e1df7a":"Nothing useful from either of these, alas. It's surprising that the low-confidence cases don't have a larger conflict rate; if anything, it's the opposite! But not enough that these features would be helpful in a model.\n\nKevin's kernel showed visually that allele frequencies were negatively correlated with classification conflict, but let's quantify this. First, I examine the distribution of the non-transformed allele frequency column in one of the test sets (as an example) versus log-transformed and min-max-scaled allele frequency.","de426dc7":"To determine the rate of conflicting classifications for variants where a column takes on a certain value, I constructed the following helper function. I apply this function to genes with a frequency of at least 652 (1% of the entire dataset), exon status, and the IMPACT variable. For the purposes of this analysis, if the aveage conflict rate across all 10 folds differs from the base rate by 3 percentage points or more, I'll consider it a feature worth including in the model testing process.","b88f2f19":"Even with a modest number of trees, the Bayesian optimized random forest performs slightly better than the decision tree!","8cbbf087":"What about SIFT and PolyPhen?","a311d049":"Final score on the test set: 0.748!

No notable patterns for STRAND.","08d3f418":"Our feature matrix has all dummy variables except for allele frequency. First we verify that no imputation of missing values is required.","6162b3a1":"The randomized search tree is worse than the Bayesian-optimized one, which at least is a sign that Bayesian optimization is doing its job.

What if we try to optimize the same hyperparameters as we did for the decision tree? The runtime for this process is rather impractical, even with a GPU and with an upper bound of 10 iterations (at least for my machine). I limited the number of estimators to 10 for this.","aa9c970b":"With very little computation time, the Naive Bayes classifier achieves a decent F1 score, but it's not comparable to the decision tree. Let's try PCA on this.","50031d24":"The first two PCs stand out, but they still only explains about 53% of variance. I will examine how performance varies with the number of PCs included in the analysis, separately for each model.\n\nNow I want to assess the performance of a variety of models, based on F1 score, which is evidently ideal for a binary imbalanced problem like this. I'll also examine the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for each model, although this evidently has limitations for imbalanced problems.\n\nBut what is the F1 score to beat in this case? At the very least, our model should outperform a prediction of \"no conflict\" for every variant.","a3f437e1":"All good. Fortunately, all the features are between 0 and 1 already, so feature scaling isn't necessary. Below I reformat the target value arrays such that the models will work on them.","da833d83":"Almost as good as the best decision tree, but not quite. Let's try the default hyperparameters, with the exception of n_estimators.","aae1af8f":"This means that if a model can achieve an F1 score of no better than about 0.64, it's no improvement on a naive prediction rule based on the base rate of conflicts.\n\n# Logistic Regression\n\nThe logistic regression classifier's performance may vary based on the value of C (inverse of the regularization hyperparameter).","608d1a15":"Exploring the gradient boosting model in more depth would be ideal, but executing it just once with 20 estimators takes significant runtime.

Still,  it achieves a decent F1 score.","ea616d62":"(Credit to Kevin Arvai's EDA Kernel.) We convert the \"x\/y\" format of EXON to an absolute value. In addition, I'm recoding this into a binary variable for exon status, since leaving exon number as a numerical variable would not be terribly enlightening.

I also create dummy variables for IMPACT.","846151c2":"# Gradient Boosting","df8e4f98":"Also, let's investigate the results of PCA on this set of features.

In updates of this kernel I'd like to examine the feature\/PC importances more closely. However, based on the comparison of these results with those from iterations in which I did not include HIGH_SYMBOL, LOW_SYMBOL, HIGH_FEATURE, or LOW_FEATURE, it's evident that identifying the genes and feature IDs with either high or low conflict rates, and marking which variants include match any of such genes\/feature IDs, can provide significant predictive power. I include these lists for reference: ","8e7d9574":"All of the high-frequency genes actually have skewed conflict rates.\n\nSince there are so many genes represented among these variants, it seems a shame to waste the data on the rarer genes.

Let's make a dummy variable for intron status to compare with this later. Also, while \"ORIGIN\" is numeric, the numbers are codes, so we'll need dummy variables for it too.

Finally, we parse the Amino Acid column.","02c09257":"Below, I first separate out the test set from training, then construct a list of 10 training and validation sets. The use of \"StratifiedKFold\" ensures the rate of conflict in each fold is approximately equal to the base rate, as confirmed below. ","1ca9d512":"For chromosome 2, this isn't an exceptional deviation, which shouldn't be surprising since the frequency of Chrom 2 among the variants is so high anyway - thus if Chrom 2 had a drastically large rate of conflicting classifications, the base rate of conflict probably wouldn't be very different unless every other chromosome had exceptionally low conflict rates.\n\nHowever, some of the rarer chromosome variants, we see, have significantly different conflict rates! Chromosomes 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, and MT (mitochondrial) stand out. MT is too rare to be worth including, but the rest may be useful predictors.\n\nLooking at the 'MC' crosstab from Kevin Arvai's kernel, 'intron_variant' seems to be promising. Let's check conflict rates for variants with and without each Consequence.","7e3e4faf":"Unfortunately, PCA does not improve performance.\n\nLet's try a Bayesian search with PCs - it's possible that these hyperparameters aren't optimal because they were derived from an analysis *without* PCA.","fc977c40":"Here we see a very low conflict rate for \"frameshift_variant\" and \"stop_gained\", which are somewhat rare, but still have frequencies above 1000.
