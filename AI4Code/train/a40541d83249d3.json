Keep in mind that the same domain might appear more than once, in the same query. As you can see below YouTube appeared 154% of the queries (662 \u00f7 430 unique queries).\n- `avg_rank`: The average rank that the domain appeared on, in the dataset. \n- `coverage`: The number of times the domain appeared \u00f7 the number of unique queries sent.","cd9692af":"The above table shows the most used words in the title column of the `recipes` DataFrame, for Google.

","a07c4633":"This was a quick overview of doing some SEO research on Google and YouTube, and how you can compare, and extract certain information.  \nThere is more that can be done but these are some of the main features that I think are important.  \nIf you have any suggestions\/questions, or come across any bugs, [let me know.](https:\/\/github.com\/eliasdabbas\/advertools\/issues)","b179b3d2":"I wanted to quickly check if there is any correlation between any of those numeric columns and the rank of the channel.

YouTube appears mostly on ranks three to five, as shown above, in the summary table where they have an average rank of 4.8.\n\n### Comparison with flights keywords \n\nTo get an idea of how this distribution compares to other industries, here is a quick look at a similar data set for flights and tickets keywords. This is for one hundred top destinations (cities), and two keyword variations for each.  \nThe below code is pretty much the same as the one we ran for recipes.","6ec102bc":"YouTube is clearly the undisputed leader, and very far from the first competitor. \nLet's visualize this summary for a different view. Before that, we create a summary showing how many times each domain appeared on every rank.  \n\nFor example, in the sample below, cooking.nytimes.com appeared on rank one, eight times, on rank two, five times, and so on. Before that I created `top_domains` which are the top ten domains that appeared the most. You can change this of course if you want more, or fewer domains.","acf476ed":"The DataFrame is sorted by `wtd_freq` by default but you can obviously change that if you want.  \n\"recipe\" was used 412 times, and the sum total of views for all videos who's title contains \"recipes\" was 394,834,312.  \nThe words on indexes two to six are interesting. They all have an `abs_freq` of one, and the same number on `wtd_freq`. This means that there was one video who's title contained these words, and this is further confirmed by the fact that they all have the same `wtd_freq`.  \nThis is a very important example, where one row can affect the whole dataset. This is typical on social media where you have people with tens of millions of followers, and with one post, can make such a dramatic difference to the averages.  \nAgain \"chicken\" is the top specific food word in this DataFrame. \n\nLet's run the same function for the description column (also weighted by the number of views):","378761a5":"## Text Analysis\n\nSince we have a lot of numeric columns that describe videos and channels, and since we also have many text columns, let's do some word counting and see which are the most common.  \nNote that there are two types of counting that are provided by the `word_frequency` function. \n\n- Absolute (`abs_freq`): This is a simple count of how many times each word was used in the text list that we specify. \n- Weighted (`wtd_freq`): This takes into consideration the numeric value that we provide. For example, if a video has the title \"sushi recipe\" and that video got one thousand views, then \"sushi\" and \"recipe\" would be counted a thousand times each. This shows how important the word was from a consumption perspective and not just from a production point of view.
