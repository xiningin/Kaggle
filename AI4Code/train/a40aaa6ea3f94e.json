I just watched the error for learn = cnn_learner(....) from two cells down to identify the directory to copy the pth file to and what the postfixed id was.\n\nThis is the original instructions shared:  Later, I use resnet as the base architecture. However, since we can't use the internet for this kernel in this competition I will set these directories which will contain the models. This is because, cnn_learner will check those directories first before attempting to download. When internet for the kernel is turned off and these models don't exist, an error will be raised. To add the models, click on add dataset at the top right corner of this kernel and search for resnet. Make sure to choose resnet for PyTorch\n\nThanks Amin!  https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/aminyakubu"}}
