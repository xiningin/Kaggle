","3a2b0374":"# How to represent words?\n\nThe first and arguably most important common denominator across all NLP tasks is how we represent words as input to any of our models. Much of the earlier NLP work that we will not cover treats words as atomic symbols. To perform well on most NLP tasks we first need\nto have some notion of similarity and difference between words.\n\nOne common solution is using WordNet. This is something which uses NLTK which is the swiss army knife for NLP meaning it is not terribly good for anything but has a lot of basic functions. WordNet makes very fine distinctions of a word like a thesaurus containing lists of synonym sets and hypernyms ('is a' relationship). But there are a few problems such as it is built with human labour, can't compute accurate word similarities and is subjective. \n\nWell, how about one-hot-vectors? There are few things which are bad here such as language has a lot of words and there is no notion of similarity. \n\nhow about representing a word using its context?\n\nWhen a word is used in a text, its context is the set of words that appear nearby, right?\nWhen you get a sense of the idea of 'oh no that's the wrong word to use there' you understand the meaning of the word right? This is the idea of Distributional Semantics to understand the meaning of a word.\n\nSo that leads us to representing words in a better way using Word Embeddings. \n\n# What are Word Embeddings?\n\nWe will build a dense vector for each word, chosen so that it's similar to vectors of words that appear in the same context.\n\nThere are 2 types of algorithms used for word embedding:\n\nThe first set are count-based and rely on matrix factorization (e.g. LSA, HAL). While these methods effectively leverage global statistical information, they are primarily used to capture word similarities and do poorly on tasks such as word analogy, indicating a suboptimal vector space structure. The other set of methods are shallow window-based (e.g. the skip-gram and the CBOW models), which learn word embeddings by making predictions in local context windows. These models demonstrate the capacity to capture complex linguistic patterns beyond word similarity, but fail to make use of the global co-occurrence statistics.\n\nhow about we combine them but how do we do that?\n\nwe could use ratios of co-occurrence probabilities to encode meaning components which is called \n# GLOVE Embedding. \n\nThe training objective of Glove is to learn word vectors such that their dot product equals the logarithm of the words probability of co-occurence.
