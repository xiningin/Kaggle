It only looks at three columns of the data, `Sex, Age, Fare`. The results would definitely get better with more careful data\/feature engineering. However, I didn't want to distract from the neural network implementation.","750d472a":"### Convert the Pandas DFs to Numpy Arrays\nNumpy arrays are required for the neural network to process the data.","3d596604":"We'll add the `PassengerId` column, and make sure the values are the type we want. Then we'll save it as a CSV file.","a8072870":"### Check Accuracy on Test\/Train Split\nThis test comes from the splitting of the data we did earlier. We can be limited on the number of competition submissions, so we'll test with data that we know the results, but that the model has never seen.","8cd7ef1b":"### Check Dimensions of Data \nWhen working with neural networks, the dimensionality of your data is crucial to the design. We'll check the shape (size of each dimension) of our numpy arrays (numpy matrices).","d9f6c43c":"### Import Keras\n`Sequential` is the type of NN we'll be using. It's also the most basic -- meaning data is flowing from the start to the finish. Nothing tricky.\n<br>`Dense` is the type of layer we want. It's a fully connected layer of neurons. You can play around with densely connected sequential NN models at [here.](https:\/\/www.playground.tensorflow.org)\n<br>`Activation` is the function we want to use to simulate the biological activation of neurons. There are lots of them, but some of the standard include `relu`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`. You can read more about them [here.](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Activation_function)\n<br> `train_test_split` is just a simple way to split up our numpy arrays so we can train on one part of the data, and test on another.","2630b802":"### Make Data Usable\nNeural networks need number values, so we'll replace the categorical data with numeric data by simply using a binary represation where `male = 0, femal = 1`.","c2fb5a0b":"### The Model\nThis model takes in the 3 column input, passes it through two dense layers with each layer containing 2 neurons. It then goes through a final layer with a single neuron. This final layer uses a `sigmoid` activation function to transform the values between 0 and 1 -- just what we need for our output.\n\n<br><br> If we want consistency in our results, we need to tell the random weight generator to start at the same values each time. We do this with `np.random.seed(some_starting_int)`.

We'll need to do a little more prep work before we're able to save it as a CSV file in the format required for the competition.\n<br> We'll also need to round the output of the neural network so that it's either a 0 or 1 in the survived column.\n<br> *I would also recommended going back and training on the full training data set prior to submission*"}}
