Skewness and kurtosis for a normal distribution is roughly about 0 and 3 respectively (in some cases +\/-2 and +\/-7 respectively).\n\nNon-parametric test across elementry stats is chi-square test. However, there are many more tests. Ex: In this data we'll be using *Mann Whitney test* which is non-parametric and alternative to the Two sample t-test however not always.\n\nDisadvantages with non-parametric test is that they are time consuming as most of the calculation is done by hand. Also, critical value tables for many tests aren\u2019t included in many computer software packages. So, you need to check them manually.","96fe6ce2":"### Rejecting Null hypothesis as p-value is very small which means:\n\nWomen Entrepreneurship Index values do not show a statistically significant difference between the countries that are developed and developing.","434ad4b4":"### Rejecting Null hypothesis as p-value is small.\n#### So, Women Entrepreneurship Index values do not show a statistically significant difference between the countries that are members of the European Union and not.\n\nWe have seen almost every column relations with women entretreneurship index. Further more you can calculate relation between two independent columns using ***chi-square test***.\n\n***Thanks for visiting! \nThe exploratory data analysis is done in another notebook which I will be uploading soon.
