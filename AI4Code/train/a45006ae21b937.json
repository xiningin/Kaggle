It is one way to display an algorithm that contains only conditional control statements.\n\nA decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a \u201ctest\u201d on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from the root to leaf represent classification rules.","3066777d":"#### Types of Decision Trees\nTypes of the decision tree are based on the type of target variable we have. It can be of two types:\n\n1. Categorical Variable Decision Tree\n2. Continuous Variable Decision Tree\n\nQ. What is Categorical Variable Decision Tree?\n\nAns: A decision tree which has a categorical target variable is called categorical variable decision tree.\n\nQ. What is Continuous Variable Decision Tree?\n\nAns: A decision tree which has continuous target variable then it is called as the continuous variable decision tree.","3c783b3e":"#### Model's Parameters Study:","4cf57b8b":"#### Training\/model fitting\n","6a8507eb":"#### Identify the target and predictor variables","27e9c08b":"The model evaluates\n   cars according to the following concept structure:\n\n   * CAR       ->              car acceptability\n   * PRICE     ->               overall price\n   * buying    ->           buying price\n   * maint     ->            price of the maintenance\n   * TECH      ->             technical characteristics\n   * COMFORT   ->           comfort\n   * doors     ->         number of doors\n   * persons    ->        capacity in terms of persons to carry\n   * lug_boot    ->       the size of luggage boot\n   * safety      ->         estimated safety of the car\n\n   Input attributes are printed in lowercase.
