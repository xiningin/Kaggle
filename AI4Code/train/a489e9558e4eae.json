The model would be confused if the image is a text or not and your accuracy ( though high in some cases ) will not be generatlized across train and test. The trick here is to set the learning rate to a very low value to get a smooth loss curve as shown below\n\n##### Epochs : A low epoch number results in a low train accuracy. You can try to work this on your own and see for yourself. You will have to cut a balance between train and test accuracy so that the model can be generalized for any data and should have low varience\n\n##### The only downside of this code is the run time. Since there is no scaling the epochs seem to be running at a lower rate. With this combination the run time is about 1 Hour.

While reading the images we are also performing some image processing techniques on them. Some of the processing operations are possible after the image is flattended out, however doing it in a single block caters to our needs.\n\n##### image.convert(\"L\") - Converts any image of any color configuration to Monochrome, using an built-in function and conversion algorithm the pixels are mapped in the range of 0 to 255, 0 being dark\/black and 255 being bright\/white, you should get the idea from here as to why we are doing this. We are reducing the complex image to a more manageable format. \n\n##### Important Fact - If you stop your processing here ( image.convert(\"L\") and try tuning your hyper parameter - you cannot acheive higher accuracy figures. I felt this boilerplate code is still primitive way of image processing and such a code ( like MP Neuron ) would love binaries. I would like to add a special mention for Shravan ( see Key mentions for more details ) for pointing this out during a discussion on slack, I wanted to binarize it and was trying image.convert(\"1\") - this would convert the image to black & white -  0 or 1. But again, based on a fixed algorithm just the way \"L\" would. I tried this option, but the accuracy and the log loss curve did not match my expectations and I did go ahead with it. You can try this and see for yourself. There may be a better way of using image.convert(\"1\") and acheving good results. Now le's move on to Binarization of the pixels.\n\n##### image.point - I came across this awesome pillow feature which would convert pixel range to binary using a threshold value. To be honest, this is not widely used because there are better ways of doing it using openCV ( I have explored this option but decided not to use it in the spirit of the contest and learning curve, there are lot of new users in this program who are new to image processing and openCV can be overwhelming, however I highly encourage everyone to look at openCV - any learning is good learning !! ). Coming to image.point, this according to me is probably the best way of binarizing the code if that is your main intention and the most easiest of all. A single line of code with lambda function ( thought to us in MP Neuron ) did the trick for me. There are several ways in which you can use this feature and set the threshold, I decided to go with my own way of setting the threshold as 15.\n\n##### Why 15 ? - I wanted the text ( which we know is in range of black color pixels ) to stand out and I did account for the edges of the text ( if handwritten ). After some iterations of threshold value I decided to go with 15. Epochs and learning rate will have to adjusted to acheive high accuracy with other threshold values. After the lambda conversion, the text would now have value of 1 for pixel value <15 ( though not pure black, atleast it would stand out as black and I am having a range for black as 0 to 15 ) and anything that is not a text or any other color format from 16 to 255 would be 0 ( pure white - this has no range ! )\n\n##### flatten() - This actually converts the image to an array of numbers. Remember - an image is nothing but numbers eventually !!","ada201c1":"#### Print CE Accuracy","a660436a":"#### MSE\n##### MSE is not meant for non linear datapoints, hence removed.","37bdd940":"#### Eliminating StandardScaler\n##### Now that we have converted the image to a binary format, we don't need StandardScaler. If this step is retained you will have variations in loss and accuracy as the conversion would tamper with the number of 1's present in the image.
