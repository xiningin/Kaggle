CONCLUSION\n\nFirst, we engineer a series of random returns (i.e., random walk) and test whether the series follows a random walk with Lo and MacKinlay (1988) variance ratio test. The test successfully identifies the truth we engineer (i.e., we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the market is efficient, specifically, weak-form efficient).\n\nSecond, we replicate Table 1a of Lo and MacKinlay (1988) paper using the equal-weighted CRSP NYSE-AMEX index from 620906 to 851226. The null hypothesis that the market is weak-form efficient is rejected (i.e., the stock market prices do not follow random walk).
