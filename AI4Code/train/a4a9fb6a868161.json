A 350 engine means it \"displaces\" 350 cubic inches of \"area\" internally that can be filled with fuel and air.\n\n4.hp - horsepower commonly used term it specify the engine capacity. it is also called torque which means power needed to move your vechicle from 1 place to other.\n\n5.weightlbs - It represents weight of a car.\n\n6.time-to-60 - This parameter tells that how much second a car take to reach 60 miles or 100 km\/hr speed.\n\n7.year -  Which year car has been launched. \n\n8.brand - Barnd represent the owner country, which has designed this car in ours (US, Europe and Japan )","c8925ad1":"Cluster 0 has low weight , cluster1 has medium and cluster 3 has high weight vechicle","245c80a7":"As we see 3 is optimal number of cluster where score has become constant. so fit and check cluster on 3 class cluster.","9be0a1c6":"After all this analysis over many variables we see cluster divides based on hp, mpg, cylinders and time-to-60.\n\ncluster 0 contain small weight , less cylinder, less hp, more time to 100km\/hr and more mpg.\n\nCluster 1 contain slight weight more than cluseter1 , medium hp, medium cylinder *6, avg time to 100 km\/hr and avg mileage.\n\ncluster 2 contain max weight vechicle, max cylinders , max hp, less time to 100 km\/hr and less mpg.","87725d06":"if less number of cylinders then it will take more time to reach 100km\/hr.
