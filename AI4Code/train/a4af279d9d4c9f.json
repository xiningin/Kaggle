Season 4 was when a lot of the creative team started to leave the show, including series creator and showrunner [Dan Harmon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dan_Harmon) and two the primary directors during the early seasons, the [Russo brothers](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russo_brothers). It's also when the first regular cast member, [Chevy Chase](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chevy_Chase), would leave the show, followed by [Donald Glover](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Glover) in season 5. Season 6 starts out with among the lowest ratings, but the series does finish relatively strong."}}
