most significant change in employment due to thr economic impact of covid-19\n\n- Business Services\n\nThe business services industry includes real estate, legal activities, accounting activities, business and management consultancy activities, architectural and engineering activities. \n\nAnd as seen above, the change in employment in Business Services has been fluctuating with both ups and downs from 2010 3Q to 2019 4Q. Prior to 2020, its highest employment was 12k in 2014 2Q and lowest employment was -2000 in 2016 1Q.  \n\nHowever, that has changed as employment dipped to -800 in 2020 1Q then further to -14k in 2020 2Q, which has never been seen before in Singapore. This notable decline in employment is consistent with when COVID-19 first entered Singapore. Such services were likely hit hard due to the chain reaction caused by both the circuitbreaker and travel ban being imposed. \n> As more companies' profits suffered, employees were laid off and disposable income fell. This means that not only was there less demand for consultancy services, other business services like real estate saw a fall in employment too as there are now less people who will buy properties.\n\nIt is thus clear that COVID-19 was not kind to those working in the business services industry as it has caused the lowest employment Singapore has seen in this industry at -14k.\n\n- Other Services Industries\n\nOther services industries include recreation, community and personal services. \n\nSimilar to the aforementioned industries, other service industries have seen a fluctuating trend in employment from 2010 3Q to 2019 4Q, and then a sharp decline from 2020 1Q onwards. Employment fell from 100 in 2020 1Q to -27.3k in 2020 2Q. As mentioned before, this decline is consistent with the time COVID-19 entered Singapore.\n\nConsidering how there was a travel ban, it is inevitable that this industry which mainly consist of arts, entertainment and recreation (AER) would be severely affected.\n\n**Overall, the services-producing industries saw a general decreasing trend in change in employment as COVID-19 cases rose in Singapore.**\n\n\n- Wholesale and Retail Trade \n\nThere is a general fluctuating trend of employment in the wholesale and retail industry from 2220 in 2010 3Q to 2220 2019 4Q. However, due to the uncertainties in the covid-19 climate, there is a sharp decline in the employment rate from 2220 in 2019 4Q to -15.9k in 2020 2Q as detailed by figure 5.3. \n\n>This could be due to the [lack of consumer demand](https:\/\/www.businesstimes.com.sg\/government-economy\/may-retail-sales-hit-all-time-low-industry-hoping-for-rebound) due to economic uncertainties where consumers tend to hold back spending on non-essential retail goods \nMoreover, due to covid 19 circuit breaker measures where retail stores were deemed as a non essential service and forced to closed to abide by the [government regulations](https:\/\/www.gov.sg\/article\/covid-19-circuit-breaker-heightened-safe-distancing-measures-to-reduce-movement) and to play our mitigate the spread of the virus. \n\nHence due to the circuit breaker restrictions, this is led to a fall in demand and thus weak deamnd for labour in this sector which resulted in the drop im employment.\n\n- Accommodation and Food Services\n\nThere is a general fluctuating trend of employment in the Accommodation and food servicesindustry from 2400 in 2010 3Q to 3000 2019 4Q. However, due to the uncertainties in the covid-19 climate, there is a steep decrease in the employment rate from 3000 in 2019 4Q to -27.4k in 2020 2Q as detailed by figure 5.3. \n\n>A factor that atributed to this fall in employment could be due to the [travel ban](https:\/\/www.stb.gov.sg\/content\/stb\/en\/home-pages\/advisory-on-covid-19.html) implmented in light of the covid-19 pandemic where countries have closed off their boarders to reduce the spread of the virus. This certainly has caused the accommodation industry to suffer as a [huge bulk](https:\/\/www.stb.gov.sg\/content\/stb\/en\/about-stb\/overview.html) of singapore's GDP is made up of the tourism sector and that this industry depends on foreign vistors to thrive. \n\nHence due to the decrease in demand for accommodation and food services has resulted in the fall for demand for labour thus causing this sharp fall in unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n","11d65fcd":"# Ecommerce and Online Delivery Trends ","58276f34":"![Covid-19-Webpage-banner-1170x240-opt2.jpg](attachment:Covid-19-Webpage-banner-1170x240-opt2.jpg)","acf1a9b1":"## Importing of Data Sets and Data Cleaning","8674b1d4":"### Online Food Delivery Data Sets","a1f3f3f8":"Revenue in the ecommerce market is projected to reach US$2,405m in 2020.\n\nThe market's largest segment is Food & Personal Care with a projected market volume of US$593m in 2020.\n\n### Positive Trends in Ecommerce\nThis (pandemic) has created a sudden and dramatic change in consumer behaviour, with more consumers turning to online shopping.
