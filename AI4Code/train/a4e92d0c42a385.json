methods, I found that there are 8124 samples and 23 features. These categorical features mostly include the various aspects of a mushroom's morphology\/physical appearance. Moreover, there is no missing data!","5ada3d51":"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed for dimensionality reduction.","c2d21d31":"The same results were echoed in the test set.","df9e0a38":"### Building models\nBefore building our machine learning algorithms, I dropped 'veil-type' as this feature has only one category. This is followed by label encoding and one hot encoding to convert the categorical data into a machine learning algorithm-readable form. For our target variables - 0 corresponds to edible mushrooms and 1 to poisonous mushrooms.","08cb4bd3":"### Plots\nTo get a better understanding of the characteristics of edible and poisonous mushrooms and which characters are distinct, I made plots for each feature. Instead of plugging the numbers of mushrooms directly in the characteres\/categories of each feature\/column, I calculated first the percentage of edible and poisonous mushrooms falling in the categories in each feature or column. This was done because we have unequal amount of data for edible and poisonous mushrooms (4208 edible (e) mushrooms and 3916 poisonous (p) ). For a better understanding, I have kept tables showing the percentage distribution of edible and poisonous mushrooms in different categories here.","7aaeec13":"Excited with the 100% accuracy obtained using LogisticRegression and a bit skeptical, I tried Random Forest Classifier. Another reason for using RandomForest classfier was to obtain important features that can aid in distinguishing edible and poisonous mushrooms. I used the data that was obtained before PCA as in my exerience I have seen that RandomForest Classfier works better (gives higher accuracy) in non-PCA data than when the data is obtained after PCA. RandomForest classfier also gave a 100% accuracy score in that case. (Accuracy was 99.86% in data obtained after PCA. If you have an explaination, why this hapeens, please let me know.)","864621ad":"Some of the features that show vast differences between the two classes are - Odor, Bruises, Stalk surface above the ring, Spore print color. Within the features there are categories where either of the classes having complete dominance such as in the case of buff gill color shown only by poisonous mushrooms.","cc20c733":"### Importing modules\nWe begin with importing the necessary modules.","82a40b8c":"For further data analysis, I made 2 dataframes for poisonous and edible mushrooms.","ab269baf":"I started with a simple classifier- Logistic Regression. This gave a high accuracy of 99%  and over 98% scores for both recall and precision.","fae1468b":"RandomForest Classfier was then used to get the important features and their degree of  importance.","bae1a167":"Next, I obtained the train and test sets.","1c4277bf":"## Objective \nIn this kernel we will explore the world of mushrooms using tools of Exploratory Data Analysis, will try to build a predictive modeling tool and in the end, we will make a guideline that can aid in distinguishing edible from poisonous variety.  ","05c4455f":"The top 10 features for distinguishing edible from poisonous mushrooms are as follows:\n1. odor_n= This correspond to odor-none i.e. odorless, which is a characteristic shown by over 81% of the edible mushrooms compared to only 3% poisonous mushrooms. Odor in general is one of the features that shows huge difference between edible and posionous mushrooms. This was already quite evident from the EDA performed above.\n2. gill_color_b= This corresponds to buff coloured gill shown only by poisonous mushrooms. It is a characteristic shown by 44% of the poisonous variety.\n3. gill spacing= Closed spacing is shown by 97% of poisonous mushrooms and 71% edible ones. The difference is more evident when 28% of edible ones show crowded gill spacing compared to only 3% of poisonous ones.\n4. ring type p= Pendant type ring is shown by over 75% edible mushrooms compared to 21% poisonous ones.\n5. population_v= 'several' population, with 21% edible mushrooms compared to 9% poisonous ones.\n6. stalk surface above ring s= 'Smooth' stalk surface for nearly 86% edible mushrooms compared to 40% poisonous ones.\n7. ring type i= If the ring type is large, then the mushroom is definitely poisonous. \n8. bruises= Majority of poisonous mushroom have no bruises while majority of edible ones have.\n9. spore print color h- 40% of poisonous mushrooms show chocolate coloured spores, while only 1% of edible ones have chocolate colored spores.\n10. stalk surface above ring k=Majority of poisonous mushrooms have silky stalk surface above ring.","8232fc94":"###  Conclusion\nSo, a **general guideline** (obtained after EDA and from RandomForestClassfier's features importantance) while shrooming is -\nA mushroom is **poisononous**, if it has-\n1.  an odor (such as creosote ,fishy, foul, pungent, spicy , a character of 95% poisonous mushrooms), or \n2. has a large ring (a character shown only by poisonous mushrooms),  or \n3. a combination of any of the above and lower mentioned points-\ni).   buff colored gills, \nii).  closed gill spacing, \niii). no bruises, \niv). chocolate colored spore print (or even white colored), \nv). has a silky stalk surface  above the ring\n\n### Thanks for reading. ","f6c21bbf":"Further, probing shows that except 'veil-type', all other features have atleast 2 or more categories.","fb87fd37":"After hyperparameteres tuning, I obtained the best parameteres for logistic regression- penalty =l1 and C=100.
