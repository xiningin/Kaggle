Further analyzing their individual preferences and affinities will provide additional opportunities for even more personalized messaging.\n\nHigh-spending New Customers \u2013 It is always a good idea to carefully \u201cincubate\u201d all new customers, but because these new customers spent a lot on their first purchase, it\u2019s even more important. Like with the Best Customers group, it\u2019s important to make them feel valued and appreciated \u2013 and to give them terrific incentives to continue interacting with the brand.\n\nLowest-Spending Active Loyal Customers \u2013 These repeat customers are active and loyal, but they are low spenders. Marketers should create campaigns for this group that make them feel valued, and incentivize them to increase their spend levels. As loyal customers, it often also pays to reward them with special offers if they spread the word about the brand to their friends, e.g., via social networks.\n\n\nChurned Best Customers \u2013 These are valuable customers who stopped transacting a long time ago. While it\u2019s often challenging to re-engage churned customers, the high value of these customers makes it worthwhile trying.

Here are just a few examples to illustrate:\n\nBest Customers \u2013 This group consists of those customers who are found in R-Tier-1, F-Tier-1 and M-Tier-1, meaning that they transacted recently, do so often and spend more than other customers. A shortened notation for this segment is 1-1-1; we\u2019ll use this notation going forward.\n\nHigh-spending New Customers \u2013 This group consists of those customers in 1-4-1 and 1-4-2. These are customers who transacted only once, but very recently and they spent a lot.\n\nLowest-Spending Active Loyal Customers \u2013 This group consists of those customers in segments 1-1-3 and 1-1-4 (they transacted recently and do so often, but spend the least).\n\nChurned Best Customers \u2013 This segment consists of those customers in groups 4-1-1, 4-1-2, 4-2-1 and 4-2-2 (they transacted frequently and spent a lot, but it\u2019s been a long time since they\u2019ve transacted).\n\n\nMarketers should assemble groups of customers most relevant for their particular business objectives and retention goals.","a3969f10":"## Methodology\n\ncalculate Recency = number of days since last purchase\n\ncalculate Freqency = number of purchases during the studied period\n\ncalculate Monetary = total amount of purchases made during the studied period\n\nfind quintiles for each of these dimensions\n\ngive a grade to each dimension depending in which quantiles it stands\n\ncombine R, F and M scores to get the RFM score\n\nmap RF scores to segments","dbc142a3":"## A change of Approach\n\nThis doesnt look right, so lets review our RFM class methods.\nCreate a fuction that assign ranks from 1 to 5 \nA smaller Recency value is better\nFor Frequency and Monetary values, a Higher value is better. \nso we have two different functions.","805128fa":"Distribution of Recency, Frequency and Monetary\nRecency distribution is right-skewed, showing that the majority of customers made a purchase in the recent past. It has a long tail containing single customers who made their order long time ago.\n\nBoth frequency and monetary distributions are bimodal (with two different peaks - modes). The chart reveals that one group of customers has low frequency (small number of orders, around 10 per customer) and another group is much more \"loyal\" (with around 50 purchases per customer). When it comes to monetary, it follows similar pattern. Part of customers have only spent little amount of money but there is another (significant in size) group that have spent much more.\n\nFrequency and monetary distributions suggest that there are visible differences between different groups of customers. By looking at the distribution of three the biggest segments: \"loyal customers\", \"hibernating\", \"potential loyalist\" it's easy to see that indeed they build up different parts of total distribution, eg. hibernating customers are responsible for first monetary peak and loyal customers for the second peak.","3b10b839":"\n## Online Retail Data Set II","9f8aad59":"## Brief Introduction","d90539a4":"Another perspective of RFM or customer segmentation is to increase Sales.\nBy applying the following scoring system as stated on https:\/\/www.barilliance.com\/rfm-analysis\/\n\nCore - Your Best Customers\nRFM Score: 111\n\nWho They Are: Highly engaged customers who have bought the most recent, the most often, and generated the most revenue.\n\nMarketing Strategies: Focus on loyalty programs and new product introductions.
