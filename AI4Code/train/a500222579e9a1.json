We can use pandas's [groupby](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) method and find the [count](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/reference\/api\/pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.count.html#pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.count) to find the count of each group.","4966249b":"Next, let's inspect the value of the `YearsCode` field:","f80cd288":"We need to convert this field to a numerical representation so we could plot a heat map.

Let's define this conversion function:","3bffdbdb":"# Multiple Plots\n\nBefore ending this notebook, I would like to talk about how to draw multiple plots within the same figure. The way this is done in matplotlib is via the [plt.subplot](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html) method. This method instrurcts matplotlib that the upcoming plot-related instructions belong to particular subplot of the figure. The method accepts three parameters, one for the number of subplot rows in the figure, one for the number of subplot columns, and the last is for the index of the subplot currently being created starting from the top-left corner with index 1 and moving right. For example, the following call:\n```Python\nplt.subplot(3, 3, 4)\n```\ninstruct matplotlib that our figure should have 3 rows and 3 columns of subplots, and that we are currently created the plot number of 4.\n\nAs a demonstration, let's modify our code at the beginning for plotting the sine function to draw multiple plots of the sine function, each having different frequency:","84e04b26":"Let's start by loading the Stack Overflow Developer Survey so we could employ it in the subsequent sections.","a80a9371":"As easy as that, just another call to the `plot` method and we have two graphs. However, we cannot easily tell which graph is for which function. We will see in the next section how we can enhance the graph by adding more features.","bb74d23c":"# Loading the Data\n\n","80994fbf":"# Summary\n\nI hope this gave you a taste of how to work with matplotlib. The number of different [kinds](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/gallery\/index.html) of graphs you can do with matplotlib is huge, so this notebook is no way a representation of the power of matplotlib. Instead, I hope I managed to take you through the basics of matplotlib that, with a little googling or Stack Overflow reading, you could easily generate the plot type you need to visualize your data.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that I focused on 2D plots here. It is frequently necessary to deal with 3D plots. However, the notebook is already long, so I thought I would refer you to [matplotlib 3D plotting tutorials](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/mpl_toolkits\/mplot3d\/tutorial.html) if you need such plots.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that matplotlib is not the only visualization library in Python. In fact, there are [many more](https:\/\/www.anaconda.com\/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries\/) libraries and matplotlib is just one of them, though it is one of the oldest and most popular library and many other libraries build on top of it. One interesting library which extends matplotlib is [seaborn](seaborn.pydata.org) as mentioned in the section about heat maps. Another interesting library I came to know about recently is [altair](https:\/\/altair-viz.github.io\/getting_started\/installation.html).\n","1b5d6f2e":"Having load the complete survey, let's pick the some columns which are interesting to study:","aff283da":"# Simple 2D Plots\n\nLet's start with a simple 2D plot.

If you don't already know NumPy and pandas, you should still be able to follow this notebook and understand the basic ideas, though I still highly recommend that you read and experiment with the previous notebooks\n\nIn this notebook, I will take the reader through [matplotlib](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/), which is the most famous package for visualization in Python. Machine learning deals with a huge amount of data and without proper insignt into the data, it is hard to come up with something useful. `matplotlib` supports a variety of [plot types](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/gallery\/index.html) which can be exteremely useful within machine learning and outside it.\n\nFor good visualization we need good data. As such, I will mostly be using [Stack Overflow Developer Survey for 2019](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mchirico\/stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-2019) throughout this notebook, except at the beginning where I will be using elementary mathematical functions.","9753341a":"# Multilpe 2D Plots\n\nIn many cases, we need to plot multiple graphs on the same plot.

It is not clear what the horizontal and vertical axes represent.\n3. Lack of grid makes it harder to estimate values at certain points.\n\nWith a few additional calls, we can add those features.\n","51b4ab68":"# Multiple Bar Charts\n\nIt is sometimes useful to have multiple bar charts for better comparison. For example, taking the respondants from the top 15 countries, what is the number of developers who are actively contributing to open source vs those who are not? Let's try to plot this. First, let's examine the `OpenSourcer` column to see the possibly values:","eaac3515":"With these, let's go ahead and create a pivot table for the ","6278acac":"What if we want to annotate the blocks of the heat map with the values they represent?

What if we want to add a color bar so we get a sense of the value of each color? We could use [colorbar](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/3.1.1\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar.html). As you can see, things are getting complicated quickly. Obviously, you could wrote your method for plotting a heat map with all required features and re-use it, but you don't have to since others have already done in other libraries that extend the functionality of matplotlib.

In such cases, we can manually specify those limits via the [xlim](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.xlim.html) and [ylim](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.ylim.html) functions.

To get a basic understanding of how this works, let's see the following example:","a99809ff":"# Heatmaps\n\nIn this section, we will demonstrate how to plot a [heat map](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heat_map). The way [a heat map is plotted using matplotlib](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/3.1.1\/gallery\/images_contours_and_fields\/image_annotated_heatmap.html) is with a little trick. matplotlib has a function called [imshow](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/3.1.1\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html) which is used to display an image. So, to display a heat map, we could treat the values of the heat map matrix as an image (think a low resolution image). \n\n","3d7a749f":"Next, let's filter the data frame to those countries only:","8083c3b8":"# Pie Chart","6d15fb05":"Notice that we got the color bar automatically. If we want to get annotation, we simply pass `annot=True`. We could also easily add labels ","0daf8015":"As a practical application of heat maps on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, let's plot the a heat map for open source contribution among the top countries with respect to the number of years coding. In other words, how likely are people to contribute based on their number of years coding?\n\nLet's first see the different values of the `OpenSourcer` fields to know what what to make of it:","dae9a36e":"What if we want to the draw side adjacent to each others instead of overlapping? In this case, we need somoe manual processing here. Specifically:\n\n1. Instead of passing in categories, i.e. country names, as the first parameter to the `bar()` method, we pass x-coordinates. This way we can shift the bars to the left or right, depending on which set of bars we want to show.\n\n2. Now that we are passing in x-coordinates instead of the actual country names, we need to use the [set_xticks](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/3.1.1\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xticks.html) and [set_xticklabels](https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/api\/_as_gen\/matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xticklabels.html)."}}
