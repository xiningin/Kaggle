The main one being the presence of **Vishy Anand**, who is still actively playing chess and has motivated the entire nation by becoming the World Champion for a record five times. At the same time India has a strong national federation, work that is being done at the grassroot level and the chess in schools program that is slowly picking up pace. All of these factors have led to Indian chess going from one GM in 1987 (Vishy Anand) to 66 GMs as of August 2020.\n\nI hope that you enjoyed this analysis of Grandmasters of Indian chess.
