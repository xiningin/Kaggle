I hope that I am not mistaken in this matter. The size of the government naturally affects the government consumption of the state money significantly. Over the past six years:\n- First, reducing the size of the Egyptian government and thus reducing the volume of government public consumption\n- In conjunction with the increase of government companies with a slight rise in the margin tax, and a very small contraction in customs value in conjunction with the imposition of sanctions and control of the black markets\n\nThis was the policy of the government in the economic sector in recent years, but tried as much as possible to defy the financial crisis and headed later in 2016 to float the Egyptian pound after the rates of trade achieved the worst level and the stagnation of local markets to investment, so the government has developed for that solution I do not have Any information about 2017 and 2018, but I would like to assure you that the situation is not good on perception and it was a failed strategy\n\nKnowing that all these rates have not changed at all and that in light of all those taxes added to all the people did not increase their pricing much, all that happened is a decline in the value of the currency and this has created the gap between the people and the government and its policy","5548161c":"## Economic Freedom World Wide 2016\n#### Economic Freedom of the World measures the degree to which the policies and institutions of countries are supportive of economic freedom.
