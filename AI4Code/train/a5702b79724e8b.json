Great bus connectivity at night too which covers all the part of the city.\n2. There's a bus stop at the far left, most probably outside Barcelona which is a night bus stop.\n3. There are 3 Bus Stations in the city which are correctly placed with almost equivalent areas of the city around them.","ba538f48":"<img src=\"images\/BA.jpg\">\n## Courtesy : Google Maps","4dca351f":"To make it clearer, let's plot day and night bus stops separately.\n# Day and Night Bus Stops","e0a71d13":"Let's see clearly how the density of bus stops is varying using Marginal Histograms.","c236220a":"# Barcelona Bus Stops' Distribution\nNow let's see how bus stops are distributed inside the city of Barcelona.","8b12420a":"So about 26% of the toatal bus stops are operational at night too. This is a great sign as far as odd-times connectivity is concerned!","1c9020e7":"We can see only 2 districts are provided with the Bus stops connecting to the airport\nA quick google search informed me there are 10 districts in Barcelona. Let's look at Barcelona's map.\n","0ea7a8b7":"There are 7 airport bus stops. That means 7 bus stops are used to provide buses to and from the Barcelona airport.","7758eba1":"<img src=\"images\/districts.jpg\">\n## Courtesy : Wikipedia","4c29717b":"So there are 400 bus stops in the district going to various parts of barcelona! After getting off at Eixample people have many bus stops which can go all around barcelona!","4060b609":"The Barcelona airport is located in the Sants-Montjuic district of Barcelona. Let's look in the map!","ae9258c4":"Let's first analyse the column 'Transport' from the dataset. ","d52a8b8b":"Now let's see how bus stops are distributed among the 10 districts.","8d0b579f":"# Inference\nHere we can see, the density is not so strong at a particular district and weak somewhere else. It is well planned. A very huge portion of the city's centre has heavy density of bus stops. We can see there's a heavy density of bus stops from Latitude - [41.375 to 41.425] and Longitude - [2.125 to 2.200], covering almost all of central (highly populated) Barcelona.","31750255":"We can see about 12% of busstops are available in Eixample district. Although the Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi district has highest number of busstops, we can see the district is at extreme left end of the city. Since, Eixample is at the centre, this justifies airport busstops to be built here as well as having 12% of total bus stops in the city!\n\n\nMan! Barcelona seems to be greatly planned!","874c71cb":"So the airport is located in the southernmost part of Barcelona. Now in addition to this, bus stops are provided to Eixample district. The population of the district according to wikipedia is 262,485, the most populous district of Barcelona.\nLet's see how many bus stops does Eixample have!"}}
