The Quality of the wine has a significant difference in its alcohol content. The Higher the Alcohol content, the higher the quality of the wine\n2. The Quality of the wine has a significant difference in its cirtic acid content. The Higher the Citric acid content, the higher the quality of the wine\n3. The rest of the features don't really affect the wine quality that much because most of them are blended and a classification is hard to see.\n\nThe observations make sense. When the wine has a strong punch, they tend to be liked more. When the wine is sweeter and fruity, they tend to be more liked.\n\nFollowing this, we can keep only the alcohol, citric acid features to predict the quality of the wine.","5d70d2c4":"To analyze the rest of the data further, we can use box-and-whisker plots to see how high and low quality wines differ","ca5c71c9":"Looking at the density column, we see that the standard deviation of the values is near 0.
