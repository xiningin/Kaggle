This skews the PCA towards high magnitude features.\n* **Gradient Descent** We can speed up gradient descent by scaling. This is because $\u03b8_{hat}$ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.\n\nAlogrithms tolerant to different scales \n* **Tree based models** are not distance based models and can handle varying ranges of features. Hence, Scaling is not required while modelling trees.\n* **LDA**  and **Naive Bayes** are by design equipped to handle this and gives weights to the features accordingly. Performing a features scaling in these algorithms may not have much effect.\n\nThere are two common ways for feature scaling: min-max scaling and standardization.\n1. MinMax Scaling: (also called normalization) consists of shifting and rescaling values so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1 as follows:\n\n$$ \\frac{x-min}{max-min} $$ \n\n2. Standardization: first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized values always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the standard deviation so that the resulting distribution has unit variance. \n$$\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nwhere \u03bc is the mean value of the feature and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the feature\n\nUnlike min-max scaling, standardization does not bound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algorithms (e.g., neural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1). However, standardization is much less affected by outliers.\n\n\n**PS IMPORTANT** : Scalers must be fitted only on the training data, (not to the whole dataset with the test ssubset).
