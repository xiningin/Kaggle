It seems that the air in India is indeed unhealthly. The avergae PM2.5 value is 251 which puts it in the 'Very Unhealthy' category. The maximum value was 51 at a particluar place which puts it at the 'hazardous' level.\n\n### NO2\nRefer to [this](https:\/\/www3.epa.gov\/airnow\/no2.pdf) link to learn about the acceptable values. The average value is 62. This puts it in the 'moderate' category. The verdict is: \"Individuals who are unusually sensitive to nitrogen dioxide should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion\".\n\n### SO2\nAccording to [this](http:\/\/www.air-quality.org.uk\/04.php) link, in most major cities in UK, the So2 mean values range from 15-20. The mean value from this dataset is 19. The most important sources of SO2 are fossil fuel combustion.\n\n### CO\n[This](https:\/\/www.kidde.com\/home-safety\/en\/us\/support\/help-center\/browse-articles\/articles\/what_are_the_carbon_monoxide_levels_that_will_sound_the_alarm_.aspx) link states that a value of around 50, dosent have any serious effects on healthy adults even with a continuous exposire to upto 8 hours. The maximum at a particular place reached close to 200. This might casue Slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea after two to three hours.\n\n### OZONE\n[This](https:\/\/www.airnow.gov\/index.cfm?action=pubs.aqiguideozone) link has detaits regarding ozone levels. The with the mean value of 54, it is classified as 'moderate'. Unusually sensitive people should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.\n**"}}
