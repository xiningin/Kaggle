It combines multiple weak or average predictors to a build strong predictor.","93e7fd92":"<a id=\"14\"><\/a> <br>\n## 8-6 Naive Bayes\n\nIt is a classification technique based on Bayes\u2019 theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, a naive Bayes classifier would consider all of these properties to independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple.","e1d15dd7":"<a id=\"7\"><\/a> <br>\n## 7- Prepare Train and Test\n\nscikit-learn provides a helpful function for partitioning data, train_test_split, which splits out your data into a training set and a test set.\n\nTraining and test usually is 70% for training and 30% for test\n\n- Training set for fitting the model\n- Test set for evaluation only","b2bcefba":"<a id=\"25\"><\/a> <br>\n## 8-17 Linear Discriminant Analysis\n\nA classifier with a linear decision boundary, generated by fitting class conditional densities to the data and using Bayes\u2019 rule.\n\nThe model fits a Gaussian density to each class, assuming that all classes share the same covariance matrix.\n\nThe fitted model can also be used to reduce the dimensionality of the input by projecting it to the most discriminative directions.","60fb82ce":"<a id=\"11\"><\/a> <br>\n## 8-3 RandomForest\n\nRandom Forest is a trademark term for an ensemble of decision trees.

It is a classification not a regression algorithm. It is used to estimate discrete values ( Binary values like 0\/1, yes\/no, true\/false ) based on given set of independent variable(s). In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function. Hence, it is also known as logit regression. Since, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).","6a99f485":"<a id=\"22\"><\/a> <br>\n## 8-14 Bagging classifier \n\n Bagging classifier is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base classifiers each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction.

Unless there is some substantive reason for setting radius to some value, it is best to treat it like any other hyperparameter and tune it during model selection. The second useful parameter is outlier_label, which indicates what label to give an observation that has no observations within the radius - which itself can often be a useful tool for identifying outliers.\n","7e2385cc":"####  **I hope you find this kernel helpful and some <font color=\"red\"><b>UPVOTES<\/b><\/font> would be very much appreciated**","be83fc8a":"<a id=\"5\"><\/a> <br>\n## 5- Load Data","76068991":"<a id='top'><\/a>\n## <div style=\"text-align: center\">Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn  <\/div>\n\nScikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.

In this case, the label with the highest probability is returned by model.predict().\n**model.score()** : for classification or regression problems, most (all?) estimators implement a score method. Scores are between 0 and 1, with a larger score indicating a better fit.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n#### Available in unsupervised estimators\n\n**model.predict()** : predict labels in clustering algorithms.\n**model.transform()** : given an unsupervised model, transform new data into the new basis. This also accepts one argument X_new, and returns the new representation of the data based on the unsupervised model.\n**model.fit_transform()** : some estimators implement this method, which more efficiently performs a fit and a transform on the same input data.","5f691b36":"<a id=\"top\"><\/a> <br>\n## Notebook  Content\n\n1.

However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases by a majority vote of its k neighbors. The case being assigned to the class is most common amongst its K nearest neighbors measured by a distance function.","af07799c":"<a id=\"16\"><\/a> <br>\n## 8-8 Nu-Support Vector Classification\n\nSimilar to SVC but uses a parameter to control the number of support vectors.\n\nThe implementation is based on libsvm."}}
