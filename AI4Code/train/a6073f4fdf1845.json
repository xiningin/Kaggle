differences regarding athletic performance measures and injury occurrence on various surface types (Meyers and Barnhill, 2004; Powell and Schootman, 1992). Recent studies have specifically examined synthetic turf (Mack et al., 2018; Loughran et al., 2019). These observational studies only show a\u00a0correlation\u00a0in injury rate-- they don\u2019t make assertions about the specific\u00a0mechanisms\u00a0associated with lower body injury. My analysis attempts to find a specific link between a movement pattern and NC injury. Once I\u2019ve identified a movement pattern link, can I find a measurable difference in that  movement pattern between playing surfaces (synthetic turf vs. natural turf)?\n\nMy analysis is based on data that the NFL has provided with the full player tracking of on-field position for 250 players over two regular season schedules. Of the 250 players provided, one hundred of them sustained one or more injuries during the study period. The other 150 serve as a control group (representing a sample of the non-injured NFL population).\nAt first look, it\u2019s provocative to note that, within the data set provided, there are numerically more NC injuries on synthetic turf. I hope to go beyond this purely observational approach, though, by also finding\u00a0mechanisms\u00a0associated with these injuries.","9e45ffa9":"## Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nSo there you have it. I've shown that high lateral movements have a strong relationship with injury plays. I've also shown that there isn't a relationship between playing surface and lateral movement. Because of that we can't conclude that turf type plays a role in increasing this specific type of high risk movement.\n\nGiven my findings I have the following suggestions for the NFL:\n1. Monitor the percentage of lateral movement of players during game play and provide summary statistics on players, and play types. This could be integrated into already existing monitoring protocols.\n2. Increase the quality of the orientation data. If possible include it to monitor the orientation of players\u2019 hips, shoulders and head. I also suggest  collecting data that might elucidate the link between playing surface and injuries: player cleat data and dampness of playing surface could be a place to start.\n3. Allow strength and conditioning coaches to play a role in injury prevention by educating them about the link between lateral movement and injuries for Linebackers, Wide Receivers and Defensive backs. They may be able to use data that I\u2019ve suggested  they develop individualized workout plans.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my analysis.","d508aa83":"# Appendix\n\n## Details of Regression analysis\n\nExpand the cell below to see the full details of the regression model.","a5a7469c":"# Computing the Orientation-Movement Angle\n\nDefensive backs and Linebackers have responsibilities to track offensive players- they\u2019re mirroring quick directional movements. As compared to their offensive opponents, they aren\u2019t putting a lot of forethought into their path. Could this be placing statistically more strain on their knees and ankles? Wide receivers make quick movements down field and then make cuts in their routes to create space between themselves and defenders. Could lateral movements during their \u201ccut\u201d moments be an underlying factor in their NC injuries?\n\nIn this video clip, you can see the movements of Derrick Johnson moments before he tears his achilles tendon. He\u2019s almost exclusively moving sideways before he goes down. This gave me an idea of what to focus on in the data.\n\n![](https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/XDErlBCeSQ8TFsRx6n\/giphy.gif)","d699a100":"# No evidence to support a link between playing surface and lateral movement\n\nPrevious observational studies have shown a link between injury and playing surface. My analysis for this report identifies an association between NC injuries and lateral movement during game play. Now I wonder: is there a measurable difference between time spent in lateral movement based  on playing surface? My hypothesis would be that, if players gain more traction when interacting with a type of turf, then I will observe a difference in lateral movement (and therefore a difference in NC injuries) on that turf.\n\nOne of the most straightforward ways to test my hypothesis is to examine the distribution of Orientation-Movement angles over plays on Natural and Synthetic playing surfaces. When I compared these distributions, I couldn't visually see any difference between turf type and the time spent in specific Orientation-Movement angles. To test if these distributions are different I calculated the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on 2 samples. Since this statistic is very small (0.0096) then I cannot reject the hypothesis that the distributions of the two samples are the same.","ec2213c7":"# Data Cleaning and Standardizing the Orientation Feature\n\nIt was noted in the data description that the orientation feature may not be completely reliable when considering \"geography\". I have some experience working with the NGS data in the 2019 Big Data Bowl. During that competition, it was found that the orientation was shifted 90 degrees for one of the seasons' data. To correct for this orientation difference, I determined the plays which appeared to be shifted and standardized them as to be consistent with the direction feature. This approach was first shared by John Miller in his [kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jpmiller\/how-to-adjust-orientation).\n\nWhile not perfect, I believe these corrections and standardization techniques are appropriate for the purposes of my analysis. As the NFL continues to collect tracking data, I'm sure the quality of the orientation feature will increase, strengthing the quality of similar analyses.  \n\nNext, I verified that the orientation was reasonable by plotting orientation at the moment of ball snap for all players. As you would expect, most players were facing towards the line of scrimmage at this time.\n\nI also did some cleaning to the NGS data in order to hone in on moments of gameplay. I removed the portion of NGS data not associated with play time (0.1 second prior to the ball snap up until the moment of the final \"event\" in the play). I also capped play length to 25 seconds in order to exclude outliers.\n\nLastly, I computed some features to the NGS data later in my analysis, including the time since the snap and acceleration (difference in speed over 0.1 second). I also added binary indicators to the tracking data for plays involving injured players and plays involving an injury.","af445b8a":"# Lateral Movement During Plays is Linked to Injury\nAfter looking at the data, it was clear to me that one factor closely linked to player injury was the amount of time during a play that he spent in lateral movement.","e93dd66b":"This model wasn\u2019t created for its predictive power, but rather as  an attempt to quantify the impact of each feature and its statistical significance. The R-squared value is quite low, however we can still gain insights from the model. The main insights are as follows:\n1. The position type (Defensive Back, Linebacker, or Wide Receiver) has the strongest relationship with lateral movement.\n2. Injury Play is also a strong indicator, this supports our analysis above.\n3. Synthetic playing surface  demonstrated a (weakly) negative relationship with amount of lateral movement. Simply put, with all things taken into account synthetic turf decreases the percent of time spent in lateral movement by roughly 0.4%\n\nTo quickly summarize: My analysis shows we are not able to prove that there is a substantial link between playing surface and the amount of lateral movement of an athlete during a play.","cf38a788":"When we look closer at the lateral movement by position, I found this relationship between lateral movement and injury is found across all three of my focus positions (Wide Receivers, Linebackers and Defensive Backs).","bfab3857":"# Analysis of movement category over duration of play\n\nI found it useful to visualize the percentage of time a given position spends using each of these three movement categories during a play. Wide Receivers in our dataset tend to move forward right after the snap use lateral movement and backpedaling 2 to 3 seconds after the play. Defensive Backs spend much of the beginning of a play backpedaling and then quickly change to lateral or forward movement. Linebackers appear to have a mix of all three types of movements with a slight decrease in forward movement around 2-3 seconds after the snap.","1a5c5090":"With these findings in mind, I decided to focus my analysis on\u00a0**Defensive Backs, Linebackers, and Wide Receivers during rushing and passing plays**. Narrowing the scope of my analysis allows me to clearly identify player movements that involve high risk of injury for these positions and play types while removing the \"noise\" of plays and positions that have very different movement patterns. ","520354c2":"I also compared the differences of time spent in lateral movement by field type. I broke down the percentages by positions in a similar manner to how I compared injury plays to non-injury plays. I found more commonalities than differences. The difference for each position  were all less than 1%.","ab7ab2ad":"# Focusing on the players and plays at high risk\n\nIt\u2019s intuitive, and quickly reveals itself in the data that certain players are at higher risk than others when it comes to NC lower body injuries. Among  the 100+ injuries from  the 2 seasons of game play, 70% (74\/105) were sustained by just three positions (Defensive Backs, Linebackers and Wide Receivers). When thinking about why these positions might be at higher risk, I envisioned the movements commonly made by these players. I was struck by the fact that these men are spending a lot of time moving in open space and making quick changes in direction.","58c2cc54":"# Playing Surface Analysis\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZsERLAT.png)\n## Lateral movement and increased injury risk.\n\nThis report contains my analysis for the 2019 NFL 1st and Future competition. The competition tasked data scientists to investigate the relationship between the playing surface and the injury and performance of National Football League (NFL) athletes and to examine factors that may contribute to lower extremity injuries.\n\nI propose a metric for measuring the angle between athlete's body orientation and movement direction. I categorize player movements into three groups: forward, lateral, and backpedaling. I find that increased lateral player movement is strongly correlated with plays involving non-contact (NC) lower limb injuries. I then look to see if we can find a measurable link between increased lateral movement and playing surface.\nI then propose a hypothesis that if injury rate is linked to playing surface, then we may see a link between playing surface and lateral movement. My findings show that there is no link between lateral movement and playing surface.\n\nLast, I offer three suggestions that I believe may help to identify players at high risk of injuries: 1) Monitor the percentage of lateral movement of players during game play and provide summary statistics on players, and play types. This could be integrated into already existing monitoring protocols.  2) Monitor  the orientation of players\u2019 hips, shoulders and head.
