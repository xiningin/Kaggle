Higher police records for Male group and black group overlap with overall high police records.  For 'white' group it is less clear. Highest police records for 'white' group are in regions where overall police record are highest in the region.  \n5. From series of choropleths and correlation maps, total police records has strong postive correlation with black race population, education up to highschool only, poverty rate, and population with age up to 14.  \n6. Police districts nicely cluster together into 2 group. Group 0 is C1, B2, B3, D4 and D14. Rest in group 1. Group0 is characterised by total police records with strong positive correlation with hispanic race and black race population, less education and population with age upto 14. Group1 is characterised by very strong positive correlation with asian race, renter occupied housing units.  \n7. White, female, asian, native american groups have higher population % than police records % accross the police districts.  \n8.
