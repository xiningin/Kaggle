Its name stems from the notion that it is a \"SciKit\" (SciPy Toolkit), a separately-developed and distributed third-party extension to SciPy. The original codebase was later rewritten by other developers. In 2010 Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent Michel, all from INRIA took leadership of the project and made the first public release on February the 1st 2010.Of the various scikits, scikit-learn as well as scikit-image were described as \"well-maintained and popular\" in November 2012.","78da5fbb":"The same data can be used for plotting a bar chart as follows","9762e984":"Let's go ahead with a pie chart now, For this purpose we are building a piechart for both the female and male population of canada for the year of 2013","c427b12d":"### Data Visualisation is an important aspect of data science. Why? \nBecause data scientists deal with humongous amounts of data. And it becomes easier to understand the data if we can see it visually and dig deeper.\nFor this sole purpose, Python has the matplotlib package to generate simple and interactive visualisations. Let's start using matplotlib to extract information from data. \nFor this purpose, We will be using the [WHO_SUICIDE_STATISTICS dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/szamil\/who-suicide-statistics) that captures the number of suicides per age group of several countries over 1990-2017.
