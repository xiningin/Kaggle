It gets value between -1 and 1. If its close to 0, it means no connection about these two veriable. If its close to +1, it means positive correlation, so these two have direct proportion.

The easiest and basic plots are line, scatter and histogram plots.\n* Line plot is better when x axis is time.\n* Scatter is better when there is correlation between two variables\n* Histogram is better when we need to see distribution of numerical data.\n* Customization: Colors,labels,thickness of line, title, opacity, grid, figsize, ticks of axis and linestyle  "}}
