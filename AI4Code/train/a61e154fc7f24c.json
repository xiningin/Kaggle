For example, if we\u2019d like to reduce an array with a particular\noperation, we can use the reduce method of any ufunc. A reduce repeatedly applies a\ngiven operation to the elements of an array until only a single result remains.\nFor example, calling reduce on the add ufunc returns the sum of all elements in the\narray:","5e89683c":"* Notice that N split points lead to N + 1 subarrays.

In NumPy,\nBoolean masking is often the most efficient way to accomplish these types of tasks.","7280cd20":"* Broadcasting is simply a\nset of rules for applying binary ufuncs (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) on\narrays of different sizes.","0953853d":"<a id=\"17\"><\/a> <br>\n### Advanced Ufunc Features","c44575cd":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a> <br>\n### NumPy Array Attributes","903d8c28":"<a id=\"43\"><\/a> <br>\n#### One-dimensional subarrays","390c91ba":"<a id=\"12\"><\/a> <br>\n### Exploring NumPy\u2019s UFuncs","616c10b7":"<a id=\"30\"><\/a> <br>\n### Broadcasting example 3"}}
