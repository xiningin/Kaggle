Like **`layer_forward`** calculates **H** using **W**, **H_prev** and **b**, **`layer_backward`** uses **dH** to calculate **dW**, **dH_prev** and **db**. You have already studied the formulae in backpropogation. To calculate **dZ**, use the **`sigmoid_backward`** and **`relu_backward`** function.

","a8aa0e3e":"### initialize_parameters\nLet's now create a function **`initialize_parameters`** which initializes the weights and biases of the various layers. One way to initialise is to set all the parameters to 0. This is not a considered a good strategy as all the neurons will behave the same way and it'll defeat the purpose of deep networks. Hence, we initialize the weights randomly to very small values but not zeros. The biases are initialized to 0. Note that the **`initialize_parameters`** function initializes the parameters for all the layers in one `for` loop. \n\nThe inputs to this function is a list named `dimensions`. The length of the list is the number layers in the network + 1 (the plus one is for the input layer, rest are hidden + output). The first element of this list is the dimensionality or length of the input (784 for the MNIST dataset). The rest of the list contains the number of neurons in the corresponding (hidden and output) layers.\n\nFor example `dimensions = [784, 3, 7, 10]` specifies a network for the MNIST dataset with two hidden layers and a 10-dimensional softmax output.\n\nAlso, notice that the parameters are returned in a dictionary. This will help you in implementing the feedforward through the layer and the backprop throught the layer at once.","c24690bf":"# Parameter Updates\n\nNow that we have calculated the gradients. let's do the last step which is updating the weights and biases.","eed15f86":"In this assignment, you'll implement an L-layered deep neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset.
