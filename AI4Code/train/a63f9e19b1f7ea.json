It's not super important to understand all the activation fuctions for this notebook, but is recommened that you learn what they are and how they are used. The first layer needs to always have the parameter input_shape. We can look up at where we used the shape method to find out what it is. The shape is listed as (891,7), we are going to be inputing the classes so the input_shape is (7,). WE also implement a method called dropout. In a nutshell it turns off random nuerons while training to avoid overfitting. Using the parameter (0.2), we are telling it to turn off 20 percent of the nuerons.","d9059703":"## Now lets add our output layer. We have 2 classes or outcomes from this dead or alive (1 or 0), so we specify that to the layer. We are using a softmax activation to classify passenger survival. Softmax will return a probabilty for each outcome and we will pick the highest probabilty as our prediction.   ","e44aae87":"## Check it out.","49d2344e":"## For our next 2 cells we are going to be transforming the csv files into Panda datasets. After we load them into a Panda, we will use the head() method to check that the files were loaded properly. ","5b38bf03":"## For our next cell we are going to use the LabelEncoder. I could have imported this above fully using \"from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\", but I want to also show another way to access it. We imported preprocessing already so we can access this method with dot notation. First thing we need to do is find out what columns are Categorical (needs to be labeled), and then find out what columns are Numerical. We can do this by simply looking up at the table we printed a few cells above. For label encoding we want our categorical columns(anything that is not an int or float), so we have (\"Name\", \"Sex\", \"Cabin\", \"Embarked\"). We don't want Name or Cabin to be in the final training set so we wont bother labeling them.","74572002":"## Now this is where we make the magic happen. We will rejoin that encoded data back into our regular testing and training set. But when we do we are only going to take the columns we want (everything but Name, Cabin, and Ticket), and we already did all the work to make that happen!","78ea6280":"## Awesome! Everything looks like it has loaded properly. So we want to get rid of some of this data as it has little impact on our model and could even ruin our model entirely. Columns that have too many unique values or missing values are going to be of little to no use to us. There is a method to return all the unique values in a column, but we are just going to use common sense here and say we dont want the columns (\"Name\", \"Cabin\", \"Ticket\"). These are all columns that will have little to no impact on our models accuracy and even worse could overfit the data making it seem like it performs really well on our validation set but then performs poorly on our test set or in the real world. This is because the model will start learning the unique variable(such as name) and give them too heavy a weight while training. (ex. model learning Mr. Owen Harris is always dead doesnt help it predict that a new person introduced to the model survived or perished). We can achieve this by using the drop() method but we will be excluding them in a different way which I will explain in a little bit. ","da7aa7b4":"## Thats not what we want! Remember how I said Softmax will return a probabilty for each answer. Well we need to take the one with the highest probability and make that our prediciton. We will do this with the argmax() method. ","60c92682":"## Time to fit(train) our model! We pass in our X and y data we made earlier. Our batch size is going to be 1 since we arent looking at more than 1 passenger at a time. Epochs is the number of training cycles it will go through. We will split off 20 percent of our data for validation. You can change verbose to 1 if you want to watch the training in action. I find it exciting, but I am sure others feel like they are watching paint dry if they try to do so. ","5ca7847a":"## Lets see what our new data looks like.","5371b3af":"## And the testing one.","d6c2ac3b":"## Now time to build our model! We are going to build a sequential model. This is where you can build a model from scratch. I know this is a beginner tutorial, but we wont make this too complicated. Let us start by defining the model variable. ","3c53913a":"## Here we set our variables to the path of the file you want to use for training and the final set of testing data. With Kaggle competitions it is labeled to let you know what file is what pretty easily. If you dont have the files you will need to add them. You can do this by clicking the blue link that says \"+ Add Data\" in the top right of the sidebar and searching for Titanic Competiton. Once added, you can also get the link by extending the data option on the side bar and clicking the file you want the path to. You should then be able to see it at the bottom of your notebook and copy and paste it.","e1fc79b5":"## When we go to actually encode our labels we will get thrown an error saying that Embarked is not of type str, but only for the training dataset and not the testing one. That's weird! Well that is a very easy fix with the .astype() method! So we will take the column from our training panda and transform it into a column of strings with this line of code below.","b100bbdb":"## Uh, oh! Looks like our column labels are gone! And so is our index label! This is fine, I am going to leave the index labels as they dont matter as much but we do need to reset the column labels.

","e9a1c65f":"## Time to compile all those layers together and build the model! We need to define our loss mesurement, our optimizer, and our measure of accuracy. There are many different options for these and you should absolutely play around with them. Adam is considered one of the best optimizers and your metrics for accuracy will always depend on your model and the data it is predicting. ","90871695":"## Looks like our data is not quite ready yet. There are many options here. We can ditch the column age, but we dont like losing all that data. We could fill it with 0, but we dont want it to throw our data off too much so lets go ahead and use imputation to fill these values in. Imputation allows you to fill in values with values such as the mean on all the ages in the list. That seems like the best bet for keeping the model accurate. \n\n## We will define the imputer and transform our data sets here in the same cell.","c715fb0e":"## IGNORE We will turn them into panda DF's again, reset the columns, and check to see if they look correct.","2ddc88d5":"## Now lets use that model we just built to make predictions!

We will be building a Sequential Model using the Keras library that was added into Tensorflow recently(Yay!), with dropout implemented to combat any sort of overfitting.

Because we are training our model that the column \"sex\" is just 1s and 0s, and when we go to make predictions it wont be able to connect that \"male\" is 0 or \"female\" is 1.
