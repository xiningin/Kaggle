","a5832080":"In this approach, we add a meta-model on averaged base models and use the out-of-folds predictions of these base models to train our meta-model. \n\nThe procedure, for the training part, may be described as follows:\n\n\n1. Split the total training set into two disjoint sets (here **train** and .**holdout** )\n\n2. Train several base models on the first part (**train**)\n\n3. Test these base models on the second part (**holdout**)\n\n4. Use the predictions from 3)  (called  out-of-folds predictions) as the inputs, and the correct responses (target variable) as the outputs  to train a higher level learner called **meta-model**.\n\nThe first three steps are done iteratively . If we take for example a 5-fold stacking , we first split the training data into 5 folds. Then we will do 5 iterations. In each iteration,  we train every base model on 4 folds and predict on the remaining fold (holdout fold). \n\nSo, we will be sure, after 5 iterations , that the entire data is used to get out-of-folds predictions that we will then use as \nnew feature to train our meta-model in the step 4.\n\nFor the prediction part , We average the predictions of  all base models on the test data  and used them as **meta-features**  on which, the final prediction is done with the meta-model.\n","9ab0c699":"- **Exterior1st and Exterior2nd** : Again Both Exterior 1 & 2 have only one missing value.
