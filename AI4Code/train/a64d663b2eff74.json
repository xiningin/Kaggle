Import dataset\n2. Copy & rename packages\n3. Install\n\nThanks to this discussion by Chris Deotte: [How to Install Without Internet](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/severstal-steel-defect-detection\/discussion\/113195)\n\nBeginners note:\n- Be careful when installing hydra from internet - `pip install hydra` will result installing unintended package. Use `pip install hydra-core`. \n- Don't use `.yml` for file extensions - hydra only recognize `.yaml`.","46e93704":"# 1.

Copy & rename packages\n\nNotice:\nDue to the Kaggle Dataset's design, `*tar.gz` will be uncompressed when creating dataset.\nI didn't want the package to be uncompressed (For easier installation). \n\nTo prevent being uncompressed, I renamed `*.tar.gz` into `*tar.gz.tmp` before creating dataset. \n\nThus you need to rename `*tar.gz.tmp` into `*tar.gz` back before `pip install`.","340581fc":"# 3.
