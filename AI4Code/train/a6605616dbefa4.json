This is given by the fact that there are many ok players (0 kills) and a few really good consistent players. However, first I want to look into the rest of the individual features I mentioned above before moving on to group stats since there may be some interesting patterns lurking about.","dcdcd11b":"# Background\n\nPlayerUnknowns Battleground (Pubg) is a game where 100 playes drop onto a deserted island alone, with a partner, or with three others and seek to be the final one(s) standing. The goal is to predict the likelihood an individual will win based on a variety of statistics. \n\nThe features as taken from the compeition's data page is:\n* **DBNOs** - Number of enemy players knocked.\n* **assists** - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.\n* **boosts** - Number of boost items used.\n* **damageDealt** - Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n* **headshotKills** - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n* **heals** - Number of healing items used.\n* **Id** - Player\u2019s Id\n* **killPlace** - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n* **killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a \u201cNone\u201d.\n* **killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n* **kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n* **longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n* **matchDuration** - Duration of match in seconds.\n* **matchId** - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n* **matchType** - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are \u201csolo\u201d, \u201cduo\u201d, \u201csquad\u201d, \u201csolo-fpp\u201d, \u201cduo-fpp\u201d, and \u201csquad-fpp\u201d; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n* **rankPoints** - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API\u2019s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of \u201cNone\u201d.\n* **revives** - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* **rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n* **roadKills** - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n* **swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n* **teamKills** - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n* **vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n* **walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n* **weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n* **winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a \u201cNone\u201d.\n* **groupId** - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n* **numGroups** - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n* **maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n* **winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.\n\nI will be breaking up this into a three part series with Part 1 (this notebook) investigating the features individually. Part 2 will look at the groups, and finally, Part 3 will involve the modeling and predictions.
