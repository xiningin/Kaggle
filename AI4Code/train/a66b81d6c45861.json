With each day new restaurants opening the industry has\u2019nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day.\n\nThis Zomato data aims at analysing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating for the place.The data is accurate to that available on the zomato website until 15 March 2019. The data was scraped from Zomato in two phase. After going through the structure of the website I found that for each neighborhood there are 6-7 category of restaurants viz. Buffet, Cafes, Delivery, Desserts, Dine-out, Drinks & nightlife, Pubs and bars.","095e5bf8":"* Only the variable `votes` is read as an integer, remaining 16 columns are read as objects","0c091a81":"* Most of the highly rated restaurants (rating more than 4.0) provide an option of booking table","bdd3faec":"## Online Order\n- Analysing based on availability of online order ","816d0120":"* Most of the restaurants are located in **BTM** followed by **Kormangala 5th Block**\n* **Bellandur** has lowest number of restaurants (in Top 10).","2d4730dc":"## Restaurant Listed in\n- Lets see to in which area most of the restaurants are listed in or deliver to","bcd77245":"* Restaurants with online order facility has inverse relationship with average cost of two.\n* Restaurants which provide an option of booking table in advance has a high average cost.","07db0fc3":"# Exploratory Data Analysis of Zomato Data","510f449c":"A violin plot plays a similar role as a box and whisker plot.
