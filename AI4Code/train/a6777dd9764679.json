What is a normal probability plot\n\nand possibly more...\n\nThe answers to these questions are simple. One can easily understand those by studying about the formulae of the corresponding distributions and then relating those with the analysis done in this notebook. For example, it would be wise to know the formula of the exponential distribution, and then try answering the first question. That way, the knowledge persists with a little settlement with the hardwork on my part.","cf9f72b2":"***2. Normal distribution?***","5681bea8":"***More the IQR, more is the spread of the data.
