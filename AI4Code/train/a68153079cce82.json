You are encouraged to do thorough analysis!\n\nLet's load the data using `pandas` and have a look at the generated `DataFrame`.","b74a2f00":"## Submission File Generation\n\nWe have built a model and we'd like to submit our predictions on the test set! In order to do that, we'll load the test set, predict the class and save the submission file. \n\nFirst, we'll load the data.","88fd7175":"The remaining steps is to submit the generated file and are as follows. \n\n1. Press `Save Version` on the upper right corner of this notebook.\n2. Write a `Version Name` of your choice and choose `Save & Run All (Commit)` then click `Save`.\n3. Wait for the saved notebook to finish running the go to the saved notebook.\n4. Scroll down until you see the output files then select the `submission.csv` file and click `Submit`.\n\nNow your submission will be evaluated and your score will be updated on the leaderboard!

We hope you enjoy and learn as much as we did prepairing this competition.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the competition, it's required to predict the `Severity` of a car crash given info about the crash, e.g., location.\n\nThis is the getting started notebook. Things are kept simple so that it's easier to understand the steps and modify it.\n\nFeel free to `Fork` this notebook and share it with your modifications **OR** use it to create your submissions.\n\n### Prerequisites\nYou should know how to use python and a little bit of Machine Learning. You can apply the techniques you learned in the training program and submit the new solutions! \n\n### Checklist\nYou can participate in this competition the way you perefer. However, I recommend following these steps if this is your first time joining a competition on Kaggle.\n\n* Fork this notebook and run the cells in order.\n* Submit this solution.\n* Make changes to the data processing step as you see fit.\n* Submit the new solutions.\n\n*You can submit up to 5 submissions per day. You can select only one of the submission you make to be considered in the final ranking.*\n\n\nDon't hesitate to leave a comment or contact me if you have any question!","36d153c5":"## Import the libraries\n\nWe'll use `pandas` to load and manipulate the data. Other libraries will be imported in the relevant sections.","33cdf4a3":"Well. That's a good start, right? A classifier that predicts all examples' `Severity` as 2 will get around 0.63.

DO NOT forget to change this step as you change the preprocessing of the training data.**","8b7094cd":"## Model Training\n\nLet's train a model with the data!

Typically the dataset is split into 3 subsets, namely, the training, validation and test sets. In our case, the test set is already predefined. So we'll split the \"training\" set into training and validation sets with 0.8:0.2 ratio. \n\n*Note: a good way to generate reproducible results is to set the seed to the algorithms that depends on randomization. This is done with the argument `random_state` in the following command* ","ee6d3359":"## Conclusion\n\nIn this notebook, we have demonstrated the essential steps that one should do in order to get \"slightly\" familiar with the data and the submission process. We chose not to go into details in each step to keep the welcoming notebook simple and make a room for improvement.\n\nYou're encourged to `Fork` the notebook, edit it, add your insights and use it to create your submission.","429f726a":"We've got 6407 examples in the dataset with 14 featues, 1 ID, and the `Severity` of the crash.\n\nBy looking at the features and a sample from the data, the features look of numerical and catogerical types. What about some descriptive statistics?","ef158ab7":"Now we're ready to generate the submission file. The submission file needs the columns `ID` and `Severity` only.","e8b4d511":"The output shows desciptive statistics for the numerical features, `Lat`, `Lng`, `Distance(mi)`, and `Severity`. I'll use the numerical features to demonstrate how to train the model and make submissions. **However you shouldn't use the numerical features only to make the final submission if you want to make it to the top of the leaderboard.**"}}
