At the national level, the people of Pakistan elect a bicameral legislature, the Parliament of Pakistan. The parliament consists of a lower house called the National Assembly, which is elected directly, and an upper house called the Senate, whose members are chosen by elected provincial legislators. The head of government, the Prime Minister, is elected by the majority members of the National Assembly and the head of state (and figurehead), the President, is elected by the Electoral College, which consists of both houses of Parliament together with the four provincial assemblies. In addition to the national parliament and the provincial assemblies, Pakistan also has more than five thousand elected local governments.\n\nIn this document the Statistical analysis and Visualization is performed to get the insights of available data of Pakistani Election from 1970 to 2018","c9357bc7":"# Calculate average turnout of election of 10 Elections using group by.","f7594841":"# Then plot mean median and mode of election turn out on the histogram of election turnout","a16a7a87":"# Write your analysis in paragraph on the chart prepared above to explain how turn out increases or decrease over the period.\n\n\nElections overall results depends on the turnout of votes, with the time, we can see from Turn over the number of Votes increasded as it is directly propotional to population growth, but since it shows the improvement that valid vote counts also incread while decreasing of reject votes.\nFrom the above diageram we can see that the average Turn of single election including all the province and NAs decreases from 1970 till 1997 but after that it changed it's behaviour and  started to increase ( keep in mind that with the same election system the valid count also increased which triggers the alarms...), The graph behaviour predicts that in next election Average Turnout will also decreased to the Total average line but after that in the next elections it will increase"}}
