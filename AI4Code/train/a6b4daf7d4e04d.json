Make the first heatmap to see how the average number of votes of males is varying across the genres. Use seaborn heatmap for this analysis. The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for males, i.e., `CVotesU18M`,`CVotes1829M`, `CVotes3044M`, and `CVotes45AM`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-male group. \n\n2.

The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-female group. \n\n3.

We will extensively use these columns for the third and the final stage of our assignment wherein we will analyse the voters across all demographics and also see how these vary across various genres. So without further ado, let's get started with `demographic analysis`.","c41375b9":"- ### Subtask 2.4: Find the Most Popular Trios - I\n\nIf we are a producer looking to make a blockbuster movie, there will primarily be three lead roles in the movie and we wish to cast the most popular actors for it. Now, since we don't want to take a risk, you will cast a trio which has already acted in together in a movie before. The metric that we've chosen to check the popularity is the Facebook likes of each of these actors.\n\nOur objective is to find the trios which has the most number of Facebook likes combined. That is, the sum of `actor_1_facebook_likes`, `actor_2_facebook_likes` and `actor_3_facebook_likes` should be maximum.\nWe find out the top 5 popular trios, and output their names in a list.\n","5f2b975c":"**`Inferences:`** Sci-Fi appears to be the highest rated genre in the age group of U18 for both males and females. Also, females in this age group have rated it a bit higher than the males in the same age group. Additionally,\n- Inference 1: *`Romance`* is the worst rated genre by both male and female with age 45 & above. In fact, as we can see from the pattern, the Avg rating decreases through age (U18, U1829, U3044, U45A) for both male and female age groups\n- Inference 2: `Animation` movies are highest rated by 18-29 females while `Sci-Fi` are the highest rated by 18-29 males\n- Inference 3: `Crime` movies are rated higher by U18 males compared to U18 females","b7ec75d6":"These kids are watching `Deadpool` a lot.","bb84f0aa":"-  ###  Subtask 3.4: US vs non-US Cross Analysis\n\nThe dataset contains both the US and non-US movies. Let's analyse how both the US and the non-US voters have responded to the US and the non-US movies.\n\n1. Create a column `IFUS` in the dataframe `movies`. The column `IFUS` should contain the value \"USA\" if the `Country` of the movie is \"USA\". For all other countries other than the USA, `IFUS` should contain the value `non-USA`.\n\n\n2. Now make a boxplot that shows how the number of votes from the US people i.e. `CVotesUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Make use of the column `IFUS` to make this plot. Similarly, make another subplot that shows how non US voters have voted for the US and non-US movies by plotting `CVotesnUS` for both the US and non-US movies. Write any of your two inferences\/observations from these plots.\n\n\n3. Again do a similar analysis but with the ratings. Make a boxplot that shows how the ratings from the US people i.e. `VotesUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Similarly, make another subplot that shows how `VotesnUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Write any of your two inferences\/observations from these plots.\n\nNote : Use `movies` dataframe for this subtask.","2406460e":"Can we spot the movie `Tangled` in the dataset? Although its one of the highest grossing movies of all time, it has negative profit as per this result. If we cross check the gross values of this movie (link: https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0398286\/), we can see that the gross in the dataset accounts only for the domestic gross and not the worldwide gross.

Let's add a small condition to it and make sure that all three actors are popular. The condition is **none of the three actors' Facebook likes should be less than half of the other two**. For example, the following is a valid combo:\n- actor_1_facebook_likes: 70000\n- actor_2_facebook_likes: 40000\n- actor_3_facebook_likes: 50000\n\nBut the below one is not:\n- actor_1_facebook_likes: 70000\n- actor_2_facebook_likes: 40000\n- actor_3_facebook_likes: 30000\n\nsince in this case, `actor_3_facebook_likes` is 30000, which is less than half of `actor_1_facebook_likes`.\n\nHaving this condition ensures that we aren't getting any unpopular actor in your trio (since the total likes calculated in the previous question doesn't tell anything about the individual popularities of each actor in the trio.).\n\nWe can do a manual inspection of the top 5 popular trios you have found in the previous subtask and check how many of those trios satisfy this condition. Also, which is the most popular trio after applying the condition above?","133e6f26":"-  ###  Subtask 3.1 Combine the Dataframe by Genres\n\nThere are 3 columns in the dataframe - `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3`. As a part of this subtask, we need to aggregate a few values over these 3 columns. \n1. First,we create a new dataframe `df_by_genre` that contains `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` and all the columns related to **CVotes\/Votes** from the `movies` data frame. There are 47 columns to be extracted in total.\n2. Now, Add a column called `cnt` to the dataframe `df_by_genre` and initialize it to one.\n3. First group the dataframe `df_by_genre` by `genre_1` and find the sum of all the numeric columns such as `cnt`, columns related to CVotes and Votes columns and store it in a dataframe `df_by_g1`.\n4. Perform the same operation for `genre_2` and `genre_3` and store it dataframes `df_by_g2` and `df_by_g3` respectively. \n5. Now that you have 3 dataframes performed by grouping over `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` separately, it's time to combine them. For this, add the three dataframes and store it in a new dataframe `df_add`, so that the corresponding values of Votes\/CVotes get added for each genre.\n6. The column `cnt` on aggregation has basically kept the track of the number of occurences of each genre.Subset the genres that have atleast 10 movies into a new dataframe `genre_top10` based on the `cnt` column value.\n7. Now, take the mean of all the numeric columns by dividing them with the column value `cnt` and store it back to the same dataframe. We will be using this dataframe for further analysis in this task unless it is explicitly mentioned to use the dataframe `movies`.\n8. Since the number of votes can't be a fraction, type cast all the CVotes related columns to integers. Also, round off all the Votes related columns upto two digits after the decimal point.\n"}}
