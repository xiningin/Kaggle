While some parts of the world are shut down in uncertainty, it was said that Netflix gained 16 millions new sign-ups last year. Netflix reached 203.7 million subscribers in January 2021.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to analyze the data of movies and TV shows available on Netflix, based on the dataset I found on Kaggle\u200a-\u200aNetflix Movies and TV Shows by Shivam Bansal. Data wrangling and visualization are done with the help of **Microsoft Excel**.\n\nThis dataset provides information of TV shows and movies available on Netflix by 2021. The major focus of the analysis would be to generate facts and insights from the provided data.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn short: As expected from a streaming service that originally comes from America, movies and TV shows from United States are the majority in Netflix. Most appeared genres are 'Drama' and 'Comedies' despite the program's type (movie or TV show) and release year. There are more movies than TV shows available in Netflix, but Netflix is more focusing on TV shows in recent years.","55a0c825":"Top genres of programs from 1925 to 1999 are 'Dramas', 'International Movies', 'Comedies', 'Action & Adventure', and 'Classic\u00a0Movies'.","c253eebe":"\n### Types of Content on\u00a0Netflix","cfe9cf22":"Netflix produced the highest number of titles in 2018, and it's consistently decreasing until 2020.

They're consistently giving more TV shows year by year, and one title of TV show has more episodes\/duration than one title of movie.","b407ca92":"### Word Frequency in\u00a0Title","49911ae4":"\n### The End\nThanks for reading through.","e8065b10":"Both movie and TV show are mostly categorized as 'Drama', 'Comedies', 'Documentaries', 'Action & Adventure', 'Romantic', and 'Kids'."}}
