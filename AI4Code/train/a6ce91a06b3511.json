First we need to preprocess the data. \n\n**Threee Approaches:**\n\n1) Drop Categorical Variables: The easiest approach to dealing with categorical variables is to simply remove them from the dataset. This approach will only work well if the columns did not contain useful information.\n\n2) Label Encoding: Label encoding assigns each unique value to a different integer.\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tEogUAr.png\"\/>\n\n3) One-Hot Encoding: \n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TW5m0aJ.png\"\/>","f6f3cd47":"# Data Leakage\n**Data leakage** (or **leakage**) happens when your training data contains information about the target, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction. This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.\n\nIn other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate.\n\nThere are two main types of leakage: **target leakage** and **train-test contamination**.\n\n**Target Leakage**: Occurs when our predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.\n\nImagine we want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of our raw data look like this:\n<img src=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/BEf5da3.png\"\/>\n\nPeople take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. The raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns, but `took_antibiotic_medicine` is frequently changed after the value for `got_pneumonia` is determined. This is target leakage.\n\nThe model would see that anyone who has a value of False for `took_antibiotic_medicine` didn't have pneumonia. Since validation data comes from the same source as training data, the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores.\n\nBut the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world, because even patients who will get pneumonia won't have received antibiotics yet when we need to make predictions about their future health.\n\nTo prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y7hfTYe.png\"\/>","3de18143":"As shown above, everyone who did not receive a card had no expenditures, while only 2% of those who received a card had no expenditures. It's not surprising that our model appeared to have a high accuracy. But this also seems to be a case of target leakage, where expenditures probably means expenditures on the card they applied for.\n\nSince `share` is partially determined by expenditure, it should be excluded too. The variables `active` and `majorcards` are a little less clear, but from the description, they sound concerning. In most situations, it's better to be safe than sorry if you can't track down the people who created the data to find out more.\n\nWe would run a model without target leakage as follows:","a0d6541e":"Exercises of this tutorial are solved [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mahendrabishnoi2\/exercise-xgboost)\n\n---","5fdd23cc":"# Example","61192c84":"- `n_jobs`\n\nOn larger datasets where runtime is a consideration, we can use parallelism to build your models faster. It's common to set the parameter `n_jobs` equal to the number of cores on our machine. On smaller datasets, this won't help.\n\nThe resulting model won't be any better, so micro-optimizing for fitting time is typically nothing but a distraction. But, it's useful in large datasets where we would otherwise spend a long time waiting during the `fit` command.","19ae209c":"98% accuracy doesn't happen often so enquire for target leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the data:\n\n- **card**: 1 if credit card application accepted, 0 if not\n- **reports**: Number of major derogatory reports\n- **age**: Age n years plus twelfths of a year\n- **income**: Yearly income (divided by 10,000)\n- **share**: Ratio of monthly credit card expenditure to yearly income\n- **expenditure**: Average monthly credit card expenditure\n- **owner**: 1 if owns home, 0 if rents\n- **selfempl**: 1 if self-employed, 0 if not\n- **dependents**: 1 + number of dependents\n- **months**: Months living at current address\n- **majorcards**: Number of major credit cards held\n- **active**: Number of active credit accounts\n\nA few variables look suspicious. For example, does `expenditure` mean expenditure on this card or on cards used before appying?\n\nHere data comparision may be helpful","2d02af39":"**Approach 3:**\nWe use the `OneHotEncoder` class from scikit-learn to get one-hot encodings. There are a number of parameters that can be used to customize its behavior.\n\nWe set `handle_unknown='ignore'` to avoid errors when the validation data contains classes that aren't represented in the training data, and\nsetting `sparse=False` ensures that the encoded columns are returned as a numpy array (instead of a sparse matrix).\nTo use the encoder, we supply only the categorical columns that we want to be one-hot encoded. For instance, to encode the training data, we supply `X_train[object_cols].(object_cols` in the code cell below is a list of the column names with categorical data, and so `X_train[object_cols]` contains all of the categorical data in the training set.)","2d3f7a11":"- `early_stopping_rounds` - offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for `n_estimators`. Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for `n_estimators`. It's smart to set a high value for `n_estimators` and then use `early_stopping_rounds` to find the optimal time to stop iterating.\n- Since random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve, we need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping. Setting `early_stopping_rounds=5` is a reasonable choice. In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores.\n- When using `early_stopping_rounds`, we also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores - this is done by setting the `eval_set` parameter.","dfe3dee7":"# Pipelines\n\n## Introduction\n**Pipelines** are a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized. Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n\nMany data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits.

In this case, we say that we have broken the data into 5 \"**folds**\".\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9k60cVA.png\"\/>\n\nThen, we run one experiment for each fold:\n\n- In **Experiment 1**, we use the first fold as a validation (or holdout) set and everything else as training data. This gives us a measure of model quality based on a 20% holdout set.\n- In **Experiment 2**, we hold out data from the second fold (and use everything except the second fold for training the model). The holdout set is then used to get a second estimate of model quality.\n- We repeat this process, using every fold once as the holdout set. Putting this together, 100% of the data is used as holdout at some point, and we end up with a measure of model quality that is based on all of the rows in the dataset (even if we don't use all rows simultaneously).","4bfa87b1":"**When to use Cross Validation?**\n\nCross-validation gives a more accurate measure of model quality, which is especially important if you are making a lot of modeling decisions. However, it can take longer to run, because it estimates multiple models (one for each fold).\n\nSo, given these tradeoffs, when should you use each approach?\n\n- For **small datasets**, where extra computational burden isn't a big deal, you should run cross-validation.\n- For **larger datasets**, a single validation set is sufficient. Your code will run faster, and you may have enough data that there's little need to re-use some of it for holdout.","0b771bfe":"Exercises of this tutorial are solved [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mahendrabishnoi2\/exercise-categorical-variables)\n\n---","3913524d":"Three steps of creating a pipeline:\n\n**Step 1: Define Preprocessing steps**\n\nSimilar to how a pipeline bundles together preprocessing and modeling steps, we use the `ColumnTransformer` class to bundle together different preprocessing steps.

We can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior. This is sometimes called train-test contamination.\n\nFor example, imagine we run preprocessing (like fitting an imputer for missing values) before calling `train_test_split()`. The end result? Our model may get good validation scores, giving us great confidence in it, but perform poorly when we deploy it to make decisions.\n\nAfter all, we incorporated data from the validation or test data into how you make predictions, so the may do well on that particular data even if it can't generalize to new data. This problem becomes even more subtle (and more dangerous) when we do more complex feature engineering.\n\nIf our validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of fitting, including the fitting of preprocessing steps. This is easier if we use scikit-learn pipelines. When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you do your preprocessing inside the pipeline!","b70260b6":"# Dealing with missing values\n\n**1) Drop Columns with missing values**\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Sax80za.png\"\/>","10f3e4cc":"# XGBoost\n\n## Gradient Boosting\n**Gradient boosting** is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.\n\nIt begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive. (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors).\n\n- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset. To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.\n- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like mean squared error, for instance).\n- Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble. Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss. (Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use [gradient descent](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gradient_descent) on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.)\n- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n- ... repeat!\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/MvCGENh.png\"\/>","c955da8e":"- learning_rate\n\nInstead of getting predictions by simply adding up the predictions from each component model, we can multiply the predictions from each model by a small number (known as the learning rate) before adding them in.\n\nThis means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less. So, we can set a higher value for n_estimators without overfitting. If we use early stopping, the appropriate number of trees will be determined automatically.\n\nIn general, a small learning rate and large number of estimators will yield more accurate XGBoost models, though it will also take the model longer to train since it does more iterations through the cycle. As default, XGBoost sets `learning_rate=0.1`.","56e55cf9":"[**Intermediate Machine Learning Micro-Course Home Page**](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/intermediate-machine-learning)\n\n[Open on kaggle](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mahendrabishnoi2\/06-intermediate-ml\/edit)\n\n---","289272ca":"**3) An Extension to Imputation**: Imputation, in addition with a new column showing location of imputed values.\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UWOyg4a.png\"\/>","7fae94c7":"Exercises of this tutorial are solved [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mahendrabishnoi2\/exercise-cross-validation)\n\n---","eb8224a1":"This accuracy is quite a bit lower, which might be disappointing. However, we can expect it to be right about 80% of the time when used on new applications, whereas the leaky model would likely do much worse than that (in spite of its higher apparent score in cross-validation).\n\nData leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data can prevent train-test contamination, and pipelines can help implement this separation.

There are a few important things to notice:\n\n- With the pipeline, we preprocess the training data and fit the model in a single line of code. (In contrast, without a pipeline, we have to do imputation, one-hot encoding, and model training in separate steps. This becomes especially messy if we have to deal with both numerical and categorical variables!)\n- With the pipeline, we supply the unprocessed features in `X_valid` to the `predict()` command, and the pipeline automatically preprocesses the features before generating predictions. (However, without a pipeline, we have to remember to preprocess the validation data before making predictions.)","de16d056":"Exercises of this tutorial are solved [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mahendrabishnoi2\/exercise-pipelines)\n\n---"}}
