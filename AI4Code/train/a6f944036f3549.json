For instance, So and Derrick seems to have a pretty consistent energy consumption trend for the rest of the year. Buildings such as Terrance and Jasper share a close similarity in energy usage patterns with both having 5 major dips (excluding the one at the end of 2016) and relatively high energy consumption especially in 2016. The occasional dips in between peaks for most of the educational buildings could be due to the weekends where classes are not being held and hence lesser energy is utilised to run the  building. ","4a2ff797":"Looking across the different plotted graphs, most of the educational buildings in Robin tends to be similar in beahviour. All of the data dips towards the end of the year probably due to it being the vacational period.","d9087c67":"## Extracting Data of Educational Buildings\n<a id=\"extraction\"><\/a>\nFor this analysis, the focus shall only be on the educational buildings within Robin.","58799f19":"For Margarito,energy consumption is at its peak during the summer periods. This could be due to the increased usage of air-conditioning for cooling during the hotter periods of the year.  The energy consumption dips down slightly after the hotter months are passed before increasing again during the winter months. This could be due to the increased usage of heaters for warming during the colder periods of the year.","211fb27e":"# Introduction\n\nAs a team of energy consultants, we are looking into the possibility of implementing a smart grid. This notebook shall look into the analysis of a site, Robin, from the Building Data Genome Project 2 with a focus on educational buildings. \n\nAn analysis and evaluation of the energy consumption and usage patterns will be conducted This will then be compared to the weather data to ascertain the peak periods of energy consumption. \n\nIn addition, we hope to recommend solutions to address the peak periods of energy consumption that ties in with the goal of having a smart grid.\n\n","77a9792a":"## 1.1 Looking at Daily Data\n<a id=\"daily\"><\/a>","0a689517":"These 2 buildings' energy consumption usage patterns can is more explicitly observed in the monthly data.","5c04ef2f":"# Project 2\n*** \n**Done By \u2014 Deborah Chan Wye Yin, Iffah Farina Binte Mohamad Jais, Jessica Hudaya, Nguyen Nhu Cuong, Zhao Qiaoyi**\n\n","edc07850":"# 1.

This implies that it is using large amounts of energy even beyond the summer and winter months.","b870b35e":"## 1.2 Looking at Margarito and So\n<a id=\"comparison\"><\/a>","ebb9fcd3":"Both buildings, So and Margarito, provides a potential opportunity for solutions such as smart grid and renewable energy to be implemented in order to tackle the high energy consumption issue. The inclusion of smart grid in energy managmenet could aid in better understanding the energy consumption patterns and could help in identifying potential areas where energy could be reduced especially during peak consumption periods. Implementing solar panels could aid in energy reduction and savings."}}
