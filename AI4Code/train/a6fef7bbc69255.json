women with polycystic ovary syndrome during a 24-year period: importance of obesity and abdominal fat distribution\n\nAuthors: M Forslund, K Landin-Wilhelmsen, P Trimpou, J Schmidt, M

DOI:10.1093\/hropen\/hoz042\n\nWhat are the predictive factors for later development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\n\nObesity and abdominal fat distribution in women with PCOS in the mid-fertile years were the major risk factors for T2DM development 24 years later when lifestyle factors were similar to controls.\n\nWomen with PCOS have an increased prevalence of T2DM. None of women with PCOS had T2DM at baseline. At the 24-year follow-up, 19% of women with PCOS had T2DM versus 1% of controls (P\u2009<\u20090.01). All women with PCOS who developed T2DM were obese and had waist-hip ratio (WHR) >0.85 at baseline. No difference was seen between women with PCOS and controls regarding use of high-fat diet, Mediterranean diet or amount of physical activity at follow-up at peri\/postmenopausal age. However, women with PCOS had a lower usage of a high-sugar diet as compared to controls (P\u2009=\u20090.01). The mean increases in BMI and WHR per year were similar in women with PCOS and controls during the follow-up period.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6964225\/","a7f8e8cd":"Much better than the \"messy\", \"clumsy\" Piechart.","c9a754b4":"<a id=\"1.1\"><\/a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">PyComp Library by Thiago Panini @thiagopanini<\/h3>\n\nCodes by Thiago Panini https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/thiagopanini\/pycomp-predicting-survival-on-titanic-disaster\/notebook\n\nhttps:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pycomp\/","af54eaef":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Physical activity<\/font>\n\nStructured questionnaires regarding physical activity level during leisure time and at work were used in the follow-up examination. Physical activity at work was graded as predominantly sedentary, i.e. included some walking and standing but no stairs or heavy lifting, involved walking including stairs or walking uphill and\/or lifting heavy objects or corresponded to heavy physical labor. For analysis, the four possible levels of activity were grouped into a binary variable\u2014\u2018sedentary\u2019 (grades 1 and 2) or \u2018active\u2019 (grades 3 and 4) lifestyle, during leisure and work, respectively.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)<\/font>\n\nA food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to evaluate dietary habits.

Data that were not normally distributed were tested with the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Categorical comparisons were calculated using Fischer\u2019s exact t-test.\n\nOdds ratios (ORs) were computed with a multiple variate logistic regression analysis to compare the relative impact of PCOS and BMI (Body mass index) on T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) diagnosis.\n\nAt baseline, none of the women with PCOS had diabetes mellitus, while in the control group one (1%) had type 1 diabetes mellitus and none had T2DM. At follow-up five (19%) of the women with PCOS had developed T2DM compared to one (1%) of the controls (P\u2009<\u20090.01). When comparing the women with and without PCOS who were obese at baseline, 71% of the obese PCOS women had converted to T2DM compared to 25% of obese controls (P-value 0.24).\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6964225\/","3b68fd6a":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n    I really don't think that ethnicity by itself can influence Diabetes rates.

Plus those habits are decisions made by individuals or group of people regarding what foods they eat. In addition,  we have Sedentarism.

Thus, abdominal obesity before mid-fertile age was a strong risk factor for development of T2DM in women with PCOS. This is in line with previous studies on the general population where overweight and obesity, especially when present at a young age, significantly increased the lifetime risk for T2DM.(Diabetes Type 2)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6964225\/","6f03e3d4":"![](https:\/\/leanpcos.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Diabetes-study.png)leanpcos.org"}}
