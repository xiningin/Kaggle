When coding, this library is written as **sklearn**, as you will see in the sample code. Scikit-learn is easily the most popular library for modeling the types of data typically stored in DataFrames. \n\nThe steps to building and using a model are:\n* **Define:** What type of model will it be?  A decision tree?  Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.\n* **Fit:** Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.\n* **Predict:** Just what it sounds like\n* **Evaluate**: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.\n\nHere is an example of defining a decision tree model with scikit-learn and fitting it with the features and target variable.","d108e8f2":"Visually checking your data with these commands is an important part of a data scientist's job.

Specifying a number for `random_state` ensures you get the same results in each run. This is considered a good practice. You use any number, and model quality won't depend meaningfully on exactly what value you choose.\n\nWe now have a fitted model that we can use to make predictions.\n\nIn practice, you'll want to make predictions for new houses coming on the market rather than the houses we already have prices for. But we'll make predictions for the first few rows of the training data to see how the predict function works.\n","b0723ddc":"**[Machine Learning Course Home Page](kaggle.com\/learn\/machine-learning).**\n\n---\n\n# Selecting Data for Modeling\nYour dataset had  too many variables to wrap your head around, or even to print out nicely.  How can you pare down this overwhelming amount of data to something you can understand?\n\nWe'll start by picking a few variables using our intuition. Later courses will show you statistical techniques to automatically prioritize variables.\n\nTo choose variables\/columns, we'll need to see a list of all columns in the dataset.
