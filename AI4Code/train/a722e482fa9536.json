This can be done in the browser. Some examples:\n\nhttps:\/\/musiclab.chromeexperiments.com\/Spectrogram\/\n\nhttps:\/\/webaudiodemos.appspot.com\/pitchdetect\/\n\nThe relationship is pretty simpe:\n\n$$c=\\frac{\\lambda}{T}=\\lambda f$$\n\nIn the straw we get a standing wave. Since both ends are open the first node would have a node in the center of the tube and \n\nRegrading the length $l$ of the tube we get the relationship\n\n$$l=\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$$\n\nNow measuring the length and the frequency of the pitch we can calculate the speed of sound $c$ in air."}}
