Out of all the movie genres, the first two are most significant for any film.\n\n1. Extract the first two genres from the `genres` column and store them in two new columns: `genre_1` and `genre_2`. Some of the movies might have only one genre. In such cases, extract the single genre into both the columns, i.e. for such movies the `genre_2` will be the same as `genre_1`.\n2. Group the dataframe using `genre_1` as the primary column and `genre_2` as the secondary column.\n3. Find out the 5 most popular combo of genres by finding the mean of the gross values using the `gross` column and store them in a new dataframe named `PopGenre`.","2ddd9961":"## Task 3: Data Analysis\n\n-  ### Subtask 3.1: Change the unit of columns\n\nConvert the unit of the `budget` and `gross` columns from `$` to `million $`.","357783aa":"-  ### Subtask 3.2: Find the movies with highest profit\n\n    1.

Create a new dataframe `IMDb_Top_250` and store the top 250 movies with the highest IMDb Rating (corresponding to the column: `imdb_score`). Also make sure that for all of these movies, the `num_voted_users` is greater than 25,000.\nAlso add a `Rank` column containing the values 1 to 250 indicating the ranks of the corresponding films.\n    2. Extract all the movies in the `IMDb_Top_250` dataframe which are not in the English language and store them in a new dataframe named `Top_Foreign_Lang_Film`.","0a72b85c":"## Task 2: Cleaning the Data\n\n-  ### Subtask 2.1: Inspect Null values\n\nFind out the number of Null values in all the columns and rows. Also, find the percentage of Null values in each column. Round off the percentages upto two decimal places.","b0f9dcc9":"-  ### Subtask 3.7: Find the critic-favorite and audience-favorite actors\n\n    1. Create three new dataframes namely, `Meryl_Streep`, `Leo_Caprio`, and `Brad_Pitt` which contain the movies in which the actors: 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' are the lead actors. Use only the `actor_1_name` column for extraction. Also, make sure that you use the names 'Meryl Streep', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', and 'Brad Pitt' for the said extraction.\n    2. Append the rows of all these dataframes and store them in a new dataframe named `Combined`.\n    3. Group the combined dataframe using the `actor_1_name` column.\n    4. Find the mean of the `num_critic_for_reviews` and `num_user_for_review` and identify the actors which have the highest mean.","50a67a99":"**Checkpoint 1:** You might have noticed that we still have around `77%` of the rows!","8d26ae0e":"**Checkpoint 5:** Well, as it turns out. `Family + Sci-Fi` is the most popular combo of genres out there!","6b7d667f":"-  ### Subtask 3.3: Drop duplicate values\n\nAfter you found out the top 10 profiting movies, you might have notice a duplicate value. So, it seems like the dataframe has duplicate values as well. Drop the duplicate values from the dataframe and repeat `Subtask 3.2`.","816359c7":"-  ### Subtask 2.2: Drop unecessary columns\n\nFor this assignment, you will mostly be analyzing the movies with respect to the ratings, gross collection, popularity of movies, etc. So many of the columns in this dataframe are not required.

You can let these columns as it is for now. Check the number and percentage of the rows retained after completing all the tasks above.","ff660b49":"**Checkpoint 3:** Can you spot `Veer-Zaara` in the dataframe?","aa4d5c78":"**Checkpoint 2:** You might spot two movies directed by `James Cameron` in the list.","95deab8f":"-  ### Subtask 2.4: Drop unecessary rows\n\nSome of the rows might have greater than five NaN values. Such rows aren't of much use for the analysis and hence, should be removed.","c2f2ec9f":"-  ### Subtask 2.5: Fill NaN values\n\nYou might notice that the `language` column has some NaN values.
