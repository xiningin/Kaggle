Repeat forever by specifying `dataset.repeat()` (the `epochs` parameter described below limits how long we perform training).\n2. The `dataset.shuffle(60000)` randomizes the order so our model cannot learn anything from the order of the examples.\n3. And `dataset.batch(32)` tells `model.fit` to use batches of 32 images and labels when updating the model variables.\n\nTraining is performed by calling the `model.fit` method:\n1. Feed the training data to the model using `train_dataset`.\n2. The model learns to associate images and labels.\n3. The `epochs=5` parameter limits training to 5 full iterations of the training dataset, so a total of 5 * 60000 = 300000 examples.\n\n(Don't worry about `steps_per_epoch`, the requirement to have this flag will soon be removed.)","175b1b0c":"This network layers are:\n\n* **\"convolutions\"** `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D and MaxPooling2D`\u2014 Network start with two pairs of Conv\/MaxPool. The first layer is a Conv2D filters (3,3) being applied to the input image, retaining the original image size by using padding, and creating 32 output (convoluted) images (so this layer creates 32 convoluted images of the same size as input). After that, the 32 outputs are reduced in size using a MaxPooling2D (2,2) with a stride of 2. The next Conv2D also has a (3,3) kernel, takes the 32 images as input and creates 64 outputs which are again reduced in size by a MaxPooling2D layer. So far in the course, we have described what a Convolution does, but we haven't yet covered how you chain multiples of these together. We will get back to this in lesson 4 when we use color images. At this point, it's enough if you understand the kind of operation a convolutional filter performs\n\n* **output** `tf.keras.layers.Dense` \u2014 A 128-neuron, followed by 10-node *softmax* layer. Each node represents a class of clothing. As in the previous layer, the final layer takes input from the 128 nodes in the layer before it, and outputs a value in the range `[0, 1]`, representing the probability that the image belongs to that class. The sum of all 10 node values is 1.\n\n> Note: Using `softmax` activation and `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()` has issues and which are patched by the `tf.keras` model. A safer approach, in general, is to use a linear output (no activation function) with `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)`.\n\n\n### Compile the model\n\nBefore the model is ready for training, it needs a few more settings. These are added during the model's *compile* step:\n\n\n* *Loss function* \u2014 An algorithm for measuring how far the model's outputs are from the desired output. The goal of training is this measures loss.\n* *Optimizer* \u2014An algorithm for adjusting the inner parameters of the model in order to minimize loss.\n* *Metrics* \u2014Used to monitor the training and testing steps.
