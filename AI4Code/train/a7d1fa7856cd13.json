Thus we took a closer look at the PCA result and found that in component 1, rating for ambiance and the rating for service have higher influence in the feature, and rating for how much customer's decision depend on promotion have very little influence on the component, so we may inference that the customers could potentially be separated based on how muuch they rate the ambiance of Starbuck stores and the rate for the services starbuck provides.

While pricing is particularly important, its average rating is lowest among all rating variables, thus Starbucks may need to reconsider its pricing strategy and its focus. \n","2b9e2fb0":"Now we will divide the data into training  and testing set and try to predict whether the customer will visit again using the ratings"}}
