This is highly inefficient because there is no parameter sharing, but it will work.\n- The convolutional model uses 2 1x1 convulutions and takes the outer product of the resulting arrays. This results in only 18 trainable weights! \n    - Advantage: More parameter sharing -> faster convergence\n    - Disadvantage: Information gets lost -> lower performance\n- For a real chess AI we need bigger neural networks. But now the neural network only has to learn to capture valuable pieces.","b815d6ba":"## Reinforcement Learning Chess\nReinforcement Learning Chess is a series of notebooks where I implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms to develop a chess AI.

The code below checks the action values of capturing every black piece for every white piece. \n- We expect that the action values for capturing black pieces is similar to the (Reinfeld) rewards we put in our environment. \n- Of course the action values also depend on the risk of re-capture by black and the opportunity for consecutive capture. ","b9713bce":"#### Q learning with a Q-network\n**Theory**\n- The Q-network is usually either a linear regression or a (deep) neural network. \n- The input of the network is the state (S) and the output is the predicted action value of each Action (in our case, 4096 values). \n- The idea is similar to learning with Q-tables. We update our Q value in the direction of the discounted reward + the max successor state action value\n- I used prioritized experience replay to de-correlate the updates. If you want to now more about it, check the link in the references\n> - I used fixed-Q targets to stabilize the learning process. ","603a2c23":"#### Import and Install","81e346a0":"### Notebook III: Q-networks\nIn this notebook I implement an simplified version of chess named capture chess. In this environment the agent (playing white) is rewarded for capturing pieces (not for checkmate).  After running this notebook, you end up with an agent that can capture pieces against a random oponnent as demonstrated in the gif below. The main difference between this notebook and the previous one is that I use Q-networks as an alternative to Q-tables. Q-tables are nice and straightforward, but can only contain a limited amount of action values. Chess has state space complexity of 10<sup>47<\/sup>. Needless to say, this is too much information to put in a Q-table. This is where supervised learning comes in. A Q-network can represent a generalized mapping from state to action values.\n\n![](https:\/\/images.chesscomfiles.com\/uploads\/game-gifs\/90px\/green\/neo\/0\/cc\/0\/0\/aXFZUWpyN1Brc1BPbHQwS211WEhudkh6cXohMGFPMExPUTJNUTY4MDY1OTI1NFpSND8yOT85M1Y5MTA3MUxLQ3RDUkpDSjcwTE0wN293V0d6Rzc2cHhWTXJ6NlhzQVg0dUM0WGNNWDU,.gif)\n\n","2678e0ce":"#### Board representation of python-chess:","4db228d3":"#### Demo","6dc62993":"### The environment: Capture Chess\nIn this notebook we'll upgrade our environment to one that behaves more like real chess.
