Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. \n\nWe are interested in posts whose titles begin with either \"Ask HN\" or \"Show HN\". Users submit Ask HN posts to the Hacker News Community to ask a specific question. Show HN posts include posts where the user displays a community project, product, or other interesting artifact.\n\nIn this data analysis, we will compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n\n1. Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments on average.\n2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average.\n\nPlease note the data set we're working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.","a7817191":"**Conclusion**\nThrough the analysis of Hacker News Posts, we were able to determine which type of posts based on time created receive the most amount of comments on average. Our analysis shows that in order to maximize the amount of comments a post receives, we'd recommend the post be categorized as an 'Ask Post' and created between 3 and 4pm est.","97b92180":"**Analyzing the Amount of Comments on Ask Posts Based on Hour Created**\n\nBelow we will determine if ask posts can maximize the amount of comments received based on the time it was created. First, we will discover the amounts of ask posts created per hour of the day. Then we will calculate the average amount of comments the posts created at each hour receive.","0e22340c":"The above data set contains the following:\n    1. Post ID\n    2. Title of posts\n    3. Post URL\n    4. Number of points on post\n    5. Number of comments on post\n    6. Author of post\n    7. The date the post was created. \nNext we will explore the number of comments for each type of post.","3b09a612":"**Extracting ASK Hacker News and SHOW Hacker News Posts:**\nNext we will identify posts that behin with either ASK HN or SHOW HN and separate the data for these types of posts into different lists.","9ec693ef":"Based on conclusions drawns from analysis above - ask posts receive approximately 14 comments while show posts receive approximately 10.\n\nBecause Ask posts receive more comments, the remaining analysis will focus on these posts.","2bc0b383":"From above, we can see the hour that receives the most comments per post on average is 15:00 with an average of 38.59 comments per post. Based on documention included with dataset, we can conclude the most amount of comments on Ask Hacker News Posts are on posts created at 3:00pm est.","57e9f79e":"**Sorting and Printing Values from the List Above**","b3552cb8":"Exploring Hacker News Posts: Popularity of Show vs. Ask Posts","f56ab8b6":"**Removing Headers from the Printed List","161f153e":"**Calculating the Acg.
