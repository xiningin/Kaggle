With those preliminaries out of the way, we can jump in and start learning Python. In this short lesson, we'll learn how to use Python to do arithmetic operations.\n\nPython allows you to perform all of the basic mathematical computations that you can perform on a calculator, using syntax similar to what you'd expect if you were using a calculator. To perform arithmetic with Python, simply type the operation you wish to perform into a code cell and then run the cell to view the result. (Remember, if you like you can fork this notebook using the blue button at the top of the screen and then run code cells yourself by selecting the cell you wish to run and pressing control + enter.).\n\nUse the + sign to perform addition:","eb3d4c2b":"Math expressions in Python follow the normal arithmetic order of operations so * and \/ are executed before + and - and ** is executed before multiplication and division.\n\nNote: Lines within Python code that begin with \"#\" are text comments. Comments are typically used to make notes and describe what code does and do not affect the code when it is run.","df57a5ee":"In this lesson, we learned that Python is a powerful calculator. Any time you need to perform a common mathematical operation in Python, chances are there is a function for it available in one of Python's many libraries. When in doubt, try searching Google. Helpful blog posts and answers posted on programming sites like Stack Overflow can often save you a lot time and help you learn better ways of doing things without reinventing the wheel.\n\nIn the next lesson, we'll learn about the basic data types you'll encounter in Python.","35973be7":"Base Python contains a round() function that lets you round numbers to the nearest whole number.
