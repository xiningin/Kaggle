the employees leaving are freshers between 25-35 years and IBM is either their first or second company. Most of them live within 10 kms.\n* Majority of the employees leaving have less than 10 years of experience. Employees having more than 10 years of total experience are very less likely to leave the company.\n* Most employees leaving the company are males. Most of the employees leaving the company are unmarried. Divorcees are least likely to leave the company.\n* Most of the employees leaving had just 2 hrs of training, had spent less than 4 years under the same manager and travelled rarely\n* Research and development division contributed to most employees leaving. \n* People receiving lower salary hike and lower rating represent most of the attrition population\n\nClearly, the issue of attrition is more related to freshers who despite having reasonable work-life balance choose to leave their jobs. Most of these people have high relationship satisfaction level but are single.Possibly, they don't envisage healthy career growth at IBM after marriage. Such insecurity is prominent amongst males. Male employees are generally more aggresive in their career plans as they are the compulsory earning member in a family, traditionally. In this case, low training opportunities alongwith low salary hike and performance ratings are encouraging young employees to resign notwwithstanding the incentive of staying close to the office as they cannot visualize a good future for themselves based on such poor feedback and care from the company. \n\nHR department needs to focus on engaging with this employee segment by organizing more trainings and counselling sessions with them.It should focus more on enabling career progression for its young employees rather than trying to appease them to stay back in the organisation. If by taking these steps, HR team can ensure employees end up working till 10 years then attrition is less likely to be a problem thereafter.
