Let's finish by sorting the list of lists and printing the five highest values in a format that's easier to read.","b6c6b23c":"# Exploring HackerNews: a simple data analysis project.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nHacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n\nThe original dataset can be found [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hacker-news\/hacker-news-posts), but note that it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n\n* id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n* title: The title of the post\n* url: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n* num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n* num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post\n* author: The username of the person who submitted the post\n* created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted","a434c24c":"## 3.Comparing the averages\nAbove we separated the \"ask posts\" and the \"show posts\" into two list of lists named `ask_posts` and `show_posts`.\nNext, let's determine if ask posts or show posts receive more comments on average.","6d7a0d24":"## 2. Objectives:\n\nFor this analysis, We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. Users often submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Below are a couple examples:\n\n`Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\nAsk HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\nAsk HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?`\n\nLikewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. Below are a couple of examples:\n\n`Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'\nShow HN: Something pointless I made\nShow HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm`\n\nWe'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n\n* Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?","79bfa8c1":"## 4. Digging deeper into 'Ask Posts'\nWe've determined above that, on average, ask posts receive more comments than show posts. Since ask posts are more likely to receive comments, we'll focus our remaining analysis just on these posts.\n\nNext, we'll determine if ask posts created at a certain time are more likely to attract comments. We'll use the following steps to perform this analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of ask posts created in each hour of the day, along with the number of comments received.\n2. Calculate the average number of comments ask posts receive by hour created.","beede8e7":"Above, we created two dictionaries:\n\n* `counts_by_hour`: contains the number of ask posts created during each hour of the day.\n* `comments_by_hour`: contains the corresponding number of comments ask posts created at each hour received.\n\nNext, we'll use these two dictionaries to calculate the average number of comments for posts created during each hour of the day."}}
