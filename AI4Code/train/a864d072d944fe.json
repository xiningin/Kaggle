Make the first heatmap to see how the average number of votes of males is varying across the genres. Use seaborn heatmap for this analysis. The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for males, i.e., `CVotesU18M`,`CVotes1829M`, `CVotes3044M`, and `CVotes45AM`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-male group. \n\n2.

The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for females, i.e., `CVotesU18F`,`CVotes1829F`, `CVotes3044F`, and `CVotes45AF`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-female group. \n\n3.

Let's add a small condition to it and make sure that all three actors are popular. The condition is **none of the three actors' Facebook likes should be less than half of the other two**. For example, the following is a valid combo:\n- actor_1_facebook_likes: 70000\n- actor_2_facebook_likes: 40000\n- actor_3_facebook_likes: 50000\n\nBut the below one is not:\n- actor_1_facebook_likes: 70000\n- actor_2_facebook_likes: 40000\n- actor_3_facebook_likes: 30000\n\nsince in this case, `actor_3_facebook_likes` is 30000, which is less than half of `actor_1_facebook_likes`.\n\nHaving this condition ensures that you aren't getting any unpopular actor in your trio (since the total likes calculated in the previous question doesn't tell anything about the individual popularities of each actor in the trio.).\n\nYou can do a manual inspection of the top 5 popular trios you have found in the previous subtask and check how many of those trios satisfy this condition.

As a part of this subtask, you need to aggregate a few values over these 3 columns. \n1. First create a new dataframe `df_by_genre` that contains `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` and all the columns related to **CVotes\/Votes** from the `movies` data frame. There are 47 columns to be extracted in total.\n2. Now, Add a column called `cnt` to the dataframe `df_by_genre` and initialize it to one. You will realise the use of this column by the end of this subtask.\n3. First group the dataframe `df_by_genre` by `genre_1` and find the sum of all the numeric columns such as `cnt`, columns related to CVotes and Votes columns and store it in a dataframe `df_by_g1`.\n4. Perform the same operation for `genre_2` and `genre_3` and store it dataframes `df_by_g2` and `df_by_g3` respectively. \n5. Now that you have 3 dataframes performed by grouping over `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` separately, it's time to combine them. For this, add the three dataframes and store it in a new dataframe `df_add`, so that the corresponding values of Votes\/CVotes get added for each genre.There is a function called `add()` in pandas which lets you do this. You can refer to this link to see how this function works. https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/version\/0.23.4\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.add.html\n6. The column `cnt` on aggregation has basically kept the track of the number of occurences of each genre.Subset the genres that have atleast 10 movies into a new dataframe `genre_top10` based on the `cnt` column value.\n7. Now, take the mean of all the numeric columns by dividing them with the column value `cnt` and store it back to the same dataframe. We will be using this dataframe for further analysis in this task unless it is explicitly mentioned to use the dataframe `movies`.\n8.

This rating is determined by taking the average of hundred-thousands of ratings from the general audience. \n\nAs a part of this subtask, you are required to find out the highest rated movies which have been liked by critics and audiences alike.\n1. Firstly you will notice that the `MetaCritic` score is on a scale of `100` whereas the `IMDb_rating` is on a scale of 10. First convert the `MetaCritic` column to a scale of 10.\n2. Now, to find out the movies which have been liked by both critics and audiences alike and also have a high rating overall, you need to -\n    - Create a new column `Avg_rating` which will have the average of the `MetaCritic` and `Rating` columns\n    - Retain only the movies in which the absolute difference(using abs() function) between the `IMDb_rating` and `Metacritic` columns is less than 0.5.

Make a boxplot that shows how the ratings from the US people i.e. `VotesUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Similarly, make another subplot that shows how `VotesnUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Write any of your two inferences\/observations from these plots.\n\nNote : Use `movies` dataframe for this subtask. Make use of this documention to format your boxplot - https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.boxplot.html","9a85b01f":"-  ###  Subtask 3.2: Genre Counts!\n\nNow let's derive some insights from this data frame. Make a bar chart plotting different genres vs cnt using seaborn.","f47f4bb5":"**`Inferences:`** Write your two inferences\/observations below:\n- Inference 1: More number of US people have voted for the US movies than non-US movies. \n- Inference 2: There are more number of non-USA votes for US movies compared to non-USA movies but the average votes for both US and non-US movies seem to be similar.","cfe3ed2d":"-  ###  Subtask 2.1: Reduce those Digits!\n\nThese numbers in the `budget` and `gross` are too big, compromising its readability. Let's convert the unit of the `budget` and `gross` columns from `$` to `million $` first.","d67d179c":"- ### Subtask 2.4: Find the Most Popular Trios - I\n\nYou're a producer looking to make a blockbuster movie. There will primarily be three lead roles in your movie and you wish to cast the most popular actors for it. Now, since you don't want to take a risk, you will cast a trio which has already acted in together in a movie before. The metric that you've chosen to check the popularity is the Facebook likes of each of these actors.\n\nThe dataframe has three columns to help you out for the same, viz. `actor_1_facebook_likes`, `actor_2_facebook_likes`, and `actor_3_facebook_likes`. Your objective is to find the trios which has the most number of Facebook likes combined. That is, the sum of `actor_1_facebook_likes`, `actor_2_facebook_likes` and `actor_3_facebook_likes` should be maximum.\nFind out the top 5 popular trios, and output their names in a list.\n","d4ca94fb":"**`Inferences:`** Sci-Fi appears to be the highest rated genre in the age group of U18 for both males and females. Also, females in this age group have rated it a bit higher than the males in the same age group. What more can you infer from the two heatmaps that you have plotted? Write your three inferences\/observations below:\n- Inference 1: Romance seems to be the lowest rated genre in the age group of 45A for both males and females.\n- Inference 2: Females seem to give slightly higher rating than males across all age groups and genres.\n- Inference 3: Males from the U18 age group have rated the genre crime higher than the females in the same age group.","8ca6b8bc":"## Task 2: Data Analysis\n\nNow that we have loaded the dataset and inspected it, we see that most of the data is in place. As of now, no data cleaning is required, so let's start with some data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation to get various insights about the data. "}}
