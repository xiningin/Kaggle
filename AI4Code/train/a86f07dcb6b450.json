Otherwise we're going to experiment other epidemies since the World is fully connected.\n\nHealth promotion programs aim to engage and empower individuals and communities to choose healthy behaviors, and make changes that reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases and other morbidities. Defined by the World Health Organization(WHO), health promotion is: \n\u201cThe process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. It moves beyond a focus on individual behavior towards a wide range of social and environmental interventions.\u201d \n\nHealth promotion and disease prevention programs often address social determinants of health, which influence modifiable risk behaviors. Social determinants of health are the economic, social, cultural, and political conditions in which people are born, grow, and live that affect health status. Modifiable risk behaviors include, for example, tobacco use, poor eating habits, and lack of physical activity, which contribute to the development of chronic disease. \n\nTypical activities for health promotion, disease prevention, and wellness programs include: communication, education, policy systems and environment. https:\/\/www.ruralhealthinfo.org\/toolkits\/health-promotion\/1\/definition","54e74153":"It's messy.

There was a new virus in the square with the potential to spread quickly. Experts also pointed to the epicenter: the city of Wuhan, China. The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued the warning on January 6. The World Health Organization, on the 9th. The difference between competent traditional bodies and BlueDot is only one: artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Experts also pointed to the epicenter: the city of Wuhan, China. And also correctly predicted that the first cities outside China to notice cases of the virus would be Bangkok, Seoul, Taipei and Tokyo.\n\nBlueDot works with three sources to feed its databases. The news published by journalistic websites in 65 different languages, air traffic and animal epidemiology reports. Crossing the news, sometimes just small notes, with reports of infectious diseases in animals, they are able to notice an epidemic being born. Join the package as the planes come and go and they are able to establish, probabilistically, where the people who were exposed to the new virus are going.\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/imdevskp\/corona-virus-report\/discussion\/128472\nhttps:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/economia\/o-epidemiologista-digital-24220810\n","faa227b9":"Image globalresearch.ca","a063419a":"#Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Programs","d913dca6":"Image cister.fm","0bdd0d8f":"It seems a huge Meteor falling from the sky.
