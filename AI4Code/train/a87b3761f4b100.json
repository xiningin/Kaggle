The **axes** (an instance of the class plt.Axes) is a bounding box with \nticks and labels. It will contain the plot elements that make up the visualization. I have used the variable name fig \nto refer to a figure instance, and ax to refer to an axes instance or group of axes instances.\n","b61bb6db":"## 1. Introduction\n\n\nWhen we want to convey some information to others, there are several ways to do so. The process of conveying the information with the help of plots and graphics is called **Data Visualization**. The plots and graphics take numerical data as input and display output in the form of charts, figures and tables. It helps to analyze and visualize the data clearly and make concrete decisions. It makes complex data more accessible and understandable. The goal of data visualization is to communicate information in a clear and efficient manner.\n\n\nIn this project, I shed some light on **Matplotlib**, which is the basic data visualization tool of Python programming language. Python has different data visualization tools available which are suitable for different purposes. First of all, I will list these data visualization tools and then I will discuss Matplotlib.\n","00e26935":"We can set the **Styles** for Matplotlib plots as follows:-\n\n\n`plt.style.use('seaborn-bright')`\n","0320e6c9":"## 31.

The letters and symbols of the format string are from MATLAB. We can concatenate a color string with a line style string. The default format string is 'b-', which is a solid blue line. For example, to plot the above line with red circles, we would issue the following command:-","1ca9106b":"There are several ways to specify colours, other than by colour abbreviations:\n    \n\u2022\tThe full colour name, such as yellow\n\n\u2022\tHexadecimal string such as ##FF00FF\n\n\u2022\tRGB tuples, for example (1, 0, 1)\n\n\u2022\tGrayscale intensity, in string format such as \u20180.7\u2019.\n","30f07a2d":"## 12.\tMultiline Plots\n\nMultiline Plots mean plotting more than one plot on the same figure.

Contour Plot\n\n\n**Contour plots** are useful to display three-dimensional data in two dimensions using contours or color-coded regions.\n**Contour lines** are also known as **level lines** or **isolines**. **Contour lines** for a function of two variables are \ncurves where the function has constant values. They have specific names beginning with iso- according to the nature of the variables being mapped.\n\n\nThere are lot of applications of **Contour lines** in several fields such as meteorology(for temperature, pressure, rain, wind\nspeed), geography, magnetism, engineering, social sciences and so on.\n\n\nThe density of the lines indicates the **slope** of the function. The **gradient** of the function is always perpendicular to the contour lines. When the lines are close together, the length of the gradient is large and the variation is steep.\n\n\nA **Contour plot** can be created with the **plt.contour()** function as follows:-","790d2dab":"The above code snippet generates a blue dashed line, a green dash-dotted line and a red dotted line.","c7327561":"`plt.plot([1, 3, 2, 4], 'b-')`\n\nThis code line is the actual plotting command.

A MATLAB-style state-based interface and a more powerful object-oriented (OO) interface. \nThe former MATLAB-style state-based interface is called **pyplot interface** and the latter is called **Object-Oriented** interface.\n\n\nThere is a third interface also called **pylab** interface. It merges pyplot (for plotting) and NumPy (for mathematical functions) together in an environment closer to MATLAB. This is considered bad practice nowadays. So, the use of **pylab** is strongly discouraged and hence, I will not discuss it any further.\n","bd082eff":"I have set the **seaborn-bright** style for plots.

Pie Chart\n\n\nPie charts are circular representations, divided into sectors. The sectors are also called **wedges**. The arc length of each sector is proportional to the quantity we are describing. It is an effective way to represent information when we are interested mainly in comparing the wedge against the whole pie, instead of wedges against each other.\n\nMatplotlib provides the **pie()** function to plot pie charts from an array X. Wedges are created proportionally, so that each value x of array X generates a wedge proportional to x\/sum(X).","0906cbcd":"## 29. Handling X and Y ticks\n\n\nVertical and horizontal ticks are those little segments on the axes, coupled with axes labels, used to give a reference system\non the graph.So, they form the origin and the grid lines.\n\nMatplotlib provides two basic functions to manage them - **xticks()** and **yticks()**.\n\nExecuting with no arguments, the tick function returns the current ticks' locations and the labels corresponding to each of them.\n\nWe can pass arguments(in the form of lists) to the ticks functions. The arguments are:-\n\n1. Locations of the ticks\n\n2. Labels to draw at these locations.\n\nWe can demonstrate the usage of the ticks functions in the code snippet below:-\n\n","22387c33":"## 11.

Introduction to Matplotlib\n\n\n**Matplotlib** is the basic plotting library of Python programming language. It is the most prominent tool among Python visualization packages. Matplotlib is highly efficient in performing wide range of tasks. It can produce publication quality figures in a variety of formats.  It can export visualizations to all of the common formats like PDF, SVG, JPG, PNG, BMP and GIF. It can create popular visualization types \u2013 line plot, scatter plot, histogram, bar chart, error charts, pie chart, box plot, and many more types of plot. Matplotlib also supports 3D plotting. Many Python libraries are built on top of Matplotlib. For example, pandas and Seaborn are built on Matplotlib. They allow to access Matplotlib\u2019s methods with less code. \n\n\nThe project **Matplotlib** was started by John Hunter in 2002. Matplotlib was originally started to visualize Electrocorticography (ECoG) data of epilepsy patients during post-doctoral research in Neurobiology. The open-source tool Matplotlib emerged as the most widely used plotting library for the Python programming language. It was used for data visualization during landing of the Phoenix spacecraft in 2008.\n","f9f60c70":"## 5. Displaying Plots in Matplotlib\n\n\nViewing the Matplotlib plot is context based. The best usage of Matplotlib differs depending on how we are using it. \nThere are three applicable contexts for viewing the plots. The three applicable contexts are using plotting from a script, plotting from an IPython shell or plotting from a Jupyter notebook.\n","9f97e555":"## 15.\tLine Plot\n\n\nWe can use the following commands to draw the simple sinusoid line plot:-\n\n","078f90d6":"### Visualization with Pyplot\n\n\nGenerating visualization with Pyplot is very easy. The x-axis values ranges from 0-3 and the y-axis from 1-4. If we provide a single list or array to the plot() command, matplotlib assumes it is a sequence of y values, and automatically generates the x values. Since python ranges start with 0, the default x vector has the same length as y but starts with 0. Hence the x data are [0,1,2,3] and y data are [1,2,3,4].","ca1850f8":"**I hope you find this kernel useful and your <font color=\"red\"><b>UPVOTES<\/b><\/font> would be highly appreciated**","9d62acf2":"The **axis()** command in the example above takes a list of [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and specifies the viewport of the axes.","73e7a509":"## 6. Matplotlib Object Hierarchy\n\n\nThere is an Object Hierarchy within Matplotlib. In Matplotlib, a plot is a hierarchy of nested Python objects. \nA**hierarch** means that there is a tree-like structure of Matplotlib objects underlying each plot.\n\n\nA **Figure** object is the outermost container for a Matplotlib plot. The **Figure** object contain multiple **Axes** objects. So, the **Figure** is the final graphic that may contain one or more **Axes**. The **Axes** represent an individual plot.\n\n\nSo, we can think of the **Figure** object as a box-like container containing one or more **Axes**. The **Axes** object contain smaller objects such as tick marks, lines, legends, title and text-boxes.\n","1bbd1c2f":"## 30. Adding labels\n\n\nAnother important piece of information to add to a plot is the axes labels, since they specify the type of data we are plotting.","07238081":"## 14.\tSaving the Plot\n\n\nWe can save the figures in a wide variety of formats. We can save them using the **savefig()** command as follows:-\n\n\n`fig.savefig(\u2018fig1.png\u2019)`\n\n\n\nWe can explore the contents of the file using the IPython **Image** object.\n\n\n\n`from IPython.display import Image`\n\n\n`Image(\u2018fig1.png\u2019)`\n\n\nIn **savefig()** command, the file format is inferred from the extension of the given filename.

It starts an event loop, \nlooks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display the figure or figures.\n\n\nThe **plt.show()** command should be used only once per Python session. It should be used only at the end of the script. Multiple **plt.show()** commands can lead to unpredictable results and should mostly be avoided.\n","58df7375":"## 10. Figure and Subplots\n\n\n\nPlots in Matplotlib reside within a Figure object. As described earlier, we can create a new figure with plt.figure() \nas follows:-\n\n\n`fig = plt.figure()`\n\n\nNow, I create one or more subplots using fig.add_subplot() as follows:-\n\n\n`ax1 = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, 1)`\n\n\nThe above command means that there are four plots in total (2 * 2 = 4).

It will take an arbitrary number of arguments. For example, to plot x versus y, \nwe can issue the following command:-","a58c417b":"## 8. Pyplot API \n\n\n**Matplotlib.pyplot** provides a MATLAB-style, procedural, state-machine interface to the underlying object-oriented library in Matplotlib. **Pyplot** is a collection of command style functions that make Matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure - e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure etc. \n\n\n**Matplotlib.pyplot** is stateful because the underlying engine keeps track of the current figure and plotting area information and plotting functions change that information. To make it clearer, we did not use any object references during our plotting we just issued a pyplot command, and the changes appeared in the figure.\n\n\nWe can get a reference to the current figure and axes using the following commands-\n\n\n`plt.gcf ( )`   # get current figure\n\n`plt.gca ( )`   # get current axes \n\n \n**Matplotlib.pyplot** is a collection of commands and functions that make Matplotlib behave like MATLAB (for plotting). \nThe MATLAB-style tools are contained in the pyplot (plt) interface. \n\nThis is really helpful for interactive plotting, because we can issue a command and see the result immediately. But, it is not suitable for more complicated cases. For these cases, we have another interface called **Object-Oriented** interface, described later.\n","74cad589":"## 9.\tObject-Oriented API\n\n\nThe **Object-Oriented API** is available for more complex plotting situations. It allows us to exercise more control over the figure. In Pyplot API, we depend on some notion of an \"active\" figure or axes. But, in the **Object-Oriented API** the plotting functions are methods of explicit Figure and Axes objects.\n\n\n**Figure** is the top level container for all the plot elements. We can think of the **Figure** object as a box-like container containing one or more **Axes**. \n\n\nThe **Axes** represent an individual plot. The **Axes** object contain smaller objects such as axis, tick marks, lines, legends, title and text-boxes.\n","3c28cece":"The optional **bottom** parameter of the plt.bar() function allows us to specify a starting position for a bar. Instead of running from zero to a value, it will go from the bottom to value. The first call to plt.bar() plots the blue bars. The second call to plt.bar() plots the red bars, with the bottom of the red bars being at the top of the blue bars."}}
