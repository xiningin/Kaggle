To further improve their experience with this product, we try to personalize it to their needs. For this we have to look up at their past interactions with this product.\n\n*In one line* -> **Specialized content for everyone.**\n\n*For further info, [Wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Recommender_system#:~:text=A%20recommender%20system%2C%20or%20a,would%20give%20to%20an%20item.)*\n\n## Types of Recommender System\n\n* 1). Popularity Based\n* 2). Classification Based\n* 3). Content Based\n* 4). Collaborative Based\n* 5). Hybrid Based (Content + Collaborative)\n* 6).

This is particularly useful when you don't have past data as a reference to recommend product to the user. \n\n# Import packages and dataset","4682e36a":"# Data Preprocessing\n\nDataset contains no column headers.
