We can now do both training and inference using the native darknet program (https:\/\/github.com\/AlexeyAB\/darknet).\n\nHope this dataset could be helpful to the others and ease the pain.\n\n\n**Note:**\nThe Dockerfile that I used to prebuilt darknet:\n - https:\/\/github.com\/guitarmind\/dockerfiles\/blob\/master\/deepo\/18.04\/Dockerfile\n - https:\/\/hub.docker.com\/repository\/docker\/guitarmind\/deepo"}}
