The plot involving `cylinders` seems to indicate that that variable wouldn't be as helpful on on its own. The small number of possibilities for the number of engine cylinders (3, 4, 5, 6, or 8) results in a lot of overlap, though there is a very prononunced peak that indicates a large number of cars with above-median fuel efficiency have four-cylinder engines.

Looking at the confusion matrix compared to $k = 3$ above, we see that all of the additional errors come from false positives.\n\nWhile we would need more precisely determine the metrics by which we would choose our preferred model and then perform further testing, such as cross validation, to more confidently choose a model, it seems as if there are two likely frontrunners to choose: logistic regression using all of the predictors aside from `CHAS`, and $k$-nearest neighbors using $k = 3$ the same set of predictors. The strength of the logistic regression model lies in relative simplicity and interpretability compared to KNN, as well as the fact that it had the second lowest overall test error out of the models we explored. The KNN classifier had slightly lower overall test error, but had a much better positive predictive value than logistic regression, at least when logistic regression used a prediction threshold of 0.5.

This is a solid improvement over linear discriminant analysis using the same predictors, and suggests that relaxing the assuption of a common covariance matrix for both classes to assuming each class has its own covariance matrix is a more accurate assumption about the data.

Thinking a little more about the idea of using a weighted average, it makes sense that the performance with logistic regression won't provide an improvement over what we did in Part 4, since the weighted average is still a linear combination of the variables. We already saw that in a logistic regression model, `Lag2` was the only statistically significant coefficient, and even then it is borderline at the 5% significance level, so the weighted average includes variables which we already had reason to believe weren't particularly helpful in making a strong model. I'll still try out the remaining methods with `weighted_lag_avg` before trying out one other combination of the predictors.

One thing that I would be cautious of, though, is the fact that aside from KNN, the other three models very strongly preferred to predict up weeks, and therefore had high false positive rates. This might be okay for an investor who is comfortable with taking more risks and has can afford losing money to down weeks that were incorrectly predicted to be up weeks, but a risk-averse investor would probably want to use a less aggressive model, or at least require a higher probability threshold than 50% before accepting a prediction of an up week.","4467ec35":"In order to produce a confusion matrix that helps us better visualize the incorrect predictions, we use seaborn to convert the confusion matrix into a [heatmap](http:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.heatmap.html?highlight=heatmap#seaborn.heatmap).","1d343603":"## Part 3\n**Split the data into a training set and a test set.**","00703788":"The logistic regression model using fewer predictors (`CMEDV`, `INDUS`, `NOX`, `AGE`, `DIS`, `RAD`, `TAX`, `B`, and `LSTAT`) performed slightly worse, with an overall test error of 8.66%.

In addition, as we saw in Applied Exercise 8 from Chapter 3, every predictor aside from `CHAS` had a statistically significant association with `CRIM` when we performed univariate linear regressions. While we should first explore the data graphically, there are two possible subsets of predictors that immeidately jump out as candidates for use in producing models to predict whether or not a given suburb has a per capita crime rate above the median. First would be to use all of the predictors aside from `CHAS` and second would be to use the predictors with a correlation magnitude of at least 0.3 (`CMEDV`, `INDUS`, `NOX`, `AGE`, `DIS`, `RAD`, `TAX`, `B`, and `LSTAT`). We will make models using both subsets of predictors to compare the predictive strength of the various models.

I also need to be careful of the different scales used to measure the various predictors, since variables such as `weight` are on the order of thousands of pounds while `displacement` is on the order of tens or hundreds of cubic inches.

This means that the model correctly predicted the direction for 611 weeks out of the 1089 for an accuracy of 0.5611. While this seems to be better than random chance, it is important to note that the model was trained on the entire data set, so 0.5611 is the *training* accuracy. Moreover, a naive strategy of simply saying that every week will be an up week would have resulted in 605 correctly predicted weeks out of 1089, which is a very similar level of overall accuracy.\n\nTo look a little closer at the confusion matrix, let's assume that our goal is to correctly predict when the market will go up. In this case, up weeks will be considered as positive ($+$) and down weeks as negative ($-$). Having set this convention, we can now consider four important quantities associated with the confusion matrix: true positive rate (i.e. *sensitivity* or *recall*), false positive rate, positive predictive value (i.e. *precision*), and negative predictive value. The true positive rate is the number of correctly predicted positives divided by the overall number of positives -- the number of correctly predicted up weeks (557) over the total number of up weeks (605) for a value of $557\/605 \\approx 0.92$ for this model. While this is a pretty high value, which is good, the false positive rate -- the number of incorrectly predicted positives (weeks incorrectly predicted to be up weeks = 430 weeks) divided by the overall number of negatives (the total number of down weeks = 484 weeks) -- is comparably high at $430\/484 \\approx 0.888$, which might be quite bad depending on our sensitivity to losing money on an incorrectly predicted down week. Next is the positive predictive value, which is the number of true positives divided by the total number of predicted positives; in our case this is $557\/987 \\approx 0.564$. This is better than chance, but as already noted we would have a comparable positive predictive value if we just predicted that every week would be an up week.

What is the test error of the model obtained?**","73d28709":"To have consistency with my results for when I do these exercises in Python, I'll use the corrected Boston housing data set instead of the one that is part of the `MASS` library.","4215a914":"First, I made boxplots to compare the overall distributions for each of the quantitative variables between cars with above-median mpg and those with below median-mpg. Starting in the upper-left corner, we see that aside from some outliers, the the majority of cars with above-median mpg have four-cylinder engines. Moving to the upper-middle pair of boxplots, at least 75% of the cars with above-median mpg have smaller engines than 75% of the cars with below-median mpg. This is also true for horsepower (upper-right pair of boxplots) and weight (lower-left pair of boxplots). We also see in the final two pairs of boxplots, for acceleration and manufacture year, that while there are definitely differences between cars with above-median mpg and those with below-median mpg, the differences aren't as strong compared to the first four predictors. In particular, there is a lot more overlap in both time to reach 60mpg and manufacture year between the two categories of cars, whereas for the other predictors there is almost no overlap for the boxplots between the two categories. This suggests that `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`, and `weight` will be the most useful in predicting `mpg_med`.","0aa4ac11":"When using logistic regression to predict `mpg_med` using `cylinders`, `displacement`, `horsepower`, `weight`, `year`, and `origin`, we had an overall test error of 10.2%, which is comparable to the test errors we have obtained thus far with the other methods.","24adaeff":"## Part 2\n**Create a new function, `Power2()` that allows you to pass *any* two numbers, `x` and `a`, and prints out the value of `x^a`.

While it would be best to compare these different models using additional tools, such as computing ROC curves and AUC scores for each model, I'll save that for Chapter 9 when we discuss how to produce them in R more in depth. For now, it looks like as far as using `weighted_lag_avg` to make predictions goes, the most-promising model is QDA with a prediction threshold of 60%. \n\nIf I have time to revisit this exercise in the future, I think it would be intersting to try out a different weighting strategy, where each lag variable is weighted based on the number of shares during the corresponding week of trading.","fdcb0bc6":"## Part 3\n**Using the `Power2()` function that you just wrote, compute $10^3$, $8^{17}$, and $131^3$.**"}}
