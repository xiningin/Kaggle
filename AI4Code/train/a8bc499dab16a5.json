Demonstration of main Pandas methods\nWell... There are dozens of cool tutorials on Pandas and visual data analysis. If you are already familiar with these topics, you can wait for the 3rd article in the series, where we get into machine learning.  \n\n**[Pandas](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org)** is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.xlsx`. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, `Pandas` provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.\n\nThe main data structures in `Pandas` are implemented with **Series** and **DataFrame** classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of `Series` instances. `DataFrames` are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (examples, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features of these instances.","67074562":"**How much time (on average) do churned users spend on the phone during daytime?**","b995d66b":"\nWe see that, with *International Plan*, the churn rate is much higher, which is an interesting observation!

Let's also make a summary table and a picture.","3bbe1099":"DataFrames can be indexed by column name (label) or row name (index) or by the serial number of a row.

In the second case, we say *\"give us the values of the first five rows in the first three columns\"* (as in a typical Python slice: the maximal value is not included).","17b72391":"#  **Predicting the Telecom Churn**","1fed84a5":"\n1. First, the `groupby` method divides the `grouping_columns` by their values. They become a new index in the resulting dataframe.\n2. Then, columns of interest are selected (`columns_to_show`). If `columns_to_show` is not included, all non groupby clauses will be included.\n3. Finally, one or several functions are applied to the obtained groups per selected columns.\n\nHere is an example where we group the data according to the values of the `Churn` variable and display statistics of three columns in each group:","18a15e0b":"Although it's not so obvious from the summary table, it's easy to see from the above plot that the churn rate increases sharply from 4 customer service calls and above.\n\nNow let's add a binary feature to our DataFrame \u2013 `Customer service calls > 3`.

Here, there are none because each column contains 3333 observations, the same number of rows we saw before with `shape`.\n\nWe can **change the column type** with the `astype` method.
