We could plot more molecule structures, but let's focus on other aspects of the data now. ","419f70ad":"There are some couplings that are more usual than others. 3JHC and 2JHC are the most common, followed by 1JHC. Couplings between Hydrogen and Nitrogen atoms are less frequent. ","4453dac9":"By selecting a random sample of 5 rows, they have their type in common. Is this a general rule?","d9d2bd31":"Several 1JHC are in this group, with a small set of 1JHN and 3JHC. It is worth checking the number of each type in the whole training set.","b7175fdf":"We see two clearly different distributions of coupling constants. One around 0 and one around 80. What could be different?","5602700a":"The test set structure is the same as the training except that we don't have the `scalar_coupling_constant` column. Among the other datasets, the most promising seems to be structures.csv, as it is the only one that is available for both training and testing sets. All the other dataframes are available only for the former.","806d2bd0":"Actually this is not general, as there are 1JHN and 3JHC as well (but no 2JHC). Let's check the distribution.","d95c1426":"That's interesting. ALL 1JHC couplings are above 60. This must be good to leverage in our predictive models. Just a really small number of 3JHC are above this threshold, so this is extremely rare for this type of coupling. Perhaps this will turn out to be a good feature to use in our models.","9b0462fb":"The training has an id for each row, the name of the molecule where the coupling constant originates (the corresponding XYZ file is located at .\/structures\/.xyz).`atom_index_0` and `atom_index_1` is the atom indices of the atom-pair creating the coupling. `type` is the type of the coupling and `scalar_coupling_constant` is the scalar coupling constant that we want to be able to predict.","accb3a78":"The first molecule is methane (CH4). Let's check its structure using plotly.","06605975":"Let's start by doing a simple analysis of the data."}}
