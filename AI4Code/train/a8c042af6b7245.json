This can lead to a model that has great accuracy but does have any added value in practice. Two possible strategies to deal with this problem are:\n\n* oversampling records with target=1\n* undersampling records with target=0\n\nThere are many more strategies of course and MachineLearningMastery.com gives a nice overview. As we have a rather large training set, we can go for undersampling.","1cd1c2fb":"### Descriptive statistics\n\nWe can also apply the describe method on the dataframe.

With Sklearn's SelectFromModel you can then specify how many variables you want to keep. You can set a threshold on the level of feature importance manually. But we'll simply select the top 50% best variables.\n\n> The code in the cell below is borrowed from the GitHub repo of Sebastian Raschka. This repo contains code samples of his book Python Machine Learning, which is an absolute must to read.","d086ec23":"#### Checking the cardinality of the categorical variables\n\nCardinality refers to the number of different values in a variable. As we will create dummy variables from the categorical variables later on, we need to check whether there are variables with many distinct values. We should handle these variables differently as they would result in many dummy variables.","4e3df435":"We indeed see the following \n* binary variables\n* categorical varibales of which the category values are integers\n* other variables with integer or float values\n* variables with -1 represening missing values\n* the target variable and an ID variable","2f4ccce5":"#### reg variables\n* only ps_reg_03 has missing values\n* the range (min to max) differs between the variables. We could apply scaling (e.g. StandardScaler), but it depends on the classifier we will want to use.\n\n#### car variables\n* ps_car_12 and ps_car_15 have missing values\n* again, the range differs and we could apply scaling.\n\n#### calc variables\n* no missing values\n* this seems to be some kind of ratio as the maximum is 0.9\n* all three _calc variables have very similar distributions\n\n#### Overall, we can see that the range of the interval variables is rather small. Perhaps some transformation (e.g. log) is already applied in order to anonymize the data?","884be8ce":"There are a strong correlations between the variables:\n\n* ps_reg_02 and ps_reg_03 (0.7)\n* ps_car_12 and ps_car13 (0.67)\n* ps_car_12 and ps_car14 (0.58)\n* ps_car_13 and ps_car15 (0.67)\n\nSeaborn has some handy plots to visualize the (linear) relationship between variables. We could use a pairplot to visualize the relationship between the variables. But because the heatmap already showed the limited number of correlated variables, we'll look at each of the highly correlated variables separately.\n\n**NOTE:** I take a sample of the train data to speed up the process.","1eb03603":"### Data quality checks\n\n#### checking missing values\nMissing are represented as -1","1ea54553":"#### Creating interaction variables","a54bf8cf":"#### Feature scaling\nAs mentioned before, we can apply standard scaling to the training data. Some classifiers perform better when this is done.","b37f3e07":"## Feature Selection\n\n#### Removing features with low or zero variance\n\nPersonally, I prefer to let the classifier algorithm chose which features to keep. But there is one thing that we can do ourselves. That is removing features with no or a very low variance. Sklearn has a handy method to do that: VarianceThreshold. By default it removes features with zero variance. This will not be applicable for this competition as we saw there are no zero-variance variables in the previous steps. But if we would remove features with less than 1% variance, we would remove 31 variables.","df466a40":"As we can see from the variables with missing values, it is a good idea to keep the missing values as a separate category value, instead of replacing them by the mode for instance. The customers with a missing value appear to have a much higher (in some cases much lower) probability to ask for an insurance claim.\n\n#### Interval variables\n\nChecking the correlations between interval variables. A heatmap is a good way to visualize the correlation between variables. The code below is based on an example by Michael Waskom"}}
