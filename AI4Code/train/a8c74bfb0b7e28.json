You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nWe also include gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like..<\/p>\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\/data\">https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\/data<\/a>  \n<\/div>","abfc1672":"## Importing Python Libraries  \ud83d\udcd8\n- Libraries are important and we call them to perform the different actions on our data and for training the models.\n- Its a first step to load the library to perform the specific task","e715cf49":"<center><img src = \"https:\/\/i.gifer.com\/5SlH.gif\"><\/center>","ebae9376":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">  \n \n<hr>\n<b>Objectives: <\/b> \n<hr> \n    <p> \n<li> Uncover the insights in the data using <strong>Data exploration<\/strong><\/li>\n<li> Visualize those insights using <strong>Data visulaization<\/strong> <\/li>\n<li> The main thing we'll do is use <strong>PyCaret<\/strong> which is a low level Open source library to use different algo with small piece of code <\/li><\/p>\n   \n<\/div>","bb022ec4":"As PyCaret module is not preinstalled we'll install it using ***!pip install pycaret***","538e6361":"## Data Exploration \/ Exploratory data analysis \ud83d\udd0e","08a67d8b":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">  \n \n<hr>\n<b>Source of Data: <\/b> \n<hr> \n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\/data\">https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\/data<\/a>\n   \n<\/div>","39c82b93":"\n<p><center> <h1>Predictive Analysis using PyCaret .<\/h1><\/center> <\/p>\n<center><img src= \"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*Cku5-rqmqSIuhUyFkIAdIA.png\" width = 600px height=300px> <\/center>","68e8d0b9":"It is evident that not many passengers survived the accident. \n\nOut of 891 passengers in training set, only around 350 survived i.e Only **38.4%** of the total training set survived the crash.
