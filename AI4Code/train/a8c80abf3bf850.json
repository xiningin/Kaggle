drop them before the training step because this may help us to avoid the overfitting. So, we are going to drop the Fuel Price, which has high correlation with the Year. We will keep the size and the type, which have high correlation with each other, because they have a relatively high correlation (if compared with the others).\nIn addition to that, the MarkDown features have a lot of missing values and a low correlation with the weekly sales, so we are also going to drop them.","c41302e3":"The Stores with type A and B have higher weekly sales.

This is not the best encoder due to the fact that the Machine Learning model may interpret an order in that sequence, but it has some interesting characteristics which are: (i) simplicity and that (ii) the model do not add new features, which is highly desireble because can avoid increasing the overfitting.

That can be seen due to the fact that the RF resulted in the smallest training and testing errors. In addition to that the RF was faster than the neural networks. \n\nLet's try to improve even more that model. We have seen that the Random Forest had some overfitting, so we are going to remove some features and see if this improve the model. We have chosen those values because they have very low correlation with the Weekly Sales.
