She departed at 19.00 carrying 989 passengers and crew, as well as vehicles, and was due to dock at 09.30 the following morning, Tragically, the Estonia never arrived.\n\nThe weather was typically stormy for the time of year but, like all the other scheduled ferries on that day, the Estonia set off as usual. At roughly 01:00 a worrying sound of screeching metal was heard, but an immediate inspection of the bow visor showed nothing untoward. The ship suddenly listed 15 minutes later and soon alarms were sounding, including the lifeboat alarm. Shortly afterwards the Estonia rolled drastically to starboard. Those who had reached the decks had a chance of survival but those who had not were doomed as the angled corridors had become death traps. A Mayday signal was sent but power failure meant the ship\u2019s position was given imprecisely. The Estonia disappeared from the responding ships\u2019 radar screens at about 01:50.\n\nThe Marietta arrived at the scene at 02:12 and the first helicopter at 03:05. Of the 138 people rescued alive, one died later in hospital.\n\nOf the 310 people who had reached the decks, almost a third died of hypothermia. The final death toll was shockingly high \u2013 more than 850 people.\n\nAn official inquiry found that failure of the locks on the bow visor, which broke away under the punishing waves, caused water to flood the car deck and quickly capsize the ship. The report also noted a lack of action, delay in sounding the alarm, lack of guidance from the bridge and a failure to light distress flares.\n\nThe sinking of the Estonia was Europe\u2019s worst postwar maritime disaster.\n\nRead more: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MS_Estonia","38396d76":"### Conclusion\nThe data is very unbalanced for the predict of death, as the number of surivors are very low!!!","b7f2e6e6":"<h1><center>Estonia Disaster \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udea2\ud83c\udf0a <h1>","1b31d8de":"# Gradient Boost","6009964f":"### If you find this notebook usefull then treat me with an upvote","d74353f4":"## Facts:\nWhen was the Sinking of the Estonia: September 28, 1994\nWhere was the Sinking of the Estonia: Near the Turku Archipelago, in the Baltic Sea\nWhat was the Sinking of the Estonia death toll: 852 passengers and crew\n\nInteresting things to investigate about the data:\n\nWho's more likely to survive the sinking based on data?\nIs age an indicator for survival?\nIs gender an indicator for survival?\nDid the crew aboard have a higher chance of survival than passengers?\nSince the death toll is well above 80%, can you make a classifier that beats the baseline (all passengers died)","1ff7ff80":"# Random Forest","84e3fb63":"# LGBM Classifier","27d49fcc":" <p><center>If you find this notebook usefull then feel free to treat me with an upvote :)<\/p>\n","fe98728a":"<img src=\"https:\/\/newsnowfinland.fi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/43124752235_dcd902d7f9_z.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" align=\"center\"\/>\n","662c4eab":"# XGB Classifier"}}
