While agriculture\u2019s share in India\u2019s economy has progressively declined to less than 15% due to the high growth rates of the industrial and services sectors, the sector\u2019s importance in India\u2019s economic and social fabric goes well beyond this indicator.\n\n# Objective \nLet us analyze the Indian Agriculture crop production for the data collected from 1997 to 2022.
