This brings us back to the 4th point \"Lack of openness\" which highlights the importance of making code available to the entire community.\n\nInterestingly it was observed, that especially the best researchers -- those from elite universities with highest impact papers -- are often [transitioning to industry](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1bwJDRC777rAf00Drthi9yT2c9b0MabWO5ZlksfvFzx8\/edit#slide=id.gf171287819_0_422).\n\nSince the Kaggle survey data does not provide insight into all these aspects, we focus on the following observations:<br>\n* [Companies are investing more in AI](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1bwJDRC777rAf00Drthi9yT2c9b0MabWO5ZlksfvFzx8\/edit#slide=id.gf171287819_0_3261)\n* There is an attitude towards [\"AI-first products\"](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1bwJDRC777rAf00Drthi9yT2c9b0MabWO5ZlksfvFzx8\/edit#slide=id.gf171287819_0_3333)\n* The industry focus has [transitioned towards model deployment and focus on model performance in production](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1bwJDRC777rAf00Drthi9yT2c9b0MabWO5ZlksfvFzx8\/edit#slide=id.gf171287819_0_260)","ad943011":"## Conclusion\n\nLet's conclude by revising the statements of the [**State of AI Report 2021**](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1bwJDRC777rAf00Drthi9yT2c9b0MabWO5ZlksfvFzx8\/edit#slide=id.gf171287819_0_165) and checking the alignment with the Kaggle survey results:\n\n| Statement | Confirmed |\n| :- | :-: |\n| 1.

The total number of users from China is too low in order to make reliable statements. However, a judgement about quality of research is not possible with the given data.\n2.

The situation has not changed much, with a small tendency towards companies deploying less their ML models in production.\n\nRelevant aspects that could not be enlightened with the survey data are:\n* the usage of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and GNN being one of the hottest topics in ML research\n* AI safety and alignment\n* Sustainability issues\n\nIt would be interesting to investigate these aspect in the coming year 2022.","0c54f9ac":"### 4.
