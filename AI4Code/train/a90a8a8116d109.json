More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips. <br>\n    The earliest breast cancers, however are detected by a <strong> mammogram <\/strong>  <\/p> \n\n<p> In its early stages, breast cancer may not cause any symptoms. In many cases, a tumor may be too small to be felt, but an abnormality can still be seen on a mammogram. If a tumor can be felt, the first sign is usually a new lump in the breast that was not there before. However, not all lumps are cancer. \nAlso, lumps found in the lymph nodes located in the armpits may also indicate breast cancer. <\/p> \n\n<p> Each type of breast cancer can cause a variety of symptoms. Many of these symptoms are similar, but some can be different. Symptoms for the most common breast cancers include:\n    \n<ul> \n    \n   <li> A breast lump or tissue thickening that feels different than surrounding tissue and has developed recently <\/li> \n   <li> Breast pain <\/li> \n   <li> Red, pitted skin over your entire breast <\/li> \n   <li> Swelling in all part of your breast <\/li> \n   <li> A nipple discharge other than breast milk <\/li> \n   <li> Bloody discharge from your nipple <\/li> \n   <li> Peeling, scaling, or flaking of skin on your nipple or breast <\/li> \n   <li> A sudden, unexplained change in the shape or size of your breast <\/li> \n   <li> Inverted nipple <\/li> \n   <li> Changes to the apperance of the skin on your breasts <\/li> \n   <li> A lump or swelling under your arm <\/li> \n          \n<\/ul>\n<\/p> \n\n<p> Most <b> breast lumps <\/b> are not cancerous. However, women should visit a doctor for an examination if they notice a lump on the breast. <\/p>\n\n<h2> Types Of Breast Cancer<\/h2>\n<hr>\n<p> There are several types of breast cancer, and they are broken into two main categories which are: \n    <ol> \n        <li> Invasive <\/li> \n        <li> Non-Invasive <\/li> \n    <\/ol> \nWhile invasive cancer has spread from the breast ducts or glands to other parts of the breast, noninvasive cancer has not spread from the original tissue. These two categories are used to describe the most common types of breast cancer, which include: \n    <ul> \n    <li> <b>Ductal Carcinoma in situ:<\/b> <p> Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition. With DCIS, the cancer cells are confined to the ducts in your breast and haven't invaded the surrounding breast tissue. <\/p> <\/li>\n    <li> <b> Lobular Carcinoma in situ: <\/b> <p> Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is cancer that grows in the milk-producing glands of your breast. Like DCIS, the cancer cells haven't invaded the surrounding tissue. <\/p> <\/li>\n    <li> <b> Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: <\/b> <p> Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer. This type of breast cancer begins in your breast's milk ducts and then invades nearby tissue in the breast. Once the breast cancer has spread to the tissue outside your milk ducts, it can begin to spread to other nearby organs and tissue. <\/p> <\/li>\n    <li> <b> Invasive Lobular Carcinoma <\/b> <p> Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) firsts develops in the breast's lobules and has invaded nearby tissue. <\/p> <\/li> \n    <\/ul>\n        \n# Diagnosis Of Breast Cancer\n\n<hr>\n    \n<p> To determine if your symptoms are caused by breast cancer or a benign breast condition, your doctor will do a thorough physical exam in addition to a breast exam. They may also request one or more diagnostic tests to help understand what's causing the symptoms. \nTests that can help diagnose breast cancer include:\n    <ol>\n        <li> <h4> Mammogram: <\/h4> <p> The most common way to see below the surface of your breast is with an imaging test called a <b> mammogram. <\/b> Many women aged 40 and older get annual mammograms to check for breast cancer. if your doctor suspects you may have tumor or suspicious spot, they will also request a mammogram. <\/p> <\/li> \n        <li> <h4> Ultrasound: <\/h4> <p> A breast ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the tissues deep in your breast. An ultrasound can help your doctor distinguish between a solid mass, such as a tumor, and a benign cyst. <\/p> <\/li> \n        <li> <h4> Breast Biopsy: <\/h4> <p> If the doctor suspects breast cancer, he\/she may order both a mammogram and an ultrasound. If both of these tests can't tell the doctor the presence of cancer in the breast tissues, then the doctor may do a test called a <b>Breast biopsy.<\/b>  \nDuring this test, your doctor will remove a tissue sample from the suspicious area to have it tested. There are several types of breast biopsies. With some of these tests, the doctor uses a needle to take the tissue sample. With others, they make an incision in the breast and then remove the sample. \nThe doctor will send the tissue sample to a laboratory. If the sample test positive for breast cancer, the lab can test it further to tell the doctor what type of cancer is present. <\/p> <\/li> \n        <\/ol> \n        \n    \n<h2> Survival Rate Of Breast Cancer<\/h2> \n<hr>\n\n<p> Breast cancer survival rates vary widely based on many factors. Two of the most important factors are the type of cancer you have and the stage of the cancer at the time you receive a diagnosis. Other factors that may play a role include your age, gender, and race.\n\nThe good news is breast cancer survival rates are improving. According to the ACS, in 1975, the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer in women was 75.2 percent. But for women diagnosed between 2008 and 2014, it was 90.6 percent. Five-year survival rates for breast cancer differ depending on stage at diagnosis, ranging from 99 percent for localized, early-stage cancers to 27 percent for advanced, metastatic cancers. <\/p> \n        \n        \n# Prevention Of Breast Cancer \n\n<hr>\n<ol>\n    <li> <b> Lifestyle Factors <\/b> <\/li>\n    <p> Lifestyle factors can affect the risk of breast cancer. For instance, women who are obese have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Maintaining a healthy diet and getting more exercise could help you lose weight and lower your risk. <\/p>\n<p> Drinking too much alcohol also increases the risk. This is true of having two or more drinks per day, and of binge drinking. However, one study found that even one drink per day increases the risk of breast cancer. <\/p>\n    <li> <b> Breast Cancer Screening <\/b> <\/li> \n    <p> Having regular mammograms may not prevent breast cancer, but it can help reduce the odds that it will go undetected. The American College of Physicians (ACP) provides the following general recommendations for women at average risk for breast cancer:\n    <ul>\n        <li> <b> Women ages 40 to 49: <\/b> An annual mammogram isn't recommended, but women should discuss their preference with their doctors. <\/li> \n        <li> <b> Women ages 50 to 74: <\/b> A mammogram every other year is recommended. <\/li> \n        <li> <b> Women 75 and older: <\/b> Mammogram are no longer recommended. <\/li> \n    <\/ul> \n<\/ol> \n\n<p> The ACP also recommends against mammograms for women with a life expectancy of 10 years or less. <\/p> \n    \n<h2> Preemptive Treatment Of Breast Cancer <\/h2> \n<hr>\n\n<p> Some women are at increased risk of breast cancer due to hereditary factors. For instance, if your mother or father has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, you\u2019re at higher risk of having it as well. This significantly raises your risk of breast cancer.\n\nIf you\u2019re at risk for this mutation, talk to your doctor about your diagnostic and prophylactic treatment options. You may want to be tested to find out if you definitely have the mutation. And if you learn that you do have it, discuss with your doctor any preemptive steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting breast cancer. These steps could include a prophylactic mastectomy (surgical removal of a breast). <\/p> \n\n\n# Reference: \n\n<hr>\n\n<p> <b>Healthline Contributors<\/b>, Medically reviewed by Yamini Ranchod PhD, MS (2019).

XGBoost Model <\/h3> \n<hr>\n\n<p> XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance that is dominant competitive machine learning. XGBoost stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting. <\/p> ","56a4ad8e":"# Breast Cancer \n\n<hr>\n \n ![breast_cancer_4.jpg](attachment:breast_cancer_4.jpg)\n\n<p> Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled way.<\/p> \n\n<p> <strong> Breast cancer<\/strong> is a cancer that develops in breast cells. Typically, the cancer forms in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast. Lobules are the glands that produce milk, and ducts are the pathways that bring the milk from the glands to the nipple. <\/p> \n<p> Cancer can also occur in the fatty tissue or the fibrous connective tissue within the breast. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly-inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. <\/p> \n\n# Risk Factors Of Breast Cancer\n<hr>\n \n<p> The <b>Risk factors<\/b> for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, a lack of physical exercise, alcoholism, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, an early age at first menstruation, having childern late in life or not at all, having prior history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer. \nThe exact cause of breast cancer remains unclear, but some risk factors make it more likely. And it is possible to prevent some of these risk factors.\n<ol>\n    <li><h4>Age: <\/h4> <\/li>\n    <p> The risk of breast cancer increases with age.At 20 years, the chance of developing breast cancer in the next decade is 0.06%. By the age of 70 years, this figure goes up to 3.84%. <\/p>\n    <li><h4>Genetics: <\/h4> <\/li> \n    <p> Women who carry certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have a higher chance of developng breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or both. People inherit these genes from their parents. Mutations in the TP53 gene also have links to increased breast cancer risk. \n        if a close relative has or had breast cancer, a person's chance of developing breast cancer increases. <\/p>\n    <li> <h4> Previous History of Breast Cancer: <\/h4> <\/li> \n    <p> Women who have previously had breast cancer are more likely to have it again than those who have no history of the disease. \nHaving some types of noncancerous breast lump increases the chance of developing cancer later on. Examples include a typical <b>ductal hyperplasia<\/b> or <b>lobular carcinoma<\/b> in situ. <\/p> \n    <li> <h4> Dense Breast Tissue: <\/h4> <\/li> \n    <p> Women with more dense breasts are more likely to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer. <\/p>\n    <li> <h4> Estrogen Exposure And Breastfeeding: <\/h4> <\/li>\n    <p> Extended exposure to estrogen appears to increase the risk of breast cancer. This could be due to a person starting their periods earlier or entering <b> Menopause <\/b> at a later than average age. Between these times, estrogen levels are higher. \n        Breastfeeding, especially for over 1 year, appears to <b>reduce the chance <\/b> of developing breast cancer. This is possible due to the drop in estrogen exposure that follows pregnancy and breastfeeding. <\/p>\n    <li> <h4> Body Weight: <\/h4> <\/li> \n    <p> Women who become overweight or develop obesity after menopause may also have a higher chance of developing breast cancer, possible due to increased estrogen levels. High sugar intake may also be a factor <\/p> \n    <li> <h4> Alcohol Consumption: <\/h4> <\/li> \n    <p> A higher rate of regular alcohol consumption appears to play a role in breast cancer development. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), studies have consistently found that women who consume alcohol have a <b> HIGHER RISK <\/b> of breast cancer than those who do not. Those who drink moderate to heavy levels of alcohol have a higher risk than light drinkers. <\/p> \n    <li> <h4> Radiation Exposure: <\/h4> <\/li>\n    <p> Undergoing radiation treatment for a differnt cancer may <b> increase the risk <\/b> of developing breast cancer later in life. <\/p> \n    <li> <h4> Hormone Treatments: <\/h4> <\/li> \n    <p> According to the NCI, studies have shown that oral contraceptives may <b> slightly increase the risk <\/b> of breast cancer. \n        According to the <b>ACS<\/b>, studies have found that <b> Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) <\/b>, specifically <b>estrogen-progesterone therapy (EPT)<\/b>, is related to an <b> Increased Risk <\/b> of breast cancer. <\/p>    \n<\/ol>     \n<\/p> \n\n<p> The uncontrolled cancer cells often invade other healthly breast tissue and can travel to the lymph nodes under the arms.
