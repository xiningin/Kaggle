With all 196 species being present, there is simply not enough variability in the area of the wells that are correlated to any certain species. For a more satisfying result, one could limit the sample to the top 2 or 3 species and be much more successful at predicting the species.","830f9795":"### Distribution, Central Tendancy, and Dispertion (visual)","8fcc60f8":"In our model, we restrict the number of features to two in order to avoid over-fitting the model,\n* Label\/Target: Species\n* Feature: Width of the well\n* Feature: Length of the well\n","49c8d5dd":"## Introduction\nIn this kernel I will performing basic data cleaning and visualization for the top species planted by the City of Oakland. In addition, I will perform a iterative learning approach to predicting the type of planted species by the size of the well dug by the city using K-nearest neighbors supervised learning method.","4ddcdee9":"## KNN modelling using Neighborhood Component Analysis\nIn this section we will use what information we have about well lengths and widths to accurately predict the type of species that is being planted. From the most previous graph, we can see that the area of the holes does not differ dramatically by the type of species when considering the top 5 species. This same graph can be done with all the species and shows that the distribution from the origin is similar to that above. This will likely cause our model to poor accuracy.\n\nDue to the high number of species in the data set (196 unique species), I will continue to use the subsampled dataset containing only the top 20 planted species (around 70% of the data).","f17361d5":"## Descriptive statistics\n### Summary and data cleaning","9ad94568":"We are interested in the following parameters for this analysis. There are no current data descriptions on the data's homepage or kaggle, so assume the following,\n* WELLWIDTH - the width of the well (ft.)\n* WELLLENGTH - the length of the well (ft.)\n* SPECIES - scientific name of planted species\nThe data also hase the structured variable 'Location 1' which contains highly specific information on where the tree was planted. This will make for a good data cleaning and mapping kernel later on."}}
