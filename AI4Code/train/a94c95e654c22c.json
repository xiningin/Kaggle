Mobilization of surge medical staff to address shortages in overwhelmed communities\nFrom **\u201cThe Art of War\u201d in the Era of Coronavirus Disease 2019  (2020)** we learn that\n\n*.. efforts to build and leverage margin and flexibility within healthcare staff capacity must be\nprioritized .. specialized, dedicated teams in an outbreak, while\nattractive, could be quickly overwhelmed as cases increase. Moreover, longer shifts and increased work\nintensity may lead to HCW fatigue and lapses in PPE techniques, driving nosocomial transmission, a\npainful reminder from the battle with SARS.\nTransmission to healthcare workers is devastating as it simultaneously diverts resources,\ndepletes HCW capacity, saps morale, and drives public fear. To mitigate this, **healthcare systems\nexperiencing a surge in cases should consider all measures to liberate resources and staff, including\ntelemedicine triage, drive-thru testing, and preparations to reschedule elective medical care**.*","8ffb029f":"## 1. Resources to support skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities\n\nNursing homes and long-term care centers are often the hardest hit in the COVID-19 pandemic. The first outbreak in the United States hit in [King County Washington](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/69\/wr\/mm6912e1.htm), and ever since these locations have been under severe stress, with very high death rates as the covid-19 respiratory disease spread through them. This is discussed in **Epidemiology of Covid-19 in a Long-Term Care Facility in King County, Washington**. The impact on nursing homes is an international concern, from Ontario Canada, which has seen half its deaths from SARS-COV-2 attributed to nursing homes, to Pakistan, where the paper **Mental Health of Medical Workers in Pakistan during the Pandemic COVID-19 Outbreak** notes that \n\n*With the advent of COVID-19 in Pakistan, medical workers have been under physical and psychological pressure including high risk of infection, inadequate equipment for safety from contagion, isolation, exhaustion, and lack of contact with family. The severity is causing further mental health problems which not only effect medical workers\u2019 decision making ability but could also have long term detrimental effect on their overall well-being. The unremitting stress medical health-care workers is experiencing could trigger psychological issues of anxiety, fear, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychological distress, stigma and avoidance of contact, depressive tendencies, sleep disturbances, helplessness, interpersonal social isolation from family social support and concern regarding contagion exposure to their friends and family*","fd858bf0":"## 6.
