[Here](https:\/\/www.statsmodels.org\/stable\/generated\/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest.html) is a helpful link on using the built in.\n\nThe syntax is: \n```bash\nproportions_ztest(count_array, nobs_array, alternative='larger')\n```\nwhere, \n- `count_array` = represents the number of \"converted\" for each group\n- `nobs_array` = represents the total number of observations (rows) in each group\n- `alternative` = choose one of the values from `[\u2018two-sided\u2019, \u2018smaller\u2019, \u2018larger\u2019]` depending upon two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed respectively. \n\n\nThe built-in function above will return the z_score, p_value. \n\n---\n### About the two-sample z-test\nRecall that you have plotted a distribution `p_diffs` representing the\ndifference in the \"converted\" probability  $(p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old})$  for your two simulated samples 10,000 times. \n\nAnother way for comparing the mean of two independent and normal distribution is a **two-sample z-test**. You can perform the Z-test to calculate the Z_score, as shown in the equation below:\n\n$$\nZ_{score} = \\frac{ (p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old}) - (p_{new}  -  p_{old})}{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{new} }{n_{new}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{old} }{n_{old}}  } }\n$$\n\nwhere,\n- $p{'}$ is the \"converted\" success rate in the sample\n- $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are the \"converted\" success rate for the two groups in the population. \n- $\\sigma_{new}$ and $\\sigma_{new}$ are the standard deviation for the two groups in the population. \n- $n_{new}$ and $n_{old}$ represent the size of the two groups or samples (it's same in our case)\n\n\n>Z-test is performed when the sample size is large, and the population variance is known. The z-score represents the distance between the two \"converted\" success rates in terms of the standard error. \n\nNext step is to make a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on comparing these two values: \n- $Z_{score}$\n- $Z_{\\alpha}$ or $Z_{0.05}$, also known as critical value at 95% confidence interval.  $Z_{0.05}$ is 1.645 for one-tailed tests,  and 1.960 for two-tailed test. You can determine the $Z_{\\alpha}$ from the z-table manually. \n\nDecide if your hypothesis is either a two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed test. Accordingly, reject OR fail to reject the  null based on the comparison between $Z_{score}$ and $Z_{\\alpha}$. \n>Hint:<br>\nFor a right-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ > $Z_{\\alpha}$. <br>\nFor a left-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ < $Z_{\\alpha}$. \n\n\nIn other words, we determine whether or not the $Z_{score}$ lies in the \"rejection region\" in the distribution.

The p_value is 0.91 and is higher than the 0.05 significance level. That means we can't be confident with a 95% confidence level that the converted rate of the new_page is larger than the old_page and z_score is 1.3109 less than 1.6448, therefore, we would fail to reject the Null hypothesis.**","243fcaa0":"**Answer**\n\n>**Considering other factors is a good idea but before adding these features, we must check if they are relevant or not but in case they are relevant. of course, it's great and the result will be more accurate without any bias and help us to make the right decisions. In another hand, in case new features are semi or irrelevant. This affects results negatively so may make wrong decisions in addition to the model will more complex.**","3ce0a430":"**g. Adding countries**<br> \nNow along with testing if the conversion rate changes for different pages, also add an effect based on which country a user lives in. \n\n1.
