Conclusion\n**Water is a precious resource that needs to be conserved**. Our company believes that our product will help residential halls to conscientiously save water. Different residential halls have different water consumption patterns so we need to be flexible in order to cater to all of them. One pattern we foresaw was the link between the mean and standard deviation. Both values seem to be directly proportional. More data from different halls must be collected before we can say this pattern exist but if it does, there might be a potential to **explore the relationship between mean and standard deviation**. If one gets lower, the other might. We also need to consider that the school and holiday term significantly impacts water consumption levels. **Special water conservation plans will need to be applied as halls have a more unique consumption pattern**. Moving forward, we can try to lower water consumption in all residential halls, even those with values below Z.\n\nIf the plan does prove fruitful, we can even **extend our reach to dormitories or residential estates** where water consumption is high as well. We hope that the residential halls we are approaching will positively receive our products. Our company has just started but we have the desire to expand and help buildings throughout the world one day. We hope that we will be able to stop water shortage from worsening through conservation of water in buildings. Efforts will have to start in Wakanda before going global.\n","07c10199":"After removing Hall Carroll, **DatasetVer2** now has 43 residence halls to analyse","dde1eff9":"From the density plots, we can tell that **most of the data lie around 0.6 for the holiday month**. **Most of the data lie around 3.8 for the school month**. This shows that **schools months have higher water consumption values**. This implies that more students stay in Carroll Hall during school semesters which will lead to higher water consumption levels. We note that even 0.6 is still **significantly higher than Z (0.2306)**. This means that the **hall is using alot more water than the other halls even during the school holidays**.\n**The values range from 0 to 1.4 for holiday month while it ranges from 2 to 5.5 for a school month.** \nUsing both the spread as well as the range of values, we can conclude that **Carroll Hall is used more during the school month.**\n\nAfter identifying that school months consume more water, we will look at daily consumption practices to identify the periods of time that use the most water. To do this, we will look at **hourly consumption values of two school days and two holiday days**. Respectively, **the two days chosen will be a Wednesday and a Saturday to represent a weekday and a weekend**. For simplicity, we will assume that the results from this comparison will apply to all other days.","6341719d":"Another important finding from the heatmap is that **there are halls with no consumption of water** which are indicated by the columns in the heatmap that have **no values\/colour**. These halls have **columns which are just grey**. These halls are probably not used. One reason might be because the university the hall belongs to does not provide on-campus accomodation that year. Another reason could be because the hall is not opened for the student population as a result of a small student population. There is thus no need to open all the halls if a certain number is enough to house the entire student population.\nIn order to to **tidy** the data, we will be removing these halls from the dataset.","d89a682c":"<a id=\"10\"><\/a> <br>\n# 2. Data Tidying\nTo **tidy** the data, we will be using the **average monthly water consumption level**. The water consumption value of each day in the month will be added up and divided by the number of days in the month. This gives the average value for that month. By looking at average monthy water consumption levels, we will have 12 values for each building. This makes the data easier to read.","b5d8df89":"To go into more detail, we will calculate the **mean** and **standard deviation** for both days.","a58aadc0":"After removing the columns, a plot and heatmap can be done to show the remaining buildings.","d29cb5a1":"The mean and standard deviation is presented in the table below.","03b1443d":"After truncating the data, we will use the **average daily consumption values** for neater plotting. This will give us **one value per day in the chosen month**.","c3ddd88d":"During the school term, we can see that water consumption levels generally have the same trend on weekends and weekdays. We see that water consumption levels \ndrop from 12am onwards and gradually rise again after 6am when people start to wake up. This is normal behaviour during the school term as students go about their daily activities. The **mean value of weekday is higher than the mean value of weekend (4.20>3.03)**. This indicates higher levels of water consumption on weekdays. On weekdays, the fluctuation in water consumption is more drastic as seen by the **larger standard deviation on weekdays as compared to weekends (2.00>1.36)**.\nAlthough weekend water consumption levels are lower, the **water consumption level is still incredibly high at 3-5 l\/m2 for most of the day on a weekend** when it is compared to the Z value. **This implies that there are still a significant number of students in Carroll Hall on the weekends although the number is lower than that of a weekday**.","2d4bde89":"From the lineplot and heatmap, we can see **9 distinct halls**. From the heatmap, we can see that for **5 of the halls, they have monthly average values that \nare more than Z the entire year** (Blaine, Cora, Hattie, Juliet and Marlyn). **For 4 of the halls, 11 months have values higher than Z** (Else, Fausto, Janice and Myrtie). Since **11\/12 months are still significant, we will include these 4 halls as our clients**. Therefore, our final residence halls to target will be Blaine, Cora, Else, Fausto. Hattie, Janice, Juliet, Marlyn and Myrtie Hall.\n\nOther than identifying our potential halls to approach to sell our product, both the lineplot and the heatmap can also help us to see the general trend of **higher water consumption between the months of January to April and the months of July to November**. This **coincides with the 2 annual school semesters of universities in Panthers**. The semesters are from January to April and from Mid July to November. The **months with lower water consumption levels are the months that are school holidays for universities**. During school holidays, most students do not stay in the halls but go home. This explains the lower water consumption levels in the holiday months of Panther universities. \n\nWith this in mind, we can approach the halls with **emphasis on a shorter 4 month plan** that allows the residential halls to **subscribe to our plans during the school semester months only**. They might be more inclined to subscribe because **it will be more affordable** since they pay for lesser months. This **4 month plan is not typical** since our shortest is actually 6 months but **a new type of plan can be developed specifically for residential halls** which only need monitoring of their water consumption in certain months. This is an avenue for our company to explore to **cater to specific group of customers**.","db6edfdd":"We look at the metadata next as we will normalise the water consumption levels for a fair comparison. We need the **Gross Floor Area (GFA) information** from the metadata set **in order to normalise**. We therefore use the dataset \"metadata.csv\". This dataset will be called **Meta**.","e5630fdd":"# WaterX Pte Ltd and our proposal for water saving technology in residential halls.\n\nNational University of Singapore, Department of the Built Environment\n\nAY21\/22 PF3211 AI Applications for the Built Environment Project 2\n\n8th November 2021\n\nCreated by:\nMiki Angelica Hoe, Nahyun Kim, Rachel Lim Ke Xin and Seoh Zheng Loong Aloysius.\n\n\n","02465b54":"Using the two datasets above, we can retrieve 1) the water consumption and 2) GFA of the different buildings.

Analysing the anomaly\n\nIn the next part, we will be analysing the anomaly from the dataset. This is the analysis of Carroll Hall which has significantly higher water consumption values than the rest. It was removed in the earlier parts in view of distortion of the data. This part will **analyse the consumption patterns of Carroll Hall to identify why it has significantly higher water consumption values**.","c757cdba":"We are targeting water consumption so we will be using the dataset \"water_cleaned.csv\" for our research purposes. This dataset will be called **Water**","38fc395f":"After normalisation, we will look at the consumption level for the **Year 2017** as that is the most recent year which would imply the most accurate results. After that, we will look at **Panthers residence halls** as Panther is where many residence halls are located.","0ee7815c":"A new heatmap is plotted to show the tidied data. This heatmap only has **halls that actually use water.**","fe5b1fa7":"The **critical value, Z is 0.2306** (4sf). The next step is to **filter out values above Z**.","1e6263a6":"From the data above, there are a few points for analysis. \n1. School term has higher water consumption levels (mean=4.2 and 3.03) as compared to the holiday term (mean=0.65 and 0.99).\n\nThis is because there are **more students in the hall during the school term**. This applies to weekends too as students might stay there over the weekend since classes will begin again on Monday. The weekend break is not justifiable for them to go home. During the holiday, it is justified to go home as there are no classes for extended periods of time.\n\n2. The mean water consumption value during the weekend is higher than the mean of weekday during **holiday term**.\n\n**Hall cleaning (corridors and external surfaces) is usually carried out on weekends** throughout the year. Water hose sprays and automatic floor scrubbers are utilised for this purpose, resulting in a substantial amount of water being used during these days. During the school term, despite hall cleaning being on weekends, water consumption is still higher on weekdays as students occupy these halls. This will explain why water consumption levels are lower for the weekends during the school term. During the holidays, students usually return home, leaving only a small number of people occupying these halls, thoroughly bringing overall water consumption down. Because there is so little water usage during this period by the students, weekend water utilisation during the holidays surpass weekdays because of hall cleaning activities. Furthermore, being the hall for the Department of Botany students, there are plants that are part of student projects that need watering. **The watering is done once a week during the weekends when it is the holiday term**. This will contribute to higher water consumption levels on weekends as compared to the weekdays during the holidays as well.\n\n3. There is **larger fluctuation during the school term** (sd=2.00 and 1.36) as compared to the holidays (sd=0.39 and 0.84).\n\nFrom the results, we can see that the standard deviation for weekdays during school term (2.00) is higher than that for weekends during school term(1.36). This is because there are **more students in the halls on weekdays**. This can **lead to extremely high water consumption at certain intervals (For example, more bathrooms are utilised within the same hour as everyone is showering)**.  However,**when it comes to night time, the water consumption will drop down significantly** (Most students are asleep). Due to the **difference in water consumption levels between day and night time**, the standard deviation for weekdays will be larger as there is **more potential for surges** that can suddenly happen due to the higher number of students in the hall. On weekends, there are less students which will reduce the tendency of a surge in consumption. The surges give **weekdays a higher standard deviation during the school term**. On the other hand, the standard deviation for weekdays during the holiday is 0.39 while the weekend has a higher value at 0.84. This is due to the same reasoning as the occurrence during the school term. **More water usage in the form of washing and irrigation during the weekends can lead to surges and higher water consumption levels during the daytime**. When **night comes, the consumption level will drop**. Due to **these surges** in the daytime, the **standard deviation for weekends is higher**. Weekdays generally will not experience surges since there is not much activity. **This explains the difference between the weekday and weekend standard deviation for school and holiday term separately.**\n \nThe reason why school term standard deviation is higher than holiday term standard deviation in general is because the school term sees more students in the hall. When there are more students, consumption levels will go up and this might lead to surges. **Lesser consumption during the holiday term will result in relatively lower standard deviation for holiday weekdays and weekend as there is a smaller difference in consumption levels throughout the day, leading to a smaller spread of values.**\n \nIn conclusion, **when there are higher chances of a surge \/ surges that have very high values, standard deviation tends to be bigger**. This is the reason why **standard deviation follows the mean in our observation**. When the mean is higher, there is generally more activity. This increases the chances of a large difference in water usage throughout the day. This in turn leads to a higher standard deviation. The mean following the standard deviation can be seen in the compiled table above. **The higher the mean, the higher the standard deviation of water consumption.**\n\n4. **Holiday** consumption levels patterns are more eratic. It is unpredictable although there are **two points of lower water consumption levels** and **one highest point occurring around 10pm to 12am on both weekdays and weekend**.\n\n**The two points of lower water consumption occurs at times where people are sleeping or taking a rest**. It happens late into the night when most people are sleeping or late in the afternoon. Due to the flexibility of their schedule, late afternoon is the time when most people rest in their halls or relax. The water consumption levels will thus be lower at these two points of time.\n**The main reason for the sudden spike in water consumption around 10pm is due to showers**. Carroll Hall is the **only hall for international students** so there are activities for them during the holiday term as well to enrich their holidays. During the weekdays, there are activities and events being held until late in the night such as recreational games and Dinner & Dance. There are also many small self-organised events happening. When students return to Hall Carroll after the day ends, they will shower and this causes the increase in water consumption at that time. On the weekends, international students tend to head out to have fun and return at night around 9pm. They will shower afterwards and increase water consumption. This is the reason why water usage is significantly higher even during the holiday term.\n\n5. In general, **the water consumption level of the Hall throughout the year is high when compared to other halls** as the mean values are all significantly higher than Z, the 95th percentile value of all residence halls in Panthers.\n\nThis could be due to **the swimming pool** that is present at Hall Carroll. Hall Carroll is located in a centralised area so the public swimming pool is located at Hall Carroll on the top floor. It takes about 18,000-20,000 gallons of water to fill an ordinary swimming pool. Wakanda is known for **its humid weather**. **Evaporation rates rise in the summer**, and the pool's water level drops rapidly. Under the severe sun, up to 300 litres of pool water can evaporate in a single day, which is around 30 buckets. If the pool is not topped up during the year, nearly the whole volume will vanish. The rate of evaporation is affected by factors such as humidity, wind, overnight air temperatures, and a higher pool water temperature. **The pool's size is also a factor**: a larger pool means higher water loss. The rate of loss varies from place to place, but a general value of 35mm to 45mm per week is usual (Robust Pools, 2018). **The need to replenish the volume loss through evaporation causes water consumption to rise**. Furthermore, as this is **the lodging hall for students studying the Degree of Botan**y, there are **farms and nurseries present** in the hall. There is also **a large number of old trees and many gardens which are constantly taken care of by the students**. All this **requires irrigation which requires water**. Other halls do not use nearly as much water on irrigation as there are significantly lesser plants and most halls leave the hydration of plants to the rain. **The presence of the pool and irrigation needs of the hall explain the significantly higher water consumption levels of Hall Carroll.**\n","e8f6f357":"To analyse the data, we will first identify if the **school months or holiday months use more water**. For simplicity, we will **compare one school month and one school holiday month** to find out if Carroll Hall is used more during the school or holiday months. By comparing only one month each from school period and holiday period, we **assume that the findings will apply to all other months in the same period for simplicity**.\n\nTo do this, we will **truncate** the data. We will use **October for the school month and July for the holiday month**. The rational for choosing these two months is because the entirety of these two months fall within the school and holiday term respectively.","51b7595b":"To compare the difference in water consumption levels between school and holiday months, we will use a **density plot**. The density plot can help us to **determine the value where most of the data lies around**.

We will be **removing this outlier** for a fairer comparison as the values from this hall will affect the overall analysis.

The residence hall has been identified as Carroll hall and is described as \"Panther_lodging_Carroll\" in the dataset. This hall will be analysed in the analysis of the anomaly in the later part of the notebook.\n\nTo **tidy** the data, this hall will be removed entirely.

We will **sieve out buildings that have water consumption levels above Z** as these buildings are the ones with significant water usage (having values higher than that of the 95th percentile).

Our Organisation\nWater X is Wakanda's biggest company specialising in water reduction and monitoring technologies. To date, our technology is used in close to 50 buildings, including the famous School of Design and Environment 4, the most water-saving building in the country.\nThrough technologies, we aim to help our customers solve issues of high water consumption. We do this through our smart and automated submetering solution known as **WaterCare**. It is designed to help landlords and property managers efficiently manage water consumption. WaterCare reduces rectification time and cost inefficiency by increasing awareness of irregular energy usage with the help of data and Artificial Intelligence (AI). It also allows business managers to obtain access to energy usage insights and advice in order to increase energy efficiency and collaborate with tenants on sustainability activities.\n<a id=\"3\"><\/a> <br>\n# 2. Issue of Water Scarcity\nDue to ever-increasing water shortage, water conservation in buildings has received a lot of attention in recent years. Increased urbanization and population growth will only deteriorate the situation. Multiple studies on water usage in high-rise buildings have found a significant amount of water-saving possibilities. However, it is disheartening to see that our country's potential is not being fully realized (Sattar et al., 2019).\n \nScarcity of freshwater resources has become one of the world's most pressing issues. Many interconnected challenges, such as a fast expanding population and global climate change have contributed to this. In just five decades, the world's population has increased from 3 to 7 billion people. Rainfall is insufficient to meet the growing demand for water. The steady increase in water consumption is expected to result in severe water scarcity in the future. By 2025, it is estimated that 67 percent of the world's population would be under moderate to severe water stress, with half of them experiencing water scarcity (Mead, 2008). \n \nThe presence of water meters aids in the regulation of consumer water consumption. In a study on household technology and domestic water demand in the United Kingdom, it was discovered that metering will not only reduce use, but also the rate at which it grows (Haydar et al., 2015).\n<a id=\"4\"><\/a> <br>\n# 3. Target Group\nIn this report, we will focus on student halls in the city of Panthers in our home country of Wakanda. Students halls were chosen as the type of building to target as halls are usually occupied with a large number of people in shared rooms. Water use is highly impacted by the number of residents and their daily activities in studies of residential water usage (Domene & Sauri, 2006). This is in line with the study by Katimon & Demun (2004) who found that water consumption among students in university student halls varied depending on their activities. Food preparation operations, personal hygiene, laundry, horticulture, and many other vital residential activities all utilize water. This leads to high water consumption per meter square in residential halls when compared to other building types. The student hall facility managers have to carefully monitor resource usage as residents only pay a small fixed price for access to their communal facilities. WaterX is able to aid in this regard through water consumption monitoring and regulation as budget and resource consumption are crucial to student hall management teams. \n\nHalls in Panthers were chosen as Panthers is known to be the \"education city\" of Wakanda. The most reputable universities including the National University of Wakanda is located in Panthers. In total, Panthers has 6 universities that have residential halls. This will give us more halls to study and analyse.\n<a id=\"5\"><\/a> <br>\n# 4. WaterCare\n**Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)**\n\nAMI is an integrated system of smart meters (WoTa), communications networks, and data management systems that allows utilities and customers to communicate in two directions. WaterCare is backed by AMI, and it reduces the operational issues of utilities management, improves tenant involvement, and allows property managers to focus on their core business. AMI consists of revenue-grade AMI electricity meters and an in-building Radio Frequency (RF) mesh network that is secure and reliable. AMI is able to communicate wirelessly to an industrial gateway and data will be transmitted to WaterX's secured cloud platform. \n\n**Internet of Things (IoT)**\n\nWoTa is the Internet of Things' (IoT) de facto wireless platform . The WoTa chipsets from WaterX connect sensors to the Cloud, allowing for real-time data and analytics that can be used to improve efficiency and production. WoTa devices enable intelligent IoT applications to address some of the world's most pressing issues, including water scarcity.\n \nWoTa are attached to the water systems at different points on the outlet line from the water storage tank through to the student halls. They act as submeters to measure water usage. Possible points of attachment can be one per level or one per room. These WoTa devices collect data on water consumption and send this information wirelessly through WaterX\u2019s cloud platform and to WaterCare, as shown below.\n\n![Flow of info.JPG](attachment:898e4825-f0f5-47b3-a496-af9d5916791f.JPG)\n<a id=\"6\"><\/a> <br>\n# 5. Benefits of WaterCare\nWith the integration of WoTa into student halls' water systems, operational efficiency and productivity increases. This is because it reduces the amount of time and resources required for manual meter reading. There is also a decrease in data inaccuracies and validation. This allows more assurance in the revenue process by eliminating human error and avoiding revenue losses caused by erroneous billing and manual readings. Student hall managers can improve rectification time and cost efficiencies through early alerts about aberrant energy usage with the help of data and AI. WaterX consists of a live dashboard that is shown below. Through this, building managers can constantly monitor the water consumption levels in the halls.\n\n![Laptop Screen.JPG](attachment:5cafa4d4-e40e-44d9-af5e-5cdc11e3f9d9.JPG)\n<a id=\"7\"><\/a> <br>\n# 6. Services Available To Student Hall Managers Through WaterCare\nWaterX\u2019s services include the installation of WoTa devices at selected points and WaterCare subscription plans. WoTa devices are charged per device, and our WaterCare subscriptions come in 6-month, 12-month and 24-month plans.\n \nUpon subscription, student hall managers will have their own profile on Watercare and are able to select Plan A or B. 5 features are available on the Watercare app, with the last being made available only to clients who select Plan B, which comes at a higher cost. The following is a list of the features available:\n \n1. Monitoring water consumption in real time on WaterCare\u2019s app.\nThe WoTa devices attached at different points are labelled and identifiable in WaterCare, the water flow and water consumption volumes at each point are displayed on the live dashboard.\n\n2. Creating alerts on WaterCare\u2019s app for predetermined water consumption volumes.\nClients are also able to create alerts for when water consumption hits a certain volume or level. With this alarm, clients will be notified immediately of a spike in water consumption level and they can rectify the problem as soon as possible.\n\n3. Generate timely water consumption data reports (in hourly, daily, weekly and monthly timeframes).\n\n \n4. Customer service support via call\/chat boxes from 9am-5pm on Mondays-Fridays and 9am-1pm on Saturdays and Sundays.\n \n5. Generate analysis and recommendations\nClients can generate an analysis from their platform which is backed by AI technology to identify anomalies and patterns in their water consumption data compared to the average water consumption usage in similar buildings. Recommendations can be generated based on water usage at different points.\n \nOur pricing for the initial installation and subscription to the AMI infrastructure (connection to the AMI network and platform) as well as the monthly subscription plan is detailed in Table 1 below.\n\n![Table 1.JPG](attachment:1c7bfa67-710a-4ecd-be49-0f1605f1748b.JPG)","42dc6bb3":"# Table of Contents\n[PART 1](#1)\n   1.
