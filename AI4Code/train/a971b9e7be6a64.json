The process of customer segmentation is based on the premise of finding differences among the customers\u2019 behavior and patterns.\n\nThe major objectives and benefits behind the motivation for customer segmentation are:\n* **Higher Revenue**: This is the most obvious requirement of any customer segmentation project. \n* **Customer Understanding**: One of the mostly widely accepted business paradigms is \u201cknow your customer\u201d and a segmentation of the customer base allows for a perfect dissection of this paradigm. \n* **Target Marketing**:  The most visible reason for customer segmentation is the ability to focus marketing efforts effectively and efficiently. If a firm knows the different segments of its customer base, it can devise better marketing campaigns which are tailor made for the segment. A good segmentation model allows for better understanding of customer requirements and hence increases the chances of the success of any marketing campaign developed by the organization.\n* **Optimal Product Placement**: A good customer segmentation strategy can also help the firm with developing or offering new products, or a bundle of products together as a combined offering.\n* **Finding Latent Customer Segments**: Finding out which segment of customers it might be missing to identifying untapped customer segments by focused on marketing campaigns or new business development.\n\n**Clustering**:\n\nThe most obvious method to perform customer segmentation is using unsupervised Machine Learning methods like clustering.  The method is as simple as collecting as much data about the customers as possible in the form of features or attributes and then finding out the different clusters that can be obtained from that data. Finally, we can find traits of customer segments by analyzing the characteristics of the clusters.\n\n**Exploratory Data Analysis**:\n\nUsing exploratory data analysis is another way of finding out customer segments. This is usually done by analysts who have a good knowledge about the domain relevant to both products and customers. It can be done flexibly to include the top decision points in an analysis. \n \n### RFM Model for Customer Value:\n\nSince our dataset is limited to the sales records, and didn\u00b4t include anothers information about our customers, we will use a **RFM**,***Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value**, based model of customer value for finding our customer segments.\n The RFM model will take the transactions of a customer and calculate three important informational attributes about each customer:\n- **Recency**: The value of how recently a customer purchased at the establishment\n- **Frequency**: How frequent the customer\u2019s transactions are at the establishment\n- **Monetary value**: The dollar (or pounds in our case) value of all the transactions that the customer made at the establishment\n\n#### Recency\nTo create the recency feature variable, we need to decide the reference date for our analysis. Usually, we make use of the last transaction date plus one day. Then, we will construct the recency variable as the number of days before the reference date when a customer last made a purchase.","fdb6b1da":"From the first graph above we can see that sales amount distribution is ***skewed***, has a **peak** on the left and a long tail to the right. It **deviates from normal distribution** and is **positively biased**.\n\nFrom the **Probability Plot**, we could see that **sales amount** also does **not align with the diagonal**, special on the right. \n\nWith ***skewness positive of 19.3***, we confirm the **high lack of symmetry** and with 478 **Kurtosis** indicates that is a **too heavy-tailed distribution** and has **outliers**, surely more than 10 very extreme.\n\nLet's see a statistical summary of this dataset:","24afe82a":"### Data Preprocessing\nOnce we have created our customer value dataset, we will perform some preprocessing on the data. For our clustering, we will be using the K-means clustering algorithm. One of the requirements for proper functioning of the algorithm is the mean centering of the variable values. Mean centering of a variable value means that we will replace the actual value of the variable with a standardized value, so that the variable has a mean of 0 and variance of 1. This ensures that all the variables are in the same range and the difference in ranges of values doesn't cause the algorithm to not perform well. This is akin to feature scaling.\n\nAnother problem that you can investigate about is the huge range of values each variable can take. This\nproblem is particularly noticeable for the monetary amount variable. To take care of this problem, we will transform all the variables on the log scale. This transformation, along with the standardization, will ensure that the input to our algorithm is a homogenous set of scaled and transformed values.\n\nAn important point about the data preprocessing step is that sometimes we need it to be reversible. In our case, we will have the clustering results in terms of the log transformed and scaled variable. But to make inferences in terms of the original data, we will need to reverse transform all the variable so that we get back the actual RFM figures. This can be done by using the preprocessing capabilities of Python.","04bd9832":"When we look at the results of the clustering process, we can infer some interesting insights:\n\n- First notice that all K clusters options is valid, because they don't have presence of clusters with below average silhouette scores. \n- In the other hand, all options had a some wide fluctuations in the size of the silhouette plots. \n\nSo, the best choice may lie on the option that gives us a simpler business explanation and at the same time target customers in focus groups with sizes closer to the desired. \n\n#### Clusters Center:\nLet's look at the cluster center values after returning them to normal values from the log and scaled version. ","f0ccab95":"So we get a whopping 663.273 itemsets for only 15 itens and a support of only 1%! This will increase exponentially if we decrease the support or if we increase the number of items in our dataset. The next step is specifying a confidence value and generating our rules. The following code snippet will perform rule generation and decoding of rules, and then compile it all in a neat dataframe that we can use for further analysis.","ed06264d":"\nAfter this first cleanup, note that we still have more description than inventory codes, so we still have some inconsistency on the basis that requires further investigation.

An invoice number shared across rows means that those transactions were performed in a single invoice (multiple purchases).\n* **StockCode**: Identifier for items contained in an invoice.\n* **Description**: Textual description of each of the stock item.\n* **Quantity**: The quantity of the item purchased.\n* **InvoiceDate**: Date of purchase.\n* **UnitPrice**: Value of each item.\n* **CustomerID**: Identifier for customer making the purchase.\n* **Country**: Country of customer.","421461e3":"##### Creating our rules\nWe need to specify two pieces of information for generating our rules: support and confidence. An important piece of information is to start with a higher support, as lower support will mean a higher number of frequent itemsets and hence a longer execution time. We will specify a min support of 0.01 and see the number of frequent itemsets that we get before we specify confidence and generate our rules.","a06a94d7":"#### Clusters Insights:\n\nWith the plots and the center in the correct units, let's see some insights by each clusters groups:\n\n***In the three-cluster:***\n- The tree clusters appears have a good stark differences in the Monetary value of the customer, we will confirm this by a box plot.\n- Cluster 1 is the cluster of high value customer who shops frequently and is certainly an important segment for each business.\n- In the similar way we obtain customer groups with low and medium spends in clusters with labels 0 and 2, respectively.\n- Frequency and Recency correlate perfectly to the Monetary value based on the trend (High Monetary-Low Recency-High Frequency).\n\n***In the five-cluster:***\n- Note that clusters 0 and 1 are very similar to their cluster in the configuration with only 3 clusters.\n- The cluster 1 appears more robust on the affirmation of those who shop often and with high amount.\n- The cluster 2 are those who have a decent spend but are not as frequent as the cluster 1\n- The cluster 4 purchases medium amounts, with a relatively low frequency and not very recent\n- The cluster 3 makes low-cost purchases, with a relatively low frequency, but above 1, and made their last purchase more recently. This group of customers probably response to price discounts and can be subject to loyalty promotions to try increase the medium-ticket, strategy that can be better defined when we analyzing the market basket. \n- The silhouette score matrix says that the  five cluster segments are less optimal then the three cluster segments. \n\n***In the five-cluster:***\n- Definitely cluster 6 defines those who shop often and with high amount.\n- Clusters 1 and 5 show good spending and good frequency, only deferring in how recent were their last purchases, where 5 is older, which suggests an active action to sell to group 5 as soon as possible and another to 1 seeking to raise its frequency.\n- Cluster 0 presents the fourth best purchase and a reasonable frequency, but this is a long time without buying. This group should be sensible to promotions and activations, so that they do not get lost and make their next purchase.\n- Cluster 5 is similar to 0, but has made its purchases more recently and has a slightly better periodicity. Then actions must be taken to raise their frequency and reduce the chances of them migrating to cluster 0 by staying longer without purchasing products.\n\n#### Drill Down Clusters:\n\nTo further drill down on this point and find out the quality of these difference, we can label our data with the corresponding cluster label and then visualize these differences. The following code will extract the clustering label and attach it with our customer summary dataset.","46dfda7a":"<h1>Table of Contents<span class=\"tocSkip\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<div class=\"toc\"><ul

The next step is to convert this selected data into the required table data structure.\n\n#### Association Rule Mining with FP Growth\n\n##### Orange Table Data Structure\nSince we are using the Orage framework we still have to convert it to the Table data structure by providing the metadata about our columns. We need to define the domain for each of our variables. The domain means the possible set of values that each of our variables can use. This information will be stored as metadata and will be used in later transformation of the data. As our columns are only having binary values,we can easily create the domain by using this information. ","255fe5c2":"#### Prune Dataset for frequently purchased items\nWe saw in the earlier on EDA how only a handful of items are responsible for bulk of our sales so we want to prune our dataset to reflect this information. For this we have created a function prune_dataset below, which will help us reduce the size of our dataset based on our requirements. The function can be used for performing three types of pruning:\n- Pruning based on percentage of total sales: The parameter total_sales_perc will help us select the number of items that will explain the required percentage of sales. The default value is 50% or 0.5.\n- Pruning based on ranks of items: Another way to perform the pruning is to specify the starting and the ending rank of the items for which we want to prune our dataset.\n- Pruning based on list of features passed to the parameter TopCols. \n\nBy default, we will only look for transactions which have at least two items, as transactions with only one item are counter to the whole concept of association rule-mining. ","0b4b8986":"### Clustering for Segments\n#### K-Means Clustering\nThe K-means clustering belongs to the partition based\\centroid based hard clustering family of algorithms, a family of algorithms where each sample in a dataset is assigned to exactly one cluster.\n\nBased on this Euclidean distance metric, we can describe the k-means algorithm as a simple optimization problem, an iterative approach for minimizing the within-cluster sum of squared errors (SSE), which is sometimes also called cluster inertia. So, the objective of K-Means clustering is to minimize total intra-cluster variance, or, the squared error function: \n![image](https:\/\/www.saedsayad.com\/images\/Clustering_kmeans_c.png)\n\nThe steps that happen in the K-means algorithm for partitioning the data are as given follows:\n1. The algorithm starts with random point initializations of the required number of centers. The \u201cK\u201d in K-means stands for the number of clusters.\n2. In the next step, each of the data point is assigned to the center closest to it. The distance metric used in K-means clustering is normal Euclidian distance.\n3. Once the data points are assigned, the centers are recalculated by averaging the dimensions of the points belonging to the cluster.\n4. The process is repeated with new centers until we reach a point where the assignments become stable. In this case, the algorithm terminates.\n\n##### K-means++\n- Place the initial centroids far away from each other via the k-means++ algorithm, which leads to better and more consistent results than the classic k-means.\n- To use k-means++ with scikit-learn's KMeans object, we just need to set the init parameter to k-means++ (the default setting) instead of random.\n\n#### The Elbow Method\n  \nUsing the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters. The idea behind the elbow method is to identify the value of k where the distortion begins to increase most rapidly. If k increases, the distortion will decrease, because the samples will be closer to the centroids they are assigned to. \n\nThis method looks at the percentage of variance explained as a function of the number of clusters. More precisely, if one plots the percentage of variance explained by the clusters against the number of clusters, the first clusters will add much information (explain a lot of variance), but at some point the marginal gain will drop, giving an angle in the graph. The number of clusters is chosen at this point, hence the \"elbow criterion\". This \"elbow\" cannot always be unambiguously identified.Percentage of variance explained is the ratio of the between-group variance to the total variance, also known as an F-test. A slight variation of this method plots the curvature of the within group variance.","0a157970":"Typically, a lift value of 1 indicates that the probability of occurrence of the antecedent and consequent together are independent of each other.

The silhouette plot displays a measure of how close each point in one cluster is to points in the neighboring clusters and thus provides a way to assess parameters like number of clusters visually. \n\nIt can also be applied to clustering algorithms other than k-means\n\nSilhouette coefficients has a range of \\[-1, 1\\], it calculated by:\n1. Calculate the cluster cohesion a( i )as the average distance between a sample x( i )   and all other points in the same cluster.\n2. Calculate the cluster separation b( i ) from the next closest cluster as the average distance between the sample x( i ) and all samples in the nearest cluster.\n3. Calculate the silhouette s( i )  as the difference between cluster cohesion and separation divided by the greater of the two, as shown here:\n![image](https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/3d80ab22fb291b347b2d9dc3cc7cd614f6b15479)\nWhich can be also written as:\n![image](https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/ab5579a6c7150579af8a0d432b6630ba529376f0)\n\nWhere:\n- If near +1, it indicate that the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters. \n- a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. \n- If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. \n- If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters.\n- A value of 0 indicates that the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters\n- Negative values indicate that those samples might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.\n\nThe silhouette plot can shows a bad K clusters pick for the given data due to the presence of clusters with below average silhouette scores and also due to wide fluctuations in the size of the silhouette plots. A good k clusters can found when all the plots are more or less of similar thickness and hence are of similar sizes.\n\nAlthough we have to keep in mind that in several cases and scenarios, sometimes we may have to drop the mathematical explanation given by the algorithm and look at the business relevance of the results obtained.\n\nLet's see below how our data perform for each K clusters groups (3, 5 and 7) in the silhouette score of each cluster, along with the center of each of the cluster discovered in the scatter plots, by amount_log vs recency_log and vs frequency_log.","36c5dca0":"From the first graph above we can see that sales frequency distribution is ***skewed***, has a **peak** on the left and a long tail to the right.

Plotly enables us to interact with the plots to see the central tendency values in each boxplot in the notebook. Note that we want to avoid the extremely high outlier values of each group, as they will interfere in making a good observation around the central tendencies of each cluster. Since we have only positive values, we will restrict the data such that only data points which are less than 0.95th percentile of the cluster is used. This will give us good information about the majority of the users in that cluster segment.\n\nI've used these charts to review my previously stated insights, but follow the same for you to explore:","9c70cb4f":"The obvious patterns we can see from the plots above is that costumers who buy with a higher frequency and more recency tend to spend more based on the increasing trend in Monetary (amount value) with a corresponding increasing and decreasing trend for Frequency and Recency, respectively. ","768915ae":"### Next Steps in the Segmentation:\n\nTo enhance discovery and can further improve the quality of clustering by adding relevant features, other customer information and purchases details may be included in this dataset. \n\nFor example, but not limited to:\n- New indicators, such as customer relationship time, based on the date of your first purchase of the client\n- whether the customer is from abroad or not\n- some group or category of product to be obtained through the SKUs\n- External data vendors and use it, and so on.\n\nAnother dimension to explore can be trying out different algorithms for performing the segmentation for instance hierarchical clustering, which we explored in some of the earlier chapters. A good segmentation process will encompass all these avenues to arrive at optimal segments that provide valuable insight.\n\n## Cross Selling\n\nThe cross selling is the ability to sell more products to a customer by analyzing the customer's shopping trends as well as general shopping trends and patterns which are in common with the customer's shopping patterns. More often than not, these recommended products would be very appealing. The retailer will often offer you a bundle of products with some attractive offer and it is highly likely that we will end up buying the bundled products instead of just the original item. \n\nSo, we research the customer transactions and find out potential additions to the customer's original needs and offer it to the customer as a suggestion in the hope and intent that they buy them benefiting both the customer as well as the retail establishment.\n\nIn this section, we explore association rule-mining, a powerful technique that can be used for cross selling, then we apply the concept of market basket analysis to our retail transactions dataset.\n\n### Market Basket Analysis with Association Rule-Mining\n![image](https:\/\/fiverr-res.cloudinary.com\/images\/t_main1,q_auto,f_auto\/gigs\/117717078\/original\/7cd5947def9d84483612ef9b19829323850ac9af\/bulid-a-product-recommender-system-for-ur-site.jpg)\nThe whole concept of association rule-mining is based on the concept that customer purchase behavior has a pattern which can be exploited for selling more items to the customer in the future.\n\nAssociation rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. This rule-based approach also generates new rules as it analyzes more data. The ultimate goal, assuming a large enough dataset, is to help a machine mimic the human brain's feature extraction and abstract association capabilities from new uncategorized data.\n\nAn association rule usually has the structure like below:\n![image](https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/3141048979b977982202dbf7a80596f8a6b1177e)\nThis rule can be read in the obvious manner that when the customer bought items on the left of the rule he is likely to buy the item on the right. Following are some vital concepts pertaining to association rule-mining.\n- **Itemset**: Is just a collection of one or more items that occur together in a transaction. For example, here {milk, bread} is example of an itemset.\n- **Support**: is defined as number of times an itemset appears in the dataset. The support of ***X*** with respect to ***T*** is defined as the proportion of transactions ***t*** in the dataset which contains the itemset ***X***. Mathematically it is defined as:\n![image](https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/1c6acacd3b17051205704b5d323c83fc737e5db1)\n- **Confidence**: Confidence is an indication of how often the rule has been found to be true. It is a measure of the times the number of times a rule is found to exist in the dataset. For a rule which states { beer -> diaper } the confidence is mathematically defined as:\n![image](https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/90324dedc399441696116eed3658fd17c5da4329)\n- **Lift**: Lift of the rule is defined as the ratio of observed support to the support expected in the case the elements of the rule were independent. For the previous set of transactions if the rule is defined as { X -> Y }, then the lift of the rule is defined as:\n![image](https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/c392e3111167b60687405dfdc7ed55f22409f4c5)\n    - If the rule had a lift of 1, it would imply that the probability of occurrence of the antecedent and that of the consequent are independent of each other. When two events are independent of each other, no rule can be drawn involving those two events.\n    - If the lift is > 1, that lets us know the degree to which those two occurrences are dependent on one another, and makes those rules potentially useful for predicting the consequent in future data sets.\n    - If the lift is < 1, that lets us know the items are substitute to each other. This means that presence of one item has negative effect on presence of other item and vice versa.\n- **Frequent itemset**: Frequent itemsets are itemsets whose support is greater than a user defined support threshold.\n- **Conviction**: Is the ratio of the expected frequency that item X occurs without a item Y (that is to say, the frequency that the rule makes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions. The conviction of a rule is defined as:\n![image](https:\/\/wikimedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/media\/math\/render\/svg\/4c2228820d6a8cb5a84bd059d53764a6b9280386)\n\n#### Algorithms:\n\nSome well-known algorithms are Apriori, Eclat and FP-Growth, but they only do half the job, since they are algorithms for mining frequent itemsets. Another step needs to be done after to generate rules from frequent itemsets found in a database.\n\nThe major bottleneck in any association rule-mining algorithm is the generation of frequent itemsets. If the transaction\ndataset is having k unique products, then potentially we have 2<sup>k<\/sup> possible itemsets. \n\n##### Apriori\nApriori uses a breadth-first search strategy to count the support of itemsets and uses a candidate generation function which exploits the downward closure property of support. So, the algorithm will first generate these itemsets and then proceed to finding the frequent itemsets.  For around 100 unique products the possible number of itemsets is huge, and shows up that the Apriori algorithm prohibitively computationally expensive.\n\n##### Eclat algorithm\nEclat is a depth-first search algorithm based on set intersection. It is suitable for both sequential as well as parallel execution with locality-enhancing properties.\n\n##### FP Growth\nFP stands for frequent pattern. The FP growth algorithm is superior to Apriori algorithm as it doesn't need to generate all the candidate itemsets. The FP growth algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy and leverages a special data structure called the FP-tree, to find frequent itemsets without generating all itemsets. The core steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n1. In the first pass, the algorithm take in the transactional database and counts occurrence of items (attribute-value pairs) in the dataset, and stores them to 'header table'. \n2. In the second pass, it builds the FP-tree structure by inserting instances to represent frequent itemsets. Items in each instance have to be sorted by descending order of their frequency in the dataset, so that the tree can be processed quickly. Items in each instance that do not meet minimum coverage threshold are discarded. If many instances share most frequent items, FP-tree provides high compression close to tree root.\n3. Divide this compressed representation into multiple conditional datasets such that each one is associated with a frequent pattern.\n4. Mine for patterns in each such dataset so that shorter patterns can be recursively concatenated to longer patterns, hence making it more efficient.\n\nRecursive processing of this compressed version of main dataset grows large item sets directly, instead of generating candidate items and testing them against the entire database. Growth starts from the bottom of the header table (having longest branches), by finding all instances matching given condition. New tree is created, with counts projected from the original tree corresponding to the set of instances that are conditional on the attribute, with each node getting sum of its children counts. Recursive growth ends when no individual items conditional on the attribute meet minimum support threshold, and processing continues on the remaining header items of the original FP-tree.\n\nOnce the recursive process has completed, all large item sets with minimum coverage have been found, and association rule creation begins.\n\n#### Build Transaction Dataset\nIn order to perform our data in these algorithms, we must first turn them into a sales event table where each product sold will be represented by a column, having its value 1 for when it was sold in that event or zero when not. This will generate a sparse table","7764cf59":"# Customer Segmentation and Market  Basket Analysis\n![image](http:\/\/denary.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/picture_market_segmentation-10-4-13-resized-600.png)\n__Introduction__:\nThis notebook we using publicly dataset On-line Retail to explore customer segmentation through the interesting task  of unsupervised learning method.

In most cases this interaction is in terms of their purchase behavior and patterns. We explore some of the ways in which this can be used.\n* Market basket analysis: Market basket analysis is a method to gain insights into granular behavior of customers. This is helpful in devising strategies which uncovers deeper understanding of purchase decisions taken by the customers. This is interesting as a lot of times even the customer will be unaware of such biases or trends in their purchasing behavior.","ce7c86ce":"#### Conclusion\n\nAs we have seen, the generation of rules is a very simple process, but very computationally expensive, since it grows exponentially with the increase of the set of items.\n\nOverall, we seek the proper balance between support and confidence leading to a reasonable number of strong rules. \n\nIn the other hand, if the goal is to identify rare but with high confidence patterns, we should proceed as previously, by establishing a low level of support and a higher level of confidence, which leads to a large number of rules.\n\nWith this in mind, the rules with low support and high confidence would then be our target for further study and than outlining of strategies to raise cross selling.","9918dc6b":"We can observe from the preceding output that Quantity and UnitPrice are having negative values, which may mean that we may have some return transactions in our data also. \nAs our goal is customer segmentation and market basket analysis, it is important that these records are removed, but first we will take a look at whether there are records where both are negative or if one of them is negative and the other is zero.","59de6ed3":"So all rules are valid.","b150dfbf":"## Load Dependencies and Configuration Settings\n\nWe started with the installation of the orange3 package through the command line, since it is not possible to include it through the usual procedure of adding custom packages in the Kernel.","2b9e69aa":"Note that by the Elbow method from a K equal to 3 we already observed low rates of gain in the decay of the distortions with the decrease of K reaching the limit of 10% with the K equal to 7.
