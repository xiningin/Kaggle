Since I have to look at another dataset for a grad level ML course, I'll provide some code so you can see what I'm doing with it.","db326323":"The first thing I'm interested in is if there are any lack of representation from any particular group. As an example, the plot below shows how many players are within each team. A lack of representation won't matter in this context unless you are aggregating the values of a particular feature based on what University they attended (i.e. what is the total 'yards gained' from each university).","01ca3649":"**Downloading CSV Data**","dc6bb47c":"I'll stop here but what I want to do for my report that you might want to do as well is build an algo that can properly predict how many TD will occur for a single entry... given everything else. I won't go into the pros or cons of doing this but something to at least look at. Good luck investigating!","e19fa7c8":"***Viewing 1 Element in the Dataset***","168d9bce":"Another thing I want to see is if the data has any outliears. Not only would this benefit you in your analysis but there is a single liner that can tackle what is needed. ","e3d3eabe":"***Analytics***\n\nSince my intent is to apply ML in some fashion or another, I won't be doing much data analytics in my grad report. However, for the sake of your ambitions lets look at a few things.\n"}}
