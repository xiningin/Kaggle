The search engine transforms the input to phrases using our phrases model above and performs Query Expansion technique by adding synonyms (above certain similarity threshold) to the input keywords and ranks sentences by the number of keyword matches and the date of the article the sentence came from (the newest will be ranked higer). In order to focus on articles about COVID-19, the search engine can get optional keywords that boost the sentences containing them. We've tried to use TF-IDF and some other weighting techniques, but our simple method worked best for us.\n2. For each sub-task we created list of keywords the retrieves for us the best result set of sentences that answer the resaerch question in the sub-task.\n3. Picked 1-3 sentences (out of 10) that summarizes the answer in the most accurate, consice and informative manner. Those sentences are considered \"seed sentences\" and will serve us in the next module of sentence similarity. This part was done partially manually and we belive this approach can be automatic with better keyword extraction and a better search engine.

In most cases, we took the first 1-3 sentences that the search engine returned, but it wasn't the case for all search queries.

The techniques from the paper [\"A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Sentence Embeddings\"](https:\/\/openreview.net\/forum?id=SyK00v5xx) (Sanjeev Arora, Yingyu Liang, Tengyu Ma). In their work, they use a pretrained word embedding model on unsupervised large corpus and in order to create embedding for the whole sentence, they use a smooth weighted average on the word embeddings of the the words in the sentence, and remove the 1st principal component from the vector after performing a dimension reduction technique (e.g. SVD or PCA). The latter improves to reduce noise from the sentence embeddings. We found that using phrases (bi-grams and tri-grams) in the semantic search engine, using this technique, performed worser than with them so we decided to not using them for the semantic search engine part.\n2. Using fine-tuned BERT on Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) task that predicts if two sentences are semantically related or not. For the implementation of BERT encoder, we used UKP's sentence-transformers library. We chose to use the model called `bert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens`.\n\nWe developed a method that gets list of sentences and retrieves similar semantic sentences to them. Because the input is not just one sentence, we had to aggerage them in different manngers. We did research one some aggregation techniques:\n1. Union\n2. Mean\n3. 1st Principal Component (pc_1)\n4. 2nd Principal Component (pc_2)\n\nThe method that worked best was fine-tuned BERT (#2) with Union aggregation.\n\nWe iterate through all the sentences in our filtered corpus and encoded the sentences using the techniques mentioned above. When giving a new sentence, we encoded it and compared it to all existing pre-encoded sentences we have in our index (using Cosine Similarity function between the vectors) in order to get the most similar sentences for each input sentence. We used `nmslib` for storing the pre-encoded sentences and to perform the similarity measures.

BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and many other more recent pretraining schemes. BART is really useful for text generation tasks, hence we chose it for this task. We use HuggingFace's great library [transformers](https:\/\/github.com\/huggingface\/transformers) for that end.
