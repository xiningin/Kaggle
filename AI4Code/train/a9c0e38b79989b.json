This fact is no less true when it comes to dealing with text dataset.**\n\n**Infact for text dataset preprocessing is a must and without which we cannot move forward in training our model.**\n\n**The fact that our algorithm only understand numbers and integers and cannot understand strings or text data makes preprocessing even more valuable and essential in Natural Language Processing.**\n\n**When it comes to preprocessing a text data the most common steps are:**\n\n**1. The entire sentence needs to be converted in the form of small tokens or into individual words. By doing this it helps us to assign each word with a unique integer value called as index or ID of that word.**\n\n**2. Tokenization also helps us to find the total number of unique words in our vocabulary which is later to be fed in our model.**\n\n**3. Once the tokenization is done, the next common step is to remove stopwords. Stopwords are the the most commonly occuring words in our vocabulary. Words that won't generally matter even if they are taken out from our vocabulary. For example words like 'the', 'and', 'so', 'if' etc are the stopwords. But we don't always have to remove the stopwords. Stopwords are only removed when their absence won't affect our model prediction much, in cases like classification of documents according to the topics, stopwords can be removed as we only have to focus on words that carry more importance in our documents.**\n\n**4. There are various other ways in which preprocessing of the text data can be done.**\n\n**KERAS is a high level deep learning API which is also very easy when it comes to applying deep learning algorithms. Keras offers a 'Tokenizer' class which carries out tokenisation for us and also convert all the text data into lowercase.**\n","b10bac83":"\n\n1. Now if you observe the vector representation of each comment, the size of each vector is different.\n\n2.

Here we will be impelemnting Bidirectional LSTMs which are an extension of traditional LSTMs. The main reason to use bidirectional LSTM's instead of traditional LSTM's is that we can achieve a significant improvement in the performance of the model on sequence classification problems.**\n\n**2. Bidirectional LSTMs train two instead of one LSTMs on the input sequence. The first on the input sequence as-is and the second on a reversed copy of the input sequence. This can provide additional context to the network and result in faster and even fuller learning on the problem.**\n\n**3.

Using such pre-trained word embeddings on your model can help achieve the model very good amount of accuracy. Using pre-trained word embeddings helps you to avoid training your own word embedding from scratch. This method can be employed when the available amount of dataset is not too much. Word2Vec(by google) and Glove(by stanford NLP group) are the two most commonly use pre-trained word embeddings.**"}}
