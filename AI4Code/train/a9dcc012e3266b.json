Though, given that doing this will likely only improve my solution by <1%, maybe initial efforts are better spent finding a different strategy.","e96a962e":"Cool. We can see that the city coordinates create a picture of Sant'as reindeer and some trees. The prime cities seem to be relativley evenly distributed thorughout the \"map\". \n\nHow many Prime cities are there compared to not prime cities?\n","74077d08":"Now we can start working on some slightly more sophisticated solutions...\n\nIt makes sense that if we design an algorithm that always chooses the nearest remaining city, we should be able to greatly reduce our total trip distance. I'm sure we will run into some sub-optimal \/ long trips towards the end as the number of remaining cities is low, but it should still be pretty decent. This is commonly known as the [Nearest Neighbor Aproach](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nearest_neighbour_algorithm).\n### Nearest Neighbor Approach:\n\n\nThis will involve the following steps (via the Wiki link above):\n1. start on an arbitrary vertex as current vertex  (Less arbitrarily, the North Pole for us).\n2. find out the shortest edge connecting current vertex and an unvisited vertex V.\n3. set current vertex to V.\n4. mark V as visited (drop from the DF).\n5. if all the vertices in domain are visited, then terminate.\n6. In our case, add the North Pole as the final stop and add up the total distance traveled.","d3a6c8db":"Okay. We can see that there are 197,769 cities (tha'ts a lot!) and that for each city, we are given x and y coordinates (these do not seem to relate to typical latitude and longitude values).\n\n### Next, let's plot all the locations of all of the cities to see what we are working with:\n\nwe know that the first data point = the North Pole, so we will highlight that one so it stands out (red)...\n\nit would also be nice to highlight the 'prime' cities as well (green)...","d32ae602":"### Nearest Neighbor Approach (With Prime City Optimization):\nWhat if we add in some of the logic to help optimize for prime city distance penalties?...\n\nHere, for every 10th step, we multiply the non-prime members of the calculated distance_matrix of the remaining cities by 1.10. That way, the solution will only go out of the way to visit a prime city if it doesn't exceed the 10% distance penalty. My guess is that this will yield a fairly minimal benefit (on the order of a fraction of 1% improvement).","c7e42c3d":"While this solution is dumb, at least it gives us an idea of a starting point. It also quickly highlights that the distance punishment is pretty minimal. This was somewhat expected since there is only a distance punishment every 10th city, and sometimes you get lucky and that city ends up being a prime city by chance, so the total penalty is <1% of the total distance.","2622a1fa":"### Simplest Solution (No Optimization)\nThis is the dumbest solution we could do. It doesn't even take into acount any optimization. It purely goes down the list of cities we were given, in the order they were given, and calculates the distances between consecutive cities and sums them up (also adds the return trip to the North pole from the last city)\n\n","3eb8e4ff":"Sorting the cities by the X-coordinate lowered our total trip distance from ~447 million to ~196 million. Sweet! Not a bad improvement from such a simple solution.","9e075d03":"So going with a slightly smarter aproach (nearest neighbor) has definitely improved the total distance that Santa will need to travel. We went from ~196 million with the x-coordinate sorting down to ~ 1.81 million miles [took ~3.5 minutes through Kaggle Kernal). Pretty awesome improvement, but still worse than ~85% of other contest submissions...","ee38b406":"## Imports:","eb8f34dc":"Let's also create a column to denote if the city is a prime city (that is, the CityID is a prime number)","8ff541af":"Ok, there is about one tenth the amount of prime cities as regular cities... makes sense given that each 10th stop should be to a prime city to avoid the 10% distance penalty...","cc2f5cf1":"Using this method of optimizing visits to prime cities, we reduced the total route distance from 1,812,602 down to 1,812,550. \n\nHmmm... This only improved the distance traveled by 52 (miles?)... Lame. And somehow, the total distance incurred from penalties actually increased from 17892 to 18004. That means that I have either messed up this algorithm, or at some point the route had to make-up for passed-over cities...\n\n(If you spot my mistake, please let me know in the comments!)","1f56ef5d":"## Import\/Preview Data:","78fa113f":"# Helping Santa:\n\nIn this kernal we will attempt to help Santa make his path through a number of cities. However, there is one plot twist: The houses in prime cities always leave carrots for the Reindeers alongside the usual cookies and milk. These carrots are just the sustenance the Reindeers need to keep pace.
