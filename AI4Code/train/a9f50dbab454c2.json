Gather data to help use machine learning in the future\n\nThe most successful machine learning examples use supervised learning.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=21EiKfQYZXc\n\nSupervised learning needs inputs and outcomes. For LA jobs descriptions, the\ninputs would be job bulletins that appeal to diverse candidates and job\nbulletins that do not do so. The outcomes would be the numbers and diversity of\nthe candidates that apply to the jobs.\n\nAs of 2019, there does not appear to be data set of labelled job descriptions\nthat can be used to train a machine learning algorithm. LA county can help make\nsuch a data set available by doing the following.\n\n1. Get experts to modify job descriptions to appeal to diverse candidates\n2. Save the older job description\n3. Keep statistics on the candidates that saw each kind of job bulletin and\n   those that applied\n4. Make the data set available to researchers","d68155ae":"## Recommendation 5.
