These commands are short, but they can change the look of your figure in drastic ways. \n\n## plt.plot()\nPlt.plot is the most basic, essential command for plotting figures. The parameters of your plot are entered within the parantheses as a comma-separated list. These parameters include: your x and y variables, the color and shape, the labels, and even more. We will focus on a few basic specifications today, but feel free to use and share any others you know. \n\nWhen using the plot command sure you also write it out in the order of: plt.plot(x-variable,y-variable,color\/shape,label, etc). We will go over the basics for each of these inputs.\n\n### X and Y inputs\nThere are three main types of inputs for your x values and y values: lists and arrays, ranges, and functions. Each have their own purpose and can be helpful when creating a complex figure.\n\n### Lists\nLists are used to plot specific data points, like experimental data, and take the form of a comma-separated list between two brackets. Data describing bacteria in a petri dish, voltage outputs, distances traveled, or test scores would be best expressed in a list. Here are a few examples:","541118ff":"These two sets of data may seem a bit dawnting, but lets see what happens when we plot these two list as a function of frame numbers.","7fc8ae77":"### Reminders and Extras\n\nplt.legend() - this commmand creates the legend in your figure\n\nplt.xlim(left-limit, right-limit) - expands or limits your graph to these parameters\n\nplt.ylim(lower-limit,  upper-limit) - expands or limits your graph to these parameters\n\nplt.grid(True) - Puts a grid in the background\n\nYou can try these commands on your graph above, or explore them below.\n\nConsider doing your own research to find other graphing options and tricks. Figures in Python are basically completely customizable!","4e246761":"# <h1><center>Tutorial on Basic Figure Functions<\/center><\/h1> ","b7858e37":"## Activities:\n\nRead the Introduction below, and do the following exercises.","e0a6a94f":"After shooting a video of a water droplet being placed onto their surface, they were able to use python to break it up into indivual frames and measure the contact angle on the right and left sides of the droplet. The only down side is the data is a bit long and hard to understand visually. They need your help in creating a plot for their data. \n\nTry printing the following two list: CALA (the left contact angles) and CARA (the right contact angles)","cdc7ffbf":"### Functions\n\nFunctions are mathematical functions, like (x+3); often we want to compare and fit our data to a mathematical curve. Functions can be defined and then put into a plt.plot() command (like a list or range) or inserted straight into the command. So:\n\ny = (x+2) * 3\n\nplt.plot(x, y)\n\nwill be the same as\n\nplt.plot(x, (x+2) * 3)\n","dff10abb":"## Customizations\n\n### Color\nNext, let's move on to the visuals. In your graph above your data should be represented by a solid blue line. Changing the color of your line is easy and often helpful. It can be done in your plt.plot command, by adding the \"name\" assigned to a color after your x and y variables (as shown above, the \"name\" of that shade of blue is 'b').\n\nSome colors have short \"names\", while others are more complex. Try changing the color of the line in your graph above to your favorite color. (Refrence the image below for a wide range of colors and their names)\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n### Style of Line\n\nNext let's switch the look of our line. We can change this to dashes, single data points or even double dashes using the following commands. These go directly into the plt.plot command, in quotes with the color. For instance, 'ro' will produce red data points while 'b-' will produce a blue dashed line.\n\nWhen using colors with more complex names, add another comma in plt.plot after color, and enter the command linestyle = '(type of line you want'. For example:\n\nplt.plot(x,function,'mediumvioletred', linestyle='-.') will produce a medium violet red line with dashes and dots.\n\nTry changing the look of your line in your figure above. It should look something like the example below:","edf09e29":"### Mutiple Data Sets on One Graph\n\nLet's try adding another function to your above graph. \n\nCreate a new function of x, and name it something other than y. \n\nNext, add a second plt.plot command line with the same x range and your new function's name instead of y.\n\nLastly, to reduce the possibility of confusion, make your new line a different color and style. Refer to the examples above if you have any trouble.\n\nIf you kept adding more functions, you could get something that looks like this:\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\nThis figure is pretty busy, and it might be hard to remember which function is which. Let's try adding a legend to you graph.\n\nIn the plt.plot command, simply add another comma after linestyle (or color) and use the command label=''\n\nThis could look like:\n\nplt.plot(x, [the name of your new defined function], 'b', label='x+2')\n\nOR\n\nplt.plot(x, x+2, 'b', label='x+2')\n\nTry adding labels to your graph, but be sure to run the command: plt.legend(). Otherwise it will not populate your label onto your figure. \n\nIf you get stuck here is one example:","6f3783ef":"<h2><center> Taking it a Step Further <\/center><\/h2>\n\nUsing these basic graphing tools and a little bit more complicated list we can use python to generate graphs for some really interesting data. Take a minute and watch this short video on the dropping of a water droplet onto a superhydrophic source and a hydrophobic source: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lYBoRozgYog.\n\n\nThe students in the research lab want to compare the contact angles a drop of water makes with there possibly hydrophobic surface. One way they will know if the surface is hydrophobic is is the contact angles of the water droplet are at least greater than 90 degrees (most hydrophobic surfaces will have an average angle of 120 degrees, refrence the image below for a visual).\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n<center><h5> Mattone, Manuela & Rescic, Silvia & Fratini, Fabio & Mangan, Rachel.
