The more relaxed and flexible pattern of customer use indicates that they utilize the bike sharing system differently than subscribers, mostly on weekends and in the afternoons, maybe for personal enjoyment.\n\n### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?\n\n> When all of the interactions between characteristics are considered together, they all complement each other and make logical sense, so there isn't anything to be surprised about.

February was the most popular month of the year, owing to the weather and the fact that the data only includes the month of February.Male riders outnumbered female riders, and most members were subscribers rather than casual riders.
