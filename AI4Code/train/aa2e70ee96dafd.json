travel. While, in the Travel Frequently Category, Bachelors take up highest count(about 180) since they don't have the burden of raising children, household chores unlike Married Employees. But, interestingly, Divorced Employee Count is lowest in all the three category. This can also be because of less number of records for Divorced Employees.","35e05d67":"### Performing GridSearch \nCommented during runtime to save computation resources","d3f07fe9":"## Viewing different Datasets","0ee8b6e4":"### Department-wise and Education fields based Employees attrition \nHere, we will observe employees with which Education background and Department have faced more firing. ie: higher attrition","d043840e":"### Missing Value Treatment \nLet us look whether there are any missing values in the dataset","0e792feb":"So, we see that our models are doing well on the validation dataset.

","0b713a62":"So, we see that the age-group of 21-30 suffers the highest attrition (about 23% in Male, 13% in Female), which makes sense since majority of them are freshers in company starting straight after finishing from the college. They are the dispensable resources due to lack of skills, and are let go first if the cash flow of the company starts falling due to external factors. For 10-20 age group its less because very less no. of people start their corporate career at the age of 19 or 20.

While, Jobs involving Non-travel have the least Attrition Rate of less than 5%. Makes sense, because in recent times, majority of firings have been taken place for working in IT Sectors as Software Engineers in companies like Capgemini, Cognizant, Uber, Ola Cabs etc. This concludes that majority of jobs that were affected rarely involved traveling, traveling restrictions didn't impact jobs as much as loss of revenues due to the lockdown measures.

This is quite related to Age vs Attrition graph where we saw that age group of 21-30 were affected from job loss the most.

Married and Divorced Employees belong to higher age groups who have plenty of corporate and business exposure, leading to lower attrition rate.

Similarly, close to 200 employees have left due to lack of Job Satisfaction, only close to 150 of them found it highly satisfactory while in the case of retained employees, less than 150 have low Job Satisfaction and more than 250 employees find it satisfactory.
