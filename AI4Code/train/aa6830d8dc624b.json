The simplest way to do this is to `groupby` the family id `idhogar` and then `agg` the data. For the aggregations for ordered or continuous variables, we can use six, five of which are built in to pandas, and one of which we define ourselves `range_`. The boolean aggregations can be the same, but this will create many redundant columns which we will then need to drop. For this case, we'll use the same aggregations and then go back and drop the redundant columns.","e14e9209":"The gbm seems to think the most important features are those derived from ages.

These represent the sum of the reduction in impurity at nodes that used the variable for splitting, but we don't have to pay much attention to the absolute value. Instead we'll focus on relative scores.\n\nIf we want to view the feature importances, we'll have to train a model on the whole training set. Cross validation does not return the feature importances.

It does appear that the model has greater confidence in `Target=4` predictions which makes sense because of the _class imbalance and the high prevalence of this label._ \n\nAnother way to look at the information is as a `violinplot`.

Later we'll look at predictions themselves and see where our model is \"confused\". For now, we can generate a submission file and submit it to the competition.\n\nWhen we actually make predictions for each household, we average the predictions from each of the folds. Therefore, we are essentially using multiple models since each one is trained on a slightly different fold of the data. The gradient boosting machine is already an ensemble machine learning model, and now we are using it almost as a meta-ensemble by averaging predictions from several gbms. \n\nThis process is shown in the code below.","d2a41d23":"Because we are going to be comparing different models, we want to scale the features (limit the range of each column to between 0 and 1). For many ensemble models this is not necessary, but when we use models that depend on a distance metric, such as KNearest Neighbors or the Support Vector Machine, feature scaling is an absolute necessity. When comparing different models, it's always safest to scale the features. We also impute the missing values with the median of the feature.\n\nFor imputing missing values and scaling the features in one step, we can make a pipeline. This will be fit on the training data and used to transform the training and testing data.","a39f0162":"These variables indicate where the electricity in the home is coming from.

I'm going to choose the mapping myself, based on the data decriptions: \n\n    0: No electricity\n    1: Electricity from cooperative\n    2: Electricity from CNFL, ICA, ESPH\/JASEC\n    3: Electricity from private plant\n\nAn ordered variable has an inherent ordering, and for this we choose our own based on the domain knowledge. After we create this new ordered variable, we can drop the four others. There are several households that do not have a variable here, so we will use a `nan` (which will be filled in during imputation) and add a Boolean column indicating there was no measure for this variable.","063f9326":"Well that's a relief!

","b84b4d7e":"# Conclusions\n\nIn this notebook, we went through a step-by-step implementation of an entire data science solution to a real-world problem. Machine learning is really just a series of steps, each simple by themselves, with the overall result often extremely powerful. \n\nOur path was as follows:\n\n1. Understand the problem\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\n    * Deal with data issues\n    * Fill in missing values\n3. Feature Engineering\n    * Aggregate data \n    * Feature selection in stages\n4. Model Selection\n    * Try many different models to see which one is most promising\n    * Feature selection can also come into play\n5. Model Optimization\n    * Choose the best performing model and tune\n6. Implementing best model\n7. Investigate predictions\n    * Identify model shortcomings\n8. Try new techniques\n    * Experiment and learn! \n  \nAs stated in the introduction, while these steps do have a general order, there is nothing preventing us from repeating them based on subsequent work. For example, we often go back to feature engineering\/selection after modeling if we are not satisfied with our performance. After investigating predictions, we might return to the modeling stage and re-think our approach.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that machine learning is largely empirical: there are few established best practices so you need to constantly experiement to determine what works best. That's why we included the last step: we got to try out some new methods and even if they don't pay off for this project, they may be useful in the future. As data scientists we need to be constantly learning to do our work more effectively with the best tools possible.\n\nOur final model does well compared to others in the competition, but overall is not extremely accurate. There might be ways to improve performance, but overall, we might not have enough data to achieve exceptional metrics. That's an important point to remember: at the end of the day, the success or failure of a data science project will rest on the quality and quantity of available data. We have solved the problem of classifying household poverty in Porto Rica as well as we can with the available tools, and the next process if we were in charge would be figuring out what more data could be collected to yield a better solution.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAlthough we tried many possible approaches, there are still some methods that we did not implement but might prove useful:\n\n* Further Hyperparameter tuning: we did not spend much time optimizing the model and there are other packages for optimization that we could try. \n* Further feature selection: we probably do not need to retain all of the features to get the same performance\n* [Oversampling the minority class](http:\/\/contrib.scikit-learn.org\/imbalanced-learn\/stable\/over_sampling.html) \/ undersampling the majority class: an advanced techinque that might improve performance\n* Ensembling or stacking multiple models. We could train models on different sections of the data and then combine their predictions to try and better separate the classes. It might also be worthwhile to include models other than the gradient boosting machine. \n\nThe most valuable part of a Kaggle competition is never the rewards, but the knowledge gained along the way. These contests are great for learning how to solve realistic problems and I approach every new problem as an opportunity to improve as a data scientist.

There are many more households that classify as _non vulnerable_ than in any other category. The _extreme_ poverty class is the smallest (I guess this should make us optimistic!).\n\nOne problem with imbalanced classification problems is that the machine learning model can have a difficult time predicting the minority classes because it sees far less examples. Think about this in human terms: if we are classifiying poverty and we see far more cases of no poverty than extreme poverty, it will make it more difficult for us to identify the high poverty households because of less exposure. One potential method to address class imbalanceds is through oversampling  (which is covered in more advanced notebooks).","eae2062f":"In addition to looking at the missing values of the monthly rent payment, it will be interesting to also look at the distribution of `tipovivi_`, the columns showing the ownership\/renting status of the home.

However, the scores we are getting are fairly good and I'm going to move on to a crucial part of machine learning: investigating the predictions to see where our model is wrong. \n\nWhile Kaggle is great for presenting realistic datasets, the methods needed to get to the very top of the leaderboard are not generally used in the real-world. Past some level of performance, accuracy takes a back seat to interpretability.

On the other hand, for 26 cases where the poverty was extreme, our model predicted it was moderate. For 95 cases where the poverty was Non-Vulnerable, our model predicted the poverty was Vulnerable. Overall, we see that our model is only very accurate at idenifying the non-vulnerable households.\n\nTo look at the percentage of each true label predicted in each class, we can normalize the confusion matrix for the true labels.","16af1b47":"We can see some of the variables that we made are highly correlated with the Target.

Here we will examine two of these:\n\n1. The Pearson Correlation: from -1 to 1 measuring the linear relationship between two variables\n2. The Spearman Correlation: from -1 to 1 measuring the monotonic relationship between two variables\n\nThe Spearman correlation is 1 if as one variable increases, the other does as well, even if the relationship is not linear. On the other hand, the Pearson correlation can only be one if the increase is exactly linear.

To do this, we can simply find whichever column is non-zero for each household using `np.argmax`. \n\nOnce we have created the ordinal variable, we are able to drop the original variables.","60ca4aed":"For the most part, the two methods of calculating correlations are in agreement.

","4c617dd3":"For the negative correlations, as we increase the variable, the Target decreases indicating the poverty severity increases. Therefore, as the `warning` increases, the poverty level also increases which makes sense because this was meant to show potential bad signs about a house.

Or, families with lower socioeconomic status have more children in the hopes that one of them will be able to succeed.

The most highly correlated household level variable is `meaneduc`, the average education level of the adults in the household. This relationship between education and poverty intuitively makes sense: [greater levels of education generally correlate with lower levels of poverty](https:\/\/www.childfund.org\/poverty-and-education\/).

The following plot shows that __there are some problems where even Gaussian Naive Bayes will outperform a gradient boosting machine__.

Most people eventually settle on the __gradient boosting machine__ and we will try that out, but for now we'll take a look at some of the other options.  There are literally dozens (maybe hundreds) of multi-class machine learning models if we look at the [Scikit-Learn documentation](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/multiclass.html). We don't have to try them all, but we should sample from the options.\n\nWhat we want to do is write a function that can evaluate a model.

However, the Boolean columns that are on the individual level will need to be aggregated. \n\n#### Float Columns\n\nAnother column type is floats which represent continuous variables. We can make a quick distribution plot to show the distribution of all float columns.

The objective of the Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction contest is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the poverty level of households using both individual and household characteristics. This \"data science for good\" project offers the opportunity to put our skills towards a task more beneficial to society than getting people to click on ads!\n\nIn this notebook, we will walk through a complete machine learning solution: first, get introduced to the problem, then perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset, work on feature engineering, try out multiple machine learning models, select a model, work to optimize the model, and finally, inspect the outputs of the model and draw conclusions. __While this notebook may not get us to the top of the leaderboard, it is meant to be used as a teaching tool to give you a solid foundation to build on for future machine learning projects. Kaggle projects can teach us a lot about machine learning, but several of the strategies used to get to the very top of the leaderboard are not best practices, so here we'll stick to building a very good - although not quite first place - machine learning solution. While Kaggle projects are competitions, I think they are best described as \"a machine learning education\" disguised as a contest!\"\n\nIf you are looking to follow-up on this work, I have additional work including a [kernel on using Automated Feature Engineering](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/willkoehrsen\/featuretools-for-good) with [Featuretools](https:\/\/docs.featuretools.com\/#minute-quick-start) for this problem (with slightly higher leaderboard score). (If you enjoy my writing style and explanations, I write for [Towards Data Science](http:\/\/medium.com\/@williamkoehrsen\/))\n\n## Problem and Data Explanation\n\nThe data for this competition is provided in two files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The training set has 9557 rows and 143 columns while the testing set has 23856 rows and 142 columns. Each row represents __one individual__ and each column is a __feature, either unique to the individual, or for the household of the individual__. The training set has one additional column, `Target`, which represents the poverty level on a 1-4 scale and is the label for the competition. A value of 1 is the most extreme poverty. \n\nThis is a __supervised multi-class classification machine learning problem__:\n\n* __Supervised__: provided with the labels for the training data\n* __Multi-class classification__: Labels are discrete values with 4 classes\n\n### Objective\n\nThe objective is to predict poverty on a __household level__. We are given data on the individual level with each individual having unique features but also information about their household. In order to create a dataset for the task, we'll have to perform some _aggregations of the individual data_ for each household. Moreover, we have to make a prediction for every individual in the test set, but _\"ONLY the heads of household are used in scoring\"_ which means we want to predict poverty on a household basis. \n\n__Important note: while all members of a household should have the same label in the training data, there are errors where individuals in the same household have different labels. In these cases, we are told to use the label for the head of each household, which can be identified by the rows where `parentesco1 == 1.0`.__ We will cover how to correct this in the notebook (for more info take a look at the [competition main discussion](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction\/discussion\/61403)).\n\nThe `Target` values represent poverty levels as follows:\n\n    1 = extreme poverty \n    2 = moderate poverty \n    3 = vulnerable households \n    4 = non vulnerable households\n\nThe explanations for all 143 columns can be found in the [competition documentation](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction\/data), but a few to note are below:\n\n* __Id__: a unique identifier for each individual, this should not be a feature that we use! \n* __idhogar__: a unique identifier for each household. This variable is not a feature, but will be used to group individuals by household as all individuals in a household will have the same identifier.\n* __parentesco1__: indicates if this person is the head of the household.\n* __Target__: the label, which should be equal for all members in a household\n\nWhen we make a model, we'll train on a household basis with the label for each household _the poverty level of the head of household_. The raw data contains a mix of both household and individual characteristics and for the individual data, we will have to find a way to aggregate this for each household. Some of the individuals belong to a household with _no head of household_ which means that unfortunately we can't use this data for training. These issues with the data are completely typical of __real-world__ data and hence this problem is great preparation for the datasets you'll encounter in a data science job! \n\n### Metric\n\nUltimately we want to build a machine learning model that can predict the integer poverty level of a household. Our predictions will be assessed by the __Macro F1 Score.__ You may be familiar with the [standard F1 score](http:\/\/blog.exsilio.com\/all\/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures\/) for binary classification problems which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:\n\n$$F_1 = \\frac{2}{\\tfrac{1}{\\mathrm{recall}} + \\tfrac{1}{\\mathrm{precision}}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{recall}}{\\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall}}$$\n\nFor mutli-class problems, we have to average the F1 scores for each class. The macro F1 score averages the F1 score for each class _without taking into account label imbalances_. \n\n$$\\text{Macro F1} = \\frac{\\text{F1 Class 1} + \\text{F1 Class 2} + \\text{F1 Class 3} + \\text{F1 Class 4}}{4}$$\n\nIn other words, the number of occurrences of each label does not figure into the calculation when using macro (while it does when using the \"weighted\" score). (For more information on the differences, look at the [Scikit-Learn Documention for F1 Score](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn.metrics.f1_score) or this [Stack Exchange question and answers](https:\/\/datascience.stackexchange.com\/q\/15989\/42908). If we want to assess our performance, we can use the code:\n\n```\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nf1_score(y_true, y_predicted, average = 'macro`)\n```\n\nFor this problem, the labels are imbalanced, which makes it a little strange to use macro averaging for the evaluation metric, but that's a decision made by the organizers and not something we can change! In your own work, you want to be aware of label imbalances and choose a metric accordingly. \n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe end objective is a machine learning model that can predict the poverty level of a household. However, before we get carried away with modeling, it's important to understand the problem and data. Also, we want to evaluate numerous models before choosing one as the \"best\" and after building a model, we want to investigate the predictions. Our roadmap is therefore as follows:\n\n1. Understand the problem (we're almost there already)\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Feature engineering to create a dataset for machine learning\n4. Compare several baseline machine learning models\n5. Try more complex machine learning models\n6. Optimize the selected model\n7. Investigate model predictions in context of problem\n6. Draw conclusions and lay out next steps \n\nThe steps laid out above are iterative meaning that while we will go through them one at a time, we might go back to an earlier step and revisit some of our decisions. In general, data science is a non-linear pracice where we are constantly evaluating our past decisions and making improvements. In particular, feature engineering, modeling, and optimization are steps that we often repeat because we never know if we got them right the first time!\n\n# Getting Started\n\nWe have a pretty good grasp of the problem, so we'll move into the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. For the EDA we'll examine any interesting anomalies, trends, correlations, or patterns that can be used for feature engineering and for modeling. We'll make sure to investigate our data both quantitatively (with statistics) and visually (with figures). \n\nOnce we have a good grasp of the data and any potentially useful relationships, we can do some feature engineering (the most important part of the machine learning pipeline) and establish a baseline model. This won't get us to the top of the leaderboard, but it will provide a strong foundation to build on! \n\nWith all that info in mind (don't worry if you haven't got all the details), let's get started! ","75341134":"__rez_esc__: years behind in school\n\nThe last column with a high percentage of missing values is `rez_esc` indicating years behind in school. For the families with a null value, is possible that they have no children currently in school. Let's test this out by finding the ages of those who have a missing value in this column and the ages of those who do not have a missing value.","d37e9d9a":"This plot shows us that there are a number of variables that have a weak correlation with the `Target`. There are also high correlations between some variables (such as `floor` and `walls+roof+floor`) which could pose an issue because of collinearity. \n\n### Features Plot\n\nFor the final exploration of the household level data, we can make a plot of some of the most correlated variables with the Target. This shows scatterplots on the upper triangle, kernel density estimate (kde) plots on the diagonal, and 2D KDE plots on the lower triangle.","bbf485a8":"# Upgrading Our Model: Gradient Boosting Machine\n\nAfter using the Random Forest and getting decent scores, it's time to step up and use the gradient boosting machine. If you spend any time on Kaggle, you'll notice that the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) wins a high percentage of competitions where the data is structured (in tables) and the datasets are not that large (less than a million observations). \n\nI won't go too much into the details here, but instead will focus on the implementation. We'll use the GBM in LightGBM, although there are also options in Scikit-Learn, XGBOOST, and CatBoost. The first set of hyperparameters we'll use were based on those I've found have worked well for other problems.\n\n### Choosing Number of Estimators with Early Stopping\n\nTo choose the number of estimators (the number of decision trees in the ensemble, called `n_estimators` or `num_boost_rounds`), we'll use early stopping with 5-fold cross validation. This will keep adding estimators until the performance as measured by the Macro F1 Score has not increased for 100 training rounds. To use this metric, we'll have to define a custom metric.","8354154f":"# Machine Learning Modeling\n\nOnce feature engineering\/construction is done, we can get started with the machine learning! All of our data (both training and testing) is aggregated for each household and so can be directly used in a model. To first show the process of modeling, we'll use the capable Random Forest Classifier in Scikit-Learn. This probably won't get us to the top of the leaderboard, but it will allow us to establish a baseline. Later we'll try several other models including the powerful Gradient Boosting Machine.\n\nTo assess our model, we'll use 10-fold cross validation on the training data. This will essentially _train and test the model 10 times_ using different splits of the training data. 10-fold cross validation is an effective method for estimating the performance of a model on the test set. We want to look at the average performance in cross validation as well as the standard deviation to see how much scores change between the folds. We use the `F1 Macro` measure to evaluate performance.","3615b761":"# Investigate Predictions\n\nAs a first attempt at looking into our model, we can visualize the distribution of predicted labels on the test data. We would expect these to show the same distribution as on the training data. Since we are concerned with household predictions, we'll look at only the predictions for each house and compare with that in the training data.\n\nThe following histrograms are normalize meaning that they show the relative frequency instead of the absolute counts. This is necessary because the raw counts differ in the training and testing data.","f871f33d":"### Feature Construction\n\nWe can make a few features using the existing data.

For example, we can add up the previous three features we just created to get an overall measure of the quality of the house's structure.","5715c60e":"The meaning of the home ownership variables is below:\n\n    tipovivi1, =1 own and fully paid house\n    tipovivi2, \"=1 own,  paying in installments\"\n    tipovivi3, =1 rented\n    tipovivi4, =1 precarious\n    tipovivi5, \"=1 other(assigned,  borrowed)\"\n    \nWe've solved the issue! Well, mostly: the households that do not have a monthly rent payment generally own their own home. In a few other situations, we are not sure of the reason for the missing information. \n\nFor the houses that are owned and have a missing monthly rent payment, we can set the value of the rent payment to zero. For the other homes, we can leave the missing values to be imputed but we'll add a flag (Boolean) column indicating that these households had missing values.","3c0ec9c3":"One other feature that might be useful is the gender of the head of household.

We can look at the value counts of this variable. Since this is a household variable, it only makes sense to look at it on a household level, so we'll only select the rows for the head of household.\n\n#### Function to Plot Value Counts\n\nSince we might want to plot value counts for different columns, we can write a simple function that will do it for us!","2d55e217":"The remaining missing values in each column will be filled in, a process known as `Imputation`. There are several types of imputation commonly used, and one of the simplest and most effective methods is to fill in the missing values with the `median` of the column.","9bbb8b35":"The next variable will be a `warning` about the quality of the house. It will be a negative value, with -1 point each for no toilet, electricity, floor, water service, and ceiling.","257f2b74":"### Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest\n\nThe `RFECV` in Sklearn stands for Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation. The selector operates using a model with feature importances in an iterative manner. At each iteration, it removes either a fraction of features or a set number of features. The iterations continue until the cross validation score no longer improves. \n\nTo create the `selector` object, we pass in the the model, the number of features to remove at each iteration, the cross validation folds, our custom scorer, and any other parameters to guide the selection.","f19a11e0":"## Exploring Label Distribution\n\nNext, we can get an idea of how imbalanced the problem is by looking at the distribution of labels. There are four possible integer levels, indicating four different levels of poverty. To look at the correct labels, we'll subset only to the columns where `parentesco1 == 1` because this is the head of household, the correct label for each household.\n\nThe bar plot below shows the distribution of training labels (since there are no testing labels).","13921aba":"### Read in Data and Look at Summary Information","a44d59a7":"The most likely candidate seems to be the Random Forest because it does best right out of the box.  While we didn't tune any of the hyperparameters so the comparison between models is not perfect, these results reflect those of many other Kaggle competitiors finding that tree-based ensemble methods (including the Gradient Boosting Machine) perform very well on structured datasets. Hyperparameter performance does improve the performance of machine learning models, but we don't have time to try all possible combinations of settings for all models. The graph below ([from the paper by Randal Olson](https:\/\/psb.stanford.edu\/psb-online\/proceedings\/psb18\/olson.pdf)) shows the effect of hyperparameter tuning versus the default values in Scikit-Learn.\n\n![hyperparameter_improvement](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/WillKoehrsen\/Machine-Learning-Projects\/master\/hyperparameter_improvement.png)\n\nIn most cases the accuracy gain is less than 10% so the worst model is probably not suddenly going to become the best model through tuning. ","bd70493c":"# Model Optimization\n\nModel optimization is the process of extracting the best performance from a machine learning model by tuning the hyperparameters through cross-validation. This is necessary because the best model hyperparameters are different for every dataset. \n\nIn this notebook, we won't get too far into model tuning, but there are multiple options:\n\n1. Manual\n2. Grid Search\n3. Random Search\n4. Automated Optimization\n\nWe will stick to 4. because it is generally the most efficient method and can easily be implemented in a number of libraries, including Hyperopt, which uses a modified version of Bayesian Optimization with the Tree Parzen Estimator. ","a3c24b45":"# Light Gradient Boosting Machine Implementation\n\nThe function below implements training the gradient boosting machine with Stratified Kfold cross validation and early stopping to prevent overfitting to the training data (although this can still occur). The function performs training with cross validation and records the predictions in probability for each fold. To see how this works, we can return the predictions from each fold and then we'll return a submission to upload to the competition.\n\nChoosing hyperparameters for the Gradient Boosting Machine can be tough and generally is done through model optimization. In this notebook, we'll use a set of hyperparameters that I've found work well on previous problems (although they will not necessarily translate to this competition). \n\nWe set the `n_estimators` to 10000 but we won't actually reach this number because we are using early stopping which will quit training estimators when the cross validation metric does not improve for `early_stopping_rounds`. There's a lot going on in this function, and read through it carefully to make sure you have it all! I've tried to make the comments and code straightforward. (The `display` is used to show custom information during training in combination with `%%capture` so we don't have to see all the LightGBM information during training).","ebff26f0":"That performance is very poor. I don't think we need to revisit the Gaussian Naive Bayes method (although there are problems on which it can outperform the Gradient Boosting Machine).","0f381bf7":"### Feature Selection \n\nAs a first round of feature selection, we can remove one out of every pair of variables with a correlation greater than 0.95. ","e1f3f436":"That gives us a look at all of the columns which don't appear to be in any order. To get a quick overview of the data we use `df.info()`.","bcbc94ad":"These variables are highly correlated, and we don't need to keep both in our data.","46f0d82d":"To resume training, we can pass in the same trials object and increase the max number of iterations. For later use, the trials can be saved as json.","cafbdb8f":"__Education reigns supreme!__ The most important variable is the average amount of education in the household, followed by the maximum education of anyone in the household.  I have a suspicion these variables are highly correlated (collinear) which means we may want to remove one of them from the data. The other most important features are a combination of variables we created and variables that were already present in the data. \n\nIt's interesting that we only need 106 of the ~180 features to account for 90% of the importance. This tells us that we may be able to remove some of the features. However, feature importances don't tell us which direction of the feature is important (for example, we can't use these to tell whether more or less education leads to more severe poverty) they only tell us which features the model considered relevant. ","6dd2afc2":"## Id Variables\n\nThese are pretty simple: they will be kept as is in the data since we need them for identification.\n\n## Household Level Variables\n\nFirst let's subset to the heads of household and then to the household level variables.","3f57200b":"### Creating Ordinal Variables\n\nMuch as we did with the household level data, we can map existing columns to an ordinal variable. Here we will focus on the `instlevel_` variables which indicate the amount of education an individual has from `instlevel1`: no level of education to `instlevel9`: postgraduate education. \n\nTo create the ordinal variable, for each individual, we will simply find which column is non-zero. The education has an inherent ordering (higher is better) so this conversion to an ordinal variable makes sense in the problem context.","a5316877":"The Spearman correlation coefficient calculation also comes with a `pvalue` indicating the significance level of the relationship. Any `pvalue` less than 0.05 is genearally regarded as significant, although since we are doing multiple comparisons, we want to divide the p-value by the number of comparisons, a process known as the Bonferroni correction. ","16cc209e":"# Making a Submission\n\nIn order to make a submission, we need the test data. Fortunately, we have the test data formatted in exactly the same manner as the train data. \n\nThe format of a testing submission is shown below. Although we are making predictions for each household, we actually need one row per individual (identified by the `Id`) but only the prediction for the head of household is scored. \n\n```\nId,Target\nID_2f6873615,1\nID_1c78846d2,2\nID_e5442cf6a,3\nID_a8db26a79,4\nID_a62966799,4 \n```\n","00de82e0":"The best model seems to be the Gradient Boosting Machine trained with 10 folds on the selected features. This model has not yet been optimized, but we might be able to get a little more performance through optimization.","150ccad3":"### Redundant Household Variables\n\nLet's take a look at the correlations between all of the household variables. If there are any that are too highly correlated, then we might want to remove one of the pair of highly correlated variables.\n\nThe following code identifies any variables with a greater than 0.95 absolute magnitude correlation.","67713a00":"The `submission_base` will have all the individuals in the test set since we have to have a \"prediction\" for each individual while the `test_ids` will only contain the `idhogar` from the heads of households. When predicting, we only predict for each household and then we merge the `predictions` dataframe with all of the individuals on the household id (`idhogar`). This will set the `Target` to the same value for everyone in a household. For the test households without a head of household, we can just set these predictions to 4 since they will not be scored. ","07e4f2fd":"#### Squared Variables\n\nFirst, the easiest step: we'll remove all of the squared variables. Sometimes variables are squared or transformed as part of feature engineering because it can help linear models learn relationships that are non-linear. However, since we will be using more complex models, these squared features are redundant. They are highly correlated with the non-squared version, and hence can actually hurt our model by adding irrelevant information and also slowing down training.\n\nFor an example, let's take a look at `SQBage` vs `age`.","4d870d52":"# Individual Level Variables\n\nThere are two types of individual level variables: Boolean (1 or 0 for True or False) and ordinal (discrete values with a meaningful ordering). ","822500bd":"# Feature Selection\n\nOne potential method for improving model performance is feature selection. This is the process where we try to keep only the most useful features for our model. \"Most useful\" can mean many different things, and there are numerous heuristics for selecting the most important features. For feature selection in this notebook, we'll first remove any columns with greater than 0.95 correlation (we already did some of this during feature engineering) and then we'll apply recursive feature elimination with the Scikit-Learn library. \n\nFirst up are the correlations. 0.95 is an arbitrary threshold - feel free to change the values and see how the performance changes! ","d5f07772":"## Validation\n\nFor the test predictions, we can only compare the distribution with that found on the training data. If we want to compare predictions to actual answers, we'll have to split the training data into a separate validation set. We'll use 1000 examples for testing and then we can do operations like make the confusion matrix because we have the right answer."}}
