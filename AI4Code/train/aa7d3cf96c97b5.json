can see that the mall customers can be broadly grouped into 5 groups based on their purchases made in the mall.\nIn cluster(Cyan colored) we can see people have low annual income and low spending scores, \nthis is quite reasonable as people having low salaries prefer to buy less, in fact, \nthese are the wise people who know how to spend and save money.\nThe shops\/mall will be least interested in people belonging to this cluster.\n\nIn cluster(Magenta colored) we can see that people have low income but higher spending scores, \nthese are those people who for some reason love to buy products more often even though they have a low income.\nMaybe it\u2019s because these people are more than satisfied with the mall services.\nThe shops\/malls might not target these people that effectively but still will not lose them.\n\nIn cluster(red colored) we see that people have average income and an average spending score, \nthese people again will not be the prime targets of the shops or mall, \nbut again they will be considered and other data analysis techniques may be used to increase their spending score.\n\nIn cluster(Blue-colored) we see that people have high income and high spending scores,\nthis is the ideal case for the mall or shops as these people are the prime sources of profit. \nThese people might be the regular customers of the mall and are convinced by the mall\u2019s facilities.\n\nIn cluster(green colored) we see that people have high income but low spending scores,\nthis is interesting. Maybe these are the people who are unsatisfied or unhappy by the mall\u2019s services. \nThese can be the prime targets of the mall, as they have the potential to spend money. \nSo, the mall authorities will try to add new facilities so that they can attract these people and can meet their needs.","6bdda48c":"# Customer Segmentation\nis a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using\nclustering, identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. They divide\ncustomers into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests,\nand spending habits so they can market to each group effectively.","556bbba3":"Use K-means clustering and also visualize the gender and age distributions. Then\nanalyze their annual incomes and spending scores."}}
