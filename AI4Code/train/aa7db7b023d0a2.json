However, when considering only studies based on register methodology (more likely to report the full spectrum of the ALS population), the range of median survival is quite narrow (around 30 months from first symptom). Interestingly, these studies are also characterized by an older age of onset (62\u201367 years) than those based on other designs. However, in 10\u201320% of cases survival exceeds five years and, in 5\u201310%, 10 years.\"\n\n\"Despite the evidence of several publications, it is still impossible to predict with a good approximation the prognosis for an individual patient at the time of his\/her diagnosis. However, several prognostic factors are well established.\"\n\n\"There is a general consensus that older age and bulbar onset are negatively related to ALS outcome, but the complex relationship between age, female gender and bulbar onset remains to be clarified. Also, the time delay from onset to diagnosis and the El Escorial diagnosis of definite ALS at the time of presentation, seem to have prognostic relevance, since they probably reflect a more rapid progression of the disorder.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3515205\/","5f7f68a2":"#AutoKeras","c188bd93":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Factors Predicting One-year Mortality in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients \u2013 Data From a Population-based Registry<\/h1>\n\nAuthors: Joachim Wolf; Anton Safer; Johannes C W\u00f6hrle; Frederick Palm; Wilfred A Nix; Matthias Maschke; Armin J Grau\n\nBMC Neurol. 2014;14(197)\n\n\" Survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis varies considerably. About one third of the patients die within 12 months after first diagnosis. The early recognition of fast progression is essential for patients and neurologists to weigh up invasive therapeutic interventions. In a prospective, population-based cohort of ALS patients in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, the authors identified significant prognostic factors at time of diagnosis that allow prediction of early death within first 12 months.\"\n\n\"Methods: Univariate analysis utilized the Log-Rank Test to identify association between candidate demographic and disease variables and one-year mortality. In a second step theye investigated a multiple logistic regression model for the optimal prediction of one-year mortality rate.\"\n\n\"In the cohort of 176 ALS patients (mean age 66.2 years; follow-up 100%) one-year mortality rate from diagnosis was 34.1%. Multivariate analysis revealed that age over 75 years, interval between symptom onset and diagnosis below 7 months, decline of body weight before diagnosis exceeding 2 BMI units and Functional Rating Score below 31 points were independent factors predicting early death.\"\n\n\"Probability of early death within 12 months from diagnosis is predicted by advanced age, short interval between symptom onset and first diagnosis, rapid decline of body weight before diagnosis and advanced functional impairment.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.medscape.com\/viewarticle\/834905","d49c0cfb":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Mortality<\/h1>\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Mortality in the United States, 2011-2014\n\nCitation: Larson TC, Kaye W, Mehta P, Horton DK. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Mortality in the United States, 2011-2014. Neuroepidemiology. 2018;51(1-2):96-103. doi: 10.1159\/000488891. Epub 2018 Jul 10. PMID: 29990963; PMCID: PMC6159829.\n\n\"The International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10) did not include a code specific for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) until 2017.\"\n\n\"The proportion of excluded records coded G12.2 but not ALS was 0.21, resulting in 24,328 ALS deaths. The overall age-adjusted mortality rate was 1.70 (95% CI 1.68-1.72). The rate among males was 2.09 (95% CI 2.05-2.12) and females was 1.37 (95% CI 1.35-1.40). The overall rate among whites was 1.84, blacks 1.03, and other races 0.70. For both sexes and all races, the rate increased with age and peaked among 75-79 year-olds. Rates tended to be greater in states at higher latitudes.\"\n\n\"Conclusions: Previous reports of ALS mortality in the United States showed similar age, sex, and race distributions but with greater age-adjusted mortality rates due to the inclusion of other diseases in the case definition. When using ICD-10 data collected prior to 2017, additional review of multiple-cause of death data is required for the accurate estimation of ALS deaths.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/29990963\/","efa1d75d":"#val_accuracy: 0.0\nBest val_accuracy So Far: 0.15789473056793213","5a5022dd":"#H2OAutoML"}}
