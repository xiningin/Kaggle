Two causes for concern are isolation and burnout. Remote work is a common trend in many industries today, especially tech and business services; many are already familiar with how the solitude of working remotely can impact mental health. For those who are accustomed to and appreciative of conventional \u201coffice life\u201d and a steady rate of social interactions at the office, the shift to remote work as a result of social distancing procedure during the Covid-19 pandemic might cause a surprising, even if relatively mild, deterioration of mental health.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/onemind\/2020\/03\/17\/when-home-becomes-the-workplace-mental-health-and-remote-work\/?sh=6161335d1760","c9f814a0":"#Isolation\n\n\"Our daily interactions are shown to reinforce our sense of well-being and belonging in a community; and with cities like Los Angeles on lockdown, millions are being forced to not only work from home, but stay at home, as bars, restaurants, and events are closed through March 31. Even in \u201cnormal\u201d times, the impact of loneliness and isolation should not be understated; research has shown that it can be \u201ctwice as harmful to physical and mental health as obesity.\u201d One study found that for those who normally work remotely, 19% report loneliness. Loneliness is most risky when it is chronic, which, for many who live alone, could become a temporary reality as more and more people are encouraged to stay home during the coronavirus pandemic.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/onemind\/2020\/03\/17\/when-home-becomes-the-workplace-mental-health-and-remote-work\/?sh=6161335d1760"}}
