So why not just use this indicator instead of creating a winter weather? If the city of Chicago wanted to project future red light violations using weather data as features, nearly all forecasts contain temperature and precipitation projections but they may not contain anything specific to snow or ice.

In this dataset there are 183 unique intersections and 365 unique camera locations. Many of the intersections have multiple camera locations to capture each approach to the intersection. Because camera locations are not identified by approach, only intersection is used in this analysis. The apparent seasonal trend to the data led me to incorporate NOAA weather data for station id 725300 (Chicago\/O'Hare International Airport).

Why are people less likely to run red lights during January? One possibility is that drivers are more cautious during winter months than they are in the summer. There is also a significant amount of noise in this chart which appears to be at least partially due to the day of week, drivers tend to have more violations toward the end of the week than the beginning of the week.","f71325ac":"### <a id=\"2.3\">2.3 Winter weather<\/a>\nThis analysis looks at whether conditions which make drivers more cautious, such as winter weather conditions, has in impact on the number of red light violations. Winter weather was defined as a minimum temperature of 35\u00baF (the temperature at which most cars display a freeze warning) or less and precipitation of greater than 0 inches. Combining temperature and precipitation does show a correlation between winter weather conditions and a decrease in red light violations. This partly explains the seasonal trend in red light violations since Chicago is much more likely to see winter weather conditions in January than in July.","dbb01919":"### <a id=\"3.3\">3.3 Day of week boxplot<\/a>\nthe boxplots of the violations by day continues to show the day of week trend even with variances taken into account.","95ec5ba1":"### <a id=\"1.2\">1.2 Format Red Light Data<\/a>","e3a69ee9":"### <a id=\"1.5\">1.4 Map: Top 25 Violation Locations<\/a>\nThis map displays the top 25 Intersections by Violation. Many of these locations are near downtown. The top location, Cicero and I55, is near the Chicago Midway International Airport which may have an impact on the red light violations. This location also appears to be an entrance ramp from Cicero onto I55. Entrance ramp red lights may be used only during high traffic volume times or they may seem irrelevant during low traffic volume which may explain this increase in red light violations."}}
