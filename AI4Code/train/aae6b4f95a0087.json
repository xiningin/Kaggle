If the aim is to communicate findings, code cells will be hidden and markdown cells won't be used to explain what is going on in the code because we do not wish to muddy this communication of results. If the aim is to have people learn from the notebook then code cells will be displayed, and markdown cells will be used to explain aspects of the code. <br><br>\n    \nIf you wish to satisfy both objectives the best method I know of is to select hide input on code cells, allowing anyone curious to expand the hidden cells or open the notebook in an editor. Markdown cells can not be hidden in this manner so using them to explain code should probably be avoided to prevent derailment.<br><br>\n    \nBy including the button below in your notebook you can get the best of both worlds. With one click selected markdown cells, and all code cells, are hidden. This allows you to provide explanations for those wishing to understand the 'how' of your notebook, while providing an easy option to hide information that is superfluous to the presentation of your analysis. <br><br>\n    \n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/deepdivelm\/custom-plotly-charts-health-across-the-globe\">Here<\/a> is the notebook that I was making when I decided this toggle would be useful, and I'm satisfied with what it accomplishes.\n\nTo implement this idea I adapted code from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mchirico\/selectively-hide-code-python\">this<\/a> notebook which I found when searching for ways to hide or display groups of cells with 1 click. <br><br>\n    \nCurrently you provide a list of the text cells you wish to hide and a list of the code cells with outputs you wish to hide. By default all code cells hide but this behaviour could easily be changed to match the others. <br><br>\n    \nProblems: \n<ol>\n    <li>To make the correct output cells toggle in the viewer, 1 should be substracted from the index values which work correctly when viewing in the editor.<\/li>\n    <li>Excess whitespace remains behind which can lead to undesirable spacing when consecutive blocks are being hidden.<\/li>\n<\/ol>   \n    \nI've never used javascript before so this solution may be much uglier than necessary, if you can make it more eloquent please go ahead!\n    \n<\/div>","8a9dd300":"<div style=\"font-size:15px; font-family:verdana\">\n\nAnd here is an incredibly interesting result.
