Anything surprising?\n","19ff090b":"# Exercises\n\n## Step 1: Specify Prediction Target\nSelect the target variable, which corresponds to the sales price. Save this to a new variable called `y`. You'll need to print a list of the columns to find the name of the column you need.\n","5fe775e1":"## Step 2: Create X\nNow you will create a DataFrame called `X` holding the predictive features.\n\nSince you want only some columns from the original data, you'll first create a list with the names of the columns you want in `X`.\n\nYou'll use just the following columns in the list (you can copy and paste the whole list to save some typing, though you'll still need to add quotes):\n    * LotArea\n    * YearBuilt\n    * 1stFlrSF\n    * 2ndFlrSF\n    * FullBath\n    * BedroomAbvGr\n    * TotRmsAbvGrd\n\nAfter you've created that list of features, use it to create the DataFrame that you'll use to fit the model.","14840a51":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

Run this cell to set up your coding environment where the previous step left off.","544fcf7c":"## Step 3: Specify and Fit Model\nCreate a `DecisionTreeRegressor` and save it iowa_model. Ensure you've done the relevant import from sklearn to run this command.\n\nThen fit the model you just created using the data in `X` and `y` that you saved above.","3fc30e44":"## Step 4: Make Predictions\nMake predictions with the model's `predict` command using `X` as the data. Save the results to a variable called `predictions`.","5ec2ce5f":"It's natural to ask how accurate the model's predictions will be and how you can improve that.
