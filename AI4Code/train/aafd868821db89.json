UniVariate Analysis\nYou can use pdf, cdf, boxplot and violin plots to do analysis on a single feature to find out which feature is essential for classification.\n<br> Analysis done on a single feature is called Univariate Analysis where as on two features is called Bivariate Analysis.\n<br> If you are doing analysis on more than two variables, it is called Multivariate analysis.","4dcf7ae1":"# Observations:\nIt is fairly visible that the setosa are well seperated from virginica and versicolor and hence petal width is an important feature in classification.\n<br> If we observe the petal width for versicolor and virginica the overlap is approximately 20% which is greater than petal length.","fd9158f3":"You can tell what features are important from bivariate analysis(pairplots).
