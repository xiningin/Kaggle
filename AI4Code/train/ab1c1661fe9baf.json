They usually appear on product pages as a \"you may also like\" section.\n\nThe idea behind this recommender system is simple: if a customer is showing interest towards a product by browsing its page, he may also be interested by products that are similar.\n\n\n## How to proceed ?\n\nWe will used a pre-trained CNN model from Keras to extract the image features.\n\nThen we will compute similarities between the different products using the previously extracted image features.\n\nOther type of information can be used for this purpose such as the product category, size, color, etc. if the data is available, but that is not the case here."}}
