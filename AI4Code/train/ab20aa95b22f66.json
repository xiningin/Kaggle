A somewhat similar heuristic is also used by the United Nations to calculate the Human Development Index(HDI) to rank countries on the basis of their development.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques in the industry. By converting large data sets into smaller ones containing fewer variables, it helps in improving model performance, visualising complex data sets, and in many more areas.\n\nLet's use PCA for dimensionality reduction as from the heatmap it is evident that correlation exists between the attributes.","ee9794c8":"### Derived Metrices","83aa7c6f":"## Data Dictionary","b70aed65":"# Exploratory Data Analytics","1b5934ac":"5 reasons why we used a violin graph over boxplot\n- Violin graph is like box plot, but better\n- Violin graph is like density plot, but much useful\n- Violin graph is visually intuitive and attractive\n- Violin graph is non-parametric\n- There are many ways to use violin graphs","2322ec71":"Top 10 Countries having lowest health spending are mix bag of countries where per Capita income is very high or involved in unrest activities.","534477a7":"Top 10 Countries having highest Fertility Rate are places where people are poorest in all.","dddeb9ec":"### Null Percentage: Columns","345b4fa7":"# Introduction ","f289641f":"### Null Count: Rows","c6d0cf0f":"Top 10 Countries having lowest Per capita Income are from East Africa","06ea2aa1":"## Outlier Analysis","33663dd5":"As we can see from above heatmap that the correlation among the attributes is almost 0, we can proceed with this dataframe.","563788ba":"# Data Collected \/ Received","af119282":"Given a collection of points in two, three, or higher dimensional space, a \"best fitting\" line can be defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from a point to the line. The next best-fitting line can be similarly chosen from directions perpendicular to the first. Repeating this process yields an orthogonal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are uncorrelated. These basis vectors are called Principal Components, and several related procedures Principal Component Analysis (**PCA**).\n\nPCA is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction i.e. by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The ith principal component can be taken as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data and is orthogonal to the first i-1 principal components. From either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, principal components are often computed using an eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or SVD of the data matrix.","e9e05a20":"Top 10 Countries having lowest GDP per capita are from East Africa","232400f5":"We are able to see how Exports is distributed across the all countries.
