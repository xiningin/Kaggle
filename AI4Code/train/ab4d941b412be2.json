Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we neeedto build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).","63bd1dfa":"Metrics beyond simply accuracy","08a4fa46":"## Variable are correctly classified & added in dataset","e3420ef4":"It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems.
