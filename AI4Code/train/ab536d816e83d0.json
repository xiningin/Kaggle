Due to the mutation in the gene, the cells start growing in an uncontrolled way. Those uncntrolled growth or tumers could be visualized through the mammogram. According to the study all irregular growths are not cancer. From the mammogram the tumer size, texture etc could be analyzed to classify the cancerous cells.\nIn this note book a breast cancer data set has been analyzed. The data set comprises the numerical values derived from the mammogram. ","df152b24":"# Exploratory Data Analysis"}}
