Actually, there are two ways of understanding the space in difficult 4 cipher:\n1. There are 11 types of 'alphabets' to present information, each alphabet carries some kind of information.\n2. The 0-9 numbers contain information, the space is only a way to separate 'words' or 'letters'.\n\nLet's try figure it out.","b848fb09":"The figure above shows the weight of each number in the ciphertext, where the weight of space should be length-1 \/ length.
