This is as expected. It looks like most of the really long returns we saw earlier are in this subset.","4a56dbd2":"### Which teams gave up the most kickoff returns for a touchdown?","06f6e8ab":"So we can see that only 21 out of 2,921 kickoff returns resulted in a touchdown. That's only about 0.7%.","c4cf9b8a":"98.9% accuracy at anything is pretty impressive, but let's take a closer look at just those plays where the kick direction doesn't match the intended direction.","b1dfda28":"Not surprisingly, most of the long returns were when the return team was in the most popular formation.\n\n### Is hang time related to return yardage?\n\nLet's look at the distribution of hang times of kicks and how it relates to return yards.","d20dbb39":"It makes sense that most kicks would be straight up the middle, since it's harder to kick the ball out of bounds that way, and easier to kick it through the end zone, which is what most teams are trying to do most of the time. Let's look at how often the intended kick direction doesn't match the actual direction.","de0641d7":"### Kick type, direction, hang-time, and return formation\n\nLet's look at more attributes of the play by merging in the scouting data with the data on kickoffs that were returned.","3aa2cbc4":"So, only 9 kickoffs in the dataset were returned for more 100 yards. If we look at the `playDescription` field we can see that the play result of `TOUCHDOWN` is recorded here. We can use this to find all kickoffs that were returned for a touchdown, regardless of return length.","ab01a62c":"### Summary\n\nMost kickoffs are basically the same. Teams try to kick the ball out of the back of the endzone to avoid a return. When they fail to do this, the majority of returns are around 20 yards. Onside kicks and returns for touchdowns are extremely rare. The best things kicking teams can do to avoid long returns are:\n\n1. Kick the ball through the end zone\n2. Don't miss tackles on returns","89066705":"That looks like the distribution for most of the other types of kicks. It looks like these small mistakes in kick direction aren't that costly in terms of return yards.\n\n### How do missed tackles impact returns?\n\nThe last thing I want to look at is plays where there are missed tackles. This should correlate to longer returns more than any other feature of this data set.","5486ebd4":"### What are the most common kick types and kickoff return formations?","8bf78ed5":"### Is kick direction related to return yards?","be99a98c":"### What's the average and maximum return yardage given up by each team?\n\nLet's start by looking at the distribution of return yards overall, then look at a boxplot for each team.","5575b606":"Again, there doesn't appear to be much relationship here. Since the vast majority of kickoffs have a hang time between 3.5 and 4.5 seconds, it makes sense that all of long returns would be on this type of kick.","c3777aad":"Let's look at the first kickoff return for a touchdown in our data set, which has TEN kicking to MIA.","88dad18f":"### Visualize a Kickoff Return\n\nCredit to [Joseph Mohr](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/josephvm) for the following animation. I took the `getPlayAnimation` from his [NFL BDB 2022 - Play Animation & Tracking EDA](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/josephvm\/nfl-bdb-2022-play-animation-tracking-eda) notebook and modified it to look slightly more like a football field.","4e76d7b9":"Out of 19,979 total special teams plays in the dataset, nearly 8,000 were kickoffs, the most frequent type of special teams play.","4f447846":"Well over half (4,773) of all kickoffs (7,843) went for a touchback. Only 2,921, or 37% were returned.","677abc53":"### Load plays data and see how many plays were kickoffs","c04968ff":"Since the deep kick is the most common, it's also the kick type with the most returns for long yardage.\n\nThe kickoff formation is a 3-digit code indicating the number of players in the Front Wall, Mid Wall, and Back Wall during the kick. Let's look at which formations are most popular, then at the distribution of return yards for each formation.","2566ed72":"### How many kickoffs were returned?","3c12ab36":"From both the histogram and the boxplot, we can see that most kickoff returns were concentrated around 20 yards, but there were several kickoffs that were returned for more than 100 yards. Those must have been for touchdowns, so let's look at that subset to see if there's anything in the description that indicates a TD. We can use that to get all kickoffs that were returned for a touchdown."}}
