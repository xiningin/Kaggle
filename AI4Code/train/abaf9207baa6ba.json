Below, we've provided a helper function for loading in any type and size of image.

Therefore, the number of steps is really up to you to set! **I recommend using at least 2000 steps for good results.** But, you may want to start out with fewer steps if you are just testing out different weight values or experimenting with different images.\n\nInside the iteration loop, you'll calculate the content and style losses and update your target image, accordingly.\n\n#### Content Loss\n\nThe content loss will be the mean squared difference between the target and content features at layer `conv4_2`. This can be calculated as follows: \n```\ncontent_loss = torch.mean((target_features['conv4_2'] - content_features['conv4_2'])**2)\n```\n\n#### Style Loss\n\nThe style loss is calculated in a similar way, only you have to iterate through a number of layers, specified by name in our dictionary `style_weights`. \n> You'll calculate the gram matrix for the target image, `target_gram` and style image `style_gram` at each of these layers and compare those gram matrices, calculating the `layer_style_loss`. \n> Later, you'll see that this value is normalized by the size of the layer.\n\n#### Total Loss\n\nFinally, you'll create the total loss by adding up the style and content losses and weighting them with your specified alpha and beta!\n\nIntermittently, we'll print out this loss; don't be alarmed if the loss is very large. It takes some time for an image's style to change and you should focus on the appearance of your target image rather than any loss value. Still, you should see that this loss decreases over some number of iterations.","4e72225b":"![](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/YbjVz7t\/download-4.png)","c361c68f":"![](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/ChZ3s0y\/download-1.png)","74b590f8":"## Display the Target Image","cca8d0fa":"## Deep Learning Gallery ","759c2d2e":"![](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/XyZJTSP\/download-22.png)","85efba79":"---\n## VGG19 Layers\n\nTo get the content and style representations of an image, we have to pass an image forward throug the VGG19 network until we get to the desired layer(s) and then get the output from that layer.","b13eacc9":"---\n## Loss and Weights\n\n#### Individual Layer Style Weights\n\nBelow, you are given the option to weight the style representation at each relevant layer. It's suggested that you use a range between 0-1 to weight these layers. By weighting earlier layers (`conv1_1` and `conv2_1`) more, you can expect to get _larger_ style artifacts in your resulting, target image. Should you choose to weight later layers, you'll get more emphasis on smaller features. This is because each layer is a different size and together they create a multi-scale style representation!\n\n#### Content and Style Weight\n\nJust like in the paper, we define an alpha (`content_weight`) and a beta (`style_weight`). This ratio will affect how _stylized_ your final image is. It's recommended that you leave the content_weight = 1 and set the style_weight to achieve the ratio you want.","62d16626":"---\n## Gram Matrix \n\nThe output of every convolutional layer is a Tensor with dimensions associated with the `batch_size`, a depth, `d` and some height and width (`h`, `w`). The Gram matrix of a convolutional layer can be calculated as follows:\n* Get the depth, height, and width of a tensor using `batch_size, d, h, w = tensor.size`\n* Reshape that tensor so that the spatial dimensions are flattened\n* Calculate the gram matrix by multiplying the reshaped tensor by it's transpose \n\n*Note: You can multiply two matrices using `torch.mm(matrix1, matrix2)`.*","33fd9903":"# Style Transfer with Deep Neural Networks\n\n\nIn this notebook, we\u2019ll *recreate* a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys](https:\/\/www.cv-foundation.org\/openaccess\/content_cvpr_2016\/papers\/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in PyTorch.\n\nIn this paper, style transfer uses the features found in the 19-layer VGG Network, which is comprised of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, and a few fully-connected layers. In the image below, the convolutional layers are named by stack and their order in the stack. Conv_1_1 is the first convolutional layer that an image is passed through, in the first stack. Conv_2_1 is the first convolutional layer in the *second* stack. The deepest convolutional layer in the network is conv_5_4.\n\n<img src='https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AT-Kf6vwbPs\/maxresdefault.jpg' width=80% \/>\n\n### Separating Style and Content\n\nStyle transfer relies on separating the content and style of an image. Given one content image and one style image, we aim to create a new, _target_ image which should contain our desired content and style components:\n* objects and their arrangement are similar to that of the **content image**\n* style, colors, and textures are similar to that of the **style image**\n\nAn example is shown below, where the content image is of a cat, and the style image is of [Hokusai's Great Wave](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa). The generated target image still contains the cat but is stylized with the waves, blue and beige colors, and block print textures of the style image!\n\n<img src='https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*VUbHKrDK6Sz5yHo2' width=80% \/>\n\nIn this notebook, we'll use a pre-trained VGG19 Net to extract content or style features from a passed in image. We'll then formalize the idea of content and style _losses_ and use those to iteratively update our target image until we get a result that we want. You are encouraged to use a style and content image of your own and share your work on Twitter with @udacity; we'd love to see what you come up with!"}}
