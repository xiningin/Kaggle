During that time they documented environmental changes and how these changes favored certain individuals within the population, illustrating natural selection in action.\n\nThe dataset focuses on finches beak dimension. For the finches, the size and shape of their beaks are traits that vary to adapt the environmental changes. The relationship between beak size and ecological events which has been somewhat popularised as being an example of \u2018evolution occurring before our eyes\u2019.\n\n### Content\nThe dataset consist of 2 files:\n\n* Finch Beak 1975: The beak measurement of the finches recorded in 1975.\n* Finch Beak 2012: The beak measurement of the finches recorded in 2012.\n\n\n**Darwin's finches (also known as the Gal\u00e1pagos finches)** are a group of about 15 species of passerine birds.They are well known for their remarkable diversity in beak form and function. They are often classified as the subfamily Geospizinae or tribe Geospizini. They belong to the tanager family and are not closely related to the true finches. The closest known relative of the Gal\u00e1pagos finches is the South American Tiaris obscurus. They were first collected by Charles Darwin on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands during the second voyage of the Beagle. Apart from the Cocos finch, which is from Cocos Island, the others are found only on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.","7215c0ad":"Eyeballing, the plots above we can say that there are minute change in the mean beak length of G.fortis in 2012 than 1975, the mean beak length of 2012 appears to be shorter and it has a bigger variance.
