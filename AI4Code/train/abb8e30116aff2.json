Acceleration, year and origin are positively correlated while all others are negatively correlated.\n     2) We can see from heatmap variables like cylinders, displacement, horsepower & weight have greater impact. Hence they have more statistically significant relationship. Also we can see there's fair impact of acceleration, year and origin but not as above variables.\n     3) Even though year suggests one of highly correlated coefficient 0.580541, the causality is less","01144d95":"1) We can see here that for there is relationship between predictor and response. It is fairly linear.\n2) The relationship is strong as change in horsepower proportionally impacts miles per gallon\n3) The mpg decreases as we increase horsepower so we can say that their relationship is negative. There is one important phenomenon here that for horsepower below 75 mpg consumption is high similarly after 200 mpg starts to increase. In between these rangess they have almost linear changes. It is almost parabolic response. We can derive that from 75 to 175 the fuel consumption is moderate so it is most recommended range of operation.\n4) For 98 horsepower, the miles per gallon predicted is approximately 26-28, but the actual values are between 25-27.\n5) The plot already contains linear regression line.","c9084216":"# Analysing Auto dataset"}}
