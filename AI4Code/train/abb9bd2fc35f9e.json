Posts","134bc352":"According to the articles above, news that is reported by men is taken more seriously than the news that females report due the gendered view of journalism and the male gaze which objectifies females and therefore their bodies become more important than the issue they talk about. It is also reported that due to the patriarchal perception of society, the news reported by females are not seen as serious or valid as males. And it is illustrated in this example from Vox, it reports that male reported retweet other male reporters three times more than female reporters. \n\nIn this research I will be taking the research one step further to explore whether gendered views on journalism exist the same way for people who belong to the liberal\/left wing political group as they do for the right wing group if the level of popularity and relevance is the same for each journalist. This study will not focus on how generally females are regarded in the journalism sector but how equally famous and valid reporters are treated and if there is a difference in their reception. This will also help illustrate if females can break out of their gendered bias if they become as successful as other male reporters.\n\nEach reported will have a total of 100 posts to analyze.\n\nFirstly, I will be calculating and comparing the rate of posts shared of each reporter and how many comments they receive. \n\nI will also mine the text from the top 3 posts of each to analyse the general material reporters talk about. \n\nI will mine the text from the the top 3 comments to analyze the general reaction of the public to these reporters.\n\nI will also calculate the mean sentiments of the comments that reporters receive on average. \n\nLastly I will illustrate a distribution chart to compare the different reactions each reporters post receives on avergae. \n\nThis research is not so much about the content that these reporters produce but the general gist of how they are recieved by the public on facebook.\n\nTherfore I will take an approach that looks both at the data and statistic mined from these reporters and also the text from comments and posts.\n\nI will be taking a famous male and female journalist who are prominently right wing as well as male and female journalists who are famously left wing. I have searched for personalities that active and famous on facebook and are followed by an average of a million facebook users. To keep this study controlled and the results as valid as possible, I have placed a certain criteria for the journalists I have chosen.  1)They should be famous in the United States. 2) They should cover more or less the same political issues. 3) They should have a high and equal level of relevance. 4) They should also be in the same age bracket.5) They should be famous journalists who also appear regularly on American television, daytime or nighttime. 6) They should work with famous American television networks such as CNN, ABC, HBO, FOX etc.\nAfter carefully looking at journalists I finalized these four as my research subjects.\n\n\n1) Megyn Kelly as a famous female Right Journalist followed by 1,017,732 people\n\n2) Glenn Beck as a famous male Right Journalist followed by 2,676,248 people\n\n3) Christiane Amanpour as a famous female Left Journalist followed by 720,474 people\n\n4) Anderson Cooper as a famous male left Journalist followed by 895,474 people\n\n\nI have taken a 100 posts from each of their Facebook pages from the last year with the top 200 rated comments from Netvizz.\n","35ae70e0":"###### Comparison of Hate Received ","84dd6e22":"Even though initial findings state that bias exist in both left and right wing camps. There are certain complexities and differences that can be inferred from the findings above that i will discuss below.\n\nFirst I am going to analyze their most popular posts and its texts to get a gist of what their reporting material is like.\n\nAnalyzing the texts we have gathered from posts, all four reporters report on the same type of issues(crime, injustice, election and Trump) however the approach is quite different. Right wing reportings tend to be more negative, sensational and about the dangers Americans face.\n\nLeft wing tends to focus on localised problems, historical and sociological discussions. The left wing female shows \n\nRight wing news consumers exhibit the least amount of love for right wing males and more love for the females.\n\nSo we have established the similarities and differences in the left wing reporting styles. Let's move on to the statistics.\n\nIf we compare the result of the share count to that the study from Vox, the right wing male's posts were shared about 10 times more than the females. However if we move over to the left wing, the female reporter enjoyed more shares. This also shows that perhaps left leaning individuals are more inclined to not let gender rule their opinion on the validity of the news. Right wing news consumers exhibit gender very strongly and perhaps that camp is inclined to more bias in general.\n\nRight wing journalists tend to incite more hatred than love than left wing journalists. Even though the females of the left and right wing fall somewhere in the middle. The right wing male receives more hatred than all of the subjects and the left wing male receives the least. In this case the left wing female does incite more hate than the male. However the difference is very little. The right wing female incites more hatred than both left wing subjects however, by far,  not as much as her male counter part.\n\nNow coming to the comments, Megyn Kelly, the female right wing reporter seems to get the most amounts of comments, even more than the male right wing reporter. The female left wing reporter seems to get the least amount of comments per post, less than the male left wing reporter. In this respect left wing shows more of a gender bias than the right wing.\n\nComing to the sentiment analysis of the comments because the number of comments alone do not tell us what is going on. According to the sentiment analyzer. Left wing male receives the most positive comments on average and the right wing male receives the most negative.\n\nThere are of-course many limitations to this study because, there many be alot of other factors that influence the results however it shows that gender bias exists in both left and right wing camps in varied amounts. Both reporters in each camp have the same ideologies and present issues the same way, but the males seem to get a little more attention and appreciation than the females. Even if it is a matter of angry reacts, both the males incite the greater emotional response because their opinions and views effect people more. In some cases we see an equality or a lack of gender bias. Such as the case with shares, left wing shows less gender bias, however in terms of comments, the right wing shows that the female gets more comments. This can mean many things, by analysis the emotions of her comments are the most negative but still more negative than the two left reporters. \n\nI feel that this report shows us gender bias very much exists today with equally successful journalists aswell but it seems as if the problem is not as bad as is shown in the studies done once the female reporters have shown their worth and the glass ceiling is broken, or simply maybe because we are moving onto a more enlightened age. However that is not enough because every female reporter must get the same opportunity and attitude we lend to male reporters.\n","f68ebd98":"### Visualising the Statistics ","9db19eb5":"The right wing reporter recieves the most hate reactions, almsot 20 times as much as the others.

This phenomena has become a lot more magnified with the social media platforms. There have been a few studies about this that try and elaborate the gap in the reporting patterns as well the reception of reporter colleagues.\n\n\u201cThe Male Glance: How We Fail to Take Women\u2019s Stories Seriously | News | The Guardian.\u201d n.d. Accessed January 22, 2019. https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/news\/2018\/mar\/06\/the-male-glance-how-we-fail-to-take-womens\n\nAccording to the Guardian Article there has been observed to be a considerable difference between how news stories or material presented by women is treated as compared to their male colleagues. Stories reported by women are not given much importance or validity.Stories reported by men on the other hand are always lauded for being exceptional and always seen as worthy even if the male reporter does not have high credibility. Females are also often objectified by being judged on their looks rather than their work.\n\nSteiner, Linda. 2017. Gender and Journalism. Vol. 1. Oxford University Press. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190228613.013.91.\n\nSteiner talks about how there is also a sort of culture in the newsroom that gives women less importance and therefore they have always been given subjects to to cover that are less important. Therefore their brand of \njournalism is taken as \"light\". Women reporters are also significantly lower in numbers than men, especially in political and sports news, which is why it much harder to break through such a glass ceiling.\n\n\u201cStudy: Male D.C. Reporters Retweet Male Colleagues Three Times More - Vox.\u201d n.d.

Do the opinions of the public change if two reporters with the same credibility and ideologies report on the same type of news but are of different genders.\n\nThis research will try and gauge the reception of the public and figure out if a strong bias does exist in the minds of the people in this day and age based on data collected from Facebook posts. \n\nTo add a layer of contextualisation I will also divide the male and reporters into the left and right wing ideologies since no research has been carried out in that respect. This will help us get a clearer understandingof the patterns of bias within the pubic.\n\nApart from the profession, how true is it that females are still regarded as less important than the males by the consumers of journalism.","f793468c":"##### Reaction Distribution per Post","6af07198":"##### Post Content","d2914df4":"The conclusion is that gender bias in journalism exists very much and political opinion can differ if the gender is different however it shows that the bias is not overtly dominant and that there are many facets and not only sharing of posts that can allow us to look at how female reporters are responded to.\n\nWhen these different facets such as comments and reactions are looked at the, gender bias diminishes a little and we can a more detailed picture of the issue.\n\nGender bias exists but it is definetly on its way to lessening. The results seemed more hopeful than the previous discussions had led me to believe or perhaps it is a simply a matter of what pool of subjects are chosen.\n\nAll in all this research was really intersting to do because a qualitative approach allows us to guage the actual results and responses that individuals have. This type of code also allow us to weed out the complexities of the situation. As we had divided our subjects between left and right wing camps. We could analyze how different people tend to respond to the same phenomena such as female journalism. \n\nQualitative results allow us to gain an indepth perception of why as to this occurs but of a limited number of individuals. But this approach along with textual analysis really allows us to get the best of both worlds.\n\nWe were able to get a real time example of the public responding to gendered journalism and we got a more concrete idea of the publics opinion.","3fa0c7bf":"The males of both left and right wing recieve more love than the females.
