It's made up of three components:\n1. Analytical Writing (Scored on a 0-6 scale in half-point increments)\n2. Verbal Reasoning (Scored on a 130-170 scale)\n3. Quantitative Reasoning (Scored on a 130-170 scale)\n\nIn this dataset, the GRE Score is based on a maximum of 340 points. The mean is 317 with a standard deviation of 11.5.\n\n### **GRE Score vs Chance of Admit**\n\nGRE scores have a strong correlation with the chance of admission however not as strong as one's CGPA.\n","252ec35b":"Next, let's import our dataset and see what we're working with.","1dbcab2b":"## **Machine Learning **\n\nThe end goal is to determine if an applicant will be admitted to the univeristy or not. Therefore, this is a classification case. We'll use multiple techniques and eventually select the method with the best score. The methods used will be:\n\n1. Logistic Regression\n2.

The university weighs certain aspects of a student's education to determine their acceptance.\n\nThe objective is to explore what kind of data is provided, determine the most important factors that contribute to a student's chance of admission, and select the most accurate model to predict the probability of admission.\n\n### **Data Description**\nThe dataset contains information about a student's:\n* GRE Score\n* TOEFL Score\n* University Ratings\n* Statement of Purpose Score\n* Letter of Recomendation Score\n* CGPA\n* Whether the Student Has Done Any Research\n* Chance of Admission (What We're Trying to Predict)","2dd29aaa":"### **Research**\n\nLet's explore how many applicants have research experience.\n\nIt seems the majority of applicants have research experience. However, this is the least important feature, so it doesn't matter all too much if an applicant has the experience or not.","faa896a8":"The top three features that affect the Chance to Admit are:\n1. CGPA\n2. GRE Score\n3. TOEFL Score\n\nLet's explore these three features to get a better understanding.","5c93fe68":"### **TOEFL Score**\n\nThe Test of English as a Foreign Language is a standarized test for non-native English speakers that are choosing to enroll in English-speaking universities.\n\nThe test is split up into 4 sections:\n1. Reading\n2. Listening\n3. Speaking\n4. Writing\n\nAll sections are scored out of 30, giving the exam a total score of 120 marks. In this dataset, the TOEFL scores have a mean of 107 and a standard deviation of 6.\n\n### **TOEFL Score vs Chance of Admit**\n\nLike GRE scores, the scores received for the TOEFL strongly correlate to an applicants chance of admission.","e620ea1a":"### **Logistic Regression**"}}
