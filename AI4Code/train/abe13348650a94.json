Hard coding a Boltzmann Machine","c8fd20a5":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\"> In Physics, the Boltzmann distribution furnishes the probability of a particle being observed in a given state with energy E. In a RBM, we are interested in the probability to observe a state of v and h based on the overall model energy. As the calculation of the joint Boltzmann probability would be complex in networks with a large numbers of combinations of visible and hidden node values (v and h), the analysis focuses instead on the calculation of the conditional probabilities of hidden nodes being in a particular state <b>given<\/b> the state of the visible nodes, denoted as <b>p(h|v)<\/b>, and also the conditional probabilities of visible nodes being in a particular state <b>given<\/b> the state of the hidden nodes, denoted as <b>p(v|h)<\/b>:<\/p>","69c70b7e":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Unlike supervised learning, where machines are typically fed with pairs of known inputs and corresponding outputs to direct the learning and self-adaptation processes, in unsupervised learning machines are supplied with unlabeled responses and are expected to learn probability distributions from inference, with minimum or no human guidance.

Ideally, visible and hidden nodes would be dynamically activated (1) or not (0), representing an immense multitude of different machine states.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">However, the last.fm dataset contains total numbers of scrobbles generated per user, per music artist - a direct measure of artist popularity we intend to explore with the RBM. Furthermore, the dataset includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Both heavy users, who have generated dozens, even hundreds of thousands of 'scrobbles' for selected artists, and light users, who produced few 'scrobbles' for few artists. The model must ideally not allow that heavy user preferences overshadow those of light users;<\/li>\n    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">For every user, the number of scrobbles per artist may vary from one to thousands. The model shall ideally not allow high scrobble counts per user to drastically overshadow low scrobble counts per user.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Having said that, instead of feeding the model with simple binary inputs, which would correspond to a set of 'scrobbled' and 'not scrobbled' music artists for a given user, the machine will be supplied with scaled inputs ranging from 0 to 1 for each 'scrobbled' music artist, on a per user basis. For a given user, a scaled number of scrobbles of a given artist close to '0' means that a small number of scrobbles was generated - the user briefly checked on that artist but the return rate was none or very small, a sign of low 'popularity' of that artist for that user. Inversely, a scaled number of scrobbles of a given artist, for a given user, close to '1' means that a large number of scrobbles was collected - the user listened to that artist several times with a high return rate, an indication of high 'popularity' of that artist for that user.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The traditional approach (i.e. assigning 1 to 'scrobbled' artists and '0' to 'not scrobbled' artists) would not bring to the analysis how popular a given artist is for a given user. An artist with 1 scrobble would be given the same weight as an artist with, let's say, 1,000 scrobbles.
