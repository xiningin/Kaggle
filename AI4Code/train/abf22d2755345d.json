The goal is to use **statsmodels** to fit the regression model you specified in part **a.** to see if there is a significant difference in conversion based on which page a customer receives.

If you want to assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5%, what should your null and alternative hypotheses be?  You can state your hypothesis in terms of words or in terms of **$p_{old}$** and **$p_{new}$**, which are the converted rates for the old and new pages.","edc7e5fb":"a.

Let `n_old` and `n_new` refer the the number of rows associated with the old page and new pages, respectively.","4fa1d940":"g. Now along with testing if the conversion rate changes for different pages, also add an effect based on which country a user lives.
