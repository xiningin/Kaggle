This would assist in their daily activities.<hr> Also there should be a notification feature to remind the users who would like to get fit, to engage in some activities like 'climbing up and down the staircase', 'going for a short walk during office hours', etc to increase their active minutes. <hr> Due to the fact that the daily log of activities increases from Tuesdays to Fridays, Bellabeat can inculcate this report into their app by recommending that users take up a weekday fitness challenge from Monday to Friday. <hr> A daily streak feature should also be included so that users can know the number of days they work out. This would increase their active minutes exponentially. |\n| Daily Heart_Rate | In order to reduce stress levels, Bellabeat should also include a feature that monitors users heart_rate per minute. <hr> If the heart_rate value is above 100 BMP, there should be a notification alerting the user of their stress level. |\n| Daily Sleep | Users should be encouraged to go to bed early. <hr> Bellabeat should be linked to their phones or the internet to provide the users sleep inducing music (upon request), especially for those who find it difficult to fall asleep.  |\n| Weight Log | Due to the sedentary lifestyle of most participants, their BMI category falls on \"overweight.\"<hr>  Bellabeat can include a feature that reminds users to do little exercise on a daily basis, like walking, jogging, climbing up and down the stairs, etc.  |"}}
