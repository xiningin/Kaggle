The dataset is looking cleaner, but there are still some ugly column names like review.point, we can easily clean these up.","eef09f38":"The column is now looking more slightly more uniform, we can remove the ABVs from name and move them  into their own column where they belong.\n\nNote: For anyone wondering why ABV is relevant, I generally prefer bottlings to be \u2265 43% to allow for the addition of water to open them up. Additionally cask strength bottlings like those with ABVs in the 50s or 60s are usually watered down to a more palatable AVB which means more pours from the same sized bottle. ","114f419b":"We can take a look to see if there is any clear relationship between Score and Price, which seems like a reasonable assumption to make.

If we look at the cheaply priced Whiskys we can see that it's dominated mostly by blends, which is not surprising. At all prices there are bottles with scores from around 80 to 85, but there seems to be an increase in quality initially at around \\\\$30, at which point we start to see an increase in scores between 85 and 90 points, and again at a \\\\$50 price point where we start to see multiple scores greater than 90. \n\nAs I had expected, there isn't much of a relationship between price and score, beyond a particular price point.","64b7f6ae":"It appears as though the entire \"Currency\" column is listed in dollars, this should be easy to confirm.","8d5ee6b3":"The vast majority of our data are comprised of Single Malts, which refers to bottlings that come from one particular distillery. We do however have enough data to see that all types of Whisky have a somewhat similar distribution, with a slight exception for Single Grain Whisky which is lacking any bottling that recieived a score greater than 95.","0e41e6b5":"Ultimately I would like to find Scotch with good score to price ratios.","f871da3e":"# A quick EDA of a Scotch Whisky Dataset.\n","f4c7a7cf":"It would have been nice to have some sort of uniformity in the name syntax, but we can make this work.","48623b44":"I'm interested in taking a look at just the entries from Islay, as this is my preferred region due to the smoky profile of the whiskys distilled there. The data isn't organized in a way where I could select by region, so I'll need to get a bit creative.","8315bce2":"When I tried converting the prices into integers, I ran into trouble with a few very expensive scotches which had prices written with commas. I considered using pd.to_numeric with errors= 'coerce', but that would mean either manually re-entering the prices or removing those scotches from the list, which I don't want to do at this time (Even though I assume they will be major outliers in the future). Instead, we can just remove the commas from all entries. \n\nI need to create a list of the indexes of these problematic prices.","81d3c9d6":"At this point I downloaded the cleaned dataset into an excel file to give it a quick look over and see if I spotted any inconsistencies or major discrepancies. I noticed a few of the very expensive bottlings had strange formatting and so I fixed them via their indicies, more information is provided below.\n\nThis clearly would not be a viable option in a larger dataset, but it took me only a minute to look over this particular set. ","e53d2352":"At this point, I am looking to graph my filtered dataframe with Islay Whiskys only, I dropped the outliers (the collector bottles over \\\\$10,000) and look at the bottles within a reasonable price range, we will look at \\\\$300 and below.","23fba8f2":"Our data contains 2247 rows but only 2186 end with %. Let's find those which don't before we try to separate out the ABV.","490e0983":"Ultimately I am happy with this cleaned up data as it will help me find the best value Whiskys by distillery whenever I am in the market for a new bottle.\n\nI would certainly appreciate constructive comments and insights as I am relatively new to this sort of work and looking to start a career in Data science. ","31ceac3c":"I wanted to try and clean up this Dataset in a way which allows me to find good value Whiskys, especially from Distilleries or regions which I prefer. \n\nLet's start with a quick look at the data."}}
