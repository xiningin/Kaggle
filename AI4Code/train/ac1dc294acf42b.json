INTRODUCTION\nAn affordable, reliable, and environmentally sustainable power sector is central to modern society. Governments, utilities, and companies make decisions that both affect and depend on the power sector. For example, if governments apply a carbon price to electricity generation, it changes how plants run and which plants are built over time. On the other hand, each new plant affects the electricity generation mix, the reliability of the system, and system emissions. Plants also have significant impact on climate change, through carbon dioxide (CO2)emissions; on water stress, through water withdrawal and consumption; and on air quality, through sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions.\n2 Despite the importance of the power sector, there is no global, open-access database of power plants. Existing databases fail to be either truly comprehensive or fully open. Many countries do not report their power sector data at the plant level, and those that do vary wildly in what they report, how they report it, and how frequently they report. The lack of reporting standards makes data gathering time intensive, as the data are in different formats and must be harmonized. This creates a barrier for conducting global and national research and analysis of the power sector.The Global Power Plant Database leverages existing data sources and methodologies to build a comprehensive and open-access power sector database.\nthe following characteristics and indicators:\n##### \u25aa Technical characteristics (fuel, technology, ownership)\n##### \u25aa Operational characteristics (generation)\n##### \u25aa Plants\u2019 geolocation\n##### \u25aa Plants over 1 megawatt (MW)\n##### \u25aa Plants in operation only (in first iteratio)\n\n## 2. LIMITATIONS\nMany challenges and limitations arise when collecting \ndata from a variety of different sources and when there \nis a lack of officially reported data. Although data in \ndifferent languages can slow the collection process, we would consider this a challenge and not a limitation. With \nan international staff and translation services available \nthrough the web, we have been able to collect data in \nmany languages. The primary limitations are listed below:\n##### 1. Data availability (of small and renewable power plants)\n##### 2. Reporting delay\n##### 3. Data reliability\n##### 4. Lack of operational data reported (electricity \ngeneration, emissions, water use)\nData availability is the primary limitation. Because most \ncountries do not publicly report their power sector data, \nit is not feasible to assemble 100 percent power plant \ncoverage. It is particularly difficult to identify the smaller, \ndistributed power plants, a category that includes smaller \nrenewables and diesel generators.\n\n## Question about this data\n1. Find top 10 Power palant with maximum Capacity\n2. what is the primary fuel of top 10 Power plant and find out percentage of each power plant primary fuel\n3.
