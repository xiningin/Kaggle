An algorithm is said to be differentially private if an adversary cannot use auxiliary information to reverse engineer the sensitive data .\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#e76f51;\">Why anonymization is not sufficient ?<\/span>**\n\nPrivate data of patients in healthcare has huge potential to transform medical treatments . However exposing such data comes with substantial risk to privacy .Anonymization of features is no longer sufficient when exposing sensitive data .\n\n\nIn the 1990s , the Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission decided to release anonymized data on state employees that showed every single hospital visit . The goal was to help researchers, and the state spent time removing all obvious identifiers such as name, address, and Social Security number.In 1997 , Latanya Sweeney , a graduate student at MIT was able to identify medical record of Governor William Weld using zip code , birth date and voter registration records from Cambridge , Massachusetts .\n\n![](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?id=1exheko3vbEd14tLo1bDts8p7l9hgZ4Sk)\n\nNetflix released an anonymized viewing dataset for a competition to build a better recommendation engine in 2006 .

Mechanisms have little or no default settings, and are intended for use by experts implementing their own models. They can, however, be used outside models for separate investigations, etc.\n\n**Models:** This module includes machine learning models with differential privacy. Diffprivlib currently has models for clustering, classification, regression, dimensionality reduction and pre-processing.\n\n**Tools:** Diffprivlib comes with a number of generic tools for differentially private data analysis. This includes differentially private histograms, following the same format as Numpy's histogram function.\n\n**Accountant:** The BudgetAccountant class can be used to track privacy budget and calculate total privacy loss using advanced composition techniques.\n \n","d36a0e56":"\n# **<span style=\"color:#e76f51;\">Logging to W & B environment<\/span>**","58ac7b79":"# **<span style=\"color:#e76f51;\">Target Variable Distribution<\/span>**","2d018b04":"Some example notebooks to experiment with is present in the official github repository\n\n[Github](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/differential-privacy-library)\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#e76f51;\">Resources for Differential Privacy<\/span>**\n\nhttps:\/\/privacytools.seas.harvard.edu\/differential-privacy\n\nThe Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy (Cynthia Dwork., Aaron Roth).\n\nDeep Learning with Differential Privacy (M Abadi, A Chu, I Goodfellow, HB McMahan)\n\nConcentrated Differential Privacy (Cynthia Dwork, Guy N.
