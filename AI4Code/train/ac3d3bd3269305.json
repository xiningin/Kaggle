The imbalance was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There's an urgent need to better understand and measure the scope and impact of the pandemic on these inequities.\n\nEducation technology company LearnPlatform was founded in 2014 with a mission to expand equitable access to education technology for all students and teachers. LearnPlatform\u2019s comprehensive edtech effectiveness system is used by districts and states to continuously improve the safety, equity, and effectiveness of their educational technology. LearnPlatform does so by generating an evidence basis for what\u2019s working and enacting it to benefit students, teachers, and budgets.\n\nIn this analytics competition, you\u2019ll work to uncover trends in digital learning. Accomplish this with data analysis about how engagement with digital learning relates to factors like district demographics, broadband access, and state\/national level policies and events. Then, submit a Kaggle Notebook to propose your best solution to these educational inequities.\n\nYour submissions will inform policies and practices that close the digital divide.

Learners build knowledge as they explore the world around them, observe and interact with phenomena, converse and engage with others, and make connections between new ideas and prior understandings.\n\n- Builds on prior knowledge - and involves enriching, building on, and changing existing understanding, where \u201cone\u2019s knowledge base is a scaffold that supports the construction of all future learning\u201d (Alexander, 1996, p. 89).  \n\n- Occurs in a complex social environment - and thus should not be limited to being examined or perceived as something that happens on an individual level. Instead, it is necessary to think of learning as a social activity involving people, the things they use, the words they speak, the cultural context they\u2019re in, and the actions they take (Bransford, et al., 2006; Rogoff, 1998), and that knowledge is built by members in the activity (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006).\n\n- Is situated in an authentic context - provides learners with the opportunity to engage with specific ideas and concepts on a need-to-know or want-to-know basis (Greeno, 2006; Kolodner, 2006).\n\n- Requires learners\u2019 motivation and cognitive engagement to be sustained when learning complex ideas, because considerable mental effort and persistence are necessary.\n\nThe conditions for inputs to learning are clear, but the process is incomplete without making sense of what outputs constitute learning has taken place. At the core, learning is a process that results in a change in knowledge or behavior as a result of experience. Understanding what it takes to get that knowledge in and out (or promote behavioral change of a specific kind) can help optimize learning.\n    \n<\/font>","430dea2c":"<font size=5>\n    \nTop 10 Provider\/Company Names","95841ee1":"# Missing Values","7d64e40c":"<font size=5>\n    \nPearson Correlation for engagement_df","b7339ca1":"# Bivariate Analysis","e6121b13":"<font size=5>\n    \nDistribution of Main Function Category","1a8781ab":"# Deeper investigation for Each DataFrame","6f80573b":"<font size=5>\n    \n7.

The `lp_id` can be used to link to product information in `product_info.csv`.\n\n| Name | Description |\n| :--- | :----------- |\n| time | date in \"YYYY-MM-DD\" |\n| lp_id | The unique identifier of the product |\n| pct_access | Percentage of students in the district have at least one page-load event of a given product and on a given day |\n| engagement_index | Total page-load events per one thousand students of a given product and on a given day |\n\n### District information data\n\nThe district file `districts_info.csv` includes information about the characteristics of school districts, including data from [NCES](https:\/\/nces.ed.gov\/) (2018-19), [FCC](https:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/) (Dec 2018), and [Edunomics Lab](https:\/\/edunomicslab.org\/). In this data set, we removed the identifiable information about the school districts. We also used an open source tool [ARX](https:\/\/arx.deidentifier.org\/) [(Prasser et al. 2020)](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1002\/spe.2812) to transform several data fields and reduce the risks of re-identification.

Khan Academy\n\n### History\n    \nThe organization started in 2006 when Salman \"Sal\" Khan tutored one of his cousins in mathematics on the Internet using a service called Yahoo! Doodle Images. After a while, Khan's other cousins began to use his tutoring service. Due to the demand, Khan decided to make his videos watchable on the Internet, so he published his content on YouTube. Later, he used a drawing application called SmoothDraw and now uses a Wacom tablet to draw using ArtRage. The video tutorials were recorded on his computer.\n\nPositive responses prompted Khan to quit his job in 2009, to focus full-time on creating educational tutorials (then released under the name Khan Academy). Khan Lab School, a school founded by Sal Khan and associated with Khan Academy, opened on September 15, 2014, in Mountain View, California. In June 2017, Khan Academy officially launched the Financial Literacy Video Series for college graduates, job seekers, and young professionals.\n    \n### Funding\n    \nKhan Academy is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, mostly funded by donations coming from philanthropic organizations. \n1. In 2010, Google donated 2 million dollar for creating new courses and translating content into other languages, as part of their Project 10100 program.\n    \n2. In 2013, Carlos Slim from the Luis Alcazar Foundation in Mexico made a donation for creating Spanish versions of videos.\n    \n3. In 2015, AT&T contributed 2.25 million dollar to Khan Academy for mobile versions of the content accessible through apps.\n    \n4.

Closures of schools, institutions and other learning spaces have impacted more than 94% of the world\u2019s student population. This has brought far-reaching changes in all aspects of our lives. Social distancing and restrictive movement policies have significantly disturbed traditional educational practices. Reopening of schools after relaxation of restriction is another challenge with many new standard operating procedures put in place.\n\nWithin a short span of the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers have shared their works on teaching and learning in different ways. Several schools, colleges and universities have discontinued face-to-face teachings. There is a fear of losing 2020 academic year or even more in the coming future. The need of the hour is to innovate and implement alternative educational system and assessment strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided us with an opportunity to pave the way for introducing digital learning. This kernel aims to provide a comprehensive report on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on online teaching and learning of various papers and indicate the way forward.\n    \n## Important Fact\n    \n\"Internet users ranged from over 95% to less than 70% of the adult population in 2019, and there are important demographic differences in Internet use. Although 58% of those aged 50-74 used the Internet daily in 2019 \u2013 up from only 30% in 2010 \u2013 this remains well below the average share of daily Internet users aged 16-24 (the so-called \u201cdigital natives\u201d), which was close to 95%.\"\n\n\"There are also persistent skills gaps across demographic groups and countries, with people of higher skill or income levels making better use of the Internet and online activities, and being better able to access knowledge, job opportunities, and health and education services.\"    \n    \n    \n    \n    "}}
