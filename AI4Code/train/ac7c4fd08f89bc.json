However the raw data, a sequence of symbols cannot be fed directly to the algorithms themselves as most of them expect **numerical feature vectors with a fixed size** rather than the **raw text documents with variable length**. <br>\n\n-  We will use `CountVectorizer` to convert text into a matrix of token counts. In this scheme, features and samples are defined as follows:\n\n> - Each individual token occurrence frequency (normalized or not) is treated as a `feature`.\n> - The vector of all the token frequencies for a given document is considered a `multivariate sample`.\n\n> - A `corpus of documents` can thus be represented by a matrix with **one row per document** and **one column per token** occurring in the corpus.\n> - We call `vectorization` the general process of turning a collection of text documents into numerical feature vectors. <br>\n> - This specific strategy (tokenization, counting and normalization) is called the `Bag of Words` or `Bag of n-grams` representation. <br>\n> - Documents are described by word occurrences while completely ignoring the relative position information of the words in the document.\n\n### What we should do with this dataset - Vectorization\n\n> - Currently, we have the messages as lists of tokens (also known as [lemmas](http:\/\/nlp.stanford.edu\/IR-book\/html\/htmledition\/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html)) and now we need to convert each of those messages into a vector the SciKit Learn's algorithm models can work with.\n> - Now we'll convert each message, represented as a list of tokens (lemmas) above, into a vector that machine learning models can understand.\n\n> **We'll do that in three steps using the bag-of-words model:**\n1. Count how many times does a word occur in each message (Known as term frequency)\n2. Weigh the counts, so that frequent tokens get lower weight (inverse document frequency)\n3. Normalize the vectors to unit length, to abstract from the original text length (L2 norm)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n1. `vect.fit(train)` **learns the vocabulary** of the training data\n\n2. `vect.transform(train)` uses the **fitted vocabulary** to build a document-term matrix from the training data\n\n3. `vect.transform(test)` uses the **fitted vocabulary** to build a document-term matrix from the testing data (and **ignores tokens** it hasn't seen before)","bf5173e4":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n<h1>Observation<\/h1><\/div> <\/h1><\/div><a class=\"anchor\"><\/a>\n\n> - The goal of the algorithm is to predict if a new sms is a HAM or SPAM and there are 2 possible situation:\n> -  `False Positive Prediction`: The messages which actually SPAM but model is predicting HAM \n<br><center> **OUTCOME: I probably do not read it!!** <\/center>  \n> -  `False Negative Prediction`: The messages which actually HAM but model is predicting SPAM\n<br><center> **OUTCOME: I delete it!!** <\/center>\n    \n> - The second option is preferable!!","4bca2e78":"___","3b905110":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<h1>4.
