The other ones will not be needed for now.","89bdec4a":"As you can see, this file contains game information from the regular season and playoffs. For this analysis, we will be only looking at games from the last decade, 2010-2019. \n\nCreate a new dataset conditionally selecting only games from the 2010s. Verify that you did this correctly by using the .head() function and making sure the first game listed is the New Orleans Saints vs. Minnesota Vikings on 09\/09\/2010.\n\n**Conditional Selection**\n\nConditional selection is an effect way to select only certain rows from a large dataset. It is particularly useful to create datasets with only the pieces of information you want. In this case, create a new dataset and set it equal to the 'games' dataset and then a conditional statement that is only true for games from 2010-2019\n\n**What .head() does:**\n\nThe .head() function works very similarly to the .tail function, but instead of printing out the bottom of the table, it will print the top of the table. Therefore, it's default is set to printing out the first five lines, but putting a number, x, in the parentheses will have it print out the first x rows.","28635bee":"Hello! I created this notebook to look at how playing indoors affects the total points scored in a NFL game while also giving a tutorial on basic Python functions. \n\nThere has been a theory that has been around the NFL for a long time that playing indoors leads to higher-scoring games. There have been a number of potential reasons that have been thrown around to support this, but ultimately, this theory has mostly just been considered a myth. In this notebook, we will explore the numbers and see if there is any real correlation or at least any pattern in indoor games.\n\nStart by running the first cell below:","12d6f038":"# Conclusion\nBoth analyses show that there is a small increase in total points scored in indoor games rather than outdoor games; aggregate data from the last decade and a deeper look at the 2019 New Orleans Saints both indicate that playing indoors could lead to higher scoring games. However, it is much too early to draw any significant conclusions. A much more in-depth analysis with more advanced statistics would help to reveal whether there is a true correlation. ","50e58ef0":"Now that we have the total points for each game, you can check whether dome games lead to higher points per game. You could group by the weather_detail column again, but it would be much easier if there was a column that just told us whether it was an indoor or outdoor game. Well luckily with what you've learned so far, you can create another column that will do just that!\n\nCreate a function called 'indoor_outdoor_test' that will return 'Indoors' or 'Outdoors' based on what the value in the weather_detail column is.","d607ffeb":"Now that each game has been categorized to dome or outdoors, calculate the average points scored per game for each You can use .mean() to obtain the mean of the indoor games and outdoor games. You can visualize this data by using .plot and then selecting whichever type of chart you choose. In this case, a bar chart would be the simplest way to observe differences.\n\n**What .mean() does:**\n\n.mean() simply calculates the mean of a specific set of data.\n\n**What .plot does:**\n\n.plot is a function that will create a chart with whatever data you select. You need to put something like .bar() or .line() to indicate what kind of chart you want to produce.","174663ff":"Now, print out the away games in ascending order of total points scored.","81bc4c0e":"Because there don't seem to be any huge outliers, we can just use the mean to determine analyze the points per game data for the Saints last season.","4b077f0b":"# 2010-2019 Game Analysis \nUse the method .shape[] to see how many NFL games were played in the last decade.\n\n**What .shape[] does:**\n\n.shape[] is a method that will return the number of rows and columns in the dataset. Without any inputs, it will print out the number of rows followed by number of columns. If you input 0, it will just print out the number of rows and if you input 1, it will print out the number of columns.","6c7783d6":"First, print out the last twenty lines of the file in order to become familiar with the different columns and information in the table. Use the .tail() function to print out the final twenty rows of the file. \n\n**What .tail() does:**\n\n.tail is a function that will print out the bottom of the table; it will default to the last 5 lines, but putting a number, x, in the parentheses will have it print out the final x rows.","b7832bac":"Even though this shows that there is a slight increase between the total points scored in dome games rather than outdoor games, we should look at more data to see if there are other distinct differences between indoor and outdoor games.\n\n# 2019 New Orleans Saints Analysis\n\nOne way to do this would be to analyze how a team whose home stadium is a dome and see if they score more points at home rather than away. For this study's sake, let's analyze the 2019 games of the New Orleans Saints who play their home games in the famous Superdome. \n\nCreate two new datasets, one having all of the Saints' home games from 2019 and the other all of their away games of 2019. Then, print out the home games in descending order of total points scored using the sort_values method.\n\nHint: You will need to create an intermeidary dataset in case the Saints made it to the Super Bowl and played in a neutral site game (they didn't)!\n\n**What .sort_values does:**\n\nYou can use .sort_values to organize the rows in ascending or descending order based on a specific column.","91b2d427":"Next, let's see the average points per game in dome games. First, we will have to add a new column that has the combined total points per game. Do this by adding the home score and away score and adding the result to a new column for each row called 'total points'.","f9dfd97d":"Before drawing any conclusions from just looking at the mean, take a look at the medians of each category as well. You can use .median() the same way you used .mean(). Also, instead of doing .bar(), try doing .barh() to see how the chart is different!\n\n**What .median() does:**\n\n.median() calculates the median of a specific set of data.","662ab815":"Of these 2670 games, let's see how many were played in a dome versus being played in a typical outdoor field. Use the .groupby() function to separate the data based on the weather_detail column because it contains information about whether a game was played in a dome.\n\nOnce you have done the .groupby() function, use .size() to print out the count of games in domes.\n\n**What .groupby() does:**\n\n.groupby() is a very useful function to organize the data in groups that you want to analyze. For this exercise, input the name of the column that holds the data that you want to group the rows by.\n\n**What .size() does:**\n\n.size() is a convenient way to count the frequency of a specific piece of data when combined with .groupby(). In this example, .size() will print out each unique value that is in the weather_detail column and the number of occurrences."}}
