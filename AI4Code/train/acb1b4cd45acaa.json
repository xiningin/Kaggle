Satoshy Nakamoto created Bitcoin by starting a method that is digital mining, which works to prevent the system from being corrupt, and the only way to be corrupt is for a company or group of people to have 51% of the Total Hash-Rate that miners spend in finding a hash to obtaining their precious reward, generating income for large corporations, such as those who venture to buy a quantity of equipment and to mine at their homes, in a certain space, but not all can mine, too brings its disadvantages, the computing power of these machines requires electrical power, which in many countries digital mining could be somewhat crazy, as for example in Antigua and Barbuda, which is the country with the highest bill cost in electricity or Venezuela where only pennies are required to pay for a month of electricity. \n- - - \n## Is mining profitable? \n\nThere are many factors, for example the currency you are mining, the mining power of your machine or farm, and also the way you manage your finances. Everything influences. Let's also consider that the profit margin for some is more profitable than others in terms of electricity service expense. Which leads us to ask ourselves some questions that we will answer after doing certain analyzes. \n\n- Which is the history of profit that miners have obtained over time?\n- What is the real value of a TH\/s and what will happen in the course of time, is there any correlation or dependency between the Market-Price or Block-Rewards?\n- Which are the best countries to mine Bitcoins?\n- Profitability between the Profit of Various Models VS Monthly Electric Cost\n- Investment Reward Machine Price VS Profit\n- Conclusion\n- What will happen after the next Halving?

That's mean will continue to decrease slowly until it's totally dependent on the Market-Price and Fee-Reward of each block. But it's doesn't mean that never goona increase. The price of Bitcoin has a strong upward trend, which will significantly drag the value of TH\/s as Markets want it, my criterion \"The value of TH\/s is currently devalued\",only we can do is wait and see what is going on.\n- - -\n### Gap between Electric bill vs Profitability of mining\n\n- Only a few countries can be profitable mining, although these values \u200b\u200bwere scrapped on the Internet. These prices are with respect to electricity consumption in general and not from customized contracts or gas distribution contracts to power large electric generators at a competitive bill cost.\n\nAn indicator of this is the continued increase in Hash-Rate in the blockchain ecosystem.
