Extensive details about the metric, scaling, and weighting can be found in the [M5 Participants Guide.](https:\/\/mofc.unic.ac.cy\/m5-competition\/)\n\n1. Forecasting horizon\n\nThe number of forecasts required, both for point and probabilistic forecasts, is h=28 days(4 weeks ahead).\nThe performance measures are first computed for each series separately by averaging their values across\nthe forecasting horizon and then averaged again across the series in a weighted fashion (see below) to\nobtain the final scores. \n\n2. Point forecasts\n\nThe accuracy of the point forecasts will be evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (RMSSE),\nwhich is a variant of the well-known Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) proposed by Hyndman and\nKoehler (2006)\n. The measure is calculated for each series as follows:\n\n![image.png](https:\/\/github.com\/choco9966\/Kaggle\/blob\/master\/M5%20Forecasting\/image\/rmsse.PNG?raw=true)\n\nwhere \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61 is the actual future value of the examined time series at point t, \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61_hat the generated forecast, n the length of the training sample (number of historical observations), and h the forecasting horizon. \n\nAfter estimating the RMSSE for all the 42,840 time series of the competition, the participating methods will be ranked using the Weighted RMSSE (WRMSSE), as described latter in this Guide, using the following\n\n![image.png](https:\/\/github.com\/choco9966\/Kaggle\/blob\/master\/M5%20Forecasting\/image\/wrmsse.PNG?raw=true)\n\nwhere \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 is the weight of the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e series of the competition. A lower WRMSSE score is better\n\nNote that the weight of each series will be computed based on the last 28 observations of the training sample of the dataset, i.e., the cumulative actual dollar sales that each series displayed in that particular period (sum of units sold multiplied by their respective price). An indicative example for computing the WRMSSE will be available on the [GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/Mcompetitions) of the competition","1d7d8c8b":"### File 2: \"sell_prices.csv\"\nContains information about the price of the products sold per store and date.\n- store_id: The id of the store where the product is sold.\n- item_id: The id of the product.\n- wm_yr_wk: The id of the week.\n- sell_price: The price of the product for the given week\/store.
