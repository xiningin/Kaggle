Like in computer vision, we'll use a model pretrained on a bigger dataset (a cleaned subset of wikipeia called [wikitext-103](https:\/\/einstein.ai\/research\/blog\/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset)). That model has been trained to guess what the next word, its input being all the previous words. It has a recurrent structure and a hidden state that is updated each time it sees a new word. This hidden state thus contains information about the sentence up to that point.\n\nWe are going to use that 'knowledge' of the English language to build our classifier, but first, like for computer vision, we need to fine-tune the pretrained model to our particular dataset. Because the English of the reviews left by people on IMDB isn't the same as the English of wikipedia, we'll need to adjust a little bit the parameters of our model.

A text is composed of words, and we can't apply mathematical functions to them directly. We first have to convert them to numbers. This is done in two differents steps: tokenization and numericalization. A `TextDataBunch` does all of that behind the scenes for you.","a35588c6":"We can then create a model to classify those reviews and load the encoder we saved before.","a4a919a1":"You will need to have the fastai library installed for this lesson, and you will want to use a GPU to train your neural net.  If you don't have a GPU you can use in your computer (currently, only Nvidia GPUs are fully supported by the main deep learning libraries), no worries!  There are a number of cloud options you can consider:\n\n[GPU Cloud Options](https:\/\/course.fast.ai\/#using-a-gpu)\n\n**Reminder: If you are using a cloud GPU, always be sure to shut it down when you are done!!! Otherwise, you could end up with an expensive bill!**","ba4268b1":"All words that appear in the IMDB vocab, but not the wikitext-103 vocab, will be initialized to the same random vector in a model.  As the model trains, we will learn these weights.","63404621":"Note that language models can use a lot of GPU, so you may need to decrease batchsize here.","a0736ad3":"To complete the fine-tuning, we can then unfreeze and launch a new training.","35c7c099":"### Tokenization","6d11cc20":"## Classifier","05e546b2":"Since this is relatively slow to train, we will save our weights:","fb5bedea":"The state of the art for this dataset in 2017 was 94.1%.","6b4ea704":"### Training the model","a8ab93ea":"First let's download the dataset we are going to study. The [dataset](http:\/\/ai.stanford.edu\/~amaas\/data\/sentiment\/) has been curated by Andrew Maas et al. and contains a total of 100,000 reviews on IMDB. 25,000 of them are labelled as positive and negative for training, another 25,000 are labelled for testing (in both cases they are highly polarized). The remaning 50,000 is an additional unlabelled data (but we will find a use for it nonetheless).\n\nWe'll begin with a sample we've prepared for you, so that things run quickly before going over the full dataset.","2cc100fb":"Now let's grab the full dataset for what follows.","2d3a1ed4":"We will talk about ethical concerns raised by very accurate language models in lesson 7, but here are a few brief notes:\n\nIn reference to [OpenAI's GPT-2](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/2\/14\/18224704\/ai-machine-learning-language-models-read-write-openai-gpt2): Jeremy Howard said, *I\u2019ve been trying to warn people about this for a while. We have the technology to totally fill Twitter, email, and the web up with reasonable-sounding, context-appropriate prose, which would drown out all other speech and be impossible to filter.*\n\nFor a small example, consider when completely incorrect (but reasonable sounding) ML generated answers were [posted to StackOverflow](https:\/\/meta.stackoverflow.com\/questions\/384596\/completely-incorrect-machine-learning-generated-answers?stw=2):\n\n<img src=\"images\/robot-overflow.png\" alt=\"Roboflow\" style=\"width: 80%\"\/>","a97e4f09":"### Alternative apporach: with the data block API","d7aa2ae9":"We can use the data block API with NLP and have a lot more flexibility than what the default factory methods offer. In the previous example for instance, the data was randomly split between train and validation instead of reading the third column of the csv.\n\nWith the data block API though, we have to manually call the tokenize and numericalize steps. This allows more flexibility, and if you're not using the defaults from fastai, the various arguments to pass will appear in the step they're revelant, so it'll be more readable."}}
