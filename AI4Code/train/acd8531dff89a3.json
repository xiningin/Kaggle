It started as an app store for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 as the primary means of distributing Universal Windows Platform apps. With Windows 10, Microsoft merged its other distribution platforms (Windows Marketplace, Windows Phone Store, Xbox Music, Xbox Video, Xbox Store, and a web storefront also known as \"Microsoft Store\") into Microsoft Store, making it a unified distribution point for apps, console games, and digital videos. Digital music was included until the end of 2017, and E-books were included until 2019.[1] Some content is available free of charge from the store.\n\nFrom **Wikipedia**","1beaf280":"## Analysis and Visualization with Plotly","02df65a8":"<a id=\"3\"><\/a>\n### Distribution of Ratings","1d794063":"<a id=\"4\"><\/a>\n### Distribution of Price","bed98142":"#### To do lower case all dataframe's Name","49fd5813":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a>\n### Distribution of Category","d1b94107":"Description of Columns:\n\n* **Name:** Defines Application Name<br>\n* **Rating:** Defines Application Rating<br>\n* **No of people Rated:** Defines the value which how many people rated this application <br>\n* **Category:** Defines Application Category<br>\n* **Date:** Defines when the application uploaded to store<br>\n* **Price:** Defines Application Fee<br>","9b2f1b81":"Based on microsoft store dataset in kaggle, there is a visible difference on Ratings between Free and Paid apps.","5dba8a8d":"The last status of the dataset","1f370250":"#### Null Values","002c754a":"<a id=\"2\"><\/a>\n#### First-Looking to Data"}}
