Remember, there can be differences in how you normalize variance (biased or unbiased estimate, see [link](https:\/\/math.stackexchange.com\/questions\/496627\/the-difference-between-unbiased-biased-estimator-variance)). Compute unbiased estimate (use the - right value for ddof argument in pd.var or np.var).\n- If there were no sales at a given day, do not impute missing value with zero, just ignore that day\n\nAnswer: `117167.70229885059`"}}
