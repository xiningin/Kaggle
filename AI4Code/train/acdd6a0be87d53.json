Gradient Descent does so by calculating the gradient of the weights parameters with respect to the loss function, and using it to find a global minimum of the loss function.\n\n**Batch Gradient Descent** uses the entire training data to make one gradient computation; which results in slow convergence since the gradient descent only makes a single step with every epoch.  \n**Stochastic Gradient Descent** makes a gradient calculation with a single training sample, which will result in loss of speedup from the vectorization.  \n**Mini-Batch Gradient Descent** uses a mini-batches of training example for each gradient calculation; which makes convergence faster, and at the same time, utilise the speed up from vectorization.","f32882de":"<a id=\"sec2.1\"><\/a>\n## [2.1 CNN from scratch](#sec2.1)","fb2f7c7f":"#### Data Augmentation\nWe can visualize the effect of a random image after data augmentation","123fdef2":"### (Add-ons) Pytorch Implementation for Resnet Finetuning","ac0a6766":"#### Learning Points\n1. Setting a learning rate small enough is very important in the case of Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning, as i realized that setting learning rate to be 1e-4 will result in very low accuracy ~50%. This could be due to the complex loss function, thus, causing divergence during gradient updates if learning rate is not small enough.\n2. Images passed into ResNet needs to be preprocessed via the specific preprocessing function provided *from keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input* when generating mini-batches, as it will affect the performance of ResNet if standard preprocessing is done instead.\n3. Due to memory constraint from Kaggle Kernel (~13GB), there is possibility of the kernel crashing. What i did to mitigate this is to use the *del* function, to remove some of the variables; feature output object from VGG16.
