The amount of smokers decreasing consistently between mid-40s to late 50s when there is a fluctuation on the amount of participants around this age group. This decrease may be due to the increase on female participants and the decrease on male participants as the data contains more male smokers than female smokers.","6ea999f7":"Female tend to be charged lower than male from the same age. On the BMI-Charge plot below, healthy and underweighted female are receiving a higher insurance charge than male. The insurance charge for overweighted and obese female participants are lower compared to overweighted and obese male. This was not an expected trend based on the earlier plots.","2bf5a280":"After grouping the data by smokers and non-smokers, there some interesting results. On the diagonal plots, it indicates that most smokers are aged between 20 to 50. There are lesser smokers above 50s. This might be coming from the increase of older female participants than male participants or some other reasons. On the BMI graph, it shows that most participants are overweight, with a BMI above the maximum healthy BMI value, which is 24.9. The charges graph tells us that smoker are definitely receiving a higher charge than non smokers.\n\nOn the Age-Charge plot, smokers have a higher insurance charge in general. As the smoker's age increases, the insurance charge increases too. This is true for non-smokers too. On the BMI-Charge plot, non smokers's insurance charge does not seems to be higher when the participants are overweight or obese. For smoker participants with the same BMI as non-smokers, they are receiving a higher charge. Especially for smokers who are obese, with BMI above 30, their charges seems to be significantly higher than others. This might be the reason why there seems to be four linear equations available on Age-Charges plot. It might be a split between Smoking and BMI (underweight + healthy vs overweight + obese). \n\nNext, the graphs below will state how Age-Charge plot and BMI-Charge plot is affected when the data is group by Gender or Region.","6d7398a7":"R-Squared indicates how much variation of the dependent variable (charges) is explained by the independent variables (smoker, age and bmi) in a regression model. This value will indicate how well the data fit the regression model.\n\nAs both test and train data's R-Squared is very close, it indicates that the model predicts new observations nearly as well as it fits the dataset. In general, the higher the R-Squared, the better the model fits the data.\n\nThe first model (linear regression) and second model (lasso regression) has the highest R-Squared value for both train data and test data.  75.68% on lm and lm_lasso test data indicates that the models explains all the variability of the response data (charges) around its mean for 75.68%. The R-squared for the first three models are approximately 75%, which is good but not great.\n\nNotice that R-squared does not rely the causation relationship between the independent variables (X) and dependent variable (y). Moreover, it does not tells us the correctness of the regression model. Thus, mean squared error (MSE) is used together to draw conclusions about which is the best fitted model. Since the forth model (elastic net) has the lowest score, it is the least suitable model. This model will not be used to calculate MSE.","3bd31d90":"## Data Extraction","5762e360":"## Predictive analytics\n\nFrom the analysis above, Smoker, Age and BMI are the driving factors on insurance charge.

In addition, BMI has a positive correlation with charges.

","500451a5":"Based on the first pairplot (BMI-Charge plot), southeast participant has a higher BMI, thus the insurance charges are expected to be higher for participants from southeast.

The distribution of charges for most non-smokers are close to 0, whereas smokers are charged around 20,000 and 45,000. It is interesting to see that there is a smaller amount of smokers charged around 30,000., creating a plot shape for smokers which is totally different from non-smokers.","cfa2f80e":"The pie chart indicates that approximately 24% of participants are from southwest, northwest and northeast.

It shows the correlation for age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoker, region and insurance charges. Number of children (dependents) and gender have correlation at minimal, which is 0.068 and 0.057. As the number of children is the least influencing factor with all the other variables, a correlation range between 0.0077 to 0.068, this variable shall be excluded in most of the data analysis below. \n\nSmoker is highly correlated to the insurance charge, with a correlation coefficient of 0.79. Age and BMI are moderately correlated with insurance charge, a correlation coefficient of 0.3 and 0.2. This indicates that the insurance charge will be higher if the person is older or is a smoker or the person has a higher BMI value.\n\nAs there are four different categories for region, it is not very clear what are the impacts based on this value. It looks like the participants from the south are getting a higher insurance charge. A deep dive on various plots below may provide more insights.","e8f7b6a8":"The above pair plot is a quick view of the relation between age, gender, smoker, bmi, region and insurance charges.

There are slightly more male participants than female. More than a third of the participants are non-smokers. BMI of all participants seems to be normal distributed, with a mean of approxtimately 30.

It might seems weird to include hobbies, but if the participant spends their time on high risk hobbies like skydiving and car racing, it could lead to higher charges.","717f9742":"Above is the intercept and coefficient of all four models.

A young adult between 18 to mid 20s who are underweight or healthy (BMI below 24.9), could receive a negative insurance charge. This is not possible in the real world. Therefore, when after getting the expected charge from either smoker or non-smoker formula above, pick the maximum between the expected charge and 0. This will eliminate the negative expected charge."}}
