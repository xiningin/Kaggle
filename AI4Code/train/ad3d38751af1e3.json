Assumptions of Logistic Regression** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"><\/a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nThe Logistic Regression model requires several key assumptions. These are as follows:-\n\n1. Logistic Regression model requires the dependent variable to be binary, multinomial or ordinal in nature.\n\n2. It requires the observations to be independent of each other. So, the observations should not come from repeated measurements.\n\n3. Logistic Regression algorithm requires little or no multicollinearity among the independent variables. It means that the independent variables should not be too highly correlated with each other.\n\n4. Logistic Regression model assumes linearity of independent variables and log odds.\n\n5. The success of Logistic Regression model depends on the sample sizes. Typically, it requires a large sample size to achieve the high accuracy.","a3083ec5":"We can see that two additional variables `RainToday_0` and `RainToday_1` are created from `RainToday` variable.\n\nNow, I will create the `X_train` training set.","f0783a0c":"## ROC-AUC\n\n\n**ROC AUC** stands for **Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve**. It is a technique to compare classifier performance. In this technique, we measure the `area under the curve (AUC)`. A perfect classifier will have a ROC AUC equal to 1, whereas a purely random classifier will have a ROC AUC equal to 0.5. \n\n\nSo, **ROC AUC** is the percentage of the ROC plot that is underneath the curve.","d6cb7bbc":"## **Implement linear equation**\n\n\nLogistic Regression algorithm works by implementing a linear equation with independent or explanatory variables to predict a response value. For example, we consider the example of number of hours studied and probability of passing the exam. Here, number of hours studied is the explanatory variable and it is denoted by x1. Probability of passing the exam is the response or target variable and it is denoted by z.\n\n\nIf we have one explanatory variable (x1) and one response variable (z), then the linear equation would be given mathematically with the following equation-\n\n    z = \u03b20 + \u03b21x1    \n\nHere, the coefficients \u03b20 and \u03b21 are the parameters of the model.\n\n\nIf there are multiple explanatory variables, then the above equation can be extended to\n\n    z = \u03b20 + \u03b21x1+ \u03b22x2+\u2026\u2026..+ \u03b2nxn\n    \nHere, the coefficients \u03b20, \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b2n are the parameters of the model.\n\nSo, the predicted response value is given by the above equations and is denoted by z.","59317565":"# **1.

Multinomial Logistic Regression\n\nIn Multinomial Logistic Regression, the target variable has three or more categories which are not in any particular order. So, there are three or more nominal categories. The examples include the type of categories of fruits - apple, mango, orange and banana.\n\n\n### 3. Ordinal Logistic Regression\n\nIn Ordinal Logistic Regression, the target variable has three or more ordinal categories. So, there is intrinsic order involved with the categories.
