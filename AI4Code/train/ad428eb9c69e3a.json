I find this very useful, and you can get really creative with it too.\n\nTwint also makes special queries to **Twitter allowing you to also scrape a Twitter user's followers, Tweets a user has liked, and who they follow without any authentication, API, Selenium, or browser emulation.**\n\nYou can read about this awesome library [here.](https:\/\/github.com\/twintproject\/twint****)","34707303":"Let me take you through the step-by-step process of scraping the tweets.\n\n1. `twint.Config()` :- Configuring the Twint library.\n2. `config.Search` :- Mention the keyword which you wanna search the tweets by. I mentioned **Dogecoin** here. So, now the tweets containing this keyword will be scraped.\n3. `config.Limit` :- This method is used to tell the library how many tweets you wanna scrape from twitter. I mentioned 10 tweets.\n4. `config.Lang` :- Language of the tweet which needs to be scraped.\n5. `config.Store_csv` :- Defined boolean opearator if you wanna store the scraped data in a csv or not.\n6. `config.Since` and `config.Until`:- Define a specific date and time from which you wanna scrape the tweets.\n7. `config.Output` :- This method is used to store the scraped data in a csv.\n8. `twint.run.Search(config)` :- This step is used to search and scrape the tweets.","f4fb33fb":"# We're gonna scrape the tweets in which Dogecoin is mentioned.
