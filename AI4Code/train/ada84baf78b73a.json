What fraction of the patients who actually have heart disease were detected by the model?\n\n* *f1-score* is a combination of these. It presents a single metric for model evaluation by taking the harmonic mean of the two measures: $ f_{1} =  \\frac{2}{ \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{r} } $, where *p* is the precision and *r* is the recall. The Harmonic mean is frequently used for averaging rates, since it overweights lower values, and hence will only be high when all the values are high.\n\n* *Support* is simply the frequency of each class in the data. \n\nIn the first row, where the logistic model is predicting the not-heart disease group, the precision is 0.88 and recall is 0.69. \n* 88% of the people that the model predicted *did not have* heart disease, actually did not have heart disease; recall 0 means no heart disease.\n\n* 69% of the cases that actually *did not have* heart disease were correctly detected by the model.\n\nThe second row is the same for the positive class, or those who did have heart disease.\n\n","42251ba1":"# Introduction & Exploratory Analysis\n### About this dataset\n\nA detailed description of the data is given [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/carlosdg\/a-detail-description-of-the-heart-disease-dataset\/), and I encourage anyone to check out that post as it's going to have more details than I give below.\n\nFeatures:\n\n*     Age : Age of the patient\n*     Sex : Sex of the patient\n*     cp : Chest Pain type (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)\n*     trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).

In the original Cleveland dataset they are NaNs (so they should be removed)\n>    data #49 and 282 have thal = 0, also incorrect. They are also NaNs in the original dataset.\n\n"}}
