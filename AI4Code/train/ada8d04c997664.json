Nordrhein Westfalen has the most number of cases recently and with a big distance from the second state (Bayern).**\n\n**But comparing plain numbers like this might be misleading, since every state has different population, and it is expected that big states will have higher number of cases than smaller states. So, let's consider the ratio of cases to the population of each state to get a more fair comparison.**","01a2dbe7":"Seems like the virus does not descriminate between men and women in infection.

First, we see that some small states that were in the tail of the previous plot (number of cases) are now at the top of the current plot (meaning that they have a big ratio of infections as compared to their population). For example, we see Saarland at the third position in the current plot in the peak time around April 2020. Similarly, we see Hamburg has high ratio of infections while its population is amongst the lowest compared to other states. However, it would be unfair to judge the people in these states of being careless as these are densly populated states, and it is expected to have higher rates of infections in more densly populated areas. Unfortunately, the population density information is not available in the current datasets.**\n\n**We observe that a state such as Baden Wurttemberg has better statistics now as compared to the peak of the crisis in April. The state has moved from the second highest infection ratio in April to the 8th position. Similarly, Saarland has lower ratio now as compared to April.**","144a7e8c":"# States Comparison\n\nLet's see which states had the most cases so far..","9e29abcc":"**We can see that the peak of infections was around April 2020.
