The episode ratings generally trend up within each season, and seasons 1 and 4 each had particularly good final episodes. That coincides with a very big reveal at the end of season 1, and a very satisfying series finale that wraps up a lot of storylines from the series.","a8ab47de":"Series creator [Michael Schur](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michael_Schur) has the best average rating among writers. It's worth noting that no individual or pair wrote more than 4 episodes of the show.","389c7ebd":"### Load and Merge the episode data and IMDb ratings files\nA short example notebook to show how to load and merge the data from the two files in The Good Place dataset. The common columns are Title and Air Date.","336a0eee":"Michael Schur is at the top of this list as well. This is not surprising, since he mostly directed the same episodes that he wrote. One of the stars of the show, [Kristen Bell](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kristen_Bell) is near the top of the list for one episode she also directed.","b90f8df0":"### Who are the fan-favorite The Good Place directors?"}}
