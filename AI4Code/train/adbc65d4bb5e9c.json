The staggering of cases occurs near the end of May and into the beginning of June 2020. What is happening is that the cases are going up in a somewhat linear rate, then there is a steep drop down in the number of confirmed cases, that drop then goes up in a somewhat linear rate and this repeats several times. This could have happened due to the virus's seasonality, being more effective at spreading in certain seasons or climates. Scientists believe that colder weather and climates allow for a faster and more effective spreading of the virus. The US and India are two countries with high amounts of covid cases, so a fluctuation in their number of cases would make the biggest difference to the graph. From May to June (the time of the staggers in the graph), US is in the Spring season and India is in the Pre-Monsoon and Monsoon season. Both would have a fluctuation in temperature affecting the rate of covid cases, due to the seasons transitioning from a hot climate to a colder, rainy season, or from a cold, rainy season to a warmer season. These seasons have the biggest difference in daily temperature, where it could be 20 degrees Celsius one day, and 35 degrees the next day, affecting the rate of spread of the virus.\n\n","cfcd9ef9":"**What does the graph show?**\n\nThis graph shows the number of countries with observed covid cases daily beginning from February 2020 and ending February 20201. The total amount of countries in this dataset are 220. Near the beginning of the graph the values are low, starting at around 12 and maintaining a value of 25 for a bit, that means that for a few days, there were only 25 countries with confirmed covid cases. As you can see, there is a massive spike in the number of countries with covid cases from the end of February to the middle of March, this is due to the spread of the virus across countries. From there, the number of countries with confirmed covid cases on that day barely increases for the remainder of the graph, this is due to most countries already having the virus with it only being able to spread to more remote, smaller countries.\n\n**Based on the current trends and patterns of the graph, what do you think the future will be like?**\n\nJudging the current trend of the graph (slow increase in the number of countries with covid cases across a large period of time), it appears that it will continue in the way that it currently going. Due to the current situation of the virus, with millions of cases worldwide, it is inevitable that covid will spread to more countries. This could happen for multiple reasons like illegal traveling across countries, failure to follow covid procedures, etc. I believe that it will continue to spread across more countries until the vaccine becomes available and used by the majority of the population. Once this happens, the number of countries with daily cases will decrease until the virus is no longer an issue.\n"}}
