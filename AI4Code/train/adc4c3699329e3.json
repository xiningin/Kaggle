Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (aka. the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization:\n\n*TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) \/ (Total number of terms in the document).*\n\n**IDF: Inverse Document Frequency**, which measures how important a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However it is known that certain terms, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following:\n\n*IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents \/ Number of documents with term t in it).*\n\nSee below for a simple example.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider a document containing 100 words wherein the word cat appears 3 times. The term frequency (i.e., tf) for cat is then (3 \/ 100) = 0.03. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word cat appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., idf) is calculated as log(10,000,000 \/ 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-idf weight is the product of these quantities: 0.03 * 4 = 0.12.","4c5320b4":"### What does tf-idf mean?\nTf-idf stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query.","15d5c781":"SVC","48dcc8d8":"![photo](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/2246\/1*o_KfyMzF7LITK2DlYm_wHw.png)","7b5f3de3":"> Confidence Interval -  [95.94 96.74] ","b6f8b8b7":"> Confidence Interval - [93.41  94.21]","86a13784":"RANDOM FOREST","4f237064":"LOGISTIC REGRESSION","bc3db312":"### SMOTE\nSMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) is one of the most commonly used oversampling methods to solve the imbalance problem. It aims to balance class distribution by randomly increasing minority class examples by replicating them. SMOTE synthesises new minority instances between existing minority instances. It generates the virtual training records by linear interpolation for the minority class. These synthetic training records are generated by randomly selecting one or more of the k-nearest neighbors for each example in the minority class. After the oversampling process, the data is reconstructed and several classification models can be applied for the processed data.","c510fb6f":"![photo](https:\/\/img.freepik.com\/free-photo\/night-view-neon-sign-with-text-words-have-power_78790-1119.jpg?size=626&ext=jpg)","f4949dc7":"MULTINOMIAL NB"}}
