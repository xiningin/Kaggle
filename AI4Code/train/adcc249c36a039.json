Now let's see if the board studied makes a difference.","7c44ec57":"Clear Indicator. As you can see, people who get placed have a higher average score in secondary school. This means that academic rigour is extremely important, more so that the board. So start studying from 10th grade to get a good job!!! Now we can try to understand why other boards have a higher chance of acceptance. Maybe because they have a higher score?\n\n","0af77d8f":"Again, people who go to a non-central board for 12th grade have a slightly higher advantage, but not that much. Let's look at scores again.","cdb97c59":"Again, colleges prefer Commerce and Science more as compared to other degrees for jobs. This is similar to what we saw in 12th grade specializations. Let's look at scores.","9fc13273":"Again we see, that you need to get good scores in college. So keep working hard!!\n\nLet's also look at degree chosen and scores.","80561315":"So this might explain the college degree chosen. People who take science and commerce have better scores, so it looks like college scores are CRUCIAL to getting a good job. \n\nNow let's see if you should have any work experience.","52518fa2":"Ok, so first thing that we can see is that the scores in 12th grade are very similar to scores in 10th grade. So, they are very predictive. Apart from that, even 12th grade scores are extremely important. So, keep studying Hard.","01389ff1":"So, companies REALLY like students with work experience. Maybe it's because they will fit into the company more easily and start working diligently more quickly than those with no experience. So, go for at least one internship, cause it will count.\n\nNow, let's look at the employability test.","bb272e2f":"It turns out, that people who go a non-central board have a slightly higher chance. This might be because non-central boards are more difficult to complete, and hence, companies slightly prefer such students.\n\nNow let's see is secondary scores play a role.","3a3476c8":"So, getting a good score isn't too hard in MBA, so don't work extra hard to get a perfect score. An average one is good enough. ","6bfe0c45":"Even though very few women apply, the percentage of women and men accepted is almost the same, however men have a slightly higher chance of getting accepted. So this wraps up gender. \n\nLet us move onto the board of secondary education.","289bf84b":"Yes, they do. Only slightly, which resembles what we saw above.\n\nNow let's look at higher education.","e90325da":"So, we can see that science and arts students have similar scores, meaning that companies don't value an art specialization that much, and it is purely the fact that you are taking science that can get you in.\n\nNow let's look at undergraduate degree.","d5302e8d":"Please upvote if you found the EDA insightful. I am trying to become an expert :). \n\n\nGetting recruited from campuses is becoming increasingly competitive. As a student, you want to maximize your chances of getting placed. Using this dataset, let's explore some of the factors that can help increase your chances of getting placed.\n\nLet me just list all of the findings first, and if you are interested in the details, you can read the kernel.\n1. Study Hard in 10th, 12th and college. Make sure you get those scores.\n2. Choose the right specialization, both in 12th, undergrad and MBA. It makes a difference.\n3. Go for internships. Work Experience helps.\n4. Try to go for a non-central board, but if you can't make it, don't fret about it.\n","c11206ef":"So, in 12th grade, both non-central and central board have similar scores. So, people must become more serious during this time.\n\nNow let's look at specialization.","df39529a":"Let us print the first 5 rows, to get a feel for the kind of values and columns present.","f79868bd":"So, the employability test doesn't make too much of a difference, since it is easy for everyone to get a decently high score. So just make sure you get a score that is not too worrying. \n\nNow let's see what you should do for post-grad","d418fb38":"So, let's start by importing the data.","232eaf2c":"So, looking back, you should:\n1. Study Hard in 10th, 12th and college. Make sure you get those scores.\n2. Choose the right specialization, both in 12th, undergrad and MBA. It makes a difference.\n3. Go for internships. Work Experience helps.\n4. Try to go for a non-central board, but if you can't make it, don't fret about it.","08e052c5":"So, you should go for marketing and finance rather than marketing and HR. Maybe it is because companies don't need as many HR workers as Finance workers.\nNow, let's look at scores again.","6456246d":"First Let us explore gender. Let us see the application imbalance first.","a3f93600":"So, sadly, if you want a good job, you should pursue science ro commerce. Taking arts in like betting on an all or nothing. So, focus on science or commerce to increase your chances. Let's also look at whether specialization affects scores.","fa7b81ef":"So, we can see that about twice as many males apply as compared to females. This is very interesting a majority of students in college are women, yet very few apply. I expected a higher number for the females category.","6c916aed":"So, first let us convert status to a 1\/0 format, rather than a string. This will be easier to work with. "}}
