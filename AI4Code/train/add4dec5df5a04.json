So if we take the log of our prediction, we can just use the good old RMSE as our loss function. It's just easier this way.","2a0e2a62":"The single most important thing about fast.ai tabular_learner is the use of embedding layers for categorical data. This is the 'secret sause' that enable Deep Learning to be competitive on handling tabular data. With one embedding layer for each categorical variable, we introduced good interaction for the categorical variables and leverage Deep Learning's biggest strengh: Automatic Feature Finding. We also used Drop Out for both the dense layers and embedding layers for better regularization. The metrics of the learner is RMSE since we've already take the log of SalePrice. Let's look at the model. ","1448473a":"As can be seen from the above, we have embedding layers for categorical columns, then followed by a drop out layer.

Quite standard.","29e639fe":"# Model","543b4fe9":"# Building the Model\n","e79efbcc":"For **Feature Engineering**, we'll just do it on the 'saledate'.

","c3d16c3c":"# Sort the Training Set\nThis is to create a good validation set. It cannot be emphasised enough how important a good validation set is to making a successful model. Since we are predicting sales data in the future, we need to make a validation set that all data is collected in the 'future' of the training set. So we need to sort the training set first, then split the 'future' part as the validation set. ","83c68214":"Finally, it's time for some training. We will fire up a fast.ai 'tabular.learner' from the DataBunch we just created.","f9a7fb0e":"# Motivation\nTree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost has become very poplular to address tabular(structured) data problems and gained a lot of tractions in Kaggle competitions. It has its very deserving reasons. A lot of the notebooks for this competition is inspired by fast.ai ML course. This notebook will also try to use fast.ai, but another approach: **Deep Learning**. \nThis is a bit against industry consensous that Deep Learning is more for unstructured data like image, audio or NLP, and usually won't be very good at handling tabular data. Yet, the introduction of embedding for the categorical data changed this perspective and we'll try to use fast.ai's tabular model to tackle this competition and see how well a Deep Learning approach can do. ","d5409c96":"Namely, we'll fix the missing values, categorify all categorical columns, then normalize. Plain and simple. ","1e8a903e":"# Conlusion\nI think overall people still prefer XGBoost or Random Forest for tabular Kaggle competitions since it usually will yield the best scores. However, Deep Learning is also a viable approach, though lacking a bit on the explainability side. At least it could be used for ensamble purpose so it's worth exploring. ","a8fc81d5":"It's easy to do data pre-processing in fast.ai, we just specify the pre-processing methods we want to use in a list:","12e323e7":"Best result reaches 0.227 RMSLE, I think it beats the #1 in Kaggle leaderboard. ","91e6597b":"User fast.ai's *lr_find* function to find the proper learning rate, then do a 'fit one cycle' training. ","c2849a00":"Time to create our validation set. The most important step. Since this dataset is somewhat time series, we need to make sure validation set entries happens AFTER all entries in the training set, otherwise the model will be cheating and won't generalize well. ","1a216026":"Utilize fast.ai's Datablock API, it's very easy to put all the training\/validation dataset together for training. We pass the dataframe, categorical columns list, continous columns list, pre-processing methods list, then splid the training set into training and validation set. Specified the dependent varialble as 'SalePrice', put everything into a 'DataBunch' and get ready for training time."}}
