The participant\u2019s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.","87c8aa4a":"**Answer:**\n- The Test is two tailed t- test so find the critical value of t at 95% confidance level.\n- Sample Size(n) = 24\n- Degree of freedom(df) = n - 1 = 23","67f859f2":"**Outcome:** \n- The box plot clearly displays the difference between the median of two datasets.\n- As we can see in the box plot the distribution of time taken to name the color for congruent words are between 8 to 23 and the distribution of time taken to name the color for incongruent words are between 16 to 36. And we can see two outliers in the distribution of incongruent words.","2cbde636":"## Analysis\n\n**Question:1** What is our independent variable?

When there is a mismatch, additional time is necessary for the prefrontal cortex to process the information and decide on its meaning.The words themselves have a strong influence over your ability to say the color. The interference between the different information (what the words say and the color of the words) your brain receives causes a problem. There are two theories that may explain the Stroop effect:\n\n- Speed of Processing Theory: the interference occurs because words are read faster than colors are named.\n- Selective Attention Theory: the interference occurs because naming colors requires more attention than reading words\n\nSimilar effect to the this effect can be reserve stroop effect.In this test the participant\u2019s task is to say out loud the word that is printed not its color.","8aa03156":"**Questions:5** Now, perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level and your critical statistic value? Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. Did the results match up with your expectations?","7e331e9e":"**Question:3** Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability?","b45af271":"Both the distribution are looks like the normal distribution and we can see that the mean is different for both the distributions.","20ab8269":"**Question:2** What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.\n<br><br>\n**Answer:**\n- I choose the two tailed t-test for my given data set. The dependent t-test compares the mean of two paired groups to see if there are statistically significant differences between these means. The same subjects were tested for congruent and incongruent words. By using the same subject to test two different condition, we eliminate the individual differences that occur between subjects.\n\n\n\n###### Reason Of Selecting Two Tailed t-test  <br>\n- We don't have any imformation about the population, we have just 24 sample datasets. <br>\n- The ability to compare the means of the dataset for the pre and post test validates the benefit of this test selection<br>\n- We don't have direction of the test so we choose two tailed test. \n\n###### Assumptions: <br>\n- Normality: The distribution of the differences in the dependent variable between the two related groups should be approximately normally distributed. Normal distributions are symmetric around the center(mean) and follow a \u2018bell-     shaped\u2019 distribution.\n- The observations are independent of one another.\n- Dependent variable should be measured on a continuous scale. The dependent t-test requires the sample data to be numeric and continuous, as it is based on the normal distribution.\n- There should be no significant outliers in the differences between the two related groups. Outliers are simply single data points within your data that do not follow the usual pattern.\n\n\n###### Hypothesis <br>\n**Null Hypothesis:** A null hypothesis is a statistical hypothesis in which there is no significant difference exist between the set of variables. It is the original or default statement, with no effect, often represented by H0 (H-zero). In this experiment the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference exist between the time taken to say the congruent words and incongruent words, means the Mean (xbar) of the Reaction time for the congruent sample will be equal to the mean(xbar) of the reaction time for the incongruent sample.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis:** A alternative hypothesis is a statistical hypothesis in which there is no significant difference exist between the set of variables. Often denoted by H1 (H-one).In this experiment the alternative hypothesis is that there is significant difference exist between the time taken to say the congruent words and incongruent words, means the Mean (xbar) of the Reaction time for the congruent sample will not be equal to the mean(xbar) of the reaction time for the incongruent sample.\n<br>\n<br>\n$ H_0 $ ( Null Hypothesis ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:&nbsp; (Population Mean)<sub>incongruent<\/sub> &nbsp; = &nbsp; (Population Mean)<sub>congruent <\/sub>  &nbsp; &nbsp; OR  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ \\mu_i = \\mu_c $ <br>\n\n$ H_1 $ ( Alternative Hypothesis ) &nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp; (Population Mean)<sub>incongruent<\/sub> &nbsp; <span>&#8800;<\/span> &nbsp;(Population Mean)<sub>congruent <\/sub> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OR  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ \\mu_i$ <span>&#8800;<\/span> $\\mu_c $ \n\n- Where $ \\mu_i$ = Mean time taken to name the ink color for incongruent words.\n- $ \\mu_c$ = Mean time taken to name the ink color for congruent words.\n<br><br>\n- If we get a significant result, we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that there are statistically significant differences between the mean time taken to name ink color between two test conditions.\n<br>\n","d5b5df73":"- The calculated t-statistic is -8.0207 for the difference in colour recognition time means of the congruent and incongruent words data. And -8.0207 is much lower than the t-critical value. Since the t-statistic is in the critical region, so the null hypothesis is rejected. <br>\n\n- **Null hypothesis rejected** At \u03b1 = 0.05, the time to name colours is significantly different between congruent and incongruent tasks. People do not name colours at the same speed when the word\u2019s meaning and its colour match, as when they do not match. The result confirms my expectations.\n- According to the confidence intervals, we can say that the true difference between the congruent and incongruent group mean time is between -10.019028 and -5.910555."}}
