The others planets will have Gravity Function in between these min and max Gravity Functions.\n\nThe ordered gravity function from smallest to largest gives the path between these two points.\n\nThe Gravity Function between planet 1 and planet 2 is the mass of planet 1 times the mass of planet 2 divided by the squared distance of these two planets. Each planet would have a total gravity Funcion that is the sum of all gravity function among this planet and all other planets.\n\nSimulating Neural Network algorithms, Gravity Falls algorithm works as follow:\n    \n- Define batch size, k-lambda:\nBatch size the the percentage of points that we will change during backward propagation\nk-lambda is the proportion of the step of change during backward propagation\n\n- Initiate m that is the mass of all points, let m(0) be small and M(n) be big, 0 being the initial point of path and n the end point of path\n\n- Forward:\n    Calculate Gravity Function of all points\n    Define path as the ordered gravity function\n    Calculate the cost, that is the distance of the points in path\n\n- Backward:\n    Select batch points with the highest cost\n    Find the gravity function of the closest point (for all batch points)\n    Change the gravity of the points towards the closest point\u00b4s Gravity Funcion (step = k-lambda)\n    Calculate the expected mass of the point to achieve this result    \n\nI was not able to vectorize the algorithm so it definitely does not perform very well.","d0acbc34":"Ok. so that\u00b4s it !\n\nWith this algorithm I was not able to submit a single result in the competition, but it was fun trying to be creative and thinking about the TSP problem.\n\nMaybe somebody much smarter than me can improve this idea and make this logic works :-)\n"}}
