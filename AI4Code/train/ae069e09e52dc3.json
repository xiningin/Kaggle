The tables should resemble the tables at https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/covid-19-contributions as closely as possible.  Feel free to make improvements such as adding scroll bars, collapsible tables, and an expandable TOC (and any other ideas that you might have).\n\n## Expected Submission\n\nOur preferred format for a submission is a single Kaggle notebook that is attached to [this dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/antgoldbloom\/aipowered-literature-review-csvs).  Notebooks that contain embeddable HTML elements (and similar visualizations) are also encouraged.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nAccuracy (5 points)\n - Did the participant accomplish the task?\n\nDocumentation (5 points)\n - Is the code easy to read and reuse?\n - Is it easy to update the code and make small changes to the tables?\n\nPresentation (5 points)\n - Do the tables look good?\n - Is the document easy to navigate?","33b8de59":"This was a quick attempt to reproduce the table from the following screenshot: \n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CCGq8yX.png)\n\n","cdd16930":"# How to Display a Table (starter notebook)"}}
