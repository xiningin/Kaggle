Since the problem we're working on has a many-to-many architecture, the input and the output both include number of timesteps which is nothing but the sequence length. But notice that the tensor X doesn't have the third dimension, that is, number of features. That's because we're going to use word embeddings before feeding in the data to an RNN, and hence there is no need to explicitly mention the third dimension. That's because when you use the Embedding() layer in Keras, you the training data will automatically be converted to (#samples, #timesteps, #features) where #features will be the embedding dimention (and note that the Embedding layer is always the very first layer of an RNN). While using the embedding layer we only need to reshape the data to (#samples, #timesteps) which is what we have done.
