We should remember though that the targeted population is above 18 years old. But given the current population pyramid in Israel, with:\n* 27.89% 0-14 years;\n* 59.91% 15-64 years;\n* 12.21% 65 and older,\nthe statistic of population percentage vaccinated should be interpreted differently. Let's consider that target population is above 14 years old. We have then 72.12% of the population. Now, the 59.96% from entire population means actually 83% from entire targeted population. This, even with the more agresive COVID-19 Indian (type D) could still ensure herd immunization.","3b5199c0":"We will plot the time evolution of the vaccination.\n","5ddb826d":"Israel is the country with the highest percents of vaccination in the World.
