Some common cleaning steps are:\n\n- **Removing Noise:** So remove things that hold little meaning like URLs and html tags in the text. Punctuation is also usually removed at this stage though the Tensorflow tokenizer I use later does this by default so I leave out the logic at this step.\n\n- **Remove Stopwords:** Certain words like \"a\", \"the\" and \"are\" are very common and hold little meaning for a sentence. Removing them speeds up training and helps with accuracy.\n\n- **Stemming or Lemmatization:** Many words are derived from a root or stem word. For example words like \"working\" and \"worked\" stem from the word \"work\". Reverting all words to their stem can help in some tasks though for this task I found that it made very little difference.\n\nI've defined a few functions to perform this cleaning.","e8dda32e":"### Randomly initialised word embedding\n\nBefore I started using the imported GloVe word embeddings I trained the model using a randomly initialised embedding.

This enables me to take advantage of an embedding that has ungone more rogourous training. Additionally it will also include words that I may not have in my training dataset (but may appear in the test dataset) which helps with overfitting.\n\nThe first thing to do then is to load the embedding. I'll use GloVe for this task.","7b6b222a":"Now the data is in the tensorflow format a few handy methods can be added to improve the training.

Tensorflow provides an api to format data in its own format.

I wanted to have a go implementing a language model using this knowledge and Tensorflow v2.\n\nI picked the \"Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets\" ([link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/nlp-getting-started\/overview)) getting started competition for its straight forward task (label tweets as either reporting a disaster or not reporting disaster) and the size of the dataset (large enough to contain enough information for the model but not so much that there will be a lot of processing).\n\nFirst things first then, let's load the libraries.","e33f50fd":"The model outputs a probability per sentence.

To do this the model needs to produce predictions for the training dataset. This involves a slightly different pipeline.","b19b2fa8":"## Evaluate\n\nLet's take a look at the models output to get an idea how it did. The quickest and easiest evaluation method is to take a look at the metrics produced by the model. The final metrics can be extracted using the evaluate method. Since this competition uses an F1 score to rank submissions it may be worth having a look at it on the training dataset.","e445a75b":"## Encode sentences\n\nA model will not understand what to do with a string representing a sentence. Instead it needs to be converted into an array of numbers representing the sentence. This is where a tokenizer is needed. A simple tokenizer will assign a number index to every unique word so that the model can treat it like a categorical value. Fundamentally this is what Tensorflows tokenizer does at this stage of preprocessing. \n\nTo achieve this I'll define a couple of functions. The first defines the tokenizer by taking all the sentences from all three datasets and assigning an index number to every word present in the sentences. All three datasets are used here to ensure the tokenizer vocabulary includes all the words present in the tweets. I have done a small piece of analysis in the appendix section at the bottom of this notebook to show how many words are in one of the datasets but not the others.\n\nThe second function uses the tokenizer to encode all the sentences into an array of index numbers representing the sentence. The second function also pads the sentences with zeros so that they are all the same size as the longest sentence in the training dataset. Note that the tokenizer reserves the index zero for this purpose.","98601141":"## Train Model\n\nNow I am ready to define and train the model. Firstly I will define the model:\n\n- **Embedding layer:** To enable the model to gain an understanding of a words meaning it will need a word embedding. This embedding creates a number of generic features against each word that could represent anything from a words gender to whether it is has a positive or negative sentiment. This also enables the model to identify relationships between words. This page from Tensorflows documentation contains a good diagram of what one might look like: [link](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/text\/word_embeddings#word_embeddings_2).\n\n- **RNN layer:** An RNN layer is a bit complex to explain in it's entirety in this notebook. Check out the course link at the top of this notebook for a full run through of the theory. Tensorflow offers all three of the major RNN layers; simple RNN, GRU and LSTM. I tried all of these layers and found that the LSTM layer worked best here.\n\n- **Dense Layer:** This final layer takes the LSTM output and applies a class to the sentence i.e. a 1 if the sentence is reporting a real disaster or 0 if not.","3a20f361":"## Appendix\n\n### Word mismatch\n\nEarlier in the notebook I mentioned that the training, validation and test datasets are likely to contain words that the other datasets do not. If the model is only trained on the words in the training dataset there may be an overfitting problem when the model tries to read words it doesn't recognise in the validation and the test datasets.\n\nThe below function takes two datasets and counts how words are matching and not matching to see how severe the issue is.","ec8ff547":"A similar pipeline is defined for the validation dataset. The difference is the lack of shuffling to speed up the validation.","daa3c4dc":"Finally begin training the model.","78a6b637":"And then do the same with the false negatives (when the model didn't think there was a disaster in a tweet when in fact there was)."}}
