Outliers here are defined as observations that fall below Q1 \u2212 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR.

They are particularly adept at showing interactions: how the relationship between levels of one categorical variable changes across levels of a second categorical variable. The lines that join each point from the same hue level allow interactions to be judged by differences in slope, which is easier for the eyes than comparing the heights of several groups of points or bars.","e873074f":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> <h3>Word Cloud<\/h3><\/div>","f44fe7cc":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> <h3>Joint Plot<\/h3><\/div>\nDraw a plot of two variables with bivariate and univariate graphs.\n\nThis function provides a convenient interface to the JointGrid class, with several canned plot kinds.
