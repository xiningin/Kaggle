This takes the difference in the percentage of questions answered correctly in the first ten task containers and compares it to the percentage of questions answered correctly in the last ten task containers. The differences are then sorted starting with those that had the biggest decrease in performance and ending with those that had the biggest increase. If the performance was the same, there would be the same amount of purple on the left as there is red on the right, but you can clearly see that there are a lot more users with increases in performance.\n\nI ran this for 100,000 users and the difference was as a staggering ten points, from an average of 51% in the first ten task containers, to an average of 61% in the last ten. The p-value on the t-statistic is basically zero. As an aside, it is interesting to note that the average over the last 10 task containers is actually lower than the overall average of approximately 65%, perhaps supporting the hypothesis that the later questions are more difficult than the earlier ones.","93eff7b6":"Here is a two columned dataframe that can be joined with your data to select folds.","7bd1eca3":"That's all folks - if you made it here, you are dedicated - thanks for reading!","5d5558ec":"### TL;DR\nYou can use the sql database or two column dataframe produced in this book to select training and validation sets that are distributed similarly to the test set. [Dataset here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/calebeverett\/riiid-folds).\n\n\n### Motivation\nIn general, we want to train on data that is distributed as similarly as possible to the test data with respect to both the variable we are predicting and the features we are using in the model. We also want a validation set that is simiar to the test set, but doesn't have any leakage from the training set.\n\nFor this dataset, I thought is was important to ensure that the train and validation sets had distributions similar to the test set for the following variables:\n* Percent of interactions answered correctly\n* Number of interactions per user\n* Where in users' histories interactions begin\n\nThe test set has been described as being comprised of mostly records that continue sequentially from records in the training data. If that is the case, then the training and validation sets should be constructed similarly, so that the included sequences of users' interactions start later in users' histories, in fact, towards the end of their histories based on the description of the test set. This seems especially important given the nature of users' learning and differences in the likely changes in the characteristics of the questions delivered to users' over time. For example, on the one hand, we would expect users to correctly answer a greater percentage of questions as their knowledge increases through the use of the system over time. On the other hand, though, users are delivered more difficult questions over time to advance their learning, which may otherwise may make it more difficult for them to answer questions correctly. Below, I compared users' performance on questions later in their histories with their earlier histories and found that there was a significant increase in performance over time. Regardless of the magnitude of these two illustative effects, the important point is that the characteristics of the later interactions are liklely different from the early ones and that since we are going to be tesing on the later ones, we should construct training and validation sets that are comprised mostly of later records.\n\nI had initially thought that it was beneficial to train on records of users that would be seen in test set, but have since come to the conclusion that for decision tree based models, where there is no explicit relationship between records, and user_id isn't used as a feature, that the benefit is minimal. As long as we are able to construct the features our models use to make predictions from an accurate representation of each users' state at the beginning of the predicton period, it won't make much of a difference whether we are predicting on interactions of users that were in our training set. (Is this right?) As it is currently, if you train a model on a subset of the training data, it is likely that you are predicting on a test set that includes records primarily related to users you didn't train on. Perhaps there is something inherent in users' interactions that carries across the sequence of their interactions that is valuable, but it seems like as long as you have the state data for each user as of the start of the sequences in the test set, it is much more imporant to make sure that the time frames of the sequences are similar. \n\n### Methodology\nThe rest of this notebook constructs folds that can be used interchangeably for training or validation purposes. It divides the training data into 40 folds with approximately 1.2 million records in each that are distributed in accordance with the description provided by the competition organizers of the test set and mutually exclusive with respect to users. The end product is an sqlite database that can be easily read into pandas dataframes that includes the training data with a fold column appended. I've also created a two column (row_id, fold) pandas dataframe that can be joined with your data to select data sets.\n\n* Users divided randomly into 40 folds\n* Within each fold:\n    * 10% of users have all of their records included (~20% of records)\n    * 60% of users have only their records starting in the later half of their complete histories included (~30% of records) \n    * 20% of users have only their records starting in the in the first half of their complete histories included (~50% of records)\n       \n### Results\nThe objective of having good data sets is obviously to have better model results. I was looking for an improvement in model performance and for my validation scores to be closer to my leader board scores. While not an exhaustive analysis of the impact, I did train two models with the same features and hyperparameters on a similar number of records using my old split methodology and using this new methodology for the purpose of comparison. There was less of a difference here than I was expecting, but my validation score is now closer to my leaderboard score. It is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions from just two models, but I believe this metodology will ultimately lead to better results throughout the competition.\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Train Dataset<\/th>\n        <th>Valid Dataset<\/th>\n        <th>Train AUC<\/th>\n        <th>Valid AUC<\/th>\n        <th>Public<br>Leaderboard<\/th>                    \n    <\/tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <ul>\n                <li>24.5 million records<\/li>\n                <li>85k users<\/li>\n                <li>100% of users (100% of records) from first interaction<\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n        <\/td>\n        <td>\n            <ul>\n                <li>4.9 million records<\/li>\n                <li>17k users<\/li>\n                <li>10% of users (20% of records) from first interaction<\/li>\n                <li>90% of users (80% of records) from beginning on average 50%\n                    of the way through sequence of interactions<\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n        <\/td>\n        <td>0.771<\/td>\n        <td>0.764<\/td>\n        <td>0.772<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td>\n            <ul>\n                <li>23.4 million records<\/li>\n                <li>172k users<\/li>\n                <li>10% of users (~20% of records) from first interaction<\/li>\n                <li>60% of users (~30% of records) from an average of 75% of the way through sequence of interactions<\/li>\n                <li>30% of users (~50% of records) from an average of 25% of the way through sequence of interactions<\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n        <\/td>\n        <td>\n            <ul>\n                <li>2.6 million records<\/li>\n                <li>19k users<\/li>\n                <li>10% of users (~20% of records) from first interaction<\/li>\n                <li>60% of users (~30% of records) from an average of 75% of the way through sequence of interactions<\/li>\n                <li>30% of users (~50% of records) from an average of 25% of the way through sequence of interactions<\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n        <\/td>\n        <td>0.773<\/td>\n        <td>0.769<\/td>\n        <td>0.773<\/td>\n    <\/tr>\n<\/table>","4c860656":"The charts above were based on users and task container ids.
