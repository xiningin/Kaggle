Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity of its syntax (with some going as far as to call it \"executable pseudocode\"). \n\nNote how we indicated which code belongs to the `if`. `\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"` is only supposed to be printed if `spam_amount` is positive. But the later code (like `print(viking_song)`) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?\n\nThe colon (`:`) at the end of the `if` line indicates that a new \"code block\" is coming up. Subsequent lines which are **indented** (beginning with an extra 4 spaces) are part of that code block. You may be familiar with other languages which use `{`curly braces`}` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace often is surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. \n\nThe later lines dealing with `viking_song` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the `if`'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we start defining functions and using loops.\n\nThis code snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:\n\n```python\n\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"\n```\n\nStrings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks. (But because this particular string *contains* a single-quote character, we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single-quotes, unless we're careful.)","0bbc6964":"A **function call**. `print` is an extremely useful builtin Python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen. We call functions by putting parentheses after their name, with the inputs to the function (or *arguments*) in between.","30dbba7b":"## Numbers and arithmetic in Python\n\nWe've already seen an example of a variable containing a number above:","fb897835":"It's an `int` - short for integer.

This silly program demonstrates many important aspects of what Python code looks like (its *syntax*) and how it works (its *semantics*). Let's run down the code from top to bottom.","29f98539":"The `*` operator can be used to multiply two numbers (`3 * 3` evaluates to 9), but amusingly enough, we can also multiply a string by a number, to get a version that's been repeated that many times. Python offers a number of cheeky little time-saving tricks like this where operators like `*` and `+` have a different meaning depending on what kind of thing they're applied to. (The technical term for this is [operator overloading](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operator_overloading))","cd9fa389":"\"Number\" is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but if we wanted to be more technical, we could ask Python how it would describe the type of thing that `spam_amount` is:","51971bb5":"**Variable assignment!** Here we create a variable called `spam_amount` and assign it the value of 0 using `=`, Python's assignment operator.\n\n> **Aside**: If you've programmed in certain other languages (like Java or C++), you might be noticing some things Python *doesn't* require us to do here:  \n- we don't need to \"declare\" `spam_amount` before assigning to it\n- we don't need to tell Python what type of value `spam_amount` is going to refer to. In fact, we can even go on to reassign `spam_amount` to refer to a different sort of thing like a string or a boolean.","33fd4456":"The first line above is a **comment**. In Python, comments begin with the `#` symbol.\n\nNext we see an example of reassignment. Reassigning the value of an existing variable looks just the same as creating a variable - it still uses the `=` assignment operator.\n\nIn this case, the value we're assigning to `spam_amount` involves a little simple arithmetic on its previous value. When it encounters this line, Python evaluates the expression on the right-hand-side of the `=` (0 + 4 = 4), and then assigns that value to the variable on the left-hand-side.","f2274704":"Welcome to Kaggle Learn's Python course.
