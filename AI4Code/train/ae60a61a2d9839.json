","2920794a":"# Introduction\n\nAHR (Andalusian Hotels' Reviews) is a corpus of reviews written in Spanish. The main goal of this dataset is to offer a resource to create an practice NLP methods for a language other than English. \n\nThis data is suitable mainly for sentiment analysis. Take a look at the principal caracteristics of this collection. ","86377c42":"# Conclusion","71e5a1da":"# Two options. Which one you choose?\n\nInitially I've retrieved 16,356 reviews about 1030 hotels in Seville, Granada, Malaga, Jaen and Almeria (aprox. 15 per hotel). I've also found an extention for my dataset - the COAH corpus (cited in description), which allowed me to reach the number of 18,172 reviews that form **BIG_AHR.csv** \n\nLet's take a quick look at what the data looks like.\nThe *rating* column provides a traditional 5-scale rating, while the *label* columns provides sentiment labels: **1** stands for **positive**, **0** for **negative** and **3** for **neutral**. To perform binary sentiment classificantion on this dataset you can just remove neutral reviews. ","635d4d65":"Thank you for your attention. To conclude this presentation, I would only like to emphasize on the lack of publickly available corpora in languages other than English: such a blooming field as NLP can only benefit from the variety of forms of human expression. I hope this corpus will contribute to enhance the diversity of Kaggle's NLP community since it can open new challenges waiting for your outstanding solutions \u263a\ufe0f \n\nFell free to express your doubts, suggestions and general oppinion in the comment section. \nHappy Kaggling!"}}
