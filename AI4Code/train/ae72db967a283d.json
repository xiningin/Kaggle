If not provided, then each sample is given unit weight.\n\nIn this kernel we'll compare results with no sample weights and setting weights according to class distribution in train datatset.

You can try it on the real data (test.csv, which, as I already mentioned, is balanced) and find the difference for yourself. \n\nHappy kaggling :))))"}}
