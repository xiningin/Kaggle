predictions from two or more base machine learning models.\nStacking is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classifications or regression models via a meta-classifier or a meta-regressor. \n\nThe base-level models are trained based on a complete training set, then the meta-model is trained on the outputs of the base level model as features.\nThe base-level often consists of different learning algorithms and therefore stacking ensembles are often heterogeneous.","9a30b128":"## Load Library","b8fb8fec":"## Splitting Train And Test Data","35ee9da6":"## Filling 0's In windspeed Using Random Forest","491b6821":"## Outliers Analysis\n\nAt first look, \"count\" variable contains lot of outlier data points which skews the distribution towards right (as there are more data points beyond Outer Quartile Limit).But in addition to that, following inferences can also been made from the simple boxplots given below.\n\n* Spring season has got relatively lower count.The dip in median value in boxplot gives evidence for it.\n* The boxplot with \"Hour Of The Day\" is quiet interesting.The median value are relatively higher at 7AM - 8AM and 5PM - 6PM. It can be attributed to regular school and office users at that time.\n* Most of the outlier points are mainly contributed from \"Working Day\" than \"Non Working Day\".

Lets plot a correlation plot between \"count\" and [\"temp\",\"atemp\",\"humidity\",\"windspeed\"].\n\n* temp and humidity features has got positive and negative correlation with count respectively.Although the correlation between them are not very prominent still the count variable has got little dependency on \"temp\" and \"humidity\".\n* windspeed is not gonna be really useful numerical feature and it is visible from it correlation value with \"count\"\n* \"atemp\" is variable is not taken into since \"atemp\" and \"temp\" has got strong correlation with each other. During model building any one of the variable has to be dropped since they will exhibit multicollinearity in the data.\n* \"Casual\" and \"Registered\" are also not taken into account since they are leakage variables in nature and need to dropped during model building.\n* Regression plot in seaborn is one useful way to depict the relationship between two features.

As we mentioned earlier this can be attributed to regular school and office commuters.\n* Above pattern is not observed on \"Saturday\" and \"Sunday\".More people tend to rent bicycle between 10AM and 4PM.\n* The peak user count around 7AM-8AM and 5PM-6PM is purely contributed by registered user.\n","2eb4325a":"## Using mlextend StackingCVRegressor","259f22fb":"### Visualizing Distribution Of Data\n\nAs it is visible from the below figures that \"count\" variable is skewed towards right.
