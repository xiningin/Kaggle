We then filter for MeSH keywords and construct SciBERT section embeddings for the sentences in the abstract. We noticed that many of the Kaggle submissions followed the same system format, in which the text corpus was mapped using an embedding function to some vector in the embedding space. This vector embedding was then used to determine relationships between texts. A given question would then also be mapped through the same function and some similarity metric (euclidean distance, cosine similarity, etc.) would then be used to determine most similar texts. A diagram of such a system is given below where the red dot represents the question embedding in the space:\n","5804d27e":"<h1> Overview <\/h1>\n\nCOVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a open dataset of scientific articles related to the novel COVID-19 virus and available for download online.

However, there is substantial uncertainty about the degree and direction of influence owing to different definitions of genetic variation, most of which are not in line with the current understanding of the genetic architecture of disease traits. Also, the relevance of previous results for diseases transmitted through environmental sources is unclear. In this article a compartmental genetic\u2013epidemiological model was developed to quantify the impact of host genetic diversity on epidemiological characteristics of diseases transmitted through a contaminated environment...\n\n[[0.93211877]]  :  Mathematical prediction in infection Abstract It is now increasingly common for infectious disease epidemics to be analysed with mathematical models. Modelling is possible because epidemics involve relatively simple processes occurring within large populations of individuals. Modelling aims to explain and predict trends in disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality. Epidemic models give important insight into the development of an epidemic. Following disease establishment, epidemic growth is approximately exponential. The rate of growth in this phase is primarily determined by the basic reproduction number, R 0, the number of secondary cases per primary case when the population is susceptible. R 0 also determines the ease with which control policies can control an epidemic. Once a significant proportion of the population has been infected, not all contacts of an infected individual will be with susceptible people. Infection can now continue only because new births replenish the susceptible population. Eventually an endemic equilibrium is reached where every infected person infects one other individual on average...\n\n[[0.93612156]]  :  Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study Background: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is extending its range of transmission in all parts of the world, with substantial variation in rates of transmission and severity of associated disease. Methods: We evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a COVID-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. We used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Findings: The analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of the disease. Delays in diagnosis of cases and proportion of asymptomatic cases are key factors for containment and slowing down the epidemic. Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to control early epidemics, but only if transmissibility as measured by R0 is in the lower ranges of reported values. Timeliness as well as completeness of tracing and diagnosis of cases are paramount to achieve containment and effective slowing down of the epidemic growth rate.\n```\n\nSome of the top words identified in embedding clusters:\n\n```\n!python create_embeddings.py --load_file --embeddings_file='abstract_mesh_embeddings.json'\n\n['rna', 'protein', 'virus', 'proteins', 'viral', 'cells', 'replication', 'cell', 'binding', 'coronavirus']\n['health', 'disease', 'public', 'data', 'infectious', 'care', 'study', 'diseases', 'risk', 'model']\n['pcr', 'detection', 'virus', 'assay', 'samples', 'rt', 'respiratory', 'time', 'viruses', 'viral']\n['activity', 'compounds', 'virus', 'antiviral', 'anti', 'compound', 'cell', 'cells', 'inhibitors', 'human']\n['patients', 'respiratory', 'infection', 'study', 'ci', 'influenza', 'children', 'cases', 'clinical', '95']\n['virus', 'cells', 'infection', 'mice', 'cell', 'protein', 'infected', 'vaccine', 'viral', 'human']\n```","ed3f08e3":"<h1> Evaluation <\/h1>\n\nOne aspect of this task that we think has been overlooked is an evaluation method for embedding spaces. As these papers are not annotated, evaluating metrics are not straightforward. In this section, we brainstorm some potential evaluation metrics for document embedding spaces. Hopefully, we will be able to implement some of these in a later iteration of the project.\n\n## Cluster cohesion\n\nSome previous submissions present cluster cohesion as a potential method for identifying distinct topics within the embedding space. We present the cluster cohesion metrics for the three embedding spaces tested in this submission. The silhouette score is calculated using two metrics: a (the mean intra-cluster distance) and b (the mean nearest-cluster distance). The silhouette score is then defined as (b-a)\/max(a, b). Silhouette scores define how well-defined clusters are. For a random sample of 5000 embeddings, we compute the silhouette scores for our three embedding spaces for 10 clusters.\n\n```\nSciBERT + MeSH: 0.0747\n\nSciBERT: 0.0882\n\nSciBERT + TFIDF: 0.0359\n```\n\nHowever, since the embeddings are of such large dimension, it is difficult to discern true differences between embedding spaces. Futhermore, since papers can be of multiple topics and this is not a classification task, cluster cohesion does not necessary determine directly better embedding spaces.\n\n## Performance on related tasks\n\n### Information retrieval\n\nAlternatively, our search mechanism is essentially a question retrieval task. Consequently, there are other question\/retrieval datasets that have been annotated. One example of this is the [TyDi annotated dataset](https:\/\/github.com\/google-research-datasets\/tydiqa) constructed by Google AI. However, some embedding methods, such as our SciBERT and MeSH weighted embedding method was constructed particularly for this scientific task. This might decrease performance on other question retrieval tasks.\n\n### Identifying misinformation\n\nAnother idea that we came up with is to determine a misinformation dataset that could be annotated by users. This would also be useful in identifying misinformation in the press or in other sources of news. We expect true information to be more supported in the dataset. Thus, we can test true and untrue statements by looking at the average of the top five scores in the dataset. One example of this is given below for abstact SciBERT and MeSH embeddings:\n\n```\nStatement: Coronavirus can lead to pneumonia.\n\nScore: 0.81\n```\n\n```\nStatement: Coronavirus does not lead to pneumonia.\n\nScore: 0.75\n```\n\nBy annotating a set of statements as more true or less true using input by knowledgeable humans, we may also be able to give a soft ranking for better and worse embedding spaces. Such a system would also be useful in identifying and possibly correcting misinformation and rating news.\n","96ef1d24":"## TFIDF weighted SciBERT embeddings\n\n### Embedding Methodology\n\n<ol>\n    <li> Break title + abstract into sentences <\/li>\n    <li> Retrieve sciBERT representation of each sentence, weight tokens by TF-IDF scores across the entire corpus<\/li>\n    <li> Average sentence embeddings to return paragraph embedding <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n### Search Results\n\n```\npython search_embeddings.py --embedding_type=\"SCIBERT_TFIDF\" --embeddings_file=\"abstract_scibert_tfidf_embeddings.json\"\n\nPlease enter a statement or question: What are potential drug therapies of coronaviruses?\n\n[[0.6976624]]  :  Coronaviruses \u2014 drug discovery and therapeutic options In humans, infections with the human coronavirus (HCoV) strains HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 usually result in mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold. By contrast, the CoVs responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which were discovered in Hong Kong, China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, have received global attention over the past 12 years owing to their ability to cause community and health-care-associated outbreaks of severe infections in human populations. These two viruses pose major challenges to clinical management because there are no specific antiviral drugs available. In this Review, we summarize the epidemiology, virology, clinical features and current treatment strategies of SARS and MERS, and discuss the discovery and development of new virus-based and host-based therapeutic options for CoV infections. \n\n[[0.70208923]]  :  A review of candidate therapies for Middle East respiratory syndrome from a molecular perspective There have been 2040 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 27 countries, with a mortality rate of 34.9 %.

The current therapies have mainly been adapted from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, interferons, ribavirin, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir or mycophenolate mofetil, and have not been subject to well-organized clinical trials. The development of specific therapies and vaccines is therefore urgently required. We examine existing and potential therapies and vaccines from a molecular perspective.

We additionally perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the potential impact of differential healthcare seeking patterns by age. We illustrate this method using data from the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic in Gauteng Province, South Africa. RESULTS: Our results are consistent with others in showing decreased transmission with age. We show that results can change markedly when we make the account for differential healthcare seeking behaviors by age. CONCLUSIONS: We show substantial heterogeneity in transmission by age group during the Influenza A H1N1 pandemic in South Africa.

Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.\n\n[[0.72769375]]  :  Prediction of antiviral drugs against African Swine Fever Viruses based on protein-protein interaction analysis AbstractThe African swine fever virus (ASFV) has severely influenced the swine industry of the world. Unfortunately, there is no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against the virus until now. Identification of new anti-ASFV drugs is urgently needed. Here, an up-to-date set of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of PPIs from multiple sources. Thirty-two swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as AIPs. They were found to play a central role in the swine PPI network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of AIPs also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted AIPs and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on AIPs were identified, such as Polaprezinc. This work could not only deepen our understanding towards the ASFV-swine interactions, but also help for the development of effective antiviral drugs against the ASFVs.\n```\n\nThe code and our pretrained embeddings are available on our GitHub repository for users to try themselves.

Many researchers noted that being able to query the top K documents based upon a given keyword might not be useful for most use cases. Researchers noted pain points in needing to skim research papers that could be 50+ pages for a few small portions of information. These conversations inspired us to create search functionality that could retrieve relevant information on a paragraph granularity. We are thankful to the team at the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence for providing an open-source pretrained sciBERT model to the research community. It seems as though one of the desired features for biomedical researchers in particular was in the realm of extractive summarization (i.e being able to pull out the K most relevant sentences from a document conditioned upon a query). Our team noted that there do not exist strong open-sourced pretrained models for extractive embeddings that are well tailored to scientific text, and believe that work on this could greatly augment the utility of query tools like ours.<\/li>\n    <li> Task relevant insight from our work: in the above embeddings constructed using abstracts, we see that there exists cohesion between documents that discuss semantically similar ideas. From our knowledge of scientific writing, we know that each paragraph in a given research paper contains different values of information. We may be able to leverage this in future work to augment our tool. For example, consider two papers that are nearly identical that are testing two distinct treatments for COVID-19. Even if there exists a lot of information overlap in some sections of the paper (like related work), other portions of the paper (like methods) could provide more value of information for discriminating between the two articles with a fine granularity. <\/li>\n    <li> Another idea would be to utilize these COVID-19 specific engines to augmented existing tools that are already heavily optimized to medical domains. One example of such a tool would be PubMed. We could then fine tune the ranking with a COVID specific system for COVID-related queries. <\/li>\n<\/ol>"}}
