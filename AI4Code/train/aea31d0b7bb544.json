even a line) have created over 15 models using 10 fold stratified cross validation and evaluated the 6 most commonly used classification metrics (Accuracy, AUC, Recall, Precision, F1, Kappa). The score grid printed above highlights the highest performing metric for comparison purposes only. The grid by default is sorted using 'Accuracy' (highest to lowest) which can be changed by passing the sort parameter. For example compare_models(sort = 'Recall') will sort the grid by Recall instead of Accuracy. If you want to change the fold parameter from the default value of 10 to a different value then you can use the fold parameter. For example compare_models(fold = 5) will compare all models on 5 fold cross validation. Reducing the number of folds will improve the training time.","7423fc6e":"### Create a Model\n\nWhile compare_models() is a powerful function and often a starting point in any experiment, it does not return any trained models. PyCaret's recommended experiment workflow is to use compare_models() right after setup to evaluate top performing models and finalize a few candidates for continued experimentation. As such, the function that actually allows to you create a model is unimaginatively called create_model(). This function creates a model and scores it using stratified cross validation. Similar to compare_models(), the output prints a score grid that shows Accuracy, AUC, Recall, Precision, F1 and Kappa by fold\n\n\nThere are 18 classifiers available in the model library of PyCaret. \n\nWe Look at DT for an example","4fca203d":"<a id=\"ak\"><\/a>\n\n\n### AUTO-KERAS\n\n\n#### One of the most widely used AUTOML framework, as the name says it all it is an AutoML system based on Keras. keras is a popular and widely used DL framework, so the support is huge.\n\n#### The API\u2019s design follows the classic design of the Scikit-Learn API; hence, it\u2019s extremely simple to use. The current version provides functionalities to automatically search for hyperparameters during the deep learning process. Auto-Keras tends to simplify the ML process through the use of automated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms. Neural Architecture Search essentially replaces the deep learning engineer\/practitioner with a set of algorithms that automatically tunes the model.\n\n\n#### For deep learning, for now you have the ImageClassifier, the BayesianSearcher, a Graph module, a PreProcessor, a LayerTransformer, a NetTransformer, a ClassifierGenerator and some utilities. This is an evolving package.\n\n\n#### For tabular dataset, keras has a method called StructuredDataClassifier which is what we will use. Keras also has Automodel that combines multiple inputs. So in simple words, StructuredDataClassifier, TextClassifiers etc. are all TaskAPIs. \n\nWhen doing a classical task such as image classification\/regression, text classification\/regression, ..., you can use the simplest APIs provided by autokeras called Task API: ImageClassifier, ImageRegressor, TextClassifier, TextRegressor, ... In this case you have one input (image or text or tabular data, ...) and one output (classification, regression). \n\nAutomodel, however when you are in a situation where you have for example a task that requires multi inputs\/outputs architecture, then you cannot use directly Task API, and this is where Automodel comes into play with the I\/O API. \n\nGraphAutomodel works like keras functional API. It assembles different blocks (Convolutions, LSTM, GRU, ...) and create a model using this block, then it will look for the best hyperparameters given this architecture you provided. \n    \n\nKeras AUTOMODEL is mainly used for Multi-Modal and Multi-Task. \n\nMulti-model data means each data instance has multiple forms of information. For example, a photo can be saved as a image. Besides the image, it may also have when and where it was taken as its attributes, which can be represented as structured data.\n\nMulti-task here we refer to we want to predict multiple targets with the same input features. For example, we not only want to classify an image according to its content, but we also want to regress its quality as a float number between 0 and 1.\n\n    \n#### Now, lets do the modeling using StructuredDataClassifier","1037dde8":"### Is ensemble default in auto-sklearn?\n\n    - Yes, refer Introduction section in the paper mentioned above\n    \n    \nBelow is a simple auto-sklearn pipeline    ","e57ba8fd":"#### DRIFT REMOVAL\n\n    This is an innovative feature I haven't encountered in other packages.\n\n    The main idea is to automatically detect and remove variables that have a distribution that is substantially different between the train and the test set.\n\n    This happens quite a lot and we generally talk about biased data. \n\n    You could have for example a situation when the train set has a population of young people whereas the test has elderly only. This indicates that the age feature is not robust and may lead to a poor performance of the model when testing. So it has to be discarded.\n\n#### How does MLBox compute drifts for individual variables? \n\n\n    MLBox builds a classifier that separates train from test data. It then uses the ROC score related to this classifier as a measure of the drift.\n\n    This makes sense:\n\n    If the drift score is high (i.e. the ROC score is high) the ability the discern train data from test data is easy, which means that the two distributions are very different.\n    Otherwise, if the drift score is low (i.e. the ROC score is low) the classifier is not able to separate the two disctributions correctly.\n    MLBox provides a class called Drift_thresholder that takes as input the train and test sets as well as the target and computes a drift score of each one of the variables.\n\n    Drift_thresholder then deletes the variables that have a drift score higher that a threshold (default to 0.6).","5c0b3459":"### The heavy lifting : optimizing\n\n#### All the functionalities inside this sub-package can be used via the command-\n\n    from mlbox.optimisation import *\n\nThis hyper-parameter optimisation method in this library uses the hyperopt library which is very fast and you can almost optimise anything in this library from choosing the right missing value imputation method to the depth of an XGBOOST model.

AutoML essentially focuses on two major aspects \u2014 data acquisition\/collection and prediction. All the other steps that take place in between can be easily automated while delivering a model that\u2019s optimized well and ready to make predictions.\n\nThe success of machine learning in a wide range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts\u00b9.

This enables a data scientist to focus more on the problem rather than the models.\n\n    - Automating the ML pipeline also helps to avoid errors that might creep in manually.\n\n    - Ultimately, AutoML is a step towards democratizing machine learning by making the power of ML accessible to everybody.","54c02d42":"### Setting up Environment in PyCaret\n\nThe setup() function initializes the environment in pycaret and creates the transformation pipeline to prepare the data for modeling and deployment. setup() must be called before executing any other function in pycaret.

The data type should be inferred correctly but this is not always the case. To account for this, PyCaret displays a table containing the features and their inferred data types after setup() is executed. If all of the data types are correctly identified enter can be pressed to continue or quit can be typed to end the expriment. Ensuring that the data types are correct is of fundamental importance in PyCaret as it automatically performs a few pre-processing tasks which are imperative to any machine learning experiment.
