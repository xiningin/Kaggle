But, have you ever wondered how these filters actually works? How this artistic looks comes?****\n\n****All this is because of an intelligent style transfer algorithm....****<br>\n****Now, What is Style Transfer??****<br>\nStyle transfer is the technique of reconstructing images in the style of another image.<br> There are varoius research papers on this topic that how neural networks could be used to generate artistic style images, each author stating their own innovative way of optimization and loss function to create a artistic image generating neural network.<br>\n****After going through various works on Neural Style Transfer and how they could be constructed, In this Kernel I have explained part by part how a basic Neural style transfer is actually constructed ****","b65f85a8":"## The Style Loss\nTo do this at first we need to, calculate the **Gram-matrix**(a matrix comprising of correlated features) for the tensors output by the style-layers. The Gram-matrix is essentially just a matrix of dot-products for the vectors of the feature activations of a style-layer.<br><br>\nIf an entry in the Gram-matrix has a value close to zero then it means the two features in the given layer do not activate simultaneously for the given style-image. And vice versa, if an entry in the Gram-matrix has a large value, then it means the two features do activate simultaneously for the given style-image. We will then try and create a mixed-image that replicates this activation pattern of the style-image.\nIf the feature map is a matrix **F**, then each entry in the Gram matrix **G** can be given by:\n![Gram Matrix](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*5xx9KmhVb59Mxe_buOwHBA.png)\nThe loss function for style is quite similar to out content loss, except that we calculate the Mean Squared Error for the Gram-matrices instead of the raw tensor-outputs from the layers.\n![Style loss](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*PuYveCM2BlgFfjUCr6I_Ng.png)","c4bc4183":"# Conclusion\n* In our case the Final images formed are not totally perfect, because the Style image does not totally blend with the Base content image.\n* It could be improved through icreasing the number of iteration, or by trying out a different syle transfer algorithm which could preseve the edges of the base image, or by trying out with different optimizer to minimize gradient and loss.","62f821ae":"### this will contain our generated image\n\nThink of **Variable** in tensorflow as a normal variables which we use in programming languages. We initialize variables, we can modify it later as well. Whereas **placeholder** doesn\u2019t require initial value. Placeholder simply allocates block of memory for future use. Later, we can use feed_dict to feed the data into placeholder. By default, placeholder has an unconstrained shape, which allows you to feed tensors of different shapes in a session.","ffc16e6f":"## Features are extracted from each layer in style layers and content layers and their overall loss is calculated from it...","642eedef":"The purpose of this **Evaluator** class is to avoid the error **'numpy.ndarray' object is not callable error with optimize.minimize** while running the L-BFGS optimizer for loss minimization.<br><br>\nYou should pass the function itself to minimize, instead of a evaluated value.
