Analysing the data set and trying to find World University Rankings and extracting information     through plots .\n  2. Of all the Universities in the World which is the best ? \n\n* ***Description :***\n\n    Ranking universities is a difficult, political, and controversial practice. There are hundreds of     different national and international university ranking systems, many of which disagree with each     other. This dataset contains three global university rankings from very different places.\n\n   University Ranking Data\n\n    The **Times Higher Education World University Ranking** is widely regarded as one of the most         influential and widely observed university measures. Founded in the United Kingdom in 2010, it       has been criticized for its commercialization and for undermining non-English-instructing             institutions.\n\n    The **Academic Ranking of World Universities**, also known as the Shanghai Ranking, is an equally     influential ranking. It was founded in China in 2003 and has been criticized for focusing on raw     research power and for undermining humanities and quality of instruction.\n\n    The **Center for World University Rankings**, is a less well know listing that comes from Saudi       Arabia, it was founded in 2012.\n   \nHere we will be utilizing the Center for World University Ranking(CWUR) .\n\n* ***HYPOTHESIS :***\n\n   A good University is one that provides good teaching\/quality of education , does good quality of research , recieves citations and industrial income !\n   \n   Lesser the individual value of quality of education , citations,publication etc, better is the University !\n\n\n* ***ACKNOWLEGMENTS :***\n\n    Myself <a href='https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kaustubh-mishra-54556917b'> Kaustubh Mishra <\/a> and     my team member <a href='https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/yuvraj-kumar-68164117a\/'> Yuvraj Kumar<\/a>       created this notebook as part of the course work under ***\u201cPandas, bamboolib & Orange                 workshop\u201d*** at Suven, under mentor-ship of <a href='https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rocky-jagtiani-3b390649\/'> Rocky Jagtiani <\/a> .\n    \n    Learned from : https:\/\/datascience.suvenconsultants.com\n    \n    Mentored by : <a href='https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rocky-jagtiani-3b390649\/'> Rocky Jagtiani <\/a>\n    \n* ***DATASET :***\n\n   The Center for World University Rankings provides information for top universities in the World. *They use an overal rank per university and individual values for the National Rank, Quality of Education, Alumni Employment, Quality of Faculty, Publications, Influence, Citations, Broad Impact, Patents, and an Total Score. All these values are for a certain year. For example, Harvard University has the first position for 2012, with 100.00 overall score and ranks 1 for most of the dimmensions.*\n   \n   The above data set has : \n   Features : 1 Categorical , 12 Numerical .\n   Meta Attributes : 1 Text.\n   \n   There are in all 2200 observations available(no of rows) from which we extract information through exploratory data analysis and visualisation .\n       \n   \n   We have also used a Supplementary data available with the above dataset : ***education_expenditure_supplementary_data*** that provides information about the Public and Private sector expenditure on education by different countries for the period : 1995-2011 .\n   Note : The information about Private Expenditure and Total Expenditure is not available for the period : 1995-2010 .\n\n   There are different values for different years, here we will analyse this dataset for the year : 2012 as a sample case and try to deduce various information fot the year 2012.\n   \n   Note : Here we have used Orange data mining toolkit , some of the plots and figure are obtained through Orange toolkit. Thus , displaying how one can ,simply and easily, obtain useful information from Orange.\n   ","206ef852":"## *Scatter Plots :*","e54c89b9":"Now we can clearly see the correlation between different features of our dataset.

The number of universities of a particular country included for a particular year(area of the normal distrubution for that country between the present year and the previous year).\n\n2. When(i.e \"At which Year\") is maximum no. of Universities for a particular country achieved(for the period : 2012-15).\n\n3. As we see that , the general trend of normal distribution is increasing from the year 2012 to 2015,for every country , we can have a clear idea that the no. of universities from a particular country is increasing each year.","64be9af8":"## *TOP 10 Universities on different Parameters :*","323ea6c3":"# *SAMPLE CASE : 2012*","ebaa8a25":"# *CORRELATIONS :*","bbd65182":"# *CONCLUSION :* \nWe can now derive the following the following conclusions : \n* Harward University's world rank : 1 for the period 2012-15.\n* Harward University , Standford University and MIT are among the top 5 universities for the period : 2012-15.\n* Having world rank : 1 doesn't implies that the University is no. 1 in each of its department like : quality of education,alumni_employment etc .\n* There is a direct and positive correlation between the publications and world_rank, followed by positive correlation between influence and world_rank.\n* The total no of Countries increases each year, and we also notice that no. of Universities in differnt countries also increases each year.\n* The relation between score and world_rank can be considered as a -ve correlation as the University having more score receives less world_rank(or lower world rank).\n","36e2d923":"Fig 1 : is tabulated for 50% of the entire dataset ."}}
