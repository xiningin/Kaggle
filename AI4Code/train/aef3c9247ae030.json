The name stands for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. The idea is to embed high-dimensional points in low dimensions in a way that respects similarities between points.\n\n\n* What is T SNE used for?\n\n> **What is t-SNE**? (t-SNE) t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm used for exploring high-dimensional data. It maps multi-dimensional data to two or more dimensions suitable for human observation.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding\n\n> T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a machine learning algorithm for visualization developed by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton.[1] It is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions. Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points with high probability.\n\n> The t-SNE algorithm comprises two main stages. First, t-SNE constructs a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar objects are assigned a higher probability while dissimilar points are assigned a lower probability. Second, t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution over the points in the low-dimensional map, and it minimizes the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence (KL divergence) between the two distributions with respect to the locations of the points in the map. While the original algorithm uses the Euclidean distance between objects as the base of its similarity metric, this can be changed as appropriate.\n\n> t-SNE has been used for visualization in a wide range of applications, including computer security research,[2] music analysis,[3] cancer research,[4] bioinformatics,[5] and biomedical signal processing.[6] It is often used to visualize high-level representations learned by an artificial neural network.[7]\n\n> While t-SNE plots often seem to display clusters, the visual clusters can be influenced strongly by the chosen parameterization and therefore a good understanding of the parameters for t-SNE is necessary. Such \"clusters\" can be shown to even appear in non-clustered data,[8] and thus may be false findings. Interactive exploration may thus be necessary to choose parameters and validate results.[9][10] It has been demonstrated that t-SNE is often able to recover well-separated clusters, and with special parameter choices, approximates a simple form of spectral clustering.\n\n","d9241a49":"<a id=\"12\"><\/a> <br>\n### EVALUATING OF CLUSTERING\nWe cluster data in two groups.

Then, for each observed value of the variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.\n\n> This process produces standard scores that represent the number of standard deviations above or below the mean that a specific observation falls.

","9179553b":"### Regularized Regression\n**As we have learned, linear regression choose parameters (coefficients) while minimizing loss function. If linear regression thinks that one of the feature is important, it gives high coefficient to this feature. However, this can cause overfitting that is like memorizing in KNN. *In order to avoid overfitting, we use regularization that penalize large coefficients*.**\n\nhttps:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/regularization-in-machine-learning-76441ddcf99a#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20form%20of,avoid%20the%20risk%20of%20overfitting.\n\n\n\n* **Ridge regression: First regularization technique.

Picking alpha is similar to picking K in KNN. As you understand alpha is hyperparameter that we need to choose for best accuracy and model complexity. This process is called hyperparameter tuning.\n    * What if alpha is zero? lost function = OLS so that is linear rigression :)\n    * If alpha is small that can cause overfitting\n    * If alpha is big that can cause underfitting. But do not ask what is small and big. These can be change from problem to problem.\n* **Lasso regression: Second regularization technique. Also it is called L1 regularization**. \n    * **Lasso regression lost fuction = OLS + alpha * sum(absolute_value(parameter))**\n    * It can be used to select important features of the data.

However, if we do not use random_state, data is split differently at each time and according to split accuracy will be different. Therefore, we can conclude that **model performance is dependent on train_test_split**. For example you split, fit and predict data 5 times and accuracies are 0.89, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. Which accuracy do you use? Do you know what accuracy will be at 6th times split, train and predict. The answer is I do not know but **if I use cross validation I can find acceptable accuracy**.\n<br> Cross Validation (CV)\n* **K-folds = K folds CV.**\n* Look at this image it defines better than me :)\n* When K is increase, computationally cost is increase\n* cross_val_score(reg,x,y,cv=5): use reg(linear regression) with x and y that we define at above and K is 5. It means 5 times(split, train,predict)\n\nhttps:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/machine-learning\/latest\/dg\/cross-validation.html\n\nhttps:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/cross-validation-in-machine-learning-72924a69872f\n"}}
