Once you start packing too much into a single statement, it becomes harder to follow than a regular for loop.","6ec30562":"So if we run this code then we get such kind of output","432bf329":"Two common cases where you shouldn't use a list comprehension are:\n\nYou don't actually want a list\nThe logic is too long\nCase 1: You don't actually want a list\nList comprehensions build lists, but that's not the only reason we use for loops. Sometimes we have functions or methods whose main purpose is their side effect, and they don't return anything meaningful.","eb2eafb2":"We just hired a new intern, Dan, to help us with this but something doesn't seem to be working quite right. Here's his function:","b2cfe418":"What's his code is printing, and how can we fix it?\n\nSide note: Although learning the answers to these common Python questions is important, it's so much more important to be able to quickly solve Python problems you've never seen before. Interviewers want to see that you can do more than just memorize facts!","fdcaba47":"So how do we fix this code?\nSince daily_balances is just a regular list, the fix is simple\u2014use positive indices instead:","e708a478":"  [team.set_location(HOME) for team in league_teams if team in home_teams_today]","c0eb4577":"These Python interview questions will challenge your algorithmic thinking skills as well as your Python programming skills. The first few questions are more Python-specific, and then we have a bunch of general data structures and algorithms questions in Python.\n\nInterview Cake is not just another question database\u2014we walk you through the question step-by-step, giving hints and explanations as you need them, just like a real interviewer."}}
