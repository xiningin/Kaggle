Internally, SQL databases all operate very differently. Externally, however, they all provide the same API, the \"Structured Query Language\" (or...SQL...for short).\n\nWe (very briefly) need to use SQL to load data into \n\nFor the purposes of analysis however we can usually just think of a SQL database as a set of tables with names, and SQL as a minor inconvenience in getting that data out of said tables.\n\nSo, without further ado, here is all the SQL you have to know to get the data out of `SQLite` and into `pandas`:","85ca1bff":"In this example, the \"0, No\" entry has the value of 131.

For the workbook section, [click here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/residentmario\/creating-reading-and-writing-workbook).\n\nThe very first step in any data analytics project will probably reading the data out of a file somewhere, so it makes sense that that's the first thing we'd need to cover. In this section, we'll look at exercises on creating `pandas` `Series` and `DataFrame` objects, both by hand and by reading data from disc.\n\nThe [IO Tools](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/io.html) section of the official `pandas` docs provides a comprehensive overview on this subject.","03495539":"## Reading common file formats\n\nBeing able to create a `DataFrame` and `Series` by hand is handy. But, most of the time, we won't actually be creating our own data by hand, we'll be working with data that already exists.\n\nData can be stored in any of a number of different forms and formats. By far the most basic of these is the humble CSV file. When you open a CSV file you get something that looks like this:\n\n```csv\nProduct A,Product B,Product C,\n30,21,9,\n35,34,1,\n41,11,11\n```\n\nSo a CSV file is a table of values separated by commas. Hence the name: \"comma-seperated values\", or CSV.\n\nLet's now set aside our toy datasets and see what a real dataset looks like when we read it into a `DataFrame`. We'll use the `read_csv` function to read the data into a `DataFrame`. This goes thusly:","fc76e069":"The dictionary-list constructor assigns values to the *column labels*, but just uses an ascending count from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) for the *row labels*. Sometimes this is OK, but oftentimes we will want to assign these labels ourselves.\n\nThe list of row labels used in a `DataFrame` is known as an **Index**. We can assign values to it by using an `index` parameter in our constructor:","dbafb614":"## Writing common file formats","56edcf14":"Writing data to a file is usually easier than reading it out of one, because `pandas` handles the nuisance of conversions for you. \n\nWe'll start with CSV files again. The opposite of `read_csv`, which reads our data, is `to_csv`, which writes it. With CSV files it's dead simple:","cf957160":"Painless!","f18c38ee":"## Creating data\n\nThere are two core objects in `pandas`: the **DataFrame** and the **Series**.\n\nA DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual *entries*, each of which has a certain *value*. Each entry corresponds with a row (or *record*) and a *column*.\n\nFor example, consider the following simple `DataFrame`:","21cca359":"Every SQL statement beings with `SELECT`. The asterisk (`*`) is a wildcard character, meaning \"everything\", and `FROM fires` tells the database we want only the data from the `fires` table specifically.\n\nAnd, out the other end, data:","72c1889a":"And finally, to output to a SQL database, supply the name of the table in the database we want to throw the data into, and a connector:","8abbcdf4":"As you can see in this example, Excel files are often not formatted as well as CSV files are. Spreadsheets allow (and encourage) creating notes and fields which are human-readable, but not machine-readable.\n\nSo before we can use this particular dataset, we will need to clean it up a bit. We will see how to do so in the next section.\n\nFor now, let's move on to another common data format: SQL files.\n\nSQL databases are where most of the data on the web ultimately gets stored. They can be used to store data on things as simple as recipes to things as complicated as \"almost everything on the Kaggle website\".\n\nConnecting to a SQL database requires a lot more thought than reading from an Excel file. For one, you need to create a **connector**, something that will handle siphoning data from the database.\n\n`pandas` won't do this for you automatically because there are many, many different types of SQL databases out there, each with its own connector. So for a SQLite database (the only kind supported on Kaggle), you would need to first do the following (using the `sqlite3` library that comes with Python):","527de1b2":"Let's look at a few more datatypes you're likely to encounter.\n\nFirst up, the venerable Excel spreadsheet.
