Woodson and the prominent minister Jesse E. Moorland founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH), an organization dedicated to researching and promoting achievements by Black Americans and other peoples of African descent.\"\n\n\"Known today as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), the group sponsored a national Negro History week in 1926, choosing the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. The event inspired schools and communities nationwide to organize local celebrations, establish history clubs and host performances and lectures.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.history.com\/topics\/black-history\/black-history-month","29c43299":"#Selma Burke: Reexamining the Dime\n\n\"Many credit Selma Burke for the design, including Roosevelt\u2019s son and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Burke\u2019s portrait, which she spent two years working on, is only recognized as an inspiration and model for the final image used on the dime.\"\n\n\"Selma Hortense Burke is a Black American sculptor who was born on December 31, 1900, in Mooresville, North Carolina. She grew up in a large family, the seventh of 10 children of Rev. Neil and Mary Elizabeth Colfield Burke. As a child, she often played with riverbed clay near her home and loved how the clay felt. Inspired by her maternal grandmother, who was a painter, Burke\u2019s adoration of sculpture grew. As an adult, she earned several degrees and awards, and traveled internationally, studying in France, Germany, and Austria. While in Paris, Burke worked under Henri Matisse, whom she credits as one of her many influences. When she returned to the States due to the threat of Nazis, she created the image of FDR that\u2019s engraved on the U.S. dime.\"\n\n![](https:\/\/blog.gale.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/SelmaBurke.jpg)https:\/\/blog.gale.com\/tag\/black-history-month\/","c605ef5d":"#Fannie Lou Hamer: Papers of a Civil Rights Activist, Political Activist, and Woman\n\n\"Hamer was the daughter of sharecroppers and spent 18 years of her adult life as a sharecropper and timekeeper on the Dee Marlow plantation in Sunflower County, Mississippi. She was fired in 1962 because of her attempt to register to vote. The following year, Hamer became a registered voter and the field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. She was instrumental in starting the Delta Ministry and was one of the founders of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Hamer led a delegation to the Democratic National Convention in 1964. Additional achievements include founding the Freedom Farm Corporation in 1969, becoming a founding member of the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus in 1971, running for Mississippi State Senate in 1971 (read about her platform), and being a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1972.\"\n\n![](https:\/\/blog.gale.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Add-a-heading-2.png)https:\/\/blog.gale.com\/tag\/black-history-month\/"}}
