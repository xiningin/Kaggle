He was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent an incandescent light bulb. In fact, some historians claim there were over 20 inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison\u2019s version. However, Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors: an effective incandescent material, a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bulbs.com\/learning\/history.aspx","edb2c86c":"![](https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/3a61d0_065b2f775fc44e5ab4efc129af70671c~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_392,h_260,al_c,lg_1,q_80\/Uncle%20Scrooge%20%2316%2C%20Dec_-Feb_%201957%20Gyro%202.webp)flyingcarsandfoodpills.com","9e33243a":"#Be prepared to catch your imaginations, Dataset by Sasha Quinn.","ba7bc9d9":"#Are you ready?

However, he continued to test several types of material for metal filaments to improve upon his original design and by Nov 4, 1879, he filed another U.S. patent for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected ... to platina contact wires.\"\n\nAlthough the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using \"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways,\" it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last over 1200 hours.\n\nThis discovery marked the beginning of commercially manufactured light bulbs and in 1880, Thomas Edison\u2019s company, Edison Electric Light Company begain marketing its new product.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bulbs.com\/learning\/history.aspx","ef3b687d":"#Codes by Naim Mhedhbi https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/naim99\/data-augmentation-techniques","40277f28":"#Dataset Author: Sasha Quinn @sashaquinn\n\nProbably Sasha will understand the Kaggle Notebook Title."}}
