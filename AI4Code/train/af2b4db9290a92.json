This is not because they are better months; our dataset does not contain 2019's October, November, and December months (they hadn't happened yet). We will instead need to come up with an average accident count by the number of years on record.","08049454":"# Some Further Analysis of My Local Area (Golden Triangle Area)\nLet's go a little further and explore the data with particular focus on the area right in my local area in San Diego.","98c84c01":"## 3.

This was right behind right behind Richmond, CA, Riverside, CA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Sacramento, CA (which was ranked the worst). This came as a huge surprise to many readers.\n\nIn this module, we will do some basic analysis\/visualizations to explore the public dataset<sup>[2]<\/sup> of Traffic Collisions in San Diego since 2017, which is maintained by the city of San Diego's Transportation Department. This was of particular interest to me since the dataset is of my local area and could provide some interesting insights given what I know about the dynamic changes in San Diego. While there is a slight risk of outcome bias, I believe having domain knowledge here would only help to either validate the results or challenge my current understanding of the local area.\n\n## Table of Contents\n* [Basic Exploratory Analysis and Questions](#section-one)\n* [Most Common Violations Related to Traffic Collisions](#section-two)\n* [Most Dangerous Violations](#section-three)\n* [Traffic Collision Frequency by Day of the Week, Month, and Season](#section-four)\n* [Traffic Collision Frequency by Time of Day](#section-five)\n* [Traffic Collision Frequency by Geography](#section-six)\n* [Conclusion & Looking Forward](#section-seven)\n\n<sub><a name=\"myfootnote1\">1<\/a>: QuoteWizard's Methodology used the weighted means calculated from these parameters of two million data points of its users: Accidents, Speeding tickets, DUIs, and Citations (https:\/\/quotewizard.com\/news\/posts\/the-best-and-worst-drivers-by-city)<\/sub>\n\n<sub><a name=\"myfootnote2\">2<\/a>: The dataset can be obtained at https:\/\/data.sandiego.gov\/datasets\/police-collisions\/<\/sub>\n","6e118afb":"## 1.
