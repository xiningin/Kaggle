An input function is a function that returns a tf.data.Dataset object which outputs the following two-element tuple:\n* features - A Python dictionary in which:<br>\nEach key is the name of a feature.<br>\nEach value is an array containing all of that feature's values.<br>\n* label - An array containing the values of the label for every example.<br>\n\nThere are two ways to create input functions. first use ***tf.estimator.inputs.***  you can either pick pandas_input_fn or numpy_input_fn <br>\nSecond build your own input function. Input functions must return a mapping of the feature columns to the tensors that contains the data for the feature columns along with labels.","c78676da":"First thing we need is an estimator. You may either use the pre-made Estimators tensorflow provides or write your own  Estimators.

The sum of those output predictions will be 1.0. For example, the prediction on an unlabeled example might be something like the following:\n* 0.03 for Iris Setosa\n* 0.95 for Iris Versicolor\n* 0.02 for Iris Virginica <br>\nThe preceding prediction indicates a 95% probability that the given unlabeled example is an Iris Versicolor.","593a751a":"# Instantiate an estimator\nFortunately, TensorFlow provides several pre-made classifier Estimators.
