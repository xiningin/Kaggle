Summary of the calculations:\n\nThe sum, the average, the max and min value, and the trips per day on the distance and duration of the rides.\n","d718f516":"# Phase 1 \u2013 ASK\n## Key objectives:\n**1-Identify the business task:**\n\nThe company wants to improve their earnings converting their casual riders into annual members because they are more profitable. To reach this goal, we need to analyze in what aspects the two identified kinds of users differ, to be able to create a focused and successful marketing message to the casual customers in order for them to change to the annual subscription. So, in one phrase it would be:\n\nWhat can we do to motivate the users to change from casual subscription to annual subscription?\n\n**2- Consider key stakeholders:**\n\nMain stakeholders: Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and my manager, and the Cyclistic executive team.\n\nSecondary stakeholders: the rest of the marketing analytics team","3bb6fe30":"# Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?","56b3edef":"# Phase 2 \u2013 PREPARE\n## Key objectives:\n**1-Download data and store it appropriately**\n\nThe data used in the project is all the 2020 trip data.\n* Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1\n* 202004-divvy-tripdata\n* 202005-divvy-tripdata\n* 202006-divvy-tripdata\n* 202007-divvy-tripdata\n* 202008-divvy-tripdata\n* 202009-divvy-tripdata\n* 202010-divvy-tripdata\n* 202011-divvy-tripdata\n* 202012-divvy-tripdata\n\n**2-Identify how it is organized**\n\nThe data is organized in 13 columns and approximately 3.39 million rows.\n\n**3-Sort and filter the data.**\n\nIn this analysis, I'm going to focus on the 2020 period as it's the most recent period where we have the data from a whole year, and so we can compare it with future years. \n\n**4-Determine the credibility of the data**\n\nThe data is public from a fictional bike sharing company called \u201cCyclistic\u201d. It starts from 2013 until September 2021. The naming convention is the same in all the files, because some of them is organized by year, quarter or month. On the other hand, the data seems to be good, reliable, comprehensive and it\u2019s first-party data collected by the company itself. The data has qualitative and quantitative formats.","7a3d3c92":"# Phase 3 \u2013 PROCESS\n## Key objectives:\n**1-Check the data for errors**\n\nI cannot see any error\n\n**2-Choose your tools**\n\nI\u2019m going to use SQL for the Cleaning and Analyze process and Tableau to make the viz. for the Sharing process.\n\n**3-Transform the data so you can work with it effectively**\n\nAll imported in the DB Browser (SQLite).\n\n**4-Document the cleaning process**\n\nNow I can start to clean the data of possible errors like deleting all the NULL values. In addition, I will add useful new columns based on calculations of already existing columns in order to facilitate our analysis and arrive at more insightful conclusions.","8927bd14":"# Phase 5 \u2013 SHARE\n## Key objectives:\n\n**1-Determine the best way to share your findings** \n\nTo make the viz I have chosen Tableau\n\n**2-Create effective data visualizations**\n\nI have decided to create the following visualizations:\n-Number of rides grouped by month and by day of the week by user type\n-Average time and distance by user type\n-Number of rides grouped by day by user type and bike type\n\n**3-Present your findings** \n\nTo present my findings I have chosen Google Presentations. You can find the final result **[HERE](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1-W0WErICYOC2aFaU2lhP7XbpT2kkeuYIDDBILigH88o\/edit#slide=id.p)**\n\n**4-Share My Conclusions**\n* Focus the marketing campaigns between June and September \n* The Casual users have leisure, and tourism rides mostly on weekends. The Annual\/Member users have commute rides, during all week, so their behavior is different.\n* The Casual users are more likely to take the electric bike rather than the Annual\/Member users.\n* I would suggest that in order to convert the casual to the annual users it would be interesting to focus the messages on people that uses the bike in a more leisure or commute way, depending on whether you want casual or annual users. Maybe offer some kind of promotion related to weekends and\/or electric bikes if you aim for casual users."}}
