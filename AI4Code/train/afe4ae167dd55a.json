This is also better going forward as newer generations will be more reliant on technology. It was observed that the category of people with a teen in their home had higher number of purchases through the web in total.\n\nSince most of our Customers are from spain, it might be advisable to develop new marketing strategies that will appeal to the English speaking locals from Canada or South Africa as they are the next most dominant category.\n\nThe recent campaign was the most successful campaign, so it's formula can be repeated with minor variations to hopefully obtain similar results in the future.","97e249ee":"### There are 24 null values present in total.\n\n### Now the next question is what do we do with missing data?

Let's rename the column and remove the spaces to avoid confusion later on.","605e49c9":"## Section 2: Statistical Analysis\n\nThe number of store purchases is lightly related to the number of children in the house. If a customer has kids, their overall spending is reduced, which also reduces the number of store purchases. If there are teens in the house, the number of store purchases are reduced slightly. Other factors which is strongly related is the Income. Higher income customers have higher spending power, which can be seen through more amount spent on products from different categories.\n\nWe saw that almost half of our customer base was from Spain, while the remaining small portion was from South Africa and Canada and other countries.\n\nWe observed that people purchase products through stores regardless of their purchases on Gold Products.\n\nWe also observed that being married or having a PhD has no relation with the customer's spending on Fish Products. The factors that are actually somewhat related to spending on fish products are the customer's income and whether they are vegetarian. This is because people who spend on meat\/fish are likely to also spend on the other. Whereas people who do not consume meat of any form will not consume fish either and vice versa.\n\nFinally we learnt that geographical reason does matter when it comes to success of a campaign. Since half of our customer base is form Spain, all of the campaigns have been exceedingly popular in Spain while not having as much of an impact in the other countries.","bf5624ad":"As seen above, we have dropped all null values. Now let's boxplot all the numeric columns to see any possible outliers.","d718a390":"### To summarize our above findings, our average customer's profile looks like the one below:\n\n* Is 40-50 years old\n* Married\n* Has 1 kid\/teen in their family\n* Graduate\n* Earns somewhere between \\\\$20,000 and \\\\$80,000\n* From Spain","ed14b67e":"From the above heatmap, we can roughly estimate that the Number of Store Purchases values are strongly related to:\n\n'Income','MntWines', 'MntFruits','MntMeatProducts', 'MntFishProducts', 'MntSweetProducts','MntGoldProds','NumWebPurchases','NumCatalogPurchases'\n\n\nApart from that, we can also see that the number of Store purchases is inversely related to the number of Web Visits. Possible explanation for this could be:\n\nScenario 1: An old fashioned customer visits a store to find an item that they want. Even if they don't find what they want, they may discover something that they like along the way. People tend to not leave a store empty handed out of courtesy or out of personal guilt. \n\n\nScenario 2: A customer visits the webpage and does a quick search for what they like to purchase. If they don't find anything they like, they can simply close the webpage and carry on without feeling guilty.","90c4df84":"# Section 2: Statistical Analysis\n\n\n### Question: What factors are significantly related to the number of store purchases?","728e5a44":"From the above two representations of the data, we can see that, people who have spent a lot on gold products have a varied number of store purchases. These purchases have a wider range from 3 to 12 total purchases. Therefore, Gold Puchases and StorePurchases are proven to not have a strong correlation.","30c961c4":"The Income of the person in general affects the spending of the person on all kinds of products. But the effect is stronger in case of meat and wines as both of these products can be expensive. \n\nAnother thing to note is that, people can be vegetarians or non-vegetarians. Hence people who spend on meat products are the ones who will more likely spend on fish products as well.","7acf180c":"The most underperforming channel is Catalogue purchasing. This could be because Catalogue purchasing is quite old-fashioned in today's time. This could be because older generations prefer going to the store to purchase items, while newer generations prefer the internet to browse and shop for items. Hence the most popular mode would either be in store or via the web.\n\nPreviously, we have seen that our average consumer is 40-50 years old. Hence it is normal to expect that this customer segment is not reliant on the internet for shopping. This can be seen through the above graph, as the maximum number of purchases are made in store.","c0bb57c9":"First let's retrieve the list of all numeric columns","794fc881":"From the above graph we can see that the highest number of Purchases were made from Spain,followed by South Africa and Canada. Therefore, the answer to our question is No.","289d229f":"On the contrary, when the kids grow up till they're teenagers, the number of kids at home does not affect the spending done on items by a big margin.\n\n\nAlso, we can observe, that, when there is a teenager in the house, the number of web purchases have slightly increased. Whereas, the number of store purchases and catalogue purchases have sligntly descreased.","9224fe3b":"The latest campaign was the most successful one out of the bunch. However, historically speaking, Campaign 3 was the most successful, followed by Campign 4 then Campaign 5 and finally Campaign 1.\n\nCampaign 2 can be seen as a failure.","4bd78129":"The rest of the data as we can see is within the acceptable range.
