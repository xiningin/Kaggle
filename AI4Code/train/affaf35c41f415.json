crowdsources career advice for underserved youth. Founded in 2011 in four classrooms in New York City, the platform has now served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners. The platform uses a Q&A style similar to StackOverflow or Quora to provide students with answers to any question about any career.\n\n### Problem\n\nCareerVillage.org, in partnership with Google.org, requests a method for recommending questions to appropriate volunteers\n\nThe U.S. has almost 500 students for every guidance counselor. Underserved youth lack the network to find their career role models, making CareerVillage.org the only option for millions of young people in America and around the globe with nowhere else to turn.\n\nTo date, 25,000 volunteers have created profiles and opted in to receive emails when a career question is a good fit for them. This is where your skills come in. To help students get the advice they need, the team at CareerVillage.org needs to be able to send the right questions to the right volunteers. The notifications sent to volunteers seem to have the greatest impact on how many questions are answered.\n\n### Data\n                                           \n\n#### Reviewing the Data \nBefore starting the review proces, I import the relevant libraries for the review process\n","165f8c22":"from the top 20, it looks like all the professionals are located in the US.
