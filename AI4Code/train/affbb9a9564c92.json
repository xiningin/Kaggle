These outcomes are the two values of the binomial discrete\nrandom variable. A basic example of a binomial distribution is the repeated toss of a\ncoin. Each toss results in only two outcomes: Heads or Tails.\n\nThe following are the characteristics of a binomial distribution:\n1. There are `n` identical trials\n2. Each trial results in either one of only two possible outcomes\n3. The outcomes of one trial independent from the outcomes of other\n   trials\n4. The probability of success `(p)` and failure `(q)` is the same for each\n   trial\n5. The random variable represents the number of successes in these\n   `n` trials and can at most be equal to`n`\n6. The mean and variance of the binomial distribution are as follows:\n\n   `Mean` = `n*p` (number of trials*probability of success)\n   \n   `Variance` = `n*p*q` (number of trials*probability of\n   success*probability of failure)\n\nThe PMF, or the probability of `r` successes in `n` attempts of an experiment, is given by the\nfollowing equation:\n![Formula](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/BQHsqmfP\/image.png)\n\n\nWhere `p` is the probability of success, `q` is the probability of failure, and `n` is the number\nof trials.\n\nShape of Binomial distribution:\n![binom](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rsg2RwMd\/image.png)\n\nQuestion: The metro rail company surveys eight senior citizens traveling in a subway\ntrain about their satisfaction with the new safety features introduced in the subway\ntrains. Each response has only two values: yes or no. Let us assume that the probability\nof a \u201cyes\u201d response is 0.6, and the probability of a \u201cno\u201d response is 0.4 based on historical\nsurvey.\nCalculate the probability that\n1. Exactly three people are satisfied with the metro\u2019s new safety\n   features\n2. Fewer than five people are satisfied\n\nSolution:\n1. For part 1 of the question: We can either use previous formula\n   or solve it using a Scipy function (stats.binom.pmf), as shown in\n   the following:"}}
