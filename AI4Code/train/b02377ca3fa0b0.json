We will combine all the above three models to make a Hybrid model. \n\n### This method averages the individual predictions to form a final prediction. It is a fair approach to balance between bias and variance in the composite models. This technique also supports weight assignment to each component model, but it may lead to bias over one model, losing the benefits of generalization.\n\n###  Hybrid Regression is actually a VotingRegressor algorithm in sklearn module. A voting regressor is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits several base regressors, each on the whole dataset. Then it averages the individual predictions to form a final prediction.","899d2d79":"### Through visualization and statistical findings; most features have a very small p-value which indicates the null hypothesis is true. Or in other\u00a0words, they are highly significant.\n\n### Though the correlation is weak for most of the features, but due to dealing with a large sample and keep in mind the p-values, they can be statistically significant.\n\n### Therefore we will pick all the 19 independent features in the dataset to predict the housing prices as did by the researcher.","00e561f7":"## 2.3.1 Random Forest Classifier","6c63d98c":"### The algorithms are dealing with two types of methods, Regression and Classification. As we are predicting prices, it means we will go for regression models. \u00a0We will select five different algorithms such as \"Random Forest\", \"Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)\", \"Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)\", \"Hybrid Regression\" and \"Stacked Generalization\". The purpose of selecting more than one algorithm is to verify the accuracy across each model to ensure good predicting results.\n\n### After predicting results, the evaluation is a must to put a stamp on your work. We will use the \"Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)\" evaluation technique to check the results. \n\n### RMSLE is robust to outliers. It only considers the relative error between the Predicted and the actual value, and the scale of the error is not significant. RMSLE incurs a larger penalty for the underestimation of the Actual variable than the Overestimation. In simple words, more penalty is incurred when the predicted value is less than the Actual Value. On the other hand, a Less penalty is incurred when the predicted value is more than the actual value.","f81d2176":"### 2. \"Lat\" Latitude of the House","a5b19c69":"### It is clear from the above figure that both prices are directly proportional.

That's why we have to check the correlation as well as the p-value between the target feature \"price\" and all the other features.\n\n### The statistical Analysis provides the statistical significance of any feature (the independent variables) for the target or dependent variable. \n\n### In statistics, \"the p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results of a statistical hypothesis test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. A smaller p-value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis\".\n\n\n### P-Value is the threshold to check the significance. If P-value < 0.01 or 0.05 or 0.1 (99% or 95% or 90% Significance Levels ) of any independent variable, it is become statistically significant to affect the outcome. In our case, any statistically significant variable will affect the Housing Price. \n\n### There are mathematical (Stats library SciPy) and visualization (Heat Map) ways to determine the p-value and the correlation like strong, modest, or weak relation either positive or negative relationship with the predicted variables.","0fc99e62":"## 2.3.2 Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)","e99387d5":"### Features Selection","02391127":"### 7. \"followers\" Number of Followers","82b57627":"### In recent years, due to the growing trend towards Big Data, machine learning has become a vital prediction approach because it can predict house prices more accurately based on their attributes, regardless of the data from previous years.
