used by people of different personalities. Finding the distinctions were facilitated by the implementation of a selection of natural language processing tasks. The tasks included punctuation adjustments, labeling of similar entities such as twitter handles, webpage links, and emoticons, and the removal of \"common words with little meaning\" (stopwords).Taking the document frequency of words into account during vectorization helped to increase the importance of words that might be of more relevance.\n\nAs the word feature space were large, the employment of Logistic Regression models, that is capable of feature selection through regularization, proved successful. The Logistic Regression models for each personality type category generalized to unseen test data. It provided predictive capability beyond that of predicting the majority class, and afforded an accuracy across predictions of 86%.\n","46f64701":"## Kaggle test output","33fa8467":"Optimal 'C' values for each personality category was found to be as follows:\n- Mind: 4\n- Energy: 5\n- Nature: 5\n- Tactics: 3\n\nThese hyperparameter settings resulted in an average log loss of around 0.34 across the different personality type categories. In addition, for the respective categories, the log loss on the training and test sets were within 1.5-fold of each other. Thus, the models are not overfitting the training data and we can expect them to be able to generalize to unseen data.\nAn average accuracy score of around 86% were achieved across the models. Individually, the models also perform better than predicting the majority class of each personality category.","80c9506e":"## TfidfVectorizer","385d7c44":"With the processed and cleaned posts, we can explore and visualize some of the word tokens.","2bc8fcff":"*Reveal and run the code below to import and download nltk libraries*","75d2aed2":"Looking at the breakdown of posts between the categories, we can again see that imbalanced classes. The biggest difference is between I and E, and S and N. As an exercise, not shown in this notebook, we have investigated both resampling with replacement, as well as sampling subsets, in order to equal out the number of posts across categories. This can be done using the sklearn.utils.resample function. However, we have found that resampling does not enhance model performance for any of the categories.\n\nWe can see that the average number of use of selected characters and tags vary between categories. From observation, not statistically speaking, we note the following:\n- Emoticons: Intuitive, feeling, and judging personalities respectively tend to use more emoticons that their sensing, thinking, and perceiving counterparts.\n- Webpage links: The biggest difference in the average number of webpage links posted is between introverts and extroverts.\n- Exclamation marks: Introverts vs. extroverts and feeling vs. thinking personalities show the biggest difference in average use of exclamation marks.\n- 'I': The average use of 'I' appears fairly similar across categories, with feeling personalities using 'I' slightly more.\n- Twitter handles: The biggest difference in the average use of twitter handles appears to be between extroverts and introverts, with introverts using less handles.\n\nAll in all, there do seem to be differences in the posts from different personality types. We can thus proceed use the posts to create vectors and explore classification models. ","2d00f09a":"The scoring metric used for model evaluation in the Kaggle competition is the average log loss across the four personality categories. Log loss for a binary prediction is calculated as follows:\n\nlog loss = -(y\\log(p) + (1 - y)\\log(1 - p))\n\nwhere:\n- y: true class (i.e. 0 or 1)\n- p: predicted probability\n- log: natural logarithm\n\nLog loss thus takes the uncertainty of the prediction into account (http:\/\/wiki.fast.ai\/index.php\/Log_Loss).\n\nSince the scoring metric used requires the probability of predicting a class, we opted to investigate various classification models that are based on probability predictions to make class assignments. These include Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests. We found that Logistic Regression performed the best on the task at hand. Therefore, we will henceforth only discuss our implementation of Logistic Regression. However, with the standardized way of implementing models using sklearn libraries, it should be noted that the code below can easily be tailored to investigate all the aforementioned models. \n","9185bfe7":"In order to turn a sequence of words of type string into a vector, we need to convert each sequence into a list of word units or tokens. There are various ways to go about it, such as to split the string on white spaces of example. As we are dealing with twitter posts, we decided to use the TweetTokenizer within the natural language toolkit (nltk) library to perform word tokenization. The TweetTokenizer will preserve emoticons when splitting string sequences into tokens.\n\nWe will also employ the nltk library, WordNetLemmatizer, to transform the word tokens to their corresponding root words (i.e. their lemma or dictionary form).

However, we resorted to use the emoji library to facilitate the transformations with more ease.\n\nSome of the emoticons found in the posts are as follows:\n\n\ud83c\udf39 \ud83c\udf44 \ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\udc48 \ud83d\udc4b \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udc93 \ud83d\udc96 \ud83d\udc9b \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd5a \ud83d\ude00 \ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude03 \ud83d\ude04 \ud83d\ude05 \ud83d\ude06 \ud83d\ude07 \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\ude0b \ud83d\ude0c \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\ude0e \ud83d\ude0f \ud83d\ude10 \ud83d\ude13 \ud83d\ude15 \ud83d\ude18 \ud83d\ude1c \ud83d\ude1d \ud83d\ude1e \ud83d\ude21 \ud83d\ude22 \ud83d\ude23 \ud83d\ude27 \ud83d\ude2b \ud83d\ude2c \ud83d\ude2e \ud83d\ude31 \ud83d\ude33 \ud83d\ude34 \ud83d\ude3a \ud83d\ude4b \ud83e\udd13 \ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd17 \ud83e\udd84 \u270c \u270d \u2728\n\n","90bf008f":"## Finer hyperparameter search with an isolated test set","a73666a0":"## Text cleaning and processing","6161126e":"Logistic regression in sklearn facilitate L1 regularization when the liblinear solver in used.

Using Logistic Regression with the liblinear solver and L1 regularization then leaves the hyperparameter 'C' to be tuned. 'C' controls the amount of regularization, such that a smaller value for 'C' enforce greater regularization. \n\nWe will use the sklearn GridSearchCV function to automatically search through a specified list of values for 'C'. As GridSearchCV maximizes the scoring metric, the negative log loss will be used. Log loss will thus in effect be minimized. The average negative log loss across four-fold cross-validation will be used for comparing the different values of 'C'.\n\nAs the different personality type categories have different distributions, and are in essence different binary classification problems, the hyperparameter 'C' will be tuned for each category separately.","f3cd65b0":"To perform the same cleaning and processing on both the training set posts and the test set posts, we will define functions for specific tasks.

As such, it will \"penalize\" the term frequency according to the inverse document frequency and give more weight to less frequent, but important terms (tokens). \n\nIn addition to the word tokens, we would also like to capture some phrase context. We therefore also investigated the inclusion of bigrams and trigrams in the vector (not shown). The inclusion of bigrams was found to provided the better predictive capability.
