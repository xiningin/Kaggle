(The two far right columns below). Many kickers that one would expect to see at the top are indeed at the top. \n\nThis stat may be more informative if it only used data from 1980 or so to the present. \n\n(Obvious note, but the averages used here include each kicker's own stats. For example, when computing the field goals above average for Adam Vinatieri, the overall field goal accuracy used includes Vinatieri's own stats.)","bd40aec8":"We can see that, for the most part, field goal accuracy has steadily gone up since 1966. It would be interesting to dig into this a bit more. Perhaps less long distance field goals are being attempted. Or perhaps kickers have just gotten better. ","ed29778f":"Throughout these files, something like '_A' means attempted and '_M' means made. 'PSs' is seasons participated in. 'Team' is a string contains the acronym for the team they played for, for each year. ","48269273":"Welcome to a quick kernel showcasing some of the data of my NFL Kickers dataset and some quick analysis of NFL kickers!","a906f3d0":"Well hopefully this helps! In the future I may link a module that I'm working on to analyze this data. As of now it has some helper functions to directly read in the data from a particular year, or to combine any sequence of years. ","b58c0c2c":"Now it's time to load in the combined data for the regular season (there's obviously more data, so I find it's usually more interesting).","413089e2":"As a grand finale (for now), let's plot the field goal accuracy for each year. ","21180fab":"Now we'll calculate the field goal and extra point accuracies for the entirety of kicks from the 1966-2019 seasons. The sums for each column are also shown (except for Long, which doesn't make sense to sum up for now). ","4335c64a":"Here's a similar stat as above, except it's now for accuracy on 50+ yard field goals. A lot of similar names show up in the top 10, minus Adam Vinatiera. As for Matt Prater, being nearly 14 50+ field goals above average is especially impressive considering he only attempted 69 such field goals. ","7165fe3c":"First, we'll load the csv that contains the combined data for all playoff games from 1966-2019 (not including the Super Bowl for the 2019 season). "}}
