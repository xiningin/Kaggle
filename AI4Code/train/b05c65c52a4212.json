It is found mainly in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. This article discusses the test to measure the amount of CPK in the blood. Blood is drawn from a vein (venipuncture), usually from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand\n\nHypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels.","188350b3":"# **Machine Learning**","49bf8202":"![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/f1Kast5.png)","77549ca5":"**Understanding Terms**\n* Anemia happens when the number of healthy red blood cells in your body is too low. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all of the body\u2019s tissues, so a low red blood cell count indicates that the amount of oxygen in your blood is lower than it should be.\n\n* When the total CPK level is very high, it most often means there has been injury or stress to muscle tissue, the heart, or the brain. Muscle tissue injury is most likely. When a muscle is damaged, CPK leaks into the bloodstream. Finding which specific form of CPK is high helps determine which tissue has been damaged.\n\n* Ejection fraction (EF) is a measurement, expressed as a percentage, of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction. An ejection fraction of 60 percent means that 60 percent of the total amount of blood in the left ventricle is pushed out with each heartbeat.\n\n* Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.Too many platelets can lead to certain conditions, including stroke, heart attack, or a clot in the blood vessels. There are two types of thrombocytosis: primary and secondary.\n\n* Creatinine is a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles of the body. Everyone has creatinine in their bloodstream.A high serum creatinine level means that your kidneys aren't working well.","87920ae4":"# Heart Failure Prediction","92ba06b2":"Finding outliers"}}
