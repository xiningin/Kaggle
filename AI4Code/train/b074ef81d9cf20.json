","e3da7837":"In the below graph, we're looking at the total price received by week and cuisine. It's interesting to see that there is such a large discrepancy between the Continental cuisine and the rest of the cuisine's, when it come to the total base_price sold. It would seems the higher priced meals (pizza and seafood) fall under the Continental cuisine. In addition, we can see that total base price drops around the same time among all of the cuisine's (The percentage drops are different among all of the cuisine's).","0ff6c60b":"## Data Preparation ##\nIn this section I will be dropping some columns that will no longer be required and normalized.","aebc72f6":"After looking at the price, I wanted to take a look at which categories were the leading the overall number of order. For the graph, I thought it would be reasonable to look at the weekly sales of the top 6 number of orders. The lower cost items were the leaders for the number of orders, with Pizza being the lone higher priced item that made it into the top 6. ","9eb04c66":"Next, I just wanted to show the average base price of each of the meals. Seafood, Fish and Pizza have the highest price among the meals\/categories.","38f8002e":"# Introduction #\nRestaurants are constantly looking for ways to cut costs while continue to serve food with the same quality. You can do this by finding efficiencies in labour, production or raw materials. In this project, we will look at a dataset to determine whether we can run a model to more accurately predict when people will order a certain item. If it is completed effectively, this will allow the restaurant to do more accurate purchases. This help save costs by reducing waste and finding sales when making required purchases to meet the demand.","f0f38c79":"The next graphs that are presented a violin plot showing the density in the Checkout Price by a Promotion on a certain item and whether it has been Featured on the HomePage. In both cases when there was a promotion or featured on the HomePage (1), are mostly congregated around 300 and 500.  ","85bfde36":"## EDA ##\nFirst off I will look at a breakdown of the number unique id's (This can have multiple order per id) broken down by the cuisine. We can see that Beverages are clearly sold the most. In general, beverages would be seen as cheaper than full meals so we would expect to see higher sales of this. The rest of the meals are relatively evenly spread.","c5d8f8d7":"In order to present a more normally distributed base and checkout price, I took the log of each of the columns.","f523410f":"## Conclusion ##\nAlthough the decision tree regressor provides a much higher R squared value (accuracy) than the other models, but this would probably be unacceptable for any restaurant to use for determining the number of orders. With an accuracy slightly above 70%, it may be result in some more accurate predictions for future orders, but it may give the user too much confidence in the model. This could result in under investment in the food required, which may not be enough for the demand. When customers start losing trust in a restaurant, it can result in a lot of lost sales in the future.\n","99487345":"## Models ##\nI chose to run a couple different linear models, a decision tree and the support vector regressor. After running the linear regression, lasso, SGD Regression and support vector regression model, they resulted in an R sqaured value lower than 50%. The decision tree provides an R squared value of over 70%. "}}
