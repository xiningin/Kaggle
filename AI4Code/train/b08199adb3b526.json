A large number of immigrants have caused rents to rise in Ireland, especially in the Dublin area. \n\nA lot of large companies are established in Dublin (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Huawei, TikTok etc), so Dublin may be the best place to live in Ireland, no matter work or study. Dublin has Trinity College (TCD), University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin City University (DCU) and Dublin University of Technology (TU Dublin) and other universities that attract a large number of students to study. In this context, it becomes very difficult for someone who has been to Dublin in the future to find a suitable house. As an international student studying in Ireland, my requirement for a house is to keep the rent as low as possible under safe conditions. Therefore, in this notebook, I will mainly use the rental data collected on Daft.ie to explore where to rent a house, and appropriately introduce my rental experience in Dublin.\n\n**If you just like me two years ago, are someone who knows little about Dublin and is desperate to find a suitable house in Dublin real property market, I hope this Notebook can help you.**\n\n**The map and final conclusion in the bottom, you can scroll down to bottom.**","0401a785":"### 2.2 \"rental_per_room\" distribution","6ed7abef":"## 3.Maps\n\n3.1 clean \"longitude\" and \"latitude\" columns\n\n3.2 **Parish areas** in Dublin city\n\n3.3 Demonstrate mean rental(per room) for each parish area(**Map**)","54242ab1":"There are 158 real properties with 0 bedroom.","ff33e014":"### 2.4 mean value & median value","e88cf386":"#### 2.3.1 Three Sigma rule(if data in normal distribution)\n\nThree sigma rule\uff1aOn the premise that the data conforms to the normal distribution, 95% of the observations are distributed within two standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% are distributed within three standard deviations.

We can clearly find the most expensive areas in Dalkey and Marley Grange (2265 euro-2481 euro). The rents in most parish areas adjacent to these two areas are also very expensive. But what is interesting is that I found that the rents in Sallynoggin and Johnstown next to Dalkey are relatively low (755 euro-971 euro). If you go to school at UCD, I think Sallynoggin and Johnstown may be very good choices. In addition, Milltown has lower rents than surrounding areas. At the same time, Milltown is closer to the city center. If your company or school is in the city center, Milltown may be a good choice.\n\n**My experience:**\n\nAs I mentioned before, I used to live in Grangegorman, Warrenmount and Ranelagh. Rent prices in Grangegorman and Warremount are relatively low. Ranelagh's life impressed me deeply. I think Ranelagh is one of the most livable areas in Dublin. There are many supermarkets, coffe shops and pubs, which are very convenient for both life and entertainment. But the rent is relatively high.\n\n","a8d89ca1":"### 1.1 Import dataset"}}
