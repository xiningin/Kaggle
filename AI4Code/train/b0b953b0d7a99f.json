The other two who died in the accidents were pedestrians.\n\nThe Spokesman said nearly 10 people killed daily in road accidents since last week.\n\nThe police spokesman said that special police operations are underway to arrest drunk drivers and reckless drivers.\" These accidents therefore are the result of driving under the influence of alchohol, reckless driving.

Over the course of a year, **men represented 71 percent of casualties** while women accounted for 29 percent.
