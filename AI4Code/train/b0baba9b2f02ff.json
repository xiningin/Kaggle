Gradient Boosted Classifier\n\nGradient Boosting is also an ensemble technique much like the Random Forest where a combination of weak Tree learners are brought together to form a relatively stronger learner.

Therefore as the name suggests, the algorithm used to minimise the loss function is that of a gradient descent method which adds decision trees which \"point\" in the direction that reduces our loss function (downward gradient).\n\nTo set up a Gradient Boosting classifier is easy enough in Sklearn and it involves only a handful of lines of code. Again we first set up our classifier's parameters\n\n**Initialising Gradient Boosting Parameters** \n\nIn general there are a handful of key parameter when setting up tree-based or gradient boosted models.

In the case that we have quite a lot of correlated features one could perhaps apply a technique such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space.","632af0d3":"Having identified which of our features contain categorical data, we can set about numerically encoding the data.

For one, more features could be engineered from the data.  Furthermore one could squeeze performance out of this pipeline by perhaps using some form of blending or stacking of models.

Random Forest Classifier \n\nThe Random Forest method, first introduced by Breiman in 2001 can be grouped under the category of ensemble models. Why ensemble? The building block of a Random Forest is the ubiquitous Decision Tree. The decision tree as a standalone model is often considered a \"weak learner\" as its predictive performance is relatively poor. However a Random Forest gathers a group (or ensemble) of decision trees and uses their combined predictive capabilities to obtain relatively strong predictive performance - \"strong learner\". \n\nThis principle of using a collection of \"weak learners\" to come together to create a \"strong learner\" underpins the basis of ensemble methods which one regularly comes across in Machine learning. For a really good read that drives home the basics of the Random Forest, refer to this [CitizenNet blog][1]\n\n\n  [1]: http:\/\/blog.citizennet.com\/blog\/2012\/11\/10\/random-forests-ensembles-and-performance-metrics","b1ed4452":"As evinced from the dataset, our target column with which we can point our model to train on would be the \"Attrition\" column. \n\nFurthermore, we see that we have a mix of numerical and categorical data types. For the categorical columns, we shall handle their numerical encoding in the latter chapter. This section will be devoted to data exploration and as a first step, let us quickly carry our some simple data completeness checks to see if there are nulls or infinite values in the data\n\n**Data quality checks**\n\nTo look for any null values, we can just invoke the **isnull** call as follows","505f9553":"**Accuracy of the model**\n\nAs observed, our Random Forest returns an accuracy of approx 88% for its predictions and on first glance this might seem to be a pretty good performing model. However when we think about how skewed our target variable where the distribution of yes and no's are 84% and 26%, therefore our model is only predicting slightly better than random guessing. \n\nIt would be more informative to balance out the precision and recall scores as show in the classification report outputs. Where it falls down to the business considerations over whether one should prioritise for a metric over the other - i.e. your Precision vs Recall."}}
