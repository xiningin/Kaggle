This shows that the variables that have the highest correlation ( avaue close to 1 or -1, 1 if positively correlated. -1 if negatively correlated) are the i and  host_id columns and the number_of_reviews and Reviews_per_month. This was expected as these columns refer to very similar things.\n\nIn this case, I am going to examine further the variables that are affecting the price. From the heatmap above none of the numerical values seem to have a high correlation with the proce. Therefore, the next step will will to understand whether the price is affected by the categorical values (neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room_type). However, before that I want to see what the expected valiability of the price is.","81d72a63":"The code below creats a heatmap, which gives information on variables that are highly correlated:"}}
