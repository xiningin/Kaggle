Conclusion\n\nWith all the excitement that comes with this revolutionary ML there are some who voiced concerns; particularly for the LIC, UMIC and LMIC to cope with the waves of change. HIC economies are looking set to invest and solidify their positions in riding the waves and be race-winners but the rest are not looking good if they are unable to capitalize on these waves. LI as well as middle income nations may no longer be able to count on low-cost manufacturing as their booster for rapid growth and likely struggle to \u2018add value\u2019 to ML.\n\nA threatening landscape of inequalities between nations and economies seems to be looming. The accelerated pace that the market leaders are at will create gaps. Therefore, there is a pressing need for policy-makers of all levels of economy to find a solution to this inevitable future.","94836a88":"## Profile of Respondents","bb91ac33":"## Results","0caa7445":"# Comparative Analysis on AI and ML between High Income Countries and Middle Income Countries","f8508392":"We are now looking at income group countries against yearly compensation group. Not very surprising that most of the respondents in Kaggler for HIC have high yearly compensation with more than 30,000 compared to other income group countries. For LMIC and UMIC, mostly their yearly compensations are less than 29,999 where LMIC is slightly higher than UMIC except for yearly compensation less than 999 where number of respondents for LMIC are 3 times higher than UMIC.","728ef4cf":"Overall, HIC, UMIC, and LMIC at least need to have Bachelors's degree for thier involvement in using ML and AI application. However, for HIC and UMIC their level of education is one step higher, which is Master's degree because we believe other than experience, level of educations also play a big role for one's to secure a job in the HIC and UMIC. ","ed69bb86":"## High and Middle Income Countries Definition\n\nAccording to the World Bank there are 4 income groups: low income, lower middle, upper middle and high. These groups are classed separately based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita in US Dollars (converted using the World Atlas Bank method). For 1st July 2019 until the following year; High Income Country (HIC) economies are countries with GNI per capita exceeding 12,376 while Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC) with GNI per capita ranging from 3,996 to 12,375 Lower Middle Income Country (LMIC) with GNI per capita ranging from 1,026 to 3,995.\n\nEconomic growth are driven by more than just a mere few factors, however, machine learning (ML) has caught attention of economists as a revolution that cannot be overlooked by policy-makers. A widely respected firm, PWC from the United Kingdom (UK) published \u201cThe economic impact of artificial intelligence on the UK economy\u201d in 2017 claiming that \u201cthere will be significant gains across all UK region as an impact from AI in 2030 at least as large as 5% of GDP, and extra spending power per household of up to \u00a31,800-\u00a32,300 a year by 2030\u201d. \n\nSpecifically, ML addresses the question of how to build computers that improve automatically through experience. It is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to keep built-in algorithms current by adapting to changes and new data - giving insightful, accurate information without human intervention or assistance. ML focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. Some examples would be online chatbots on businesses\u2019 websites, or social media services and targeted ads.\u00a0\n\nThe common point for economics and ML is that they are both driven by data. Albeit the process differ in many aspects, however, the goal is the same - efficiency. With that in mind, let\u2019s think about how ML can help the economy? Intuitively, and supported by the findings in their 2017 report by PWC UK - better productivity!","477400f4":"## Reference\n\n1. https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/research\/using-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence-to-accelerate-global-development\/\n\n2. https:\/\/carnegieendowment.org\/2019\/10\/02\/world-isn-t-ready-for-ai-to-upend-global-economy-pub-79961\n\n3. https:\/\/www.pwc.co.uk\/economic-services\/assets\/ai-uk-report-v2.pdf\n\n4. https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD?locations=MY\n\n5. https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/machine-learning.asp\n\n6. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Bank_high-income_economy#cite_note-worldbank1-4\n\n7. https:\/\/addepto.com\/machine-learning-in-economics-how-is-it-used\/\n","e710e8e9":"From this analysis, we found out an interesting fact that the involvement of HIC and UMIC in the application of using ML and AI has develop from the past 20 years.
