Just follow along with the notebook and instructions below. We will be analyzing the famous iris data set!\n\n## The Data\n \nThe Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. \n\nThe data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.\n\nHere's a picture of the three different Iris types:","db3b3baa":"# Train a Model\n\nNow its time to train a Support Vector Machine Classifier. \n\n**Call the SVC() model from sklearn and fit the model to the training data.**","0fa89d34":"** Create a GridSearchCV object and fit it to the training data.**","0ba0795a":"** Now take that grid model and create some predictions using the test set and create classification reports and confusion matrices for them.
