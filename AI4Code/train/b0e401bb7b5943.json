You are on the right track. This notebook deals exactly with that with an easy to understand example.\nWe will deal with Milanese neighbourhoods, plot them on a Folium map using a choropleth, and we will add markers at the approximate centre of each neighbourhood to display their names. You can even save the generated map as an html file and place it wherever you want. Neat, right?\n\n## Dataset for this project\n\nYou can find the GeoJSON file with the Milanese neighbourhoods [Here](http:\/\/dati.comune.milano.it\/it\/dataset\/ds61_infogeo_nil_localizzazione_\/resource\/af78bd3f-ea45-403a-8882-91cca05087f0).\n\n## Libraries for this project\n\nJust a handful in this case: **folium** for the map part of this map project (it is that important for this Notebook), **shapely** to find the _representative point_ of each neighbourhood (a centre which is not really a centre but we like it because it's a good enough impostor and computationally not so difficult to calculate), and **json** to load and save the various GeoJSON files (yes, GEOjson, for they contain coordinates and other information). We are lucky, as the GeoJSON file that we are going to use no longer adopts the **EPSG:32632 WGS 84 \/ UTM zone 32N** as in previous versions (I had to convert its coordinates from that standard to latitude and longitude for a similar project), even though they are actually swapped: it's longitude and latitude, instead of the more common opposite. We need to swap them, or else all that we will be doing is going to end up somewhere in Somalia.\n\n## Functions created for the project\n\n**swap_geojson_coordinates** : it swaps the coordinates and creates a new GeoJSON file with said swapped coordinates.\n\n**create_neighbourhoods_dictionary** : it opens a GeoJSON file and searches for \\['properties'\\]\\['NIL'\\] (it's very likely to be different in other GeoJSON files, maybe \\['properties'\\]\\['province'\\], or \\['properties'\\]\\['country'\\]) to generate a dictionary with the neighbourhood name as the key, and the coordinates as the corresponding value.\n\n**create_neighbourhood_centres_dictionary**: we feed this function the previously generated dictionary of neighbourhoods. It will find the approximate centres of each neighbourhood to then return a dictionary where said centres are the values, and the neighbourhood names are the keys."}}
