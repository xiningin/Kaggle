Because with transfer learning, you begin with an existing (trained) neural network used for image recognition \u2014 and then tweak it a bit (or more) here and there to train a model for your particular use case. And why do we do that? Training a reasonable neural network would mean needing approximately 300,000 image samples, and to achieve really good performance, we\u2019re going to need at least a million images.\n* In our case, we have approximately 4000+ images in our training set \u2014 you have one guess to decide if that would have been enough if were to train a neural net from scratch.\n* We use the create_cnn() function for loading a pre-trained ResNet18 network, that was trained on around a million images from the ImageNet database.","2b49d1d4":"<a id=\"4\"><\/a>\n<font color=\"blue\" size=+2.5><b>2.1 Installation<\/b><\/font>\n* Numpy\n* Pandas\n* Matplotlib\n* Fastai","5fca6629":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","13c16a64":"<a id=\"3\"><\/a>\n<font color=\"blue\" size=+2.5><b>1.3  What is Transfer Learning ?<\/b><\/font>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n<br\/>\n\n**Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.**\n\nIt is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in skill that they provide on related problems.","809c9628":"<a id=\"8\"><\/a>\n<font color=\"blue\" size=+2.5><b>3.3 Data Explorations<\/b><\/font>\n<br\/>\n\n*Our image dataset is stored as .jpg files in 2 different folders, with each folder bearing the name of model of the images contained in the folder.
