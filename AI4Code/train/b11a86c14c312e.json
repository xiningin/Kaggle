Easily available for public on NSE website. Many people might prefer to use longer term data- however based on my experience with changing macro trends, 1 year is a good period. However, folks who prefer to fork this notebook can try on longer periods also.","59c5a8e5":"Let's create a normal distribution with mean of 12.8% and average volatility (or standard deviation) of 9.2%.

Prophet is suggesting muted market returns because of last 1 year trend while monte carlo is simulating normal distributions with given mean and high volatility (9.2%). \n\n**Prophet is taking last 1 year performance too seriously.** \n\nHowever, none of the models are aware that in the next 1 year, Indian general elections are due and results of elections might well make all this analysis redundant. \n","8f34f3d5":"As a value investor and typically a non-believer in technical analysis, I decided to play around with some techniques to predict Nifty (Indian stock market index) over the next year. **The biggest challenge in using Machine learning techniques has been that past is not a reliable predictor of future **(at least I believe so). Even if we cannot predict exact values, we can try to predict probabilities for different range. \n\n**Combination of old statistical technique (Monte carlo simulation) and state of the art timeseries algorithm (Facebook fbprophet)**. Let's use Monte Carlo simulation to predict Nifty range- probabilistic values over the next year and then use Facebook open source library fbprophet.","2e4d17a3":"Now let us use Facebook fbprophet library to predict Nifty levels and see how it compares to the standard monte carlo simulation. Use the same Nifty data file as above- index levels for the past 1 year.","a50a0f5c":"With current Nifty levels of 11,278- our random normal distributions give a wide range from downside of 9000 to an upside of 16,000 (ignoring the 17,000 outlier distribution). For derivative traders, this is important that possible downside is very low from crystal ball analysis (or monte carlo simulation).","6897b22d":"Since we need only timestamp and prediction value, let's use only date and open column for timeseries prediction.\nProphet API expects date to be in the format of pandas- YYYY-MM-DD. Convert the datetime format in file to the required format. Also, Prophet expects columns to be named as ds and y.","e06485bf":"Use this dataset to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the index levels.
