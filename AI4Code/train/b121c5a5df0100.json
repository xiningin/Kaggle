is a plot from the output of the last data manipulation. From this chart one can see that Yellowstone and Bryce National Parks seem to be doing a great job with their bat populations since there are more sightings of protected bats compared to non-protected species. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park might need to beef up there efforts in conservation as they have seen more non-protected species.","b3e8a5af":"#### Data Characteristics\n\nNext, there will be a check for the dimensions of the data sets, for `species` there are 5,824 rows and 4 columns while `observations` has 23,296 rows and 3 columns.","8312bf62":"#### In conservation\n\nThe next question is if certain types of species are more likely to be endangered? This can be answered by creating a new column called `is_protected` and include any species that had a value other than `No Intervention`.","85a58768":"Next is to checkout the different categories that are nested in the `conservation_status` column except for the ones that do not require an intervention. There is both the table and chart to explore below.\n\nFor those in the `Endangered` status, 7 were mammals and 4 were birds. In the `In Recovery` status, there were 3 birds and 1 mammal, which could possibly mean that the birds are bouncing back more than the mammals.","9b59c80d":"#### Statistical Significance\n\nThis section will run some chi-squared tests to see if different species have statistically significant differences in conservation status rates. In order to run a chi squared test, a contingency table will need to be created. The contingency table should look like this:\n\n||protected|not protected|\n|-|-|-|\n|Mammal|?|?|\n|Bird|?|?|\n\nThe first test will be called `contingency1` and will need to be filled with the correct numbers for mammals and birds.\n\nThe results from the chi-squared test returns many values, the second value which is 0.69 is the p-value. The standard p-value to test statistical significance is 0.05. For the value retrieved from this test, the value of 0.69 is much larger than 0.05. In the case of mammals and birds there doesn't seem to be any significant relationship between them i.e. the variables independent.\n","db7270c8":"\n### Project Goals\n\nIn this project the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks. Some questions that are posed:\n\n- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n\n### Data\n\nThis project has two data sets that came with the package. The first `csv` file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project. \n\n### Analysis\n\nIn this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: \n\n1. Distributions\n1. counts\n1. relationship between species\n1. conservation status of species\n1. observations of species in parks. \n\n### Evaluation\n\nLastly, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.\n","5f028ec1":"Next the results of the bat species will be merged with observations to create a DataFrame with observations of bats across the four national parks.","9d302eba":"Now let's see each park broken down by protected bats vs. non-protected bat sightings. It seems that every park except for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park has more sightings of protected bats than not. This could be considered a great sign for bats.","1adb9640":"#### species in parks","60d9345c":"# Introduction\n\nThis goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.\n\nThis project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.\n\nHere are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:\n\n- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n\n**Data sources:**\n\nBoth `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https:\/\/www.codecademy.com).\n\nNote: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional.","4689b708":"The next step is to clean up duplicate words in each row since they should no be counted more than once per species.","0415e039":"In the next steps, `Observations.csv`  and `Species_info.csv` are read in as `DataFrames` called `observations` and `species` respectively. The newly created `DataFrames` are glimpsed with `.head()` to check its contents.","2f83a362":"Let's see how many total bat observations(across all species) were made at each national park.\n\nThe total number of bats observed in each park over the past 7 days are in the table below. Yellowstone National Park seems to have the largest with 8,362 observations and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park having the lowest with 2,411.","0374dc96":"The next set of analysis will come from data from the conservationists as they have been recording sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days.\n\nThe first step is to look at the the common names from `species` to get an idea of the most prevalent animals in the dataset. The data will be need to be split up into individual names. ","3942c7b4":"#### observations","e5d518e7":"The next section looks at the observations data.  The first task is to check the number of parks that are in the dataset and there are only 4 national parks.","2c3a025d":"From the above observations made,Vascular plants are by far the largest share of species with 4,470 in the data with reptiles being the fewest with 79.","cd8a3355":"Here is a subset of the data where is_bat is true, returning see the rows that matched. There seems to be a lot of species of bats and a mix of protected vs. non-protected species.","ddc214be":"# Loading the Data","86f6b6da":"The next pair, is going to test the difference between `Reptile` and `Mammal`.\n\nThe format is again is like below:\n\n||protected|not protected|\n|-|-|-|\n|Mammal|?|?|\n|Reptile|?|?|\n\nThis time the p-value is 0.039 which is below the standard threshold of 0.05 which can be take that the difference between reptile and mammal is statistically significant. Mammals are shown to have a statistically significant higher rate of needed protection compared with Reptiles. ","9bce6263":"First task will be to clean and explore the `conservation_status` column in `species`. \n\nThe column `conservation_status` has several possible values:\n- `Species of Concern`: declining or appear to be in need of conservation\n- `Threatened`: vulnerable to endangerment in the near future\n- `Endangered`: seriously at risk of extinction\n- `In Recovery`: formerly `Endangered`, but currently neither in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range\n\nIn the exploration, a lot of `nan` values were detected. These values will need to be converted to `No Intervention`.","790ec3cb":"## Conclusions\n\nThe project was able to make several data visualizations and inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprised this data set.\n\nThis project was also able to answer some of the questions first posed in the beginning:\n\n- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n    - The vast majority of species were not part of conservation.(5,633 vs 191)\n- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n    - Mammals and Birds had the highest percentage of being in protection.\n- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n    - While mammals and Birds did not have significant difference in conservation percentage, mammals and reptiles exhibited a statistically significant difference.\n- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n    - the study found that bats occurred the most number of times and they were most likely to be found in Yellowstone National Park.\n","293ed65e":"In the data, there are several different scientific names for different types of bats. The next task is to figure out which rows of species are referring to bats. A new column made up of boolean values will be created to check if is_bat is True.","23bbd6d2":"Here are the total number of observations logged in the parks, there are 3,314,739 sightings in the last 7 days... that's a lot of observations!","6fe996cd":"Next a count of the number of observations in the breakdown of the categories in conservation_status is done. There are 5,633 nan values which means that they are species without concerns. On the other hand there are 161 species of concern, 16 endangered, 10 threatened, and 4 in recovery.","efc9878f":"Now the data is ready to be able to count the number of occurrences of each word. From this analysis, it seems that Bat occurred 23 times while Shrew came up 18 times.","9730f7d1":"## Analysis","2ffebd3d":"It is time to explore the `species` data a little more in depth. The first thing is to find the number of distinct species in the data."}}
