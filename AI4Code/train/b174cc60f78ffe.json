It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.\n\nShe has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You say yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!\n\nYour neighbor then gives you some information about a bunch of houses in regions of the United States,it is all in the data set: USA_Housing.csv.\n\nThe data contains the following columns:\n\n* 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.\n* 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city\n* 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city\n* 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city\n* 'Area Population': Population of city house is located in\n* 'Price': Price that the house sold at\n* 'Address': Address for the house","5eabc6ab":"## Regression Evaluation Metrics\n\n\nHere are three common evaluation metrics for regression problems:\n\n**Mean Absolute Error** (MAE) is the mean of the absolute value of the errors:\n\n$$\\frac 1n\\sum_{i=1}^n|y_i-\\hat{y}_i|$$\n\n**Mean Squared Error** (MSE) is the mean of the squared errors:\n\n$$\\frac 1n\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2$$\n\n**Root Mean Squared Error** (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac 1n\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}$$\n\nComparing these metrics:\n\n- **MAE** is the easiest to understand, because it's the average error.\n- **MSE** is more popular than MAE, because MSE \"punishes\" larger errors, which tends to be useful in the real world.\n- **RMSE** is even more popular than MSE, because RMSE is interpretable in the \"y\" units.\n\nAll of these are **loss functions**, because we want to minimize them.","b38aa05a":"# EDA\n\nLet's create some simple plots to check out the data!","384b57ba":"## Predictions from our Model\n\nLet's grab predictions off our test set and see how well it did!","9abc612b":"This was your first real Machine Learning Project!
