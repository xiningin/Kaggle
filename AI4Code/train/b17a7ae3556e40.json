It is my opinion that based on the data provided, Legendary pokemon are almost always stronger than non legendary pokemon.\n\nThe dragon type pokemon is the best type of pokemon in the game. They have the most legendary pokemon in their type and their non legendary pokemon still outweigh every other pokemon. \n\nIf you are in an area where there are a lot of dragon type pokemon you should spend extra time there to increase you chances of getting a legendary pokemon.\n\nIf you run accross a pokemon with a higher than average sp.attk, sp. def, and attack rating they have the potential to rank fairly high in their total rankings\n\n## Results\n* Legendary pokemon tend to be the strongest pokemon in the game\n* sp.attk, sp. def, attack have a .70+ correlation with total power.\n* Water, Normal, Grass\/Bug are the most common pokemon types \n* Psychic and Dragon types have the most legendary pokemon\n* Due to the sheer amount of water pokemon it is not suggested to go after them since there is a wide discrepency between what is valuable and what is useless\n* There are 18 different pokemon types\n\n### Non Legendary Pokemon Types\n* Fighting  \n* Bug\n* Poison\n\nThe pokemon listed above do not have a legendary pokemon within their type. This makes them pokemon that you may want to stay away from if you are further in the game. The largest non legendary total will be 700 so these pokemon types will never be stronger than 700.\n\nEnjoy the notebook!\n","3362fcb2":"### Imports","bf3f33d9":"# Conclusion\n\nIn my opinion it is best to go after dragon type pokemon. They are the superior class.\n\nThey have the highest ratio of legendary pokemon within their type.\n\nThe non legendary dragon type pokemon on average is stronger than every other non legendary pokemon type. \n\nI hope this jupyter notebook has given you a clear answer on which pokemon type is the strongest.\n* The qualities of a strong pokemon\n* Which pokemon types you might want to saty away from\n\nIf you enjoyed this analysis please be sure to give it an upvote.\nIf you found anything incorrect or any improvements that should be made please leave a comment\n\n\n","d3e842fa":"## Correlations\nFrom this data we can see that sp. attact, attack, and sp. def are the most correlated with total\nWith this information we can attempt to grab pokemons that are within the 75 percentile in sp. atk, atk, sp. def","d0ec86d5":"#  Create a total column\nA total column is needed to create an accurate gauge of a pokemons total power"}}
