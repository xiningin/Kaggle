Wii is second most popular in EU and NA. the 1st and 3rd positions are alternatively occupied by Sony's and Microsoft's consoles. It is interesting that PS2 still gets many sales.  \nIn terms of scale, NA dominates. Except GB and WS all JP sales are very small in comparison to EU sales. PC sales are no longer as popular in EU as they were in previous generation.","6765be2b":"1. Shooter, Platformer, and RPG are the most popular Genres overall.  \n2. Except in Gen1, microsoft and sony consoles dominate global sales in terms of revenue. \n3. In terms of popularity, Xbox and Playstation have always had most games for their respective platforms.  \n4. EU generally favours sony, NA favours microsoft and JP favours Wii.  \n5. EU has gradually matched NA in terms of sales scale whereas JP has fallen behind.  \n6. Sales follow a consistent pattern regardless of region with SOME exceptions.  ","fd0cad73":"Now, we will look at the sales in different regions.","4a0e58f5":"Revenue generation aside, popularity also depends on the number of games released for a platform.  \n  \n  In gen1, PS1 is by far the most popular. In gen2, PS2 and DS are the most popular. In gen3, in stark contrast to revenue, the older generation is more popular i.e PS3 and Xbox360.  \n    \n  The max number of games for the most popular console is very high for gen2. total number of games overall is also very high for gen2","0d1d2894":"There are 271 Null values in Year and 58 Null values in publisher. we can either find out the average year for the respective products and impute the values or since the NULL values are very small in number, we can delete their rows.","e240b59f":"Note: data unavailable for year 2017 (NA, EU), 2020 (EU, JP)","3dac680e":"# EDA - Part 1","1477a79b":"Goals:  \n1.

NES and GB were most popular consoles overall but PC gaming was suprsingly more popular than NES in EU. In contrast, PC gaming instances were most rare in JP. It's also intersting that JP sales were larger in scale than EU sales.","a7b1d0a0":"Gen 3 : In terms of scale, EU has boosted up to match NA, but JP has fallen even further than before (in terms of scale).  \nSales fall post 2013 likely because 2013 was the year in which the next-gen consoles (PS4, Xbox One) were Launched, A drop in hype is expected.","850aa38c":"For the First gen, \"Platformers\" were most popular, then after a significant gap, RPG and Puzzle games were popular.  \nFor the Second gen, \"platformers\" were still the most popular but Shooter and RPG have come very close in popularity.  \nFor the Third gen, Shooter displaces platformers by a large margin, where the latter occupies the second place now. Sports and RPG are very close to each other in terms of sales.  \n  \n  Lets analyze the Platform popularity (not the game genre)","0333965f":"Even in Gen2, NA sales dwarfed the others in scale. however, both NA and EU sales peaked in 2001 whereas sales peaked in 2000 for JP.

Sony and microsoft consoles dominate the EU and NA market. 3DS is most popular in JP, followed by WiiU and PSP, the latter of which is mostly forgotten in other markets.  \nIn NA, last-gen xbox360 is more popular than current-gen xbox one. PS4 is the most popular console in EU followed by last gen consoles. Xbox one ranks at number 4 here.  \n","b12daffe":"We know that, with change in generation people's interest may also change, so we will measure Genre Popularity in 3 stages:  \nGen1 1980 - 2000  \nGen2 2000 - 2010  \nGen3 2010 - 2020","2828ab7c":"Most of the revenue of gen1 was because of NES and GB platforms. With the exception of DS, all underperforming platforms are wiped out in next gen.  \n  \nIn gen2, GB is the most revenue-generating console overall but diminishes in the latter half of this gen, sony and microsoft's consoles are almost tied for second place. PS2 is way more money-making than Xbox but both are less popular than Wii.  \n  \n  \nIn gen3, PS4 is the best in sales whereas its counterpart Xbox one's sales are lesser than microsoft's previous xbox i.e xbox360. GB is wiped out. Wii gives strong competition to Sony and Microsoft. DS is the oldest console that has a prescence in current gen"}}
