That is done with the columns property of the DataFrame (the bottom line of code below).\n\n## **Selecting The Prediction Target**\n\nWe can pull out a variable with dot-notation. This single column is stored in a Series, which is broadly like a DataFrame with only a single column of data.\n\nWe'll use the dot notation to select the column we want to predict, which is called the prediction target. By convention, the prediction target is called y. So the code we need to save the house prices in the iowa data is","b445fd2c":"Let's quickly review the data we'll be using to predict house prices using the describe method and the head method, which shows the top few rows.","2e648bce":"Many machine learning models allow some randomness in model training. Specifying a number for random_state ensures we get the same results in each run. This is considered a good practice. we use any number, and model quality won't depend meaningfully on exactly what value you choose.\n\nWe now have a fitted model that we can use to make predictions.\n\nIn practice, we'll want to make predictions for new houses coming on the market rather than the houses we already have prices for. But we'll make predictions for the first few rows of the training data to see how the predict function works.","1f1ac0ce":"## Compare Different Tree Sizes\nA loop that tries the following values for *max_leaf_nodes* from a set of possible values.\n\nCall the *get_mae* function on each value of max_leaf_nodes. Store the output in some way that allows us to select the value of `max_leaf_nodes` that gives the most accurate model on your data.","535f6063":"## Fit Model Using All Data\nWe know the best tree size. If we were going to deploy this model in practice, we would make it even more accurate by using all of the data and keeping that tree size.  That is, we don't need to hold out the validation data now that we've made all your modeling decisions.","d5668b6a":"## Choosing \"Features\"\nThe columns that are inputted into our model (and later used to make predictions) are called \"features.\" In our case, those would be the columns used to determine the home price. Sometimes, you will use all columns except the target as features. Other times you'll be better off with fewer features.\n\nFor now, we'll build a model with only a few features. \n\nWe select multiple features by providing a list of column names inside brackets. Each item in that list should be a string (with quotes)."}}
