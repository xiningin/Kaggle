We learnt lot about the two wine types and their qualities with repect to chemical attributes.But now i have mix of information in my head. Can you please give me a short summary of those things? Because i want to get clear idea and familier with those facts in order to start my own business.\n\n#### Iron Man : \nAha.. why not spidy.. So this is the story. listen carefully. When you're going to start your own wine business these facts may be help to buildup your business. \n\nPeople start business with different intensions. Those intensions can be self oriented or public oriented( to provide good service to the society). But among them majority of people start their business to make money and earn profit from them. It is always good to earn money with a good intension.A business like wine, mostly depend on consumer reviews. Before start a wine business, we need to know about our target market, type of customers and their perceptions and behaviours and many more. Spidy... let's think about in this way. when you're planning to provide quality wine, it will be automatically build reliance of your customers. as a result of that those people tend to spread their opinion on your wine products among their friends,relatives and many more. like \"hey let's try this one\" , \"this product is better than others\" , i simply love it\" etc. \n\nTherefore this quality fact leads to make highly stable customer base with steady customer acquisition.Just by providing some quality stuff it will leads to gain two super benefits. first one is, build customer confidence on your products and second one is, as a result of that to earn lot of money from it. So quality of wine is the super important factor for all above benefits. Therefore let's see what type of factors controls the quality and how can we improve the quality with respect to those factors.\n\n#### Spider Man:\nSounds interesting.. continue my friend.\n\n#### Iron Man: \nYeah. Throughtout this journey we identified that there are high percent of normal quality wines than excellent and poor ones. spidy, you probably don't need any help recognizing a white versus red wine. They look different and they certainly taste different as well. But it is worth you while to understand quality of white wine is somewhat greater  than the quality of red wine. So why they look and taste so different? that because of amount of chemical ingredients used in wines. Earlier we identified that volatile acidity,fixed acidity,citric acid,total SO2,alcohol,density and sulphates have relationshitp with the quality of wine. Just by controllig those chemical factors you will probably change the quality of your wine. also it is important to understand the relation between other ingredients as well. As we mentioned above we can say that total and free SO2, density and residual sugar are close friends. \n\n#### Spider Man :\nhurrayyyy... I think now i can start my business without any hesitation.

Let's see how can we deal with this.","fda8d97c":"#### Iron Man :\nThis graph shows how quality changes with free SO2. Both red and white wines have low level of free SO2 for all quality levels.The amount of free SO2 in white wine is higher than the red wine but there is not much variation of free SO2 in red wines. As you can see , outliers can be identified.","8048eaf2":"#### Iron Man :\nAs you can see, the amount of alcohol increases with the increase of quality except for the quality level \"5\". Therefore we can be suspected that there will be an association between those two variables.\n\n## Multivariate Analysis","d996c842":"#### Iron Man : \nGreat, that's much nicer.

Conclusions\n","3cc16b6c":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","b468ebe0":"# 1. Introduction\n\nWe drink it with a nice dinner. We covet it after a long day. When we gather for a celebration, it always finds its way to the table. Yes, we're talking about \"wine\". Wine is the center of happiness. It relaxes our mind and brings smiles to faces. Who doesn't like to taste quality wine. Today variety of people all over the world enjoy wine more and more. Most of the industries related to wine and many health organizations have paid their attention on wine quality assessment to prevent the illegal production process of wines.Quality evaluation is a very important factor that can be used not only to improve wine making but also classifying wines which is useful for setting prices.\n\n# 2.  Objectives\n\n1. Understand the characteristics of red and white wine.\n2. How different ingredients effect the quality of wine.\n3. Classify the wine types based on Quality.\n\n# 3. Description of the dataset\n\n\nThe dataset is from UCI machine learning database repository https:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/machine-learning-databases\/wine-quality\/ The original data consist of variants of the Portuguese Vinho-Verde wine and has 1599 observations of Red wine and 4898 observations of White wine. For each we have the wine quality (scored between 0 and 10) and eleven chemical attributes (quantitative), which are as follows: Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Residual sugar, Chlorides, Free sulfur dioxide, Total sulfur dioxide, Density, PH, Sulphates, and Alcohol\n\n* Fixed acidity -        Most acids involved wine or fixed or nonvolatile\n\n2. Volatile acidity -     The amount of acetic acids in wine,which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant,vinegar taste\n\n3. Citric acid -          Can be found in small quantities,add freshness and the flavor to the wine\n\n4. Residual sugar -       The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1g\/L                             and wines with greater than 45g\/L considered as sweet.\n\n5. Chlorides -            The amount of salt in the wine\n\n6. Free sulfur dioxide -  The free form of sulfur dioxide that is not bound to other molecules,and is used to calculate                                   molecular sulfur dioxide\n\n7. Total sulfur dioxide - The amount of free and bound forms of sulfur dioxide\n\n8. Density -              The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent of alcohol and the sugar\n\n9. PH -                   Describe how acidic or basic a wine in on scale from 0 to 14\n\n10. Sulphates -           A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas levels, which act as an antimicrobial and                             antioxidant\n\n11. Alcohol -             The percent alcohol content of the wine\n","59781190":"We have higher training set than the set test.
