They will be examined in the context of the various survey questions which will provide the rich background to understand this most recent profiles of a unique community. I will explore the survey in its entire breadth and touch on many properties that deserve further examination. Time and time again, the analysis will come back to the key threads and view them in the light of new findings.\n\nAccording to the data description the **\u201csurvey received 23,859 usable respondents from 147 countries and territories\u201d.** This makes it a highly valuable and unique source for exploring the state of Data Science in 2018."}}
