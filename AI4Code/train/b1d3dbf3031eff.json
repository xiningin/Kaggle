In fact, on average it resulted in a very slight increase in the test error rate.","ad3806c1":"While there is some noise, especially around the vertex of parabola for the model underlying the data, we can see that for the most part the scatterplot is fairly parabolic.","dc6e4214":"The LOOCV estimate for the test error is approximately 0.45, which matches the value we get if we use `cross_val_score()` with the `LeaveOneOut()` splitter to compute the error. This tells us that the logistic regression model using `Lag1` and `Lag2` to predict `Direction` by using a probability threshold of 0.5 performed a bit better than randomly guessing. However, it is important to note that we get essentially the same error rate with a naive strategy of predicting that the market will go up every week. \n\nNote that when using `cross_val_score` to compute the LOOCV test error, it computes scores using the `score()` function associated with the estimator class by default. In the case of logistic regression with two classes, this is the accuracy score computed using a posterior probability threshold of 0.5. However, it is important to note that performing classification using logistic regression like we have done in this chapter involves choosing a probability threshold for assigning class predictions, based on the posterior probabilities predicted by the logistic regresion model. Since on its own logistic regression is ***not*** a classification method, we may wish to instead compute scores\/errors associated with the posterior probabilities instead. To do that, we should either pick one of the [scorers or metrics as discussed in the scikit-learn documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter) and supply that for the `scoring` argument.","df035ced":"## Part 3\n**Repeat the process in Part 2 three times, using three different splits of the observations into a training set and a validation set.

Alternatively, one could compute those quantities using just the `fit()` and `score()` functions for a `LogisticRegression` object, and a for loop. You will now take this approach in order to compute the LOOCV error for a simple logistic regression model on the `Weekly` data set. Recall that in the context of classification problems, the LOOCV error is given by the following formula.**\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\text{CV}_{(n)} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i)\n\\end{equation}","4505392f":"## Part 4\n**Now consider a logistic regression model that predicts the probability of `default` using `income`, `balance`, and a dummy variable for `student`.

If we look specifically at those samples which had convergence issues, then the bootstrap estimates for the standard errors of the scikit-learn coefficients are more in-line with those for the StatsModels coefficients.

This agrees with the fact that while the LOOCV error for the quartic fit is still much lower than the LOOCV error for the linear fit, it is slightly higher than this LOOCV error for the quadratic fit, which suggests that a quadratic fit is likely to be more appropriate than a quartic fit.","48954944":"# Applied Exercise 1\n\n**In Chapter 4, we used logistic regression to predict the probability of `default` using `income` and `balance` on the `Default` data set.
