It helps us by making model training more simple and effective. Sometimes, we can engineer these features using by looking at data types, otherwise we require domain knowledge to create new features.\n\nFeature Engineering also depends on model that you are going to use CART (Classification and Regression Trees), Neural Networks or Gradient Boosting Decision Trees.

Depending on its nature linear or non-linear after that we need to preprocess it accordingly. \n\nThis part of notebook has been taken from [Feature Engineering Techniques](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/ieee-fraud-detection\/discussion\/108575).
