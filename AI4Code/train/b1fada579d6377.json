This could be a reframing of the original question to remove ambiguity, expand synonyms, or use our understanding of what the Task author is trying to get at. If the question is adequate we use it as the SeedQuestion. Each Task then has a Question and a SeedQuestion, and the SeedQuestion is what we use to start a search.\n\nFor some topics neither the Question nor the SeedQuestion would seem to get good results. In this case we use some other source for a search - we might say take a paragraph from some other document or web page related to the topic and search with that. That will return research papers in the same vector space we are interested in. Once we have locate the vector space we use the similarity index (using functions like **papers.similar_to**) to find papers in that vector space that seem to fit the topic.\n\nIn other case, if we know of some authorities on a given topic, say an author or an organization, we may search by author name, or org name, then find similar papers.\n\nThe point of this search strategy is that is a **human-guided - AI powered document discovery**, fronted by really easy to use user interface and functions inside a Jupyter notebook. It would be easy to automate this, but given that the whole point of these CORD 19 notebooks is to find solutions to the most pressing health emergency in 100 years - AI gimmicks take a back seat.
