The general idea is:\n\n- Black: Air\n- Gray: Fluids and Tissue\n- White: Bone and Solids\n\nSo the issue is that an air enclosure may just be a mild disturbance in the chest xray. Considering convolutional neural networks are exceptional at identifying abnormalities, we may want them to take a look, as not to miss these tiny abnormalities.\n\n\n![Futuristic view of human](https:\/\/www.publicdomainpictures.net\/pictures\/50000\/nahled\/anatomy-high-tech.jpg)\n\nIn this challenge, we get chest xrays and masks.

We can see different modes of collection. It becomes very evident, that we have to be careful about the top right marker on the image. The different L may mess with our data. Could it be usable leakage as it points to the hospital it was taken at? Yes, yes it could, but I'm *sure* Kaggle took care of this.\n\nThen we'll look at 3 images and the masks that come with it. Personally, I can't really make out how to find the pneumothorax in the images. Play around with it, in some of the other images, it is definitely more visible than in others. Also (thanks to Ehsan) make sure to transpose the masks!","c7fe5836":"## Vanilla Unet\nSo how would we work the data on GCP?\n\nI'd suggest a very nice [Unet](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1505.04597), maybe use a pretty pre-trained encoder instead of the following.
