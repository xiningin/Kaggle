We could assing cost to misclassifications, but being interested in classifying \"1s\" correctly, the cost for misclassifying \"1s\" should be bigger than \"0\" misclassifications. After that, the algorithm would select the threshold which minimises the total cost. A drawback I see is that we have to manually select the weight of each cost... therefore, I will leave this know as a thought.\n- Going back to the threshold changing, there is an option which is the Precisio-Recall curve.

Recall captures this.\n- Obviously, trying to increase recall, tends to come with a decrease of precision. However, in our case, if we predict that a transaction is fraudulent and turns out not to be, is not a massive problem compared to the opposite. \n- We could even apply a cost function when having FN and FP with different weights for each type of error, but let's leave that aside for now.","b298989b":"#### Create a function to plot a fancy confusion matrix","c83730d8":"#### 3.

I will probably try to implement SMOTE in future versions of the code, but for now I will use traditional undersamplig.\n\n- The way we will under sample the dataset will be by creating a 50\/50 ratio.
