I used AutoGluon for this example. With a few lines of code and zero pre-processing and clean up, I am able to get highly accurate result. Cross validation on training data is 0.8664 while submission public score on test data was 0.80143\n\n****The final model is an ensemble of a few algortihms.\n\n****There is an issue running Autogluon on Kaggle, most likely is due to incompatible versions of Scikit-Learn. I ran this code in Google Colab instead. Hope it works for you if you are trying."}}
