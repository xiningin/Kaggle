January 2013 is 0, February 2013 is 1,..., October 2015 is 33\n* **shop_id** - unique identifier of a shop\n* **item_id** - unique identifier of a product\n* **item_price** - current price of an item\n* **item_cnt_day** - number of products sold. We are predicting a monthly amount of this measure\n\nNow we will examine each feature in detail","97cb458b":"That is weird because some of the items have a negative price. Let's check how many of them are like that.\n","1bd41be2":"## Feature *shop_id*\n\nThe first thing we can check is the number of different shops that we have in our dataset.","2d5eb9c6":"Okay so only 1 price of ours is set as -1. We should probably ignore it during our analysis.\nNow let's check price distribution","5dd703d7":"# Introduction\n\nThis notebook is being developed as I take the Coursera Course \"How to Win a Data Science Competition\". The idea here is to not only develop the abilities learned on the course but also get useful insights for winning the competition.","02284e95":"More than half the items sold cost less than 500 dollars.","6bfcb641":"## Feature *item_price*\n\nWe may first check the price range we will find in this dataset","992f5c28":"# Understanding the competition\n\nOur first step regards an understanding of the competition requirements and the data that was provided.\nThe main information we may retrieve from the competition description include:\n\n* We have a time-series dataset\n* We have to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month\n* Our submissions will be evaluated by root mean squared error (RMSE)\n\nCompetition organizers provide us with 6 files, which are described as follows:\n\n* **sales_train.csv** - the training set. Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015.\n* **test.csv** - the test set. We need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for November 2015.\n* **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format.\n* **items.csv** - supplemental information about the items\/products.\n* **item_categories.csv**  - supplemental information about the items categories.\n* **shops.csv** - supplemental information about the shops.\n\nIn the next sections, we will explore each one of these files in detail.","39cf9e67":"We can conclude that all 34 months within that interval are represented.","67922ccd":"Okay, now we know that all 60 shop ids range from 0 to 59.","be9d0004":"# Exploring *sales_train.csv*\n\nWe begin this task by importing the csv file into our notebook. Next, we take a look at the first rows of the imported dataframe.","bcf8a38a":"## Features *date* and *date_block_num*\n\nWe are examining both features *date* and *date_block_num* together because they are intrinsically related.\n\nThere is not much to be evaluated from these features alone. So, let's just see if all months within the period that goes from January 2013 to October 2015 are represented in the dataset.","6772aa62":"## Feature *item_id*\n\nThe first thing we can check is the number of different items that we have in our dataset.","11225b54":"## *NOTE: This notebook is still under construction*","e6fdb185":"Let's check how these ids are distributed","727be0b9":"Okay, that is a huge variety of items."}}
