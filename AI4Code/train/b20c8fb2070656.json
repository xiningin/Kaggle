Decision tree classification\n\nA decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature, the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The decision tree analyzes a set of data to construct a set of rules or questions, which are used to predict a class, i.e., the goal of decision tree is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. In this sense the decision tree selects the best attribute using to divide the records, converting that attribute into a decision node and dividing the data set into smaller subsets, to finally start the construction of the tree repeating this process recursively.

Thus, using Bayes theorem $\\left(P(X|Y)=\\frac{P(Y|X)P(X)}{P(Y)}\\right)$, we can find the probability of $X$ happening, given that $Y$ has occurred. Here, $Y$ is the evidence and $X$ is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the presence of one particular feature does not affect the other (the predictors\/features are independent). Hence it is called naive. In this case we will assume that we assume the values are sampled from a Gaussian distribution and therefore we consider a Gaussian Naive Bayes.","b38852f8":"![http:\/\/triplesteptowardthecure.org\/images\/slide1.jpg](http:\/\/triplesteptowardthecure.org\/images\/slide1.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Image : http:\/\/triplesteptowardthecure.org\/understanding.php","c6634826":"## 6.

All the training data used in the test phase. **This makes the training faster and the test phase slower and more costlier. In this technique, the number of neighbors k is usually an odd number if the number of classes is 2**.

SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification\n\nSVMs (Support Vector Machine) have shown a rapid proliferation during the last years. The learning problem setting for SVMs corresponds to a some unknown and nonlinear dependency (mapping, function) $y = f(x)$ between some high-dimensional input vector $x$ and scalar output $y$. It is noteworthy that there is no information on the joint probability functions, therefore, a free distribution learning must be carried out. The only information available is a training data set $D = {(x_i, y_i) \u2208 X\u00d7Y }, i = 1$, $l$, where $l$ stands for the number of the training data pairs and is therefore equal to the size of the training data set $D$, additionally, $y_i$ is denoted as $d_i$, where $d$ stands for a desired (target) value. Hence, SVMs belong to the supervised learning techniques.\n\nFrom the classification approach, the goal of SVM is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that clearly classifies the data points. Thus hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes.\n\n\n\n","54b37aaa":"## 1. Logistic regression classification\n\nLogistic regression is a technique that can be applied to binary classification problems. This technique uses the logistic function or sigmoid function, which is an S-shaped curve that can assume any real value number and assign it to a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly in those limits. Thus, logistic regression models the probability of the default class (the probability that an input $(X)$ belongs to the default class $(Y=1)$) $(P(X)=P(Y=1|X))$. In order to make the prediction of the probability, the logistic function is used, which allows us to obtain the log-odds or the probit. Thus, the model is a linear combination of the inputs, but that this linear combination relates to the log-odds of the default class.\n\nStarted from make an instance of the model setting the default values. Specify the inverse of the regularization strength in 10. Trained the logistic regression model with the training data, and then applied such model to the test data.","da3e4865":"## 5. Random forest classification\n\nBased on the previous classification method, random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that creates a forest randomly. This forest, is a set of decision trees, most of the times trained with the bagging method. The essential idea of bagging is to average many noisy but approximately impartial models, and therefore reduce the variation. Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:\n\n* Let $N$ be the number of test cases, $M$ is the number of variables in the classifier.\n* Let $m$ be the number of input variables to be used to determine the decision in a given node; $m<M$.\n* Choose a training set for this tree and use the rest of the test cases to estimate the error.\n* For each node of the tree, randomly choose $m$ variables on which to base the decision. Calculate the best partition of the training set from the $m$ variables.\n\nFor prediction a new case is pushed down the tree. Then it is assigned the label of the terminal node where it ends. This process is iterated by all the trees in the assembly, and the label that gets the most incidents is reported as the prediction. We define the number of trees in the forest in 100.
