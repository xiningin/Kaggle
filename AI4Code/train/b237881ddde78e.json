Its impact is expected to contribute in bridging the gap between \"developed\" and \"developing\" countries by triggering innovations in products and services, boosting local entrepreneurship, ensuring better education outcomes and reducing income inequality. \n<\/div>","185ceb0e":"In comparing the distribution of years of coding experience among the African countries and the AI Leaders the differences are significant. The overall takeaway is that, on average, African coders seem to be relatively newer to the coding game, given that:\n\n*\tThe largest proportion of African Kagglers (`37.4%`) has been coding for less than a year and the overall proportion of that have been coding for less than two years is `66.3%`. By comparison, even though \"less than a year\" and \"one to two years\" likewise gather the most responses from AI Leaders, the overall proportion of users from these countries that have been coding for less than two years is `52.0%`.\n*\tThe proportion of Kagglers who have been coding between three and five years in the AI Leaders is `20.9%` compared to `14%` for Africa. Similarly, the proportion of Kagglers who have been coding between five and ten years in the AI Leaders is `11.2%` compared to `5.6%` for Africa.\n*\tAt the extreme ends of the experience scale, `10%` of Kagglers in AI Leaders have been coding for ten years or more compared to `3%` of Kagglers in Africa. Conversely, `10.9%` of Kagglers in Africa have never coded before, compared to `5.9%` in AI Leaders.\n\nSome heterogeneity can be nevertheless observed across African countries. In particular:\n\n* The distribution of coding experience is very similar in Egypt, Kenya and Morocco. In these countries the majority of respondents (`62.6%` in Egypt, `70%` in Kenya and `63.4%` in Morocco) report up to 2 years of experience while their distribution is roughly equal in the \"up to one year\" and \"1-2 years\" bins. The proportion of Kagglers falling in the \"3-5 years\" bin is `22.9%` in Egypt, `14%` in Kenya and `15.2%` in Morocco. \n* Algeria, Nigeria and Tunisia are similar to the above sub-group in so far as the majority of respondents (`61.5%` in Algeria, `75.8%` in Nigeria and `70.5%` in Tunisia) report up to 2 years of coding experience. However, the distributions at the bin level are not equal, with Tunisia having more respondents in the \"1-2 years\" bin (`45.5%`) and Algeria and Nigeria more in the \"up to one year\" one (`20.5%` and `27.5%` respectively). The three countries also report the three highest proportions of Kagglers that have \"never written code\" (`10.3%` in Algeria, `13.7%` in Nigeria and `15.9%` in Tunisia).\n* South Africa has a unique distribution and stands out as its coders report more years of experience. The greatest proportion of the population (`26.5%`) has between 3 and 5 years of coding experience, while the second greatest (`22.5%`) between 1 and 2. South Africa also boasts a notable number of Kagglers with more than five years of coding experience (`29.4%`). The relevant maturity of data science in South Africa could be partly explained by the fact that the country is among the continent's most advanced economies and, as a result, has been at the forefront of data science in the region. ","14aa9647":"> **Question 11**: Approximately how much money have you spent on machine learning and\/or cloud computing products at your work in the past 5 years?","9f34d295":"\n\n![](https:\/\/robohub.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/bigstock-169283726.jpg)\n\nHowever, we have indeed identified a few notable factors that differentiate Africa from other countries leading the AI revolution:\n\n* First, as hinted above, the average African Kaggler tends to be younger and more inexperienced compared to the average Kaggler from an AI Leader. We suspect that this trend can be primarily attributed to the overall demographic trends in the continent. \n* Second, average Kagglers report fewer ML-related expenditures. The reasons here are more likely attributable to income inequality and other economic phenomena across African countries and the AI Leaders.\n* Third, while African Kagglers are on par with Kagglers from the AI Leaders with respect to the adoption of complicated techniques in NLP and computer vision, they seem to somewhat lag behind in the learning of \u201ctraditional\u201d ML algorithms (e.g., regressions). This seems to suggest that African data scientists are fast to specialize or prefer learning \u201con the job\u201d (as suggested by the somewhat low popularity of University courses). While this is not, in itself, a non-desirable outcome, we are of the view that firm adoption of ML throughout the continent can be more successfully pursued, if a larger part of the population is exposed to \u201cthe basics\u201d of the discipline. \n\nGiven these above insights, we have come up with the following (broad) policy recommendations which, if adopted, could enhance the status of ML in Africa and lead to its \u201cdemocratization\u201d in individual African countries:\n\n* **Adapt educational curricula to incorporate basic coding and ML algorithms**: As already discussed, education is crucial in increasing adoption rates of ML. One of the key reasons why initiatives such as Africa Coding Week are very successful in this respect is that it includes school-aged children and development in its initiatives, while it aims to equip them with basic tools that are likely to stimulate further interest in the discipline. Local governments could adopt similar policies by incorporating computer science early on in the school curriculum and focusing (where age appropriate) on basic data science tools, statistics and regressions. Such efforts could increase interest in university-level ML courses, encourage more academic research and, ultimately, bring Africa at the intellectual forefront of the AI and ML community.\n* **Continue to encourage investment by global technology firms**: African regulators should prioritize the creation of an investment-friendly climate in order to attract more technology giants in the likes of Google and IBM (e.g., through fiscal incentives or simplification of administrative procedures for companies in the space). A scenario where different governments would engage in such a \u201crace to the top\u201d could lead up to policies with limited fiscal cost but great impact in terms of ML adoption. More technology companies in Africa could mean that any economic imbalance hindering ML innovation could be partly addresses by the market mechanism. After all, global technology employers are more likely to sponsor employees to attend University, in order to pick up hard skills, implement corporate-wide training programs, invest in ML expenditure or, in some cases, encourage their employees to pursue ML-related research.\n* **Subsidize smaller and local players that focus on ML investments**. Even though governments would be advised to prioritize policies intended to attract \u201cBigTech\u201d players, the importance of small, local entrepreneurs in spreading ML adoption should not be underestimated. Local entrepreneurship is crucial to the extent that it is more knowledgeable of challenges, opportunities and risks in a given country while is it often able to flexibly source creativity and talent. African country governments could thus examine incentives such as the provision of subsidies to local start-ups in the ML space or other incentives intended to facilitate their operations. Although such policies would arguably trigger larger fiscal costs, their implementation could lead to outcomes that indeed deliver of the promise to \u201ctangibly improve the lives of millions\u201d through AI and ML through the design of tailored and innovative applications.\n","24755e52":"## Table of Contents\n***\n\n* [Introduction](#introduction)\n    * [Why Africa](#why-africa)\n    * [Methodology](#methodology)\n        * [How We Identified the AI Leaders](#identify-leaders)\n        * [Participating African Countries](#african-countries)\n* [Data Analysis](#data-analysis)\n    * [Demographics](#demographics)\n        * [Age](#age)\n        * [Gender](#gender)\n        * [Education](#education)\n    * [Developing Experience](#experience)\n        * [Coding](#coding-years)\n        * [Machine Learning](#ml-years)\n    * [Sources of Education\/Information](#info-edu)\n        * [Media Platforms](#fav-media)\n        * [Education Platforms](#edu-platforms)\n    * [The Status of Machine Learning](#ml-status)\n        * [Algorithms](#algos)\n        * [Software](#ml-framework)\n        * [Hardware](#hardware)\n        * [Expenditure](#ml-expenditure)\n* [Limitations](#limitations)\n* [Conclusions and Recommendations](#conclusions)\n* [References](#references)","8fada756":"> **Question 24**: Which of the following ML algorithms do you use on a regular basis?

There are some important observations and take-aways to note here:\n* Every technique\/algorithm is used more by the group of AI Leaders, however the differences in popularity are not extreme, and only in the case of `gradient boosting machines` do they surpass `10%`.\n* The greatest differences in popularity are observed in more traditional ML algorithms such as `regression`, `random forests` and `gradient boosting machines`. In more modern techniques (i.e. various deep learning algorithms) there seems to be a much smaller gap. One potential explanation might be that the resurgence of the study of artificial neural networks and deep learning can be placed at 2012 (with the success of **Krizhevsky et al. (2012)** in using GPUs to train convolutional neural networks that won the ImageNet competition) and coincides with the beginning of the first efforts to broaden participation in ML. This coincidence might have led to an increased interest for deep learning techniques as opposed to more traditional methods.\n* Considering ML algorithms that require the use of at least a GPU to train (e.g. `RNNs`, `Transformers`, `CNNs`) we note that African countries do not lag far behind their AI Leader counterparts. In the domain of NLP, for instance, popularity differences across all deep-learning algorithms are at no more than `2.5%`. The corresponding figure for computer vision is at around `4.5%`. This indicates that, at least in the given set of African respondents, hardware considerations have not been a significant obstacle in their ML development.","b14c0f58":"### The Status of Machine Learning <a id=\"ml-status\"><\/a>\n***","66009295":"> **Question 23**: For how many years have you used machine learning methods?","24d559e3":"## Data Analysis <a id=\"data-analysis\"><\/a>\n***","cba3042d":"#### Coding (Distribution) <a id=\"coding-years\"><\/a>","71008391":"## Conclusions and Recommendations <a id=\"conclusions\"><\/a>","fc681508":"<div style=\"text-line:justify\"> Seven African countries participated in the 2019 Kaggle DS & ML Survey These countries are, in particular, Algeria, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia).

It is not clear from `Question 22` whether it is referring to specialized CPU chipsets or whether it includes CPUs of typical laptop computers or ML workstations. We hypothesize that the respondents interpreted it to be the latter, which led to such a small difference in popularity.\n\nWith GPUs on the other hand, we observe a considerable difference of `~11%` in popularity in favour of AI Leaders. This is expected, as GPU cards on the one hand and GPU-containing instances in cloud computing services are quite expensive, so we expect higher popularity more developed countries.\n\nWhat is indeed very startling is the higher TPU popularity in African countries. TPUs are specialized pieces of hardware that accelerates ML computations and are currently only available through Google Cloud. TPU instance tend to be much more expensive that GPU instances so we would expect a large difference in favour of AI Leaders (much like the one we observed for GPUs), however we observe a `~0.2%` higher popularity in African countries. What makes things even more peculiar is that if we observe the frequency distribution for TPU usage, we observe that for all frequency groups (2-5 times, 6-24 times etc.) the AI Leaders are slightly higher (although the differences are very small).","056654be":"#### Specialized Hardware (Popularity) <a id=\"hardware\"><\/a>","2e91b9ea":"### Demographics <a id=\"demographics\"><\/a>\n***","62d1d457":"* Davide Strusani and Georges Vivien Houngbonon. 2019. _The role of Artificial Intelligence in Supporting Development in Emerging Markets_.

Tunisia is notable insofar as `52.9%` of the Kagglers who replied to the survey are in their early twenties. This patterns suggests that the coders in these countries are expected to have typically completed their college education and be in a position to currently join the workforce. On the other hand, these counties have a lower proportion in the \"college age\" age bin of 18-21.\n* South Africa and Algeria follow a somewhat similar pattern, with the difference that the highest majority of their population that answered the Kaggle questionnaire falls in the \"late twenties\" bin and the second highest falls into the \"early twenties\" one. Again, the proportion of the \"college age\" coders is relatively low (i.e., below `10%`). These countries also have significant numbers of coders in their \"early thirties\": `22.5%` of South Africa's coders and `19%` of Algeria's fall in the respective bin (30-34). As the workforce of these age categories can be expected to be more experienced professionally, this could suggest that these countries are good talent pools for large-scale ML and AI initiatives or managerial projects. \n* The other two countries, Kenya and Nigeria, are closer to the aggregate trend for African countries, insofar as the majority of their population is concentrated roughly equally in the first three bins (i.e., \"college age\", \"early twenties\" and \"late twenties.\")","b92b011a":"# The Status of ML in Developing Economies: the Case of Africa\n***\n*    [Angeliki Varela](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/angeliki-varela-8a365b37) \n    *    email: avarela@chicagobooth.edu\n    *    Kaggle: `ang3l1k1`\n*    [Orest Xherija](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/orestxherija) \n    *    email: xherija.orest@gmail.com \n    *    kaggle: `orestxherija`","a8f90c75":"*\tTheir world share of AI investment and financing from 2013 to 2018 (**Holst 2019**);\n*\tThe number of local job listings regarding AI professional opportunities in those countries (**Reints 2018**); and\n*\tThe number of citable academic [publications](https:\/\/www.scimagojr.com\/countryrank.php?category=1702&year=2018) in such countries in 2018 (without regard to the influence of such publications, which can be subjective).","87e32807":"#### Gender (Distribution) <a id=\"gender\"><\/a>","611948db":"### Sources of Information\/Education <a id=\"info-edu\"><\/a>\n***","f43bbddb":"This barplot, which compares the relative popularity of DS media and information platforms across African countries and the AI Leaders, reveals several notable trends.

For example, Hacker News and Podcasts, are the least popular media according to the results of the Kaggle Survey across both categories. However, the AI Leaders prefer Hacker News to Podcasts while the pattern in Africa is reversed.\n* Twitter (`26.4%`) is the fourth most popular DS media platform in Africa.

More specifically:\n* `35.9%` of African Kagglers report no lifetime ML expenditures whatsoever, compared to `29.6%` of Kagglers from AI Leaders.\n* `42.3%` of African Kagglers report ML expenditures up to USD 999 (i.e., either in the \"USD 1-99\" or \"USD 100-999\" bins) and `21.9%` report ML expenditures above USD 1,000. The same percentages for Kagglers from the AI Leaders are `31.3%` and `39.1%` respectively.\n*  The differences become starker, the higher the expenditure level.

It is the country with the lowest proportion of no ML expenditures (`28%`) and has the largest proportion of Kagglers reporting expenditures in the \"USD 10,000 \u2013 99,999\" (`9.8%`) and \"USD 10,000 \u2013 99,999\" (`8.5%`) bins.\n* The remaining countries follow, with some variation, the overall trend for African countries.

A few points worth noting:\n\n* The largest differences in popularity are observed in frameworks that are designed for non-deep learning, such as `Scikit-learn` (difference: `~8%`), `RandomForest` (difference: `~7%`) and `Xgboost` (difference: `~8%`). This observation is in line with our previous observation on popular ML algorithms. We noted in particular that more traditional learning methods are less popular in African countries, so unsurprisngly, the frameworks to implement said methods will be correspondingly less popular.\n\n* Focusing on the main deep learning frameworks, we note that `Tensorflow` and `Keras` (although with the introduction of `TensorFlow 2.0` the line between `Tensorflow` and `Keras` is not well-defined) are dominant compared to `PyTorch`, in both AI Leaders and African countries. This seems to follow the pattern that we observe for deep learning framework popularity in industry rather in research, where `PyTorch` took the lead from `Tensorflow` overwhelmingly (see relevant [article](https:\/\/thegradient.pub\/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry\/) for further details). This, of course, might be due to inertia, since `TensorFlow` has been around for more years than `PyTorch`. We should expect next year's survey results to gauge if the popularity has shifted in the same manner as that for research papers.","36e5cbf1":"> Africa is Tech's next great frontier (**Kahn 2019**)","94e6655e":"This graph, which illustrates the distribution of years of ML experience across Africa and AI Leaders, follows (as would be expected) the trend identified for coding experience, with most African Kagglers reporting that they have only recently turned to ML. In particular:\n* `53.9%` of African Kagglers report having ML experience of less than 1 year, compared to `37.7%` of Kagglers from AI Leaders.\n* `4.1%` of African Kagglers report having more than 5 years of ML experience, compared to `9.2%` of Kagglers from AI Leaders. No African Kagglers reported having more than 20 years of ML experience.\n\nWe also observe the following patterns across countries:\n* Algeria, Kenya and Nigeria drive the trend for African countries insofar as there is a large divide between those with less than one year of ML experience and those with ML experience between one and two years. For example, `56.2%` of respondents in Algeria reported having less than one year of ML experience v. `18.8%` who reported having between one and two years. For Kenya and Nigeria, the same percentages are `56.8%` v. `32.9%` and `67.8%` v. `22%` respectively. \n* The divide seems less pronounced in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco \u2013 the latter country is the only one where the percentage of respondents with ML experience between one and two years exceeds that of respondents with ML experience below one year. More specifically, `41.3%` of the respondents in Egypt reported ML experience below one year against `36.7%` with ML experience between one and two years. The same numbers were `35.6%` (v. `39.2%`) for Morocco and `44.1%` (v. `32.3%`). \n* We note that Egypt and Morocco also have a noteworthy proportion of Kagglers (i.e., above `10%`) with ML experience between two and three years. \n* South Africa is again unique in terms of its distribution. Overall, it follows the general African trend of a relatively large divide between those with less than one year of ML experience and those with ML experience between one and two years. However, among all African countries, South Africa has the lowest percentage of Kagglers with less than one-year ML experience (`37.6%`) while a large part of its population falls in the bins pertaining to ML experience of two years and above.

In particular:\n* Tunisia stands out as a notable case of \"gender parity\" among coders: `51.5%` of the country's surveyed Kagglers are male, while `8.5%` are female. To be noted that the size of Tunisian Kagglers who took the survey (`68`) can be seen as being in line with that of other northern African countries (see also above).\n* Other than Tunisia, the country with the largest proportion of female Kagglers is Kenya (`25.4%`).\n* The countries with the least representation of female coders in Kaggle are South Africa (`15.8%`) and Nigeria (`15.9%`). Assuming that participation of Kaggle is indicative of coding activity generally, such proportions may be an indication that targeted initiatives could be offered in those countries, to stimulate the interest of the female population in coding.","4b58b431":"> **Question 4**: What is the highest level of formal education that you have attained or plan to attain within the next 2 years?","b14c4270":"## Limitations <a id=\"limitations\"><\/a>","69c7a871":"![](https:\/\/unctad.org\/en\/PublishingImages\/aldc_LDCs_map_large.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"text-line:justify\">\nIndeed, in recent years, Africa has become the epicenter of numerous exciting initiatives aiming to broaden participation in the study of ML and related disciplines, increase diversity in both academic and non-academic conferences and, generally, democratize AI (<b>Maskey 2018<\/b>).
