Two types of risks are associated with the bank\u2019s decision:\n\n* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company\n* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he\/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.\nThe data given below contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios:\n**The client with payment difficulties**: he\/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample\n**All other cases**: All other cases when the payment is paid on time\nWhen a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client\/company):\n* Approved: The Company has approved loan Application\n* Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her\/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.\n* Refused: The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.)\n* Unused offer: Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.","65fa2674":"There are several peaks along the distribution.
