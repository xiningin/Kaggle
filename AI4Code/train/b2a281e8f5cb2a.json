Thus we don't get to know the no. of students each school can enroll and manage effeciently. No. of teachers is too a huge factor here.

There is less motivation to go to school in rural areas as a lot of people tend to take up their parent's profession or business. Also, often children are made to skip school and work at the farm. The state should provide more incentives to ensure that families living in rural areas get their children to complete their schooling.\n* Dropout rate from 8th to 9th class should be decreased and schemes should be made to ensure that this dropout rate declines.

Meghalaya has the 5thhighest no. of illiterate males. The avg female literacy rate for Meghalaya though is higher than the avg female_lit rate.\n* Also, the states with the highest overall literacy rates have really little differences between male and female literacy rates in general.

We compared the Male and Female literacy rates in these states and saw that there was a huge difference in the states with a low overall literacy rate. The top 3 states were Kerala, Lakshadweep and Mizoram and the bottom 3 were Bihar, Telngana and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nNext we saw that difference in male and female literacy rates, rural population proportion and dropout rates from 8th to 9th class played a huge role in separating the top 3 and bottom 3 states.\n\nFinally, the dropout rates in different classes were explored and while the dropout rate for 6th class was really high, more students had enrolled in class 4 than had dropped out.\n\nThe literacy rate in India has been improving but there are some key issues that need to be tackled aggressively in order to improve the state of education in India. This is not just the job of the govt, but it is the duty of each and everyone living in the country. Hope to see the stats showing a much better India in the future.","af4fadfe":"We now check out how the North-East Indian states perform compared to the National Average","d7b6ea7f":"6.

C9_B, C9_G, C8_B and C8_G","0b031623":"### [Step 1] Business Understanding:\n\nWe will be trying to answer the following questions : \n1. Which states have the highest and the lowest literacy rates? \n2. How are the top 3 states different from the bottom 3 states and what factors can the bottom 3 states work on to increase their literacy rate?\n3. Which class is the dropout rate maximum in ?\n\nThese questions help us not only in determining which states are the top and bottom 3 w.r.t. to overall literacy rate, but also in studying about factors that affect these states. The 3rd question is really important from the governments view as it gives us the class\/age of the child where he\/she is most likely to dropout and thus, that particluar age group can be targeted with highly personal and specialized incentives.","816860bf":"There are two things that could be interesting to explore:\n\n1. Make a new column showing the the differences in literacy rates between men and women.\n2. It looks like North-Eastern states on an average have less difference between male and female literacy rates. ","6c0e6c2a":"### [Step 3] Data Preparation:\n\nTo answer our final question, we must calculate the dropout rates for all classes given in the dataset. So we start by summing up the boys and the girls enrollment for each class. We form a dataframe out of this and then take the sum for each class, i.e, sum up total enrollments for all states. Then we calculate the dropout rate for each class and plot it","4cecaf03":"Sex ratio is the no. of females per 1000 males","2346d17a":"Some functions that have been used throughout the notebook have been defined here:","f2064746":"DIFF_LIT says a lot. The differences are really high in states with low overall literacy rates. So even if the bottom most states have good male literacy rates, female literacy rates are really low and that takes their overall literacy rate down. Thus these states really need to work on educating their females and increasing their literacy rate.","4b81ef60":"We find the drop out rate from 8th to 9th(primary to secondary) a pretty important feature in distinguishing between the top 3 and bottom 3 states. It is an obvious reason but no one knew that there would be this much of a difference. The top 3 states have more admissions in 9th than they had in 8th while the bottom 3 have the opposite going on. ","9b704d74":"We see from this given graph that the dropout rate was maximum in the 6th class followed by the 9th class and 2nd class. Class 4 saw a negative dropout rate, i.e, more students enrolled and less dropped out when moving from class 3 to class 4 and that is some really good news\u00a0!\n\nThe dropout rate for 5th to 6th was really high, 8.5%. One reason for this could be that when the child is old enough to be in 5th, he is usually old enough to do a lot of other work too. His parents might need him at the farm or at their business to help them and start earning. This is a huge problem, especially in the rural parts of India. An additional step here could be to compare the dropout rates between the rural and urban schools.","3a9b42ed":"5.

Business understanding: outlining the questions we will answer along with why they are relevant and important\n2. Data understanding: understanding the data and providing stats about it\n3.

At first I thought that maybe having higher population density created more pressure on the govt to cater to the needs of the people and that it might be difficult for states of really high population density to do so.But the govt of that state should be well equipped enough to make sure that people get access to education in that state irrelevent of how dense the population is.","fba0b8e8":"## Yay. Done !! ","bb198b1b":"### [Step 3] Data Preparation:\n\nWe can also take a look at the different types of schools in these states. It might be that the states having a high literacy rate have more private schools than govt. schools. For this purpose, we do some data preparation to allow for plotting of the type of schools."}}
