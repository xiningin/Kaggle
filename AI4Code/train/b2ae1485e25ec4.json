Factors for thermal sensation are:\n\n* operating temperature\n* relative humidity\n* airspeed \n* metabolic rate \n* clothing insulation \n\nPMV equal to zero is representing thermal neutrality. PMV in range of 0 to 3 is for warm sensation and pmv 0 to -3 is for cold sensation.\n\n## What is ASHRAE standard?\nASHRAE Standard is the recognized standards for ventilation system design and acceptable indoor air quality (IAQ).
