Of course, the better you finished, the longer you have to get kills, and do other things. Therefore the last two plots divide the number of kills over distance walked so that people who lived longer (and walked more) get the playing field leveled. We still see a higher concentration of people past 0 (People who got no kills) for people in the top 90% vs everyone. "}}
