The human evaluation results indicate that its quality is comparable to human response quality under a single-turn conversation Turing test.\n\nThe bot can also use any other text generator supported by transformers.\n\nTo further improve dialog generation, the bot uses DialogRPT - a set of dialog response ranking models trained on 100+ millions of human feedback data.\n\nSince the underlying model was trained on Reddit comment chains, the bot often behaves like a community rather than an individual, which makes it even more fun.\n\n\n### Borrowed from https:\/\/github.com\/polakowo\/gpt2bot#locally\n\n* The following nb, installs the above and dependencies and prepares a bot to be used via Telegram channel\n* You have to register a new Telegram bot via BotFather (see https:\/\/core.telegram.org\/bots) and use your token from Telegram - see below\n* The kernel must be up and running in order for the bot to work, with GPU on.\n\n### Not counting the installation process, there are only 2 lines of code. That's it !\n"}}
