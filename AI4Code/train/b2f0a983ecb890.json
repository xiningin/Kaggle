different behaviours.\n\nThe most self-evident observation, is that the other call type meets at a very specific point in time: the Friday and Saturday nights. Possibly it's because the taxi drivers go to leisure areas to pick up clients, rather than wait at the stand or wait for a phone call.\n\nTrips dispatched from the central have a big contrast between the first hour in the morning and the rest of the day. And a mild peak at Friday and Saturday evenings.\n\nTrips demanded in a stand, has a flatter behavior, with specific levels and times of activity.\n\nCall type has, certainly, a big correlation with activity.","96b48976":"## Trip distance per day of week and hour faceted per call type","76c7d55f":"## Trip distance and time per day of week and hour","0d1503e6":"# Load data","5518189a":"# Trip distance and duration over time","4ee35ce6":"There's clearly a big difference between working days and weekend days.\n\nOn working days, the activity is concentrated between 8 h and 18 h, with a peak at first hour on Mondays.\n\nAlso there's big activity in friday and saturday night, specially this last one.\n\nFriday evening also shows more activity, compared to the other working days.\n\nIt can be deduced that there are two main sources of activity: work and leisure. The first one take place on working days and working hours. The second one, in Friday evening and night and Saturday night.\n\nIt can not be ignored that weekday and hour have and sound correlation with activity.","e01e4184":"Although distance and time are highly correlated, the means are not. \n\nIn distance, there's a big group of trips longer than the rest. Those are trips very early at night on working days. Extremely accused, on Monday. Maybe there are trips to airport to get the firsts flights.\n\nIn time, by night and weekends, the trip time is below the average. But at evenings, specially on Fridays, the trips take longer, maybe caused by dense traffic.","3f571ea8":"## Number of trips per day of week and hour","d0d92886":"## Number of trips per day of week and hour faceted per call type","831d0fbb":"# Trips over time"}}
