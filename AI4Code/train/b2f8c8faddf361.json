Pandas makes use of these index names or numbers by allowing for fast look ups of information (works like a hash table or dictionary).\n\nLet's see some examples of how to grab information from a Series. Let us create two sereis, ser1 and ser2:","f0856c25":"## Creating a Series\nYou can convert a list,numpy array, or dictionary to a Series:","93fe33f1":"# Introduction to Pandas\nIn this section of the course we will learn how to use pandas for data analysis.

Let's import Pandas and explore the Series object.\n\nA Series is very similar to a NumPy array (in fact it is built on top of the NumPy array object). What differentiates the NumPy array from a Series, is that a Series can have axis labels, meaning it can be indexed by a label, instead of just a number location. It also doesn't need to hold numeric data, it can hold any arbitrary Python Object.\n\nLet's explore this concept through some examples:"}}
