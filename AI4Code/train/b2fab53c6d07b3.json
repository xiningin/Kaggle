Specify the following arguments:\n1. `loss = \"categorical_crossentropy\"`\n2. `optimizer = 'adam'`\n3. `metrics = ['accuracy']`","24a19030":"# 1) Start the model\nCreate a `Sequential` model called `fashion_model`.

The first layer always requires that you specify the `input_shape`.  We have saved the number of rows and columns to the variables `img_rows` and `img_cols` respectively, so the input shape in this case is `(img_rows, img_cols, 1)`.","b24eb81e":"---\n**[Deep Learning Home Page](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/deep-learning)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

The arguments you will use are\n1. The data used to fit the model. First comes the data holding the images, and second is the data with the class labels to be predicted. Look at the first code cell (which was supplied to you) where we called `prep_data` to find the variable names for these.\n2. `batch_size = 100`\n3. `epochs = 4`\n4. `validation_split = 0.2`\n\nWhen you run this command, you can watch your model start improving.  You will see validation accuracies after each epoch.","c03cba35":"# 6) Create A New Model\n\nCreate a new model called `second_fashion_model` in the cell below.  Make some changes so it is different than `fashion_model` that you've trained above. The change could be using a different number of layers, different number of convolutions in the layers, etc.\n\nDefine the model, compile it and fit it in the cell below.  See how its validation score compares to that of the original model.","03c32e89":"# Keep Going\nYou are ready to learn about **[strides and dropout](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/dansbecker\/dropout-and-strides-for-larger-models)**, which become important as you start using bigger and more powerful models.\n","bd49ed56":"# Introduction\n\nYou've seen how to build a model from scratch to identify handwritten digits.  You'll now build a model to identify different types of clothing.  To make models that train quickly, we'll work with very small (low-resolution) images. \n\nAs an example, your model will take an images like this and identify it as a shoe:\n\n![Imgur](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GyXOnSB.png)","b0cd79f1":"# 3) Add the remaining layers\n\n1. Add 2 more convolutional (`Conv2D layers`) with 20 filters each, 'relu' activation, and a kernel size of 3. Follow that with a `Flatten` layer, and then a `Dense` layer with 100 neurons. \n2. Add your prediction layer to `fashion_model`.  This is a `Dense` layer.  We alrady have a variable called `num_classes`.  Use this variable when specifying the number of nodes in this layer. The activation should be `softmax` (or you will have problems later)."}}
