Contains characteristis of people.\n\n_ Activity.csv:\nThe activity file contains all of the unique activities (and the corresponding activity characteristics) that each person has performed over time. Each row in the activity file represents a unique activity performed by a person on a certain date. Each activity has a unique activity_id. \n\nThe activity file contains several different categories of activities.
