This tells us that this file isn't actually UTF-8. We don't know what encoding it actually is though. One way to figure it out is to try and test a bunch of different character encodings and see if any of them work. A better way, though, is to use the `chardet` module to try and automatically guess what the right encoding is. It's not 100% guaranteed to be right, but it's usually faster than just trying to guess.\n\n\n* One reason to just look at the first part of the file is that we can see by looking at the error message that the first problem is the 11th character. So we probably only need to look at the first little bit of the file to figure out what's going on.","74b7a5c6":"* However, when we try to use a different encoding to map our bytes into a string, we get an error. This is because the encoding we're trying to use doesn't know what to do with the bytes we're trying to pass it. You need to tell Python the encoding that the byte string is actually supposed to be in.","9711cc51":"* It does look like there is another inconsistency: 'southkorea' and 'south korea' should be the same.","1dc9dc58":"* **Scaling** means that you're transforming your data so that it fits within a specific scale, like 0-100 or 0-1. You want to scale data when you're using methods based on measures of how far apart data points are, like **support vector machines (SVM)** or **k-nearest neighbors (KNN)**. With these algorithms, a change of \"1\" in any numeric feature is given the same importance.","d536f52c":"# Parsing Dates","e2520d82":"* We can also run into trouble if we try to use the wrong encoding to map from a string to bytes. Like I said earlier, strings are UTF-8 by default in Python 3, so if we try to treat them like they were in another encoding we'll create problems.\n\n\n* This is bad and we want to avoid doing it! It's far better to convert all our text to UTF-8 as soon as we can and keep it in that encoding. The best time to convert non UTF-8 input into UTF-8 is when you read in files, which we'll talk about next.","b1b08526":"We can pandas what the format of our dates are with a guide called as [\"strftime directive\"](https:\/\/strftime.org\/), which you can find more information on at this link. The basic idea is that you need to point out which parts of the date are where and what punctuation is between them. There are lots of possible parts of a date, but the most common are `%d` for day, `%m` for month, `%y` for a two-digit year and `%Y` for a four digit year.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* 1\/17\/07 has the format \"%m\/%d\/%y\"\n* 17-1-2007 has the format \"%d-%m-%Y\"\n\nLooking back up at the head of the \"date\" column in the landslides dataset, we can see that it's in the format \"month\/day\/two-digit year\", so we can use the same syntax as the first example to parse in our dates:","16c37d06":"* The other data is the [bytes](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3.1\/library\/functions.html#bytes) data type, which is a sequence of integers. You can convert a string into bytes by specifying which encoding it's in:","2321ec28":"# Inconsistent Data Entry","708069c2":"* in **scaling**, you're changing the range of your data\n* while in **normalization**, you're changing the shape of the distribution of your data.","c3cf45af":"* **Character encodings** are specific sets of rules for mapping from raw binary byte strings (that look like this: 0110100001101001) to characters that make up human-readable text (like \"hi\"). There are many different encodings, and if you tried to read in text with a different encoding than the one it was originally written in, you ended up with scrambled text called \"mojibake\".\n\n\n* There are lots of different character encodings, but the main one you need to know is UTF-8. UTF-8 is **the** standard text encoding. All Python code is in UTF-8 and, ideally, all your data should be as well. It's when things aren't in UTF-8 that you run into trouble.","d5114672":"We're going to use the [fuzzywuzzy](https:\/\/github.com\/seatgeek\/fuzzywuzzy) package to help identify which strings are closest to each other. This dataset is small enough that we could probably could correct errors by hand, but that approach doesn't scale well. (Would you want to correct a thousand errors by hand? What about ten thousand? Automating things as early as possible is generally a good idea. Plus, it\u2019s fun!)\n\n* **Fuzzy matching**: The process of automatically finding text strings that are very similar to the target string. In general, a string is considered \"closer\" to another one the fewer characters you'd need to change if you were transforming one string into another. So \"apple\" and \"snapple\" are two changes away from each other (add \"s\" and \"n\") while \"in\" and \"on\" and one change away (rplace \"i\" with \"o\"). You won't always be able to rely on fuzzy matching 100%, but it will usually end up saving you at least a little time.\n\nFuzzywuzzy returns a ratio given two strings. The closer the ratio is to 100, the smaller the edit distance between the two strings. Here, we're going to get the ten strings from our list of cities that have the closest distance to \"d.i khan\".","07a4f489":"* Scaling just changes the range of your data. **Normalization** is a more radical transformation. The point of normalization is to change your observations so that they can be described as a normal distribution.\n\n\n* In general, you'll normalize your data if you're going to be using a machine learning or statistics technique that assumes your data is normally distributed. Some examples of these include **linear discriminant analysis (LDA)** and **Gaussian naive Bayes**. (Pro tip: any method with \"Gaussian\" in the name probably assumes normality.)","4d3a1c3c":"* If you look at a bytes object, you'll see that it has a b in front of it, and then maybe some text after. That's because bytes are printed out as if they were characters encoded in ASCII. (ASCII is an older character encoding that doesn't really work for writing any language other than English.) Here you can see that our euro symbol has been replaced with some mojibake that looks like \"\\xe2\\x82\\xac\" when it's printed as if it were an ASCII string.","e90b329b":"# Scaling and Normalization","844b2f78":"# Handling Missing Values","d7df7573":"* **What if I run into an error with multiple date formats?** While we're specifying the date format here, sometimes you'll run into an error when there are multiple date formats in a single column.

(With a dip on 31 because not all months have 31 days.)","7ef58a62":"* Finally, once you've gone through all the trouble of getting your file into UTF-8, you'll probably want to keep it that way. The easiest way to do that is to save your files with UTF-8 encoding.
