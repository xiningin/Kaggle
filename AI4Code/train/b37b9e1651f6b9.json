Specifically, the features included per asset are the following:\n*   **timestamp**: All timestamps are returned as second Unix timestamps (the number of seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00.000 UTC). Timestamps in this dataset are multiple of 60, indicating minute-by-minute data.\n*   **Asset_ID**: The asset ID corresponding to one of the crytocurrencies (e.g. `Asset_ID = 1` for Bitcoin). The mapping from `Asset_ID` to crypto asset is contained in `asset_details.csv`.\n*   **Count**: Total number of trades in the time interval (last minute).\n*   **Open**:\tOpening price of the time interval (in USD).\n*   **High**:\tHighest price reached during time interval (in USD).\n*   **Low**: Lowest price reached during time interval (in USD).\n*   **Close**:\tClosing price of the time interval (in USD).\n*   **Volume**:\tQuantity of asset bought or sold, displayed in base currency USD.\n*   **VWAP**: The average price of the asset over the time interval, weighted by volume. VWAP is an aggregated form of trade data.\n*   **Target**: Residual log-returns for the asset over a 15 minute horizon. \n\nThe first two columns define the time and asset indexes for this data row. The 6 middle columns are feature columns with the trading data for this asset and minute in time. The last column is the prediction target, which we will get to later in more detail.\n\nWe also view the asset information, including the list of all assets, the `Asset_ID` to asset mapping, and the weight of each asset used to weigh their relative importance in the evaluation metric.","5d68b26f":"# Preprocessing","02242bba":"## Log returns\n\nIn order to analyze price changes for an asset we can deal with the price difference. However, different assets exhibit different price scales, so that the their returns are not readily comparable. We can solve this problem by computing the percentage change in price instead, also known as the return. This return coincides with the percentage change in our invested capital.\n\nReturns are widely used in finance, however log returns are preferred for mathematical modelling of time series, as they are additive across time. Also, while regular returns cannot go below -100%, log returns are not bounded.\n\nTo compute the log return, we can simply take the logarithm of the ratio between two consecutive prices. The first row will have an empty return as the previous value is unknown, therefore the empty return data point will be dropped.","335dc7ef":"We encourage participants to perform additional statistical analyses to have a stronger grasp on the dataset, including autocorrelation, time-series decomposition and stationarity tests.","f3dbfe2e":"On shorter intervals we can visually see some potential correlation between both assets, with some simultaneous ups and downs.

For each row in the dataset, we include the target for prediction, `Target`. `Target` is derived from log returns ($R^a$) over 15 minutes.\n\n$$R^a(t) = log (P^a(t+16)\\ \/\\ P^a(t+1))$$\n\nCrypto asset returns are highly correlated, following to a large extend the overall crypto market. As we want to test your ability to predict returns for individual assets, we perform a linear residualization, removing the market signal from individual asset returns when creating the target. In more detail, if $M(t)$ is the weighted average market returns, the target is:\n\n$$M(t) = \\frac{\\sum_a w^a R^a(t)}{\\sum_a w^a}  \\\\\n\\beta^a = \\frac{\\langle M \\cdot R^a \\rangle}{\\langle M^2 \\rangle} \\\\\n\\text{Target}^a(t) = R^a(t) - \\beta^a M(t)$$\n\nwhere the bracket $\\langle .\\rangle$ represent the rolling average over time (3750 minute windows), and same asset weights $w^a$ used for the evaluation metric.\n\nSome rows have null values for targets due to missing values in future prices. Rows with nulls in the test set ground truth are ignored for scoring purposes.\n\nIn the competition, your predictions will be evaluated on a weighted version of the Pearson correlation coefficient, with weights given by the `Weight` column in the Asset Details file.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will simplify things and use correlation (without weights) for evaluation, and consider only two assets, BTC and ETH.","b6eecc06":"We can see the number of rows in the training set, and that there are missing values for the targets columns, which we will address later.

We can visualize this data through the commonly used candlestick bar chart, which allows traders to perform technical analysis on intraday values. The bar's body length represents the price range between the open and close of that day's trading. When the bar is red, it means the close was lower than the open, and green otherwise. These are also referred to as bullish and bearish candlesticks. The wicks above and below the bars show the high and low prices of that interval's trading.","038bd5e7":"## Baseline model: Linear Regression\n\nWe will try a simple Linear Regression model on the features we designed.

On the other hand, a non-stationary behaviour is characterized by a continuous change of statistical properties over time.
