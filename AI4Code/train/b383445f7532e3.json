Inspect the daily vaccinations and COVID-19 cases of the country\n<p>From the time-serie plot(and the table), the vaccination campaign started on March 8th, 2021. The number of infection was started to be recorded from February 15th, 2020. According to the graph, the number of cases in Vietnam is comparatively low. From the graph, there were 4 waves in total: April 2020, August 2020, February 2021, annd May 2021. The highest number of daily infection is 190 which is around 1 month after the peak of the vaccination. The percentage of vacinated people is 0.03; however, the data in Gibraltar seem to be invalid because it exceeds 100.<\/p>\n<p>Contradictory, the biggest wave of daily infection is just after the vaccination campaign was initiated, so it is suspected that the number has been underreported.

News reviewing\n<p> Even though it is unprofessional to cite Wikipedia in an academic work, the article about COVID in Vietnam has been nicely compiled with citations in https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_Vietnam, although it is bizarrely descriptive and detailed. The first case was confirmed on January 2020, and ccordingly, the government stated a lockdown in the district, so it did not spread further from this cluster. Then a case was confirmed in March 2020 in Hanoi, and continuously increased from the people who arrived from Europe, causing the 1st wave in April 2020. The second wave started in July 2020 when there was a case which the source of infection is unknown. Consequently, hundreds of cases were reported across the country braching from this case. The government enacted a similar strategy, and could contain the infection, according to the source. The 3rd wave began in January 2021, which was related to a single migrant worker. The government tried to use the same strategy of local lockdown, but it had already spread too far and took some time for the situation to be under control. Then on the following day, the government started the vaccination campaign. Finally, the 4th wave started in the end of April which is the highest of all time. The investigation led to a patient who had just returned from abroad and a group of Chinese experts who had visited many places before testing positive. Another reason is a 4-day holiday for Reunnification day and International Worker's Day because the people traveled. <\/p>\n<p> The information regarding the number of daily vaccination does not disagree with the data from other source, which uses the cumulative data and shows a similar declination of the administration rate. However, since the data regardinng the vaccination rate drop is relatively new, the related information is not available yet. <\/p>","375493a3":"### 1. **The selected country**: Vietnam\nThe following block imports the data and libraries.
