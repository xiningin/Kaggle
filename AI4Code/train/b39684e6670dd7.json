The IQR is the range between the 1st quartile (25th quantile) and the 3rd quartile (75th quantile).\n\nCentering and scaling happen independently on each feature by computing the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Median and interquartile range are then stored to be used on later data using the transform method.\n\nStandardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators. Typically this is done by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. However, outliers can often influence the sample mean \/ variance in a negative way. In such cases, the median and the interquartile range often give better results.","d7c8fe3e":"# import libraries"}}
