Komaroff, MD, an internal medicine specialist [5](https:\/\/www.sharecare.com\/health\/circulatory-system-health\/what-st-segment-electrocardiogram-ecg) .... *\"An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the heart's electrical activity. The waves that appear on it are labeled P, QRS, and T. Each corresponds to a different part of the heartbeat. The **ST segment** represents the heart's electrical activity immediately after the right and left ventricles have contracted, pumping blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. Following this big effort, ventricular muscle cells relax and get ready for the next contraction. During this period, little or no electricity is flowing, so the ST segment is even with the baseline or sometimes slightly above it. The faster the heart is beating during an ECG, the shorter all of the waves become. **The shape and direction of the ST segment are far more important than its length. Upward or downward shifts can represent decreased blood flow to the heart from a variety of causes, including heart attack, spasms in one or more coronary arteries (Prinzmetal's angina), infection of the lining of the heart (pericarditis) or the heart muscle itself (myocarditis), an excess of potassium in the bloodstream, a heart rhythm problem, or a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism).\"***\n\n<img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.cvphysiology.com\/uploads\/images\/CAD012%20ST%20elevation.png\" width=\"350px\"\/>    [6](https:\/\/www.cvphysiology.com\/CAD\/CAD012)","c4d70b88":"# Contents\n\n1.

If the output from a model is the particular course of treatment (potentially with side-effects), or surgery, or the *absence* of treatment, people are going to want to know **why**.\n\nThis dataset gives a number of variables along with a target condition of having or not having heart disease. Below, the data is first used in a simple random forest model, and then the model is investigated using ML explainability tools and techniques.\n\nLearn more in Dan Becker's course in Kaggle Learn [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/machine-learning-explainability)\n\nFirst, load the appropriate libraries,","cb29bbb9":"This gives us on explainability tool.

Exercise induced angina has a clear separation, although not as expected, as 'no' (blue) *increases* the probability. Another clear one is the st_slope. It looks like when it's flat, that's a bad sign (red on the right).\n\nIt's also odd is that the men (red) have a *reduced* chance of heart disease in this model. Why is this? Domain knowledge tells us that men have a greater chance.","ac8279b1":"# Conclusion\n\nThis dataset is old and small by today's standards. However, it's allowed us to create a simple model and then use various machine learning explainability tools and techniques to peek inside.

Instead, the number of major factors and aspects of ECG results dominated.

However, the meaning of some of the column headers are not obvious. Here's what they mean,\n\n- **age**: The person's age in years\n- **sex**: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)\n- **cp:** The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\n- **trestbps:** The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n- **chol:** The person's cholesterol measurement in mg\/dl\n- **fbs:** The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg\/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false) \n- **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)\n- **thalach:** The person's maximum heart rate achieved\n- **exang:** Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n- **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot.

The types of tests run will be chosen on the basis of what the physician thinks is going on [1](https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/heart-disease\/diagnosis-treatment\/drc-20353124), ranging from electrocardiograms and cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scans, to blood tests and exercise stress tests [2](https:\/\/www.heartfoundation.org.au\/your-heart\/living-with-heart-disease\/medical-tests).\n\nLooking at information of heart disease risk factors led me to the following: **high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking** [3](https:\/\/www.bhf.org.uk\/informationsupport\/risk-factors). According to another source [4](https:\/\/www.heart.org\/en\/health-topics\/heart-attack\/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack), the major factors that can't be changed are: **increasing age, male gender and heredity**. Note that **thalassemia**, one of the variables in this dataset, is heredity. Major factors that can be modified are: **Smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, and being overweight and having diabetes**. Other factors include **stress, alcohol and poor diet\/nutrition**.\n\nI can see no reference to the 'number of major vessels', but given that the definition of heart disease is **\"...what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries\"**, it seems logical the *more* major vessels is a good thing, and therefore will reduce the probability of heart disease.\n\nGiven the above, I would hypothesis that, if the model has some predictive ability, we'll see these factors standing out as the most important.","d97dfd1d":"# The Explanation\n\nNow let's see what the model gives us from the ML explainability tools.\n\n**Permutation importance** is the first tool for understanding a machine-learning model, and involves shuffling individual variables in the validation data (after a model has been fit), and seeing the effect on accuracy.
