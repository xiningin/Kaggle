LightAutoML installation","26266c0b":"# Step 4. Feature importances calculation \n\nFor feature importances calculation we have 2 different methods in LightAutoML:\n- Fast (`fast`) - this method uses feature importances from feature selector LGBM model inside LightAutoML. It works extremely fast and almost always (almost because of situations, when feature selection is turned off or selector was removed from the final models with all GBM models). no need to use new labelled data.\n- Accurate (`accurate`) - this method calculate *features permutation importances* for the whole LightAutoML model based on the **new labelled data**. It always works but can take a lot of time to finish (depending on the model structure, new labelled dataset size etc.).\n\nIn the cell below we will use `automl_rd.model` instead `automl_rd` because we want to take the importances from the model, not from the report. But **be carefull** - everything, which is calculated using `automl_rd.model` will not go to the report.","ad0e2e4c":"To solve the task, we need to setup columns roles.

It's interactive so you can click the black triangles on the left of the texts to go deeper in selected part.","cdf8871a":"# Step 0.1.

Create submission file","525e5e62":"In next the cell we are going to create LightAutoML model with `TabularAutoML` class - preset with default model structure like in the image below:\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sberbank-ai-lab\/lightautoml-datafest-workshop\/raw\/master\/imgs\/tutorial_blackbox_pipeline.png\" alt=\"TabularAutoML preset pipeline\" style=\"width:70%;\"\/>\n\nin just several lines. Let's discuss the params we can setup:\n- `task` - the type of the ML task (the only **must have** parameter)\n- `timeout` - time limit in seconds for model to train\n- `cpu_limit` - vCPU count for model to use\n- `reader_params` - parameter change for Reader object inside preset, which works on the first step of data preparation: automatic feature typization, preliminary almost-constant features, correct CV setup etc. For example, we setup `n_jobs` threads for typization algo, `cv` folds and `random_state` as inside CV seed.\n- `general_params` - we use `use_algos` key to setup the model structure to work with (Linear and LGBM model on the first level and their weighted composition creation on the second). This setup is only to speedup the kernel, you can remove this `general_params` setup if you want the whole LightAutoML model to run.\n\n**Important note**: `reader_params` key is one of the YAML config keys, which is used inside `TabularAutoML` preset. [More details](https:\/\/github.com\/sberbank-ai-lab\/LightAutoML\/blob\/master\/lightautoml\/automl\/presets\/tabular_config.yml) on its structure with explanation comments can be found on the link attached. Each key from this config can be modified with user settings during preset object initialization. To get more info about different parameters setting (for example, ML algos which can be used in `general_params->use_algos`) please take a look at our [article on TowardsDataScience](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/lightautoml-preset-usage-tutorial-2cce7da6f936).\n\nMoreover, to receive the automatic report for our model we will use `ReportDeco` decorator and work with the decorated version in the same way as we do with usual one.
