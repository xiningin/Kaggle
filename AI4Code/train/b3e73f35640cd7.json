Let's take a look how it affects the average prices on avocados. We will use the technique **indexing pandas time series** to make it easy.\n\nDataset already has a column named `Date`, so all we have to do is converting this feature to proper type and implement it as an index.","9e564049":"## Correlation Between Numeric and Non Numeric Feature","7183e867":"Let's visualize this correlation by using **scatter plot**.\n\nComparison between the feature `Total Volume` and features `Small Bags`, `Large Bags`, `XLarge Bags`, respectively:","3bcc95d3":"# EDA for Avocado Prices Dataset\n\nHere in this kernel, we will be exploring the Avocado Prices Dataset by using dedicated libraries and making visualizations.\n\nLet's begin with importing the necessary libraries:","cf3ea35f":"By examining a single row, we can say something further about the dataset.

We can easily observe that `AveragePrice` has nothing to do with the type or number of bags.  But we can say, as `Total Volume` gets a higher value, the number of `Small Bags` increases faster than `Large Bags` and `XLarge Bags`.\n\nIt seems like examining the correlation between the volume of a single avocado (`Total Volume`) and the type of bag (`Small Bags`, etc) may take us somewhere.","8b381b04":"And fetch the dataset into `df`.","82e47a9f":"A bunch of numbers scaled between 0 and 1, indicating the correlation between features. `seaborn` comes in handy here to visualize these correlations, via `sns.heatmap()` method.","8d3ea687":"Now it's time to take a look at data!","ded7ba78":"At the first glance, we can observe that dataset covers avocados observed from 2015 to 2018.","bb3d3e16":"Now it is perfect time to examine the relationships between features, by using `df.corr()` method.","96db7b0e":"Strictly speaking, `Unnamed: 0` is an index feature which gets zero as `region` changes.\n\nWe can even make an intuitive comparison between two samples. Let's compare the samples with indexes `3` and `18240`. Fetching them into two distinct dataframes and then concatenating those frames will help us to see them sequently.","5c5dd82e":"We fetched the first 5 samples in the dataset by using `df.head()` method.

Filtering the dataset with arbitrary values may help us to get shallow observations.\n\nLet's declare our arbitrary threshold as 2.0, so prices higher than this value will be claimed as expensive."}}
