brown and may rot due to secondary fungus infection\n\n1. yellowing along veins on lower\/older leaves ~ 3 months after planting\n2. dark brown spots on upper green portion of stem ~ 6 months after planting\n3. Severe cases- leaf drying, shoot die-back\n4. In Tuber - Brown and hard rot when you cut into it. Causes malformation and root\nconstriction ~ 10 months after planting\n\nThe origin of CBSD is suspected to have arisen from the viruses that are already present on the indigenous African flora. Virus structure and properties: The microscopic studies revealed that the virus is 650 nm long and earlier it was believe to be carlavirus.\nDisease diagnosis: The first and foremost important aspect is to identify the disease correctly. Cassava brown streak disease varies in symptoms which made it difficult to identify in the field. It makes further complicated if both cassava brown streak and cassava mosaic diseases occur together. There are few techniques like serological and molecular methods are used to identify the virus in laboratory but have their limitations.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/plantvillage-production-new\/images\/pics\/000\/001\/095\/original\/Cassava_brown_streak_2.jpg?1375898926\" alt=\"Smiley face\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" style=\"float:left\">","368570d9":"Scientific Name\nCassava green mottle nepovirus. It has not been confirmed to be a nepovirus; these are viruses that are transmitted by nematodes - hence the name.\n\nDistribution\nNarrow. Only known from Solomon Islands. It was first found on Choiseul in the 1970s; more recently (2010), similar symptoms were seen on Malaita.\n\nHosts\nIt is only known from cassava, and only from Choiseul (and possibly Malaita), nowhere else in the world. In the lab, several plant species have been infected with this virus; these species are known as \"indicator\" plants and are used to identify and characterise many kinds of viruses\n\nSymptoms & Life Cycle\nYoung leaves are puckered with faint to distinct yellow spots (Photo 1), green patterns (mosaics), and twisted margins (Photo 2). Usually, the shoots recover from symptoms and appear healthy. Occasionally, plants become severely stunted, edible roots are absent or, if present, they are small and woody when cooked.\n\nIn the lab, the virus can be passed between plants in sap, and also in seed. Thirty percent of the seed of infected tobacco plants was infected. Whether it also spreads in seed of cassava is unknown. Seed is not used for growing cassava, so spread on Choiseul is most likely in diseased cuttings. However, there are other possibilities.\n\nImpact\nSurveys on Chosieul showed that the disease is present in most plantings, but the number of infected plants is low. Cuttings taken from diseased plants are much slower to develop than those from plants without symptoms during the previous 9 months, and assumed to be healthy.\n\nDetection & Inspection\nLook for yellow patterns on the leaves, from small dots to irregular patches of yellow and green. Look for leaf margins that are distorted. The plants may be stunted.","5ba8e4c8":"<h2 style='background:#4974a5; border:50; color:white'><center>Class 4 - Healthy - Total: 2577<center><h2>  ","0fd3726f":"<h2 style='background:#4974a5; border:50; color:white'><center>Class 2 - Cassava Green Mottle (CGM) -  Total: 2386<center><h2> \n","b8d85e1d":"<h1 style='background:#4974a5; border:50; color:white'><center>Plotting samples of each class<center><h1>","98225cce":"<h2 style='background:#4974a5; border:50; color:white'><center>Class 0 - Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB) - Total: 1087<center><h2> ","da8107bf":"## We can see that there is an imbalance between classes.
