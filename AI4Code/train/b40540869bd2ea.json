So this [article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/mastering-the-features-of-google-colaboratory-92850e75701) helps you to solve this issue (I was the one who wrote this article :0).

This was just to give an idea as to how the process of data cleaning looks like in a beginners perspective. Thank you guys for spending your time reading my article, stay tuned for more updates.

I will make sure that everyone with no prior experience in python programming or don\u2019t know what is data science or data cleaning can easily understand this tutorial. I'm not very good at python in the first place, so even for me, this was a good place to start. One thing with python is that the code is self-explanatory, your focus should not be what the code does, because the code pretty much says what it does, rather you should tell why did you choose to do this, the \u201cwhy\u201d factor is important than the \u201cwhat\u201d factor.
