Weekdays seems to be slightly higher than Weekends in most cases except for Northern and Central cities. The Western cities clearly show a chunk more contribution of `CO` during the weekdays, we can say Ahmedabad alone contributes to pretty much for most if not all other cities put together. We can see groupings between the other cities where their levels are similar in proportion.","ceb36035":"<i><p style=\"font-size:20px; background-color: #FFF1D7; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">Here are a handful of cities from among the **26** cities that have readings for all the AQI Bucket types, that is about 14 of the 26 cities i.e. only ~54% of the total. This tallies again with previous observations of absense of readings leading to absence of AQI Bucket types.","0c690afe":"<a id='ToC'><\/a>\n\n----------\n\n# Table of content\n\n- [Installing packages and libraries](#installation)\n- [Loading datasets](#loading_datasets)\n- [Commonly used variables and functions](#common_functions)\n- [Summary](#summary)\n- [Filling missing values (rest of the four tables)](#missing_values_four_tables)\n- [Filling missing values (Stations table)](#missing_values)\n   - After filling in missing values in the original Stations table\n- [Station's status analysis](#station_status_analysis)\n   - city_day table: Inactive and Unknown status Stations across the Cities\n   - city_hour table: Inactive and Unknown status Stations across the Cities\n   - station_day table: Inactive and Unknown status Stations across the Cities\n   - station_hour table: Inactive and Unknown status Stations across the Cities\n- [Pivot tables, visualisations and charts: CO levels and AQI Bucket\/AQI Acceptability](#pivots_visualisations_charts)\n   - CO levels across Cities and Years (using city_day table)\n   - CO levels across Cities and Seasons (using city_day table)\n   - CO levels across Cities and Months (using city_day table)\n   - CO levels across Cities and Weekday\/weekend (using city_hour table)\n   - CO levels across Cities and Holiday\/Regular day (using city_hour table)\n   - CO levels across Cities and Day period (using city_hour table)\n- [Trying to understand the interaction of AQI\/AQI Bucket\/AQ Acceptability and Cities](#aqi_bucket_and_acceptability)\n   - AQI Bucket and Cities\n   - AQI Bucket and Cities: readings available across all bucket types\n   - AQI Bucket and Cities: readings available across one or more bucket types (but not all)\n   - AQ Acceptability and Cities: listed by Acceptable AQ\n   - AQ Acceptability and Cities: listed by Unacceptable AQ","a1746b2a":"<a id='aqi_bucket_and_acceptability'><\/a>\n\n----------\n\n\n## Trying to understand the interaction of AQI\/AQI Bucket\/AQ Acceptability and Cities","a50ec34f":"<a id='common_functions'><\/a>\n\n----------\n\n## Commonly used variables and functions","0c49ff99":"<i><p style=\"font-size:20px; background-color: #FFF1D7; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">Here are the handful of cities from among the **26** cities that have readings for all the years between 2015 and 2020, that is about 8 of the 26 cities i.e. only ~30% of the total. \n    \n<i><p style=\"font-size:20px; background-color: #FFF1D7; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">For cities where it is visible, Bengaluru, Delhi, Lucknow and Chennai show marked improvements since 2015 and the years to follow until 2020 (although we don't have all the data for 2020).\n    \n<i><p style=\"font-size:20px; background-color: #FFF1D7; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">On the other hand cities like Ahmedabad, Gurugram, Patna, and Hyderabad do not give a clear indication of improvements since 2015 and the years to follow until 2020 (although we don't have all the data for 2020).
