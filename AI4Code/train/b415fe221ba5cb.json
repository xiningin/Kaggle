psychological and educational variables are distributed approximately normally. Measures of reading ability, introversion, job satisfaction, and memory are among the many psychological variables approximately normally distributed. although the distributions are only approximately normal, they are usually quite close.\n\nIt is very helpful in forecasting .We can calculate the estimated length of the bones of animals and woods and leaves . because if animals are one type their numbering is normally distributed .\n\nSecond reason the normal distribution is so important is that it is easy for mathematical statisticians to work with.Normal distribution is very useful for controlling the quality in business. With this we can fix the limit of quality . that will helpful for controlling the quality .\n\nIf we take one sample out of the universe and calculate the mean size of growing then it will normal distribution This means that many kinds of statistical tests can be derived for normal distributions. Almost all statistical tests discussed in this text assume normal distributions. Fortunately, these tests work very well even if the distribution is only approximately normally distributed. Some tests work well even with very wide deviations from normality.","70d3bf8e":"<a id=\"p5\"><\/a>\n# 5. Feature Engineering\n\n","eb6e371a":"## Improving Classifier Performance With Synthetic Features\nWhen you train a classifier on a dataset, often that you are stuck at a certain performance and are unable to get past it. At this time, you may add new training data, use a more complex model, etc to boost the performance of the classifier. However, you may not always be able to add more training data, or may have a large dataset such that using a more complex model is infeasible computationally.\nSo, what can I do?\n\nWe can add synthetic features to the dataset, which is a form of feature engineering. You can view it as adding a higher level representation of the raw dataset.\nFor instance, if you have to predict whether it is feasible to drive between two pairs of latitude and longitude points. Let\u2019s say feasible is that we are driving our car and we can\u2019t drive for many days. Then, the dataset would look something like this: we have in our datasets 2 columns somehow related to each other like siblings column which has the number of sibling with a certain person and parents column which is the number of accompaning parents with a certain person and if he is alone or not.","6ec724c1":"Don't you see the difference? now let's move on to the next step\n","c82bf88f":"## An easy way to directly visualize whether a certain feature is affecting  our target is Correlation heat maps  ","80814630":"<a id=\"p2\"><\/a>\n# 2.

The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. so let's have an example let's you have a dataset with like 100 people and their interests and you would like to group them according to interests, see no labels are here. simple?","f4bf2fa0":"Last feature is the name the technique i am about to inroduce is a bit counter intuitive but trust me it worked, we can extract some useful information from names column , actual names are actually means nth  so why don't we extract these info from the names columns what if we just extracted Mr., Mrs,Doc so we can see if Doc are more likely to survive or its Mr or Mrs and so on don't you think it will help our classifier to achieve a better accuracy, let's find out\n","b7622f14":"Nth is clear right so the righ tool at this moment is to plot the data and see what it represents, so let's plot the Age data","084ad5b0":"Perfect? but wait a second don't you think that the values in Age and Fare are a bit in a different range than the rest of our columns , wouldnt it be a problem? yes  of course we should put all our datasets in the same range in order to achieve normalization and  normalization in statistics basically means:\nI have dataset 1 with possible values from 0-1000 randomly distributed.\nI have dataset 2 with possible values from 0-1 randomly distributed.\n\nIf I want to compare the distributions between dataset 1 and dataset 2 I would normalize the data by either dividing every value in dataset 1 by 1000 or multiplying every value in dataset 2 by 1000. Then the 2 datasets are comparable and can be merged. so this leads us to what's called feature rescaling.","2263dd27":"Before i may proceed as long as the square infront of a specific feature lies on the left  getting more navy and the number in it is closer to 1 that means that it's strongly correlated with the feature lies down. One thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information.

In **fitting** batch_size is an important parameter and its just how many data the model should run through before it update its weights, epochs are the iteration through data","b8b57f34":"\n# Figure out why the data is missing\n\nThis is the point at which we get into the part of data science that I like to call \"data intution\", by which I mean \"really looking at your data and trying to figure out why it is the way it is and how that will affect your analysis\". It can be a frustrating part of data science, especially if you're newer to the field and don't have a lot of experience. For dealing with missing values, you'll need to use your intution to figure out why the value is missing. One of the most important question you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this:\n\n    Is this value missing becuase it wasn't recorded or becuase it dosen't exist?\n\nIf a value is missing becuase it doens't exist  then it doesn't make sense to try and guess what it might be. These values you probalby do want to keep as NaN. On the other hand, if a value is missing becuase it wasn't recorded like for example here in Embarked, Age columns, then you can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row. (This is called \"imputation\" and we'll learn how to do it next! :)\n\nLet's work through an example. Looking at the number of missing values in the **train** dataframe, I notice that the column **Cabin** has a lot of missing values in it:\n","2d13aa3a":"<a id=\"p4\"><\/a>\n# 4. Data Cleaning(Handling missing values) \nThe first thing I do when I get a new dataset is take a look at some of it. This lets me see that it all read in correctly and get an idea of what's going on with the data. In this case, I'm looking to see if I see any missing values, which will be reprsented with NaN or None.\n## See how many missing data points we have\n","c0e09dc7":"Perfect we are done with titles so now feel free to drop the Name column as it did the job it meant to do also PassengerId, Ticket, these columns will just deflects our learning process","6a5280bd":"So we can see that women from the first class are the most likely to survive then comes women from class 2 ","130c2ce2":"<a id=\"p8\"><\/a>\n# 8.

Let's see how many we have in each column.","5a8c852f":"Gender appears to be a very good feature to use to predict survival, as shown by the large difference in propotion survived so as you can see in the plot if you are a woman then your likelyhood to survive is more than double the men likelyhood . Let's take a look at how class plays a role in survival as well. ","2d0e3afa":"Looks like the distribution of ages is slightly skewed right. Because of this, we can fill in the null values with the median for the most accuracy. \n> **Note:** We do not want to fill with the mean because the skewed distribution means that very large values on one end will greatly impact the mean, as opposed to the median, which will only be slightly impacted.","5f6edea1":"If you made it this far, congratulations!! You have gotten a glimpse at an introduction to data visualization, analysis and Deep Learning. You are well on your way to become a Data Science expert! Keep learning and trying out new things, as one of the most important things for Data Scientists is to be creative and perform analysis hands-on.

Categorical data might not have a logical order. For example, categorical predictors include gender, material type, and payment method. \n### Discrete variable\n    Discrete variables are numeric variables that have a countable number of values between any two values. A discrete variable is always numeric. For example, the number of customer complaints or the number of flaws or defects. \n### Continuous variable\n    Continuous variables are numeric variables that have an infinite number of values between any two values. A continuous variable can be numeric or date\/time. For example, the length of a part or the date and time a payment is received.
