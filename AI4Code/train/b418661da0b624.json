You can use any chart type (_line chart, bar chart, heatmap, etc_) of your choosing!","ff98f447":"## Step 1: Attach a dataset to the notebook\n\nBegin by selecting a CSV dataset from [Kaggle Datasets](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasets).  If you're unsure how to do this or would like to work with your own data, please revisit the instructions in the previous tutorial.\n\nOnce you have selected a dataset, click on the **[+ Add Data]** option in the top right corner.  This will generate a pop-up window that you can use to search for your chosen dataset.  \n\n![ex6_search_dataset](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cIIWPUS.png)\n\nOnce you have found the dataset, click on the **[Add]** button to attach it to the notebook.  You can check that it was successful by looking at the **Data** dropdown menu to the right of the notebook -- look for an **input** folder containing a subfolder that matches the name of the dataset.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nMYc1Nu.png\" width=30%><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nYou can click on the carat to the left of the name of the dataset to double-check that it contains a CSV file.  For instance, the image below shows that the example dataset contains two CSV files: (1) **dc-wikia-data.csv**, and (2) **marvel-wikia-data.csv**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/B4sJkVA.png\" width=30%><br\/>\n<\/center>\n\nOnce you've uploaded a dataset with a CSV file, run the code cell below **without changes** to receive credit for your work!","d13c8a80":"The questions below will give you feedback on your work. Run the following cell to set up the feedback system.","05b93a64":"## Step 2: Specify the filepath\n\nNow that the dataset is attached to the notebook, you can find its filepath.  To do this, begin by clicking on the CSV file you'd like to use.  This will open the CSV file in a tab below the notebook.  You can find the filepath towards the top of this new tab.  \n\n![ex6_filepath](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fgXQV47.png)\n\nAfter you find the filepath corresponding to your dataset, fill it in as the value for `my_filepath` in the code cell below, and run the code cell to check that you've provided a valid filepath.  For instance, in the case of this example dataset, we would set\n```\nmy_filepath = \"..\/input\/fivethirtyeight-comic-characters-dataset\/dc-wikia-data.csv\"\n```  \nNote that **you must enclose the filepath in quotation marks**; otherwise, the code will return an error.\n\nOnce you've entered the filepath, you can close the tab below the notebook by clicking on the **[X]** at the top of the tab."}}
