With help from Plotly's interactive visualizations, we can see a few things. \n- The majority of the facilities in the country are government-owned. \n- Most of the facilities are Tier 3 with <1,000 patients per month.\n- Clinics are the most common facility type.\n- The southern and coastal areas of Ghana have the most infastructure in place and Tier 2 facilities.\n- Most government owned facilites are spread out and further north in the country."}}
