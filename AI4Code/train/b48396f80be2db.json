Votes cast 4 years ago may be out of date. Instead, we need to find the recent weighted average. The reason we use the time-weighted average is because we want to give a coefficient to the most recently cast votes. Because the last votes represent the product up to date. For example, there may have been a problem with deliveries recently. That's why people will give it a lower rating. This scoring method will represent the product much better for customers.","5be50597":"**As a result:** We have reached the top 10 reviews that best represent the product. We have created the ranking not according to the highest scores, but according to the reviews that best represent the product.

That's why we gave more coefficients to those with a small day_diff so that it has a greater effect on the result. The largest day_diff ones show a very distant date, so we lowered their coefficients. These coefficients may vary from person to person. As can be seen, there was an increase of approximately 0.11 in time-weighted scoring.","c87f614b":"### **Task 2: Determine the 10 reviews that will be displayed on the product detail page for the product.**\nWe will use the Wilson Lower Bound method. In short, we can say that this method works according to the logic of liked\/disliked, useful\/not useful.\n\nhelpful_yes \u2192 indicated that the review was found useful. To use the Wilson Lower Bound method, let's create a variable called helpful_no.\n\n**Total Votes \u2014 Useful Votes = Useless Votes**"}}
