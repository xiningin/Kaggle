In daily life, we often see that emergency vehicles face difficulty in passing through traffic. So differentiating a vehicle into an emergency and non emergency category can be an important component in traffic monitoring as well as self drive car systems as reaching on time to their destination is critical for these services.\n\nIn this problem, you will be working on classifying vehicle images as either belonging to the emergency vehicle or non-emergency vehicle category. For the same, you are provided with the train and the test dataset.
