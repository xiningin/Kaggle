H2O\u2019s AutoML can be used for automating the machine learning workflow, which includes automatic training and tuning of many models within a user-specified time-limit. Stacked Ensembles \u2013 one based on all previously trained models, another one on the best model of each family \u2013 will be automatically trained on collections of individual models to produce highly predictive ensemble models which, in most cases, will be the top performing models in the AutoML Leaderboard.# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n"}}
