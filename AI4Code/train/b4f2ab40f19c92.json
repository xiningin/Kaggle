However, I'm not sure how it \"should\" be have after the curve has been flattened out (as is the case with South Korea).

","cfdc321b":"### Miscellaneous\nBelow is just some miscellaneous fiddling I've been doing looking at the ratio of recovered to fatalities. Or other comparison that I may put further up.","1f45f9c0":"Here are the actual predictions. The first is the actual number of cases in the U.S. based on the mean death rate in South Korea. South Korea has had the best testing, and the death rate has remained mainly level, so it is being used as a base line to predict the actual cases in the U.S. \n\nThe other plot is a prediction based on the median growth for the last month. The goal is not to have an accurate prediction, but to have a baseline to measure improvement against. Social distancing and closuers didn't really start in the U.S. until the last several weeks. Hopefully, the effects of those closures will be seen in the difference between the two, the third graph. Which if things are doing well in the U.S. will be negative.\n\nAdditionally, I've added a new prediction based on the difference from my first flat rate prediction. At first I attempted to fit it to an exponential, which had difficulties matching the original curve. I then tried a polynomial fit, which fits the data I gave it; however, doesn't work after extending it out to the end of April. \n\nForthcoming: Figure something else out. ","442ba426":"## Additional Dataset\nThe following sections are processing an additional dataset to have the newest data to analyze. However, there are some discrepancies between the two sets.\n\nThe original data set \"Novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset\" has time-series data that hasn't been updated since March 14th. This appears to be the maintainers intention, as specific country level datasets are being mentioned in other areas. \n\nThe discrepancies are not large in most cases, and may only be due to differences in classifying situations like the Diamond Princess. Timely analysis with current data is more of a pressing concern, so this alternate dataset will be used for analysis below. ","b2b1fd57":"## Data Analysis","4dbb1d8d":"My initial thoughts on this analyis are based on the information provided by 3Blue1Brown's video here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/Kas0tIxDvrg.\n\nAs I am given to understand, South Korea has undergone a lot of rigourous testing and containment efforts, and so likely is the most ideal model to base actual spread on. Any other countries will have a much wider spread in where they fit based on how much testing they've been doing at any one time.\n\nAdditionally, while the virus will mutate as it spreads, I am assuming that transmissions and mortatlity rates stay roughly the same. \n\n## Recent Updates:\n\n* Jun 15, 2020: Added additional fourier analysis of daily case change.\n* May 14, 2020: Added some Fourier Analysis of the \"new daily fatalities\", there's some recent periodicity on a 6 day scale.\n* April 4th, 2020: Attempt at something other than a flat rate prediction. Didn't work out well. Leaving in until I figure something better. \n* March 31st, 2020: Added a rolling 7 day graph for looking at the number of negative 2nd derivatives. This should hopefully help to tell if things are slowing down. The original graph itself is super noisy, and even looking at a heatmap is a bit of a mess. \n* March 30th, 2020: Changed a couple of graphs to log scale. My US cases are deviating in an exponential way from my inital base-line predictions. (This is good because it's smaller than my base-line). \n* March 26th, 2020: Added a graph and some explanation in the \"predictions\" section. Note: It's not so much predictions as it is a baseline to measure the U.S. doing \"better\" against. \n* March 25th, 2020: Data update. US had a spike on the 19th. Appears to be trending downward from there, which is good news.\n* * Added some addtional predictions based on the median growth rate for the US for the last month. It's depressing, but hopefully we'll start seeing some improvements due to all of the social distancing. \n* March 23rd, 2020: Graphical cleanup and added some percentage change graphs. \n* March 20th, 2020: Updated for latest data, saw jump in US deaths. Creating a separate notebook to analyze that data.\n* March 19th, 2020: Updated code to use alternate dataset. Initial analysis shows a daily differential drop in daily cases and deaths for March 18th in the US. Further investigation ongoing to determine if this is a data processing issue or something else.\n\n## TODO:\n* Get rid of the polynomial prediction and find something that fits better.\n* Add a flat rate sigmoid prediction that follows my original flat rate prediction, but maxes out at the max US population (instead of exceeding it as the flat rate prediction does before the end of April. \n* * Tried this, initial attempt didn't work out well. \n","dbedcb2c":"### Fourier analysis\nA friend of mine noted that he thought he saw some periodicity in the new daily fatalities data. Looking at the graphs, he seemd to be on to something, so I decided to see if I could pull anything out. There's a larger spike in the frequencies at 6 days, which is close enough to a week that it's probably due to some sort of reporting issues.","c55faf97":"Based on these graphs, and the graphs of the number of cases further above, it appears that South Korea passed an inflection point around March 2nd. However, the noiseiness of the raw data makes it difficult to ascertain that.\n","6a584eeb":"## Predictions\nThe predictions here are based on using South Korea's data as a model to build other trends off of. One of the underlying issues seems to be that testing in the U.S. is not very widespread and so any predictions based on the number of confirmed cases is going to have additional variability due to the changing nature of the testing process. The approach here is to use the death rate percentage of South Korea as a model of prediction for the U.S.\n\n### Underlying Assumptions\nThere are a couple of underlying assumptions that may affect the validity of these predictions. Firstly, South Korea appears to be one of the better case scenarios where the spread was able to be contained and properly treated. Additionally, this assumes that the virus has a constant death rate when medical treatement is able to be given to all cases. \n\nIf the virus spread is not properly contained and heath systems are overwhelmed then the death rate should start to significantly rise, at which point these predictions will no longer be valid.","8b44209d":"The data for the second derivative is still a bit of a mess because the first derivative isn't smooth. There are at least two ways that can be addressed. First, a running average of the original first derivative data. The second way is by fitting the original data to known smooth functions. Ideally, this would be the logistic function, or some other function that similarly levels off after a certain point. However, if there is not a clear inflection point or maximum for the data, then that may not be a realizeable option. \n","1cc2ab2e":"### Rate of Change\nIn any outbreak like this, the most pressing question seems to be when do things start getting better. Ultimately, that should be when an inflection point in the number of cases has been passed. If appropriate measures are being used to contain the spread of the disease, then it should start to flatten out at a certain point. As per the video mentioned above by 3Blue1Brown*, this situaion can be modeled with a logistic function, which has an inflection point at the halfway point. \n\nAn inflection point is where the second derivative transisitions from positive to negative, or vice-versa. In this particular case, the number of cases starts to flatten out when the second derivative starts to become negative (concave down). \n\n*Note: References are needed to support the claim of 3Blue1Brown. \n****"}}
