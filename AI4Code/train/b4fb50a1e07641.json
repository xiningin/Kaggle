Today we\u2019re going to do two things:\n\n1. Get our code ready to be served through an app\n2. Write a Flask app (well, most of one)\n\nLet\u2019s get started!\n\n# Get your modelling code ready to be put in an app\n\nSince you spent some time thinking about your app yesterday, you hopefully have a pretty good idea what you want your Python code to do. Today we\u2019re going to follow a three-step model of development. \n\n* **Make it work**. The first thing you want to do is get your code doing whatever it is that you intend for it to do. It doesn\u2019t have to be beautiful or perfectly optimized (you can always go back and refector it later), it just needs to work.\n* **Make it pretty**. At this stage, you can spend some time tidying up your code. Adding comments, creating functions for particular tasks, making sure your variable names are informative; things that will make it easier for other people to read and use your code.\n* **Make it portable**. Finally, you want to make your code portable. This includes saving out your model so that you can load it into a new session and use it to make predictions.\n\nLet\u2019s see an example of what this process looks like. \n\n## Make it work\n\nFirst, I wrote a quick script that gets all instances of Python package names & their indexes from some sample text. The general workflow is: \n\n1. Get a list of Python packages (from [this list](https:\/\/hugovk.github.io\/top-pypi-packages\/) helpful maintained by [hugovk on GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/hugovk)). \n2. Use that list to create a flashtext KeywordProcessor object. This object will let us use flashtext to find our terms. **Flashtext can be more than 20 times faster than using regular expressions to extract a list of keywords** and you also don't have to write any Perl. You can find more information about the package [here](https:\/\/flashtext.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/).\n3. Remove common English words and words that are used often on the Kaggle forums, since these are unlikely to be referring to a specific Python package. ([Even though there is a Python package called \"the\"](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/the\/) and people write \"the\" very often in the forums, they're never actually talking about the package called \"the\".)\n4. Put our KeywordProcessor into action and see if it works!","e3c10f28":"From here, we can load our model back in, assign it to a variable and apply it right away. \n\n> **How can I download my trained model from this notebook?** Right now, once you've saved a file, the easiest way to download it is to commit your notebook. Then you'll be able to download it from the \"output\" section of the notebook viewer. This will also give you a record of what code was used to produce your file so you can reproduce your work later on.","4651d6f0":"**Make it pretty!** Copy and paste your code from the cell above into this cell. Now you can spend some time commenting and refactoring your code so that it\u2019s ready to share. I\u2019d recommend at the very least writing a function to apply your model. ","9658a960":"Yay, it works! The code isn't the prettiest, though. Even though I've included comments, I've just done everything in a single long script. If I break my code up into functions it will make it more modular and easier to read.\n\n## Make it pretty\n\nMy main goal in gussying up my code is to make it easier to add to my app later. So, I want to create functions that will let me do this. I broke my code into two functions. \n\n* One function does what I want my app to do: takes in a pre-trained model (here our word processor) and then applies it\n* The other creates a keyword model, automating the preprocessing we did. That way if we want to create a new keyword processor with different words in the future we can easily do that.\n\nWith a little refactoring, my code now looks like this:","628a1d29":"## Make it portable\n\nSo far, we've gotten our code working and have refactored it so that it's more modular and other people trying to use it will be able to follow it more easily. But how can we take a model we've trained in one place and apply it in another? By saving the model and then loading it into a new environment. \n\n> In general, ML APIs are used for inference. In other words, you have a pre-trained model that is applied to the data that is sent to it. You could create an API that trains models, but you will probably have to end up having to pay for the compute used to train those models. This can become expensive. Particularly since I'm not covering how to do authentication, which means anyone would be able to train as many models as they wanted with your API, **I'd recommend avoiding including model training in your API.** I'm assuming going forward that your API will use a pretrained model.\n\nSo how do you save a model and then read it back into Python? It depends on the specific type of model you're training. \n\n### Library-specific methods for saving models\n\nIf the library you used to train your model has a specific set of methods to save and load model file, then I'd recommend using them. Here are the methods for some popular machine learning libraries.\n\n* For *TensorFlow* and *Keras*, you can save models using `model.save_weights()` and read it in using `model.load_weights()`. By default, your model will be saved as a HDF5 file. You can find [more information on tf here](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/keras\/save_and_restore_models#manually_save_weights) and [more on Keras here](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/beginner\/saving_loading_models.html). .\n* For *PyTorch* you can use `torch.save()` and `torch.load()`. PyTorch saves models as pickles. [More info here](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/beginner\/saving_loading_models.html). \n* For *XGBoost*, you can save models with `model.dump_model()` and load them with `model.load_model()`. [More info here](https:\/\/xgboost.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/python\/python_intro.html#training).\n* For *LightGBM*, you can use `model_to_string()` and `model_from_string()`. [More info here](https:\/\/lightgbm.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/Python-API.html#lightgbm.Booster.model_from_string). \n\n### If there's no library-specific technique\n\nIf the library you're using doesn't have a specific method for saving out models, probably the easiest choice is to save your model as a pickle. [Pickles are a serialized data format for Python](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/2\/library\/pickle.html), which means you can read them directly into your current environment as variables. If your model is built as one or more numpy arrays, [you may be able to use HDF5 instead](https:\/\/www.christopherlovell.co.uk\/blog\/2016\/04\/27\/h5py-intro.html), but pickles can handle more different data structures.\n\n**\ud83e\udd52 A quick warning about pickles \ud83e\udd52** You should be aware that if there are differences between the version or subversion of Python you used to pickle your model and the one you try to unpickle it with, you model can fail to load. (This is also true of packages with different versions!) To avoid this, you can specify the specific versions of Python and each package you used when you create your app in your requirements file. \n\n**\ud83e\udd52\ud83e\udd52 A second quick warning about pickles \ud83e\udd52\ud83e\udd52** While they can be useful for moving Python objects around, it\u2019s also not a very secure file format. [As the Python wiki puts it:](https:\/\/wiki.python.org\/moin\/UsingPickle) \u201cPickle files can be hacked. If you receive a raw pickle file over the network, don't trust it! It could have malicious code in it, that would run arbitrary python when you try to de-pickle it.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the Flashtext module doesn\u2019t have a native way to save a load objects (at least that I can find), so I\u2019ll save my keyword processor as a pickle using the pickle library. \n","0964311a":"See you all tomorrow! :)","a6dc913a":"## Your turn!\n\nNow that you've seen what a very small Flask app looks like, it's time for you to write your own.
