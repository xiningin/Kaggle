Within moments, the library is capable of generating highly informational plots and provides many pathways of potential expansion for a data scientist's modeling or analysis pipeline. AutoViz is meant to be integrated within a systematic iterative process. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) can be effectively initiated with AutoViz; features can be selected based on the tool's analysis and then the data can be repeatedly processed for automatic visualization. Once strong visualizations are generated, a data scientist can now jump into modeling or communicating the data with a well informed analysis. It is surprising that automated visualization options are so sparse given its many conceivable uses as an objective and practical tool, but AutoViz thankfully fulfills this role to great effect. Now let's get some visualizations going!https:\/\/danrothdatascience.github.io\/datascience\/autoviz.html","a7d4b423":"It takes 12 minutes to render the charts from 556 columns."}}
