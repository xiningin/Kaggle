To get the full list, you have to display the content of variable `duplicates`.","19215602":"Wow! It seems there are a lot of similar images in this dataset.

Except some image pre-processing and enhancement, these 3 images are identical.\n\nNow we'll visualise an image for witch imagededup found two images with a threshold of 0 and two others with a threshold of 2.","db0c18d4":"# Conclusions\n\n1. [imagededup](https:\/\/github.com\/idealo\/imagededup) is a powerful tool in your toolbox for various tasks like finding similar images in your dataset, find duplicated images to avoid leaks from train to test dataset...\n\n2. The test dataset has duplicated images. Some image filters were applied to hide this duplication.\n\n3. The test dataset also contains highly correlated images because they were taken at the same location within a short period of time.\n\nThanks for reading! "}}
