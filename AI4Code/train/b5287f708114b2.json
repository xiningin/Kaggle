Preparations\nPreparing packages and data that will be used in the analysis process. Packages that will be loaded are mainly for data manipulation, data visualization and modeling. There are 2 datasets that are used in the analysis, they are train and test dataset. The main use of train dataset is to train models and use it to predict test dataset.

An overview on train and test datasets will include a quick analysis on missing values and basic statistics, while sample submission will be loaded to see the expected submission.\n\n## Train dataset\nAs stated before, train dataset is mainly used to train predictive model as there is an available target variable in this set. This dataset is also used to explore more on the data itself including find a relation between each predictors and the target variable.\n\n**Observations:**\n- `target` column is the target variable which is only available in the `train` dataset.\n- There are `102` columns: `100` features, `1` target variable `target` and `1` column of `id`.\n- `train` dataset contain `600000` rows\n- `test` dataset contain `540000` rows\n- `train` and `test` data has no `NULL` values","b13c70e9":"# 1. Introduction\n\nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, Kaggle have launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than Featured competition, and thus more beginner-friendly.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, but less challenging, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition.\n\nThe data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a real-world dataset used to identify spam emails via various extracted features from the email.\n\nFor this competition, we need to be predicting a binary target based on 100 feature columns given in the data. All columns are continuous.\n\nThe dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting whether a claim will be made on an insurance policy. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.\n\nThe ground truth target is binary valued, but a prediction may be any number from 0.0 to 1.0, representing the probability of a spam.\nSubmissions are evaluated on **area under the ROC curve** between the predicted probability and the observed target."}}
