Today I have finished all basic concepts of python. I will practise all this concepts for few days and then I will move to data science python libraries.\nMy goal for this 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge is to learn machine learning from scratch and help others who want to start their journey in machine learning. Many concepts are known to me, but I am starting from scratch to help beginners of the Machine Learning community and revise concepts.\n\n\nThanks for Reading!","3e67c3ef":"## Creating a list from lines of data","fd3e1355":"## Reading file line by line","30a5a6aa":"## Append text","c41763ba":"## Different modes\n\u2018r\u2019 \u2014 Read mode\nThis mode allows you to read the file\n\n\u2018w\u2019 \u2014 Write mode\nThis mode will enable you to write a file; write mode is preferred when the file is empty because if you use it with a file that has some content, then old content will be erased, and new content will be written.\n\n\u2018a\u2019 \u2014 append mode\nThis mode allows read and write.\n\n\u2018r+\u2019 \u2014 Read and Write mode\nThis mode also allows us to read and write.","23cebdee":"## Exceptions"}}
