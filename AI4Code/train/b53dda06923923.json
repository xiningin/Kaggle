A study from the United Kingdom reported an overall incidence rate of only 4.6 per 100,000 person-years, but estimated that the incidence of IPF increased by 11% annually between 1991 and 2003.

Pulmonary fibrosis can occur in patients with emphysema.\n\n* **Certain occupations.** You have an increased risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis if you work in mining, farming or construction or if you're exposed to pollutants known to damage your lungs.\n\n* **Cancer treatments.** Having radiation treatments to your chest or using certain chemotherapy drugs can increase your risk of pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n* **Genetic factors.** Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, and genetic factors may be a component.","ba716e2b":"# **What is Pulmonary fibrosis(Introduction)**","654be053":"**Complications**\n\nComplications of pulmonary fibrosis may include:\n\n* **High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension).** Unlike systemic high blood pressure, this condition affects only the arteries in your lungs. It begins when the smallest arteries and capillaries are compressed by scar tissue, causing increased resistance to blood flow in your lungs.\n\nThis in turn raises pressure within the pulmonary arteries and the lower right heart chamber (right ventricle). Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious illnesses that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal.\n\n* **Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale).** This serious condition occurs when your heart's lower right chamber (ventricle) has to pump harder than usual to move blood through partially blocked pulmonary arteries.\n\n* **Respiratory failure.** This is often the last stage of chronic lung disease. It occurs when blood oxygen levels fall dangerously low.\n* **Lung cancer.** Long-standing pulmonary fibrosis also increases your risk of developing lung cancer.\n\n* **Lung complications.** As pulmonary fibrosis progresses, it may lead to complications such as blood clots in the lungs, a collapsed lung or lung infections.","69834372":"**Data Description**\n\n* train folder - It contains the patients CT scan images in DICOM format, we splitted CT scans into train and test folders.\n* test folder - Which it holds test set CT scane images in DICOM format.\n* train.csv File - It holds the entire clinical information.

This thickened, stiff tissue makes it more difficult for your lungs to work properly.\n* As pulmonary fibrosis worsens, you become progressively more short of breath.\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n* The scarring associated with pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by a multitude of factors. But in most cases, doctors can't pinpoint what's causing the problem. When a cause can't be found, the condition is termed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n* The lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis can't be repaired, but medications and therapies can sometimes help ease symptoms and improve quality of life. For some people, a lung transplant might be appropriate.","57d3094e":"# Reading Dataset Folder\n\n* I will import required libraries on the place where it requires...
