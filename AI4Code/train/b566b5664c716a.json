To get even better predictive performance, we might consider combining the predictions from each model. This is especially promising if the individual classifiers use different information to form their predictions. An easy way to combine models is a simple majority vote.\n\nThis is quickly implemented:","bb01a02f":"Fortunately, we have no missing values in this data set. However, an important problem in medical monitoring is measurement error. Let's make a scaled boxplot of our features:","19dffad5":"We can also take a look at the distribution of our 24 diagnostic features:","021f403b":"# AdaBoost\nLet's now try another ensemble method known as gradient boosting. A special case of this is the popular AdaBoost algorithm. Let us look at how AdaBoost works: We first set a number of maximum iterations $M$ and initialize a vector of equal observation weights $\\mathbf{w}$, i.e. $w_i=1\/N$ and $N$ the number of observations for $i=1,2,...,N$. We now start iterating from $m=1$ to $m=M$. At each step, we fit a base classifier $G_m(X)$ (e.g. a single decision tree) to the data using observation weights $\\mathbf{w}$. We then compute the weighted error rate \n\\begin{gather*}\n    \\text{err}_m=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i 1_{y_i=G_m(x_i)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i},\n\\end{gather*}\nfrom which we calculate the 'step weight' $\\alpha_m= \\nu \\log((1-\\text{err}_m)\/\\text{err}_m)$, where $\\nu \\in (0,1)$ is a learning rate parameter. We then set new weights (for the next step) according to $w_i=w_i \\exp(\\alpha_m 1_{y_i=G_m(x_i)})$ and finally normalize the weights to sum up to one. This concludes the step, and we repeat until we have reached the maximum number of iterations $M$. The final output of the classifier is simply the majority of classifiers at each step, weighted by step weight: $G(\\mathbf{X})=\\text{sign}\\sum_{i=1}^M \\alpha_m G_m(\\mathbf{X})$.\n\nThis method has been proven to be quite powerful. The intuition for why it works is that at each iteration, training observations are re-weighted by the performance of the current classifier: observations where the current classifier does poorly receive more weight in the next step and vice-versa. This induces the weak learners to gradually improve, and the weighted ensemble performs better the more iterations we perform. The learning rate $\\nu$ leads to slower learning but can prevent overfitting and lead to a more robust out-of-sample performance.\n\nLet's see how this method does on our problem:","b5507a9d":"# Random forests\nRandom forests are a combination of boostrap aggregating ('bagging') and random feature subspaces for decision trees. Bagging is an ensemble method that constructs a number of different training sets by sampling observations with replacement from the original set (this is called a bootstrap). We then fit a base classifier to each bootstrapped training set and aggregate the predictions of each classifier (by averaging them for regression problems or taking the majority vote for classification). This method of creating an ensemble of classifiers usually leads to more robust performance, especially when the variance and likelihood of overfitting of the base classifier is high. These issues are very pronounced for decision trees, which is why they are usually employed in ensembles ('forests'). Bagged trees are called random forest when each tree is fit to a random subset of the features. This leads to greater differences between individual trees, making the ensemble more powerful.\n\nWe now define a random forest classifier: ","f33ab2d1":"Boosting gives us over 95 percent balanced out-of-sample accuracy! The best hyperparameters are a maximum tree depth of 4, a learning rate of 0.01, and 1000 iterations.","dfa1442c":"The best performance is achieved with a Gaussiand kernel and a penalty around 20, leading to out-of-sample balanced accuracy of over 93.4 percent!","915026da":"# Outlier treatment\nTo deal with the potential problem of measurement error outlined previously, we simply flag feature values with absolute z-scores above a threshold value $z_{\\text{crit}}$ as errors. The errors are then treated as missing values and imputed via a k-Nearest Neighbors approach. Specifically, a missing feature value of a given observations is imputed as the average value of that feature of the 5 nearest neighbors, where nearest neighbors are observations closest in terms of euclidean distance of the feature matrix. ","30ac7bee":"We now choose the optimal values via 5-fold cross-validation. Since the parameter space to search over quickly becomes very large, it is advisable to optimize only over a subset of parameters at a time when the interaction between those parameters that are left out and those that we optimize over is small. For instance, the outlier threshold only affects few observations and therefore has a negligible effect on the optimal penaty or kernel. On the other hand, for SVM, the kernel function determines the dimension of the space that the optimal separating hyperplane is constructed in. Therefore we can expect the kernel type to have an important effect on the optimal penalty. We therefore start by optimizing kernel type and penalty together:","17414a91":"The optimal performance is achieved for an ensemble of 50 trees, maximum tree depth 5, and 10 random features selected for each tree.

The hyperparameters I want to tune over is the maximum depth of the base classification tree, the number of trees in the ensemble, and the number of features that are randomly selected for each tree.","2389603c":"# Decision trees\nThe next two methods will use decision trees as their base classifiers. Let's just briefly recap what decision trees are. Decision trees consist of a series of splitting rules (which constitute 'nodes') along a feature and a given cutoff. The final predictions depend on which terminal node ('leaf') an observation ends up in when descending through the tree. Below I plotted an example of a decision tree for the data at hand:\n\n![](https:\/\/github.com\/jakob-ra\/Cardiotocography\/raw\/master\/tree.png)\n\nWe start with the full sample (2126 observations) at node $0$. Now, a split occurs according to whether the 'ASTV' variable is lower than $59.5$ and the observations are send to two child nodes accordingly. Another two splits occur at nodes $1$ and $4$ and we are left with four leafs. At each leaf, the final prediction is simply the majority class of observations at that leaf: suspect\/pathological at nodes $2$ and $5$ and normal at nodes $3$ and $6$. Now, how to find the best splitting rule? At each node, we can choose a feature and a threshold to split on. At each node, we choose the splitting rule that leads to the largest decrease in Gini impurity: $G=1-p_{-1}^2-p_{+1}^2 $, wheree $p_{-1}$ and $p_{+1}$ are the shares of class $-1$ and $1$, respecively. We also need to specify some stopping criterion: we will simply set a maximum depth of the tree (the largest distance between the root and a leaf)","8bad99ad":"First, we transform the three-class expert classification (variable 'NSP') to only two classes, normal and suspect\/pathologic. This is in line with the idea of an algorithm that can quickly alert doctors to take a second look at their decision, rather than produce a full diagnosis. It also has the advantage of making this a binary classification problem, which is in many ways easier to deal with. The resulting class distribution is considerably imbalanced, with $77.8$ percent of observations belonging to the normal class.","53e08ca8":"# Introduction\nCardiotocography (CTG) is a technique to record fetal heartbeat and uterine contractions during pregnancy. It is typically used in the third trimester, in which the fetus is prone to sudden drops in oxygen supply (hypoxia). This can lead to death and long-term disability. Based on CTG data, doctors decide whether to perform an intervention, such as a Caesarian section. Doctors typically look at CTG results that have already gone through a signal processing algorithm, and make their decision based on this summary and their medical expertise. \n\nIn this notebook, we aim to predict fetal health status from raw CTG data. The proposed predictive model can help doctors' decision process by providing a simple binary classification of the fetus' status: normal or suspect\/pathological. The goal of this study is therefore not to automate diagnosis but to provide an additional piece of information that might prevent doctors from prescribing unnecessary C-sections or, even worse, fail to intervene when the fetus is in distress.\n\nThe notebook implements and gives a brief theoretical overview over different classifiers, including elastic-net penalized logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and boosted decision trees. It also discusses the 'proper' way to do cross-validation and touches upon how to deal with imbalanced data. Finally, I present stacking the different proposed models as a way to optimize performance in this high-stakes predictive problem.","9e98deaf":"This notebook implements numerous classifiers for the UCI cardiotocography data set.","48fa55b6":"As we can see, there are quite a few observations where a feature value is more than five standard deviations away from the feature mean. These outliers might represent instrument error; but they might also be caused by fat-tails of the true distributions, in which case these values are informative. If the outliers are errors, this can negatively impact the performance of our classifiers. We will discuss outlier detection algorithms and their impact on performance later.\n\nWe can also take a look at feature cross-correlation and their correlation with the outcome variable fetal status:","fc3feaab":"# Model selection and the 'proper' way to cross-validate\nBefore we dive into different classification algorithms, I want to discuss how we can objectively compare model performance. We train the models on the data set at hand, but our goal is to get accurate predictions for $\\textit{new}$ patients who receive a cardiotocography. We therefore need to test how our models would generalize to new data of the same format. In practice, we do this via stratified k-fold cross-validation. The data is divided into $k$ bins ('folds'). The folds are stratified in the sense of preserving class distribution in each fold. Each fold is used once as a test set for a model trained on the $k-1$ other folds. The technique therefore serves to get an approximation of out-of-sample performance.\n\nWe also have to choose a metric for model performance. This should really depend on the costs of a false positive (i.e. an unnecessary C-section) relative to the cost of a false negative (i.e. failing to intervene when the fetus is in distress). Let's be agnostic and simply take the two errors to be equally bad. An appropriate metric is then balanced accuracy. Balanced accuracy is simply the equally weighted average of accuracy in each class. This measure will not be inflated by imbalanced class prevalence and takes into account our assumption that misclassifications are equally bad for both classes. We also apply this to classifiers themselves: all classifiers are fitted using sample weights that weight observations by their inverse class prevalence. This means that errors for both classes are equally weighted, irrespective of class prevalence.\n\nAn important thing to remember when comparing models via cross-validation is to include all pre-processing steps as part of the model pipeline that will be fit only on training data in the respective fold. Let's say we want to apply outlier treatment and feature scaling before applying a SVM classifier. The model pipeline then consists of outlier treatment and scaling, followed by the SVM classifier. At each fold, the whole pipeline needs to be fit to the training data and then evaluated on the test set. This means that the feature means and variances to calculate z-scores and perform scaling is based on the feature distributions in the training set and never the test set. Note that if we would simply preprocess the whole data set before doing cross-validation, we would use information from outside the training set for our predictive model. This is called leakage and can cause inflated out-of-sample scores.\n\nTo compare models, we introduce the following function:","73e3ea1b":"# Data\nThe CTG data set is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The data contains the diagnostic features of 2126 fetal cardiotocograms. The data also contains classification labels assigned by expert obstetricians, who classify 1655 cases as normal, 295 cases as suspicious and 176 cases as pathologic. Here is a first look at the data:","05a0c856":"# SVM\nWe are now ready to do some classification. The first classifier we will use is a support vector machine (SVM). Before we apply SVM,we map the input features into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function. We consider two kernels, Gaussian and polynomial. For the Gaussian kernel, the elements of the kernel matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ are given by $k_{ij} = \\exp(\\gamma||\\mathbf{X}_i - \\mathbf{X}_j||^2)$, where we fix the scale parameter $\\gamma$ to $1\/p$ and $p$ the number of features. For the (inhomogenous) polynomial kernel of degree $d$, we have $k_{ij} = (1 + \\mathbf{X}_i^T\\mathbf{X}_j)^d$.\n\nThe SVM algorithm now constructs an optimal linear decision surface in the higher-dimensional space of the kernel matrix. Predicted values $q_i$ are simply constructed as linear combinations of the predictors: $q_i=c + \\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}w_j$, where $c$ is an intercept and $\\mathbf{w}$ is a vector of predictor weights. We will in the following assume that the two classes in the binary classification problem are coded as $-1$ and $1$. Let $G_{-1}$ and $G_{+1}$ denote the set of indices $i$ where $y_i=-1$ or $y_i=1$, respectively. The loss function of the binary SVM is then given by\n\n\\begin{gather*}\n    L_{SVM}(c,w) = \\sum_{i \\in G_{-1}} \\max(0,q_i+1) + \\sum_{i \\in G_{+1}} \\max(0,1-q_i) + \\lambda \\mathbf{w}' \\mathbf{w}.\n\\end{gather*}\n\nThe loss function consists of the so-called hinge error for both classes, as well as a penalty $\\lambda$ on the size of the weights. Due to the shape of the hinge error, the error is $0$ for most observations. In order to determine the optimal intercept and weights, the only relevant observations are those with non-zero error (these observations form the so-called support vector). The advantage of this method is that it is very fast to compute predictions, and due to the penalization on weights the model can generalize well to new data.\n\nLet's now define an SVM classifier from the skicit-learn package. Note that we specify balanced class weights.","8798dc68":"Some features exhibit significant cross-correlation (both negative and positive); however, we never have exact multicollinearity. Some variables, such as the number of heartrate accelerations ('AC') and uterine contractions ('UC'), correlate positively with normal fetal status (which is coded as -1); while others, such as abnormal long and short term availability ('ALTV' and 'ASTV') and the number of prolongued heartrate deccelerations ('DP') correlate negatively, meaning higher values occur more frequently with suspect\/pathological fetal status (coded as 1). Some of these correlations are substantial but there are no variables with absolute correlation coefficient above 0.5, indicating that no single feature alone can provide good predictions.\n\nNext, we construct our feature matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and vector of labels $\\mathbf{y}$. Before we do this, we shuffle the data once (with fixed seed to make results reproducible) in order to break up any inherent order the observations might have. This is important to get accuracte approximations of out-of-sample performance with cross-validation. "}}
