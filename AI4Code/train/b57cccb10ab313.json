In Convolution layer, we use filters of our desired shape such as (2 x 2) or (3 x 3).After applying these filters on the image we get an image which is enhanced in a certain way. e.g. After using a certain type of filter, it may be that horizontal lines in the image will be highlighted more as compared to rest of shapes. So when using multiple filters (e.g x filters), we get x different images and we use all these filtered images to get features to train the model.Also the  using the convolution we also consider the information in the surrounding pixels of images whih is essential when dealing with images.Here is an example that shows four different images oobtained after applying four filters to a single image.","1199e6c0":"Using the Pooling layer, we actually reduce the size of our image without loosing much image.Here we also use a filter usually (2 x 2) or (3 x 3).In this model we have used maxpooling, which selects the highest value pixel in filter.This image describes the process much easily ","cecc8027":"We use convolutional neural networks in order recognize digits from 0-9.Convolutional neural networks are very much suitable for recognizing images.Although when dealing with numbers such as 6 and 9 which have just different orientation,this type of network may struggle."}}
