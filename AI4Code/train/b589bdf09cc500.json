This time we will unfreeze several layers at a time, instead of unfreezing the whole model at once. It makes a real difference when training NLP classifiers. We pass a slice object to the lr_max parameter. This indicates that we're using discriminative learning rates. It means that the first value of the slice is the first layer's, the second value is the last layer's learning rate. The learning rates of layers in-between are multiplicatively equidistant throughout that range.","aff7c318":"## To classify the reviews we'll be using the ULMFiT (Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning) approach. The first step is to fine-tune a pretrained language model (the model we use here, AWD-LSTM, which stands for Average Stochastic Gradient Descent Weight-Dropped Long Short Term Memory, was trained on Wikipedia pages). We fine-tune it to our corpus of IMDb reviews to make it understand the content of a movie review. This step is valuable, because it helps the model to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting.","8c69ab27":"## In fastai, all of these steps are done automatically, but can be customized to suit our specific needs.","5755a621":"### Create the classifier.","86176a50":"### Save the encoder to use in the text classifier.","a0eed0b3":"### Load saved encoder from our language model.","7209290f":"### Fine-tune the model to IMDb reviews, using the one-cycle approach, where we increase and decrease learning rates in a cyclical manner over the epochs.

We set is_lm (is language model) to True to indicate that we're going to fine-tune a language, not a text classification model.

We can treat the text as categorical variables, but with the addition of the idea of a sequence. The steps to take will be:\n1. Tokenization: Concatenate all of the documents in our dataset into one long string and split it into words (or tokens), which will give us a very long list of them (we call this the vocabulary).\n2. Numericalization: Replace each token with its index in the vocabulary.\n3. Create an embedding matrix for this containing a row for each item of the vocabulary.\n4. Use this embedding matrix as the first layer of a neural network. \n\nNote: In the tokenization process, words are not the only things in the vocabulary. Some special tokens are added, like *xxbos*, which indicates the beginning of a text. There are also rules, for example removing all repetitions of the space character.\n\nOur independent variable will be the sequence of words from the first word in our list and ending with the second to last. Our dependent variable will be the word sequence starting with the second word and ending with the last word."}}
