These plots suggest a possible correlation between the number of implemented measures and both confirmed cases and deaths i.e. in general the countries that implemented more control measures are the ones with more confirmed cases and deaths.\nHowever, we should be cautious with this first observation as correlation doesn't imply causation and one likely explanation in this case is that countries most severely hitted by the outbreak responded to it by enforcing more control measures.\nTo have a clearer idea about that, we should compare the evolution of the number of control measures implemented by the governments and the number of confirmed new cases and deaths worldwide, which I did in subsequent steps.\nIndeed, the analysis of the evolution of the number of confirmed new cases vs number of implemented measures shows that the evolution of the number of implemented measures follows closely that of the number of cases with the exception of an huge peak at early February, likely corresponding to the initial peak in cases in Wuhan, China. This strongly suggests that the high number of control measures like social distancing and the use of PPE was a consequence of the spread of the disease and not a contributing factor. This tendency is more visible when the comparison is with the number of deaths, probably resulting from the fact that this indicator tends to increase slower than the number of cases, as deaths from the disease often occur several weeks after the diagnosis.\nTo draw more definitive conclusions on the impact of the existing containment strategies, we will need more updated data on the evolution of the number of Covid-19 new cases and deaths beyond Mid-March to determine if the measures that governments took (e.g. social distancing and the use of PPE) were successful in flatten the curve of the pandemic both at a worldwide level and at a country or regional level."}}
