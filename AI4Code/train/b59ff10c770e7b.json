If we make a 1 lag shift and train a model on that feature, the model will be able to forecast 1 step ahead from having observed the current state of the series. Increasing the lag, say, up to 6, will allow the model to make predictions 6 steps ahead; however it will use data observed 6 steps back. If something fundamentally changes the series during that unobserved period, the model will not catch these changes and will return forecasts with a large error. Therefore, during the initial lag selection, one has to find a balance between the optimal prediction quality and the length of the forecasting horizon.","2807ef21":"It is clear that the residuals are stationary, and there are no apparent autocorrelations. Let's make predictions using our model.","2c55389d":"Here is the code to render the plots.","44ea4baa":"# Conclusion\n\nWe discussed different time series analysis and prediction methods. Unfortunately, or maybe luckily, there is no one way to solve these kind of problems. Methods developed in the 1960s (and some even in the beginning of the 21st century) are still popular, along with LSTMs and RNNs (not covered in this article). This is partially related to the fact that the prediction task, like any other data-related task, requires creativity in so many aspects and definitely requires research. In spite of the large number of formal quality metrics and approaches to parameters estimation, it is often necessary to try something different for each time series. Last but not least, the balance between quality and cost is important. As a good example, the SARIMA model can produce spectacular results after tuning but can require many hours of ~~tambourine dancing~~ time series manipulation while a simple linear regression model can be built in 10 minutes and can achieve more or less comparable results.","e87a2264":"The process generated by the standard normal distribution is stationary and oscillates around 0 with with deviation of 1. Now, based on this process, we will generate a new one where each subsequent value will depend on the previous one: $x_t = \\rho x_{t-1} + e_t$ ","554034f4":"Unfortunately, we cannot make predictions far in the future -- in order to get the value for the next step, we need the previous values to be actually observed. But moving average has another use case - smoothing the original time series to identify trends. Pandas has an implementation available with [`DataFrame.rolling(window).mean()`](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html). The wider the window, the smoother the trend. In the case of very noisy data, which is often encountered in finance, this procedure can help detect common patterns.","bf59f916":"# Linear (and not quite) models on time series\n\nOften, in my job, I have to build models with [*fast, good, cheap*](http:\/\/fastgood.cheap) as my only guiding principle. That means that some of these models will never be considered \"production ready\" as they demand too much time for data preparation (as in SARIMA) or require frequent re-training on new data (again, SARIMA) or are difficult to tune (good example - SARIMA). Therefore, it's very often much easier to select a few features from the existing time series and build a simple linear regression model or, say, a random forest. It is good and cheap.\n\nThis approach is not backed by theory and breaks several assumptions (e.g. Gauss-Markov theorem, especially for errors being uncorrelated), but it is very useful in practice and is often used in machine learning competitions.\n","adb3c563":"# Econometric approach","4f5858af":"# Feature exctraction","8328841a":"Let's inspect the residuals of the model.","df77b78a":"The test error goes down a little bit.

In addition, all of this will be applied to (harsh) real world examples.","2761c68a":"We'll apply the same algorithm for the second series which, as you may recall, has trend and a 30-day seasonality.","faf4a3ae":"Oh no, this was not as great! Here, we can see the downside of our simple approach -- it did not capture the monthly seasonality in our data and marked almost all 30-day peaks as anomalies. If you want to avoid false positives, it is best to consider more complex models. ","8a0c5109":"It is now much better with the visible seasonality gone. However, the autocorrelation function still has too many significant lags. To remove them, we'll take first differences, subtracting the series from itself with lag 1.","e9fe998f":"We have a winner! This is the smallest error on the test set among all the models we've tried so far. \n\nBut, this victory is decieving, and it might not be the brightest idea to fit `xgboost` as soon as you get your hands on time series data. Generally, tree-based models handle trends in data poorly when compared with linear models. In that case, you would have to detrend your series first or use some tricks to make the magic happen. Ideally, you can make the series stationary and then use XGBoost. For example, you can forecast trend separately with a linear model and then add predictions from `xgboost` to get a final forecast.","199ae115":"### Stationarity\n\nBefore we start modeling, we should mention such an important property of time series: [**stationarity**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stationary_process).\n\nIf a process is stationary, that means it does not change its statistical properties over time, namely its mean and variance. (The constancy of variance is called [homoscedasticity](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Homoscedasticity))The covariance function does not depend on time; it should only depend on the distance between observations. You can see this visually on the images in the post by [Sean Abu](http:\/\/www.seanabu.com\/2016\/03\/22\/time-series-seasonal-ARIMA-model-in-python\/):\n\n- The red graph below is not stationary because the mean increases over time.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/habrastorage.org\/files\/20c\/9d8\/a63\/20c9d8a633ec436f91dccd4aedcc6940.png\"\/>\n\n- We were unlucky with the variance and see the varying spread of values over time\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/habrastorage.org\/files\/b88\/eec\/a67\/b88eeca676d642449cab135273fd5a95.png\"\/>\n\n- Finally, the covariance of the i th term and the (i + m) th term should not be a function of time. In the following graph, you will notice that the spread becomes closer as time increases. Hence, the covariance is not constant with time in the right chart.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/habrastorage.org\/files\/2f6\/1ee\/cb2\/2f61eecb20714352840748b826e38680.png\"\/>\n\nSo why is stationarity so important? Because it is easy to make predictions on a stationary series since we can assume that the future statistical properties will not be different from those currently observed. Most of the time-series models, in one way or the other, try to predict those properties (mean or variance, for example). Furture predictions would be wrong if the original series were not stationary. Unfortunately, most of the time series that we see outside of textbooks are non-stationary, but we can (and should) change this.\n\nSo, in order to combat non-stationarity, we have to know our enemy, so to speak. Let's see how we can detect it. We will look at white noise and random walks to learn how to get from one to another for free.","12658af8":"Now let's try smoothing by the previous 12 hours.","af3dc1be":"Let's import some libraries. First, we will need the [statsmodels](http:\/\/statsmodels.sourceforge.net\/stable\/) library, which has many statistical modeling functions, including time series.

As a result, the quality of prediction dropped. This problem can be solved in a variety of ways; for example, we can calculate the target encoding not for the whole train set, but for some window instead. That way, encodings from the last observed window will most likely better describe the current series state. Alternatively, we can just drop it manually since we are sure that it makes things only worse in this case.

That is cool, but it is also not enough. Let's extend exponential smoothing so that we can predict two future points (of course, we will also include more smoothing).\n\nSeries decomposition will help us -- we obtain two components: intercept (i.e. level) $\\ell$ and slope (i.e. trend) $b$. We have learnt to predict intercept (or expected series value) with our previous methods; now, we will apply the same exponential smoothing to the trend by assuming that the future direction of the time series changes depends on the previous weighted changes. As a result, we get the following set of functions:\n\n$$\\ell_x = \\alpha y_x + (1-\\alpha)(\\ell_{x-1} + b_{x-1})$$\n\n$$b_x = \\beta(\\ell_x - \\ell_{x-1}) + (1-\\beta)b_{x-1}$$\n\n$$\\hat{y}_{x+1} = \\ell_x + b_x$$\n\nThe first one describes the intercept, which, as before, depends on the current value of the series. The second term is now split into previous values of the level and of the trend. The second function describes the trend, which depends on the level changes at the current step and on the previous value of the trend. In this case, the $\\beta$ coefficient is a weight for exponential smoothing. The final prediction is the sum of the model values of the intercept and trend.","afcbb17a":"Let's build an ARIMA model by walking through all the ~~circles of hell~~ stages of making a series stationary.","25815cd5":"Now that we know how to measure the quality of the forecasts, let's see what metrics we can use and how to translate the results for the boss. After that, one small detail remains - building the model.","3913f055":"## ARIMA-family Crash-Course\n\nWe will explain this model by building up letter by letter. $SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s)$, Seasonal Autoregression Moving Average model:\n\n- $AR(p)$ - autoregression model i.e. regression of the time series onto itself. The basic assumption is that the current series values depend on its previous values with some lag (or several lags). The maximum lag in the model is referred to as $p$. To determine the initial $p$, you need to look at the PACF plot and find the biggest significant lag after which **most** other lags become insignificant.\n- $MA(q)$ - moving average model. Without going into too much detail, this models the error of the time series, again with the assumption that the current error depends on the previous with some lag, which is referred to as $q$. The initial value can be found on the ACF plot with the same logic as before. \n\nLet's combine our first 4 letters:\n\n$AR(p) + MA(q) = ARMA(p, q)$\n\nWhat we have here is the Autoregressive\u2013moving-average model! If the series is stationary, it can be approximated with these 4 letters. Let's continue.\n\n- $I(d)$ - order of integration. This is simply the number of nonseasonal differences needed to make the series stationary. In our case, it's just 1 because we used first differences. \n\nAdding this letter to the four gives us the $ARIMA$ model which can handle non-stationary data with the help of nonseasonal differences. Great, one more letter to go!\n\n- $S(s)$ - this is responsible for seasonality and equals the season period length of the series\n\nWith this, we have three parameters: $(P, D, Q)$\n\n- $P$ - order of autoregression for the seasonal component of the model, which can be derived from PACF. But you need to look at the number of significant lags, which are the multiples of the season period length. For example, if the period equals 24 and we see the 24-th and 48-th lags are significant in the PACF, that means the initial $P$ should be 2.\n\n- $Q$ - similar logic using the ACF plot instead.\n\n- $D$ - order of seasonal integration. This can be equal to 1 or 0, depending on whether seasonal differeces were applied or not.","12c1709b":"Surprisingly, the initial series are stationary; the Dickey-Fuller test rejected the null hypothesis that a unit root is present. Actually, we can see this on the plot itself -- we do not have a visible trend, so the mean is constant and the variance is pretty much stable. The only thing left is seasonality, which we have to deal with prior to modeling. To do so, let's take the \"seasonal difference\", which means a simple subtraction of the series from itself with a lag that equals the seasonal period.","4ea66531":"Let's look at the averages by hour.","820c3bfc":"Now, let's see what happens if, instead of weighting the last $k$ values of the time series, we start weighting all available observations while exponentially decreasing the weights as we move further back in time.

The $\\alpha$ weight is called a smoothing factor. It defines how quickly we will \"forget\" the last available true observation. The smaller $\\alpha$ is, the more influence the previous observations have and the smoother the series is.\n\nExponentiality is hidden in the recursiveness of the function -- we multiply by $(1-\\alpha)$ each time, which already contains a multiplication by $(1-\\alpha)$ of previous model values.","2febfc94":"Let's start with a naive hypothesis: \"tomorrow will be the same as today\". However, instead of a model like $\\hat{y}_{t} = y_{t-1}$ (which is actually a great baseline for any time series prediction problems and sometimes is impossible to beat), we will assume that the future value of our variable depends on the average of its $k$ previous values.

Holt-Winters\n\nWe've looked at exponential smoothing and double exponential smoothing. This time, we're going into _triple_ exponential smoothing.\n\nAs you could have guessed, the idea is to add a third component - seasonality. This means that we should not use this method if our time series is not expected to have seasonality. Seasonal components in the model will explain repeated variations around intercept and trend, and it will be specified by the length of the season, in other words by the period after which the variations repeat. For each observation in the season, there is a separate component; for example, if the length of the season is 7 days (a weekly seasonality), we will have 7 seasonal components, one for each day of the week.\n\nWith this, let's write out a new system of equations:\n\n$$\\ell_x = \\alpha(y_x - s_{x-L}) + (1-\\alpha)(\\ell_{x-1} + b_{x-1})$$\n\n$$b_x = \\beta(\\ell_x - \\ell_{x-1}) + (1-\\beta)b_{x-1}$$\n\n$$s_x = \\gamma(y_x - \\ell_x) + (1-\\gamma)s_{x-L}$$\n\n$$\\hat{y}_{x+m} = \\ell_x + mb_x + s_{x-L+1+(m-1)modL}$$\n\nThe intercept now depends on the current value of the series minus any corresponding seasonal component. Trend remains unchanged, and the seasonal component depends on the current value of the series minus the intercept and on the previous value of the component. Take into account that the component is smoothed through all the available seasons; for example, if we have a Monday component, then it will only be averaged with other Mondays. You can read more on how averaging works and how the initial approximation of the trend and seasonal components is done [here](http:\/\/www.itl.nist.gov\/div898\/handbook\/pmc\/section4\/pmc435.htm). Now that we have the seasonal component, we can predict not just one or two steps ahead but an arbitrary $m$ future steps ahead, which is very encouraging.\n\nBelow is the code for a triple exponential smoothing model, which is also known by the last names of its creators, Charles Holt and his student Peter Winters. Additionally, the Brutlag method was included in the model to produce confidence intervals:\n\n$$\\hat y_{max_x}=\\ell_{x\u22121}+b_{x\u22121}+s_{x\u2212T}+m\u22c5d_{t\u2212T}$$\n\n$$\\hat y_{min_x}=\\ell_{x\u22121}+b_{x\u22121}+s_{x\u2212T}-m\u22c5d_{t\u2212T}$$\n\n$$d_t=\\gamma\u2223y_t\u2212\\hat y_t\u2223+(1\u2212\\gamma)d_{t\u2212T},$$\n\nwhere $T$ is the length of the season, $d$ is the predicted deviation. Other parameters were taken from triple exponential smoothing. You can read more about the method and its applicability to anomaly detection in time series [here](http:\/\/fedcsis.org\/proceedings\/2012\/pliks\/118.pdf).","988d4162":"## Getting rid of non-stationarity and building SARIMA","fa563df3":"On the first plot, you can see the same stationary white noise as before. On the second plot with $\\rho$ increased to 0.6, wider cycles appeared, but it still appears stationary overall. The third plot deviates even more from the 0 mean but still oscillates about the mean. Finally, with $\\rho=1$, we have a random walk process i.e. a non-stationary time series.\n\nThis happens because, after reaching the critical value, the series $x_t = \\rho x_{t-1} + e_t$ does not return to its mean value. If we subtract $x_{t-1}$ from both sides, we will get $x_t - x_{t-1} = (\\rho - 1) x_{t-1} + e_t$, where the expression on the left is referred to as the first difference. If $\\rho=1$, then the first difference gives us stationary white noise $e_t$. This is the main idea behind the [Dickey-Fuller test](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test) for stationarity of time series (testing the presence of a unit root). If we can get a stationary series from a non-stationary series using the first difference, we call those series integrated of order 1. The null hypothesis of the test is that the time series is non-stationary, which was rejected on the first three plots and finally accepted on the last one. We have to say that the first difference is not always enough to get a stationary series as the process might be integrated of order d, d > 1 (and have multiple unit roots). In such cases, the augmented Dickey-Fuller test is used, which checks multiple lags at once.\n\nWe can fight non-stationarity using different approaches: various order differences, trend and seasonality removal, smoothing, and transformations like Box-Cox or logarithmic.","7a7b1ff0":"Let's add some code to render plots.","0f38ce0d":"## Target encoding\nI'd like to add another variant for encoding categorical variables: encoding by mean value. If it is undesirable to explode a dataset by using many dummy variables that can lead to the loss of information and if they cannot be used as real values because of the conflicts like \"0 hours < 23 hours\", then it's possible to encode a variable with slightly more interpretable values. The natural idea is to encode with the mean value of the target variable. In our example, every day of the week and every hour of the day can be encoded by the corresponding average number of ads watched during that day or hour. It's very important to make sure that the mean value is calculated over the training set only (or over the current cross-validation fold only) so that the model is not aware of the future.","bb7d7afb":"- [R squared](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/model_evaluation.html#r2-score-the-coefficient-of-determination): coefficient of determination (in econometrics, this can be interpreted as the percentage of variance explained by the model), $(-\\infty, 1]$\n\n$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$ \n\n```python\nsklearn.metrics.r2_score\n```\n---\n- [Mean Absolute Error](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/model_evaluation.html#mean-absolute-error): this is an interpretable metric because it has the same unit of measurment as the initial series, $[0, +\\infty)$\n\n$MAE = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|}{n}$ \n\n```python\nsklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error\n```\n---\n- [Median Absolute Error](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/model_evaluation.html#median-absolute-error): again, an interpretable metric that is particularly interesting because it is robust to outliers, $[0, +\\infty)$\n\n$MedAE = median(|y_1 - \\hat{y}_1|, ... , |y_n - \\hat{y}_n|)$\n\n```python\nsklearn.metrics.median_absolute_error\n```\n---\n- [Mean Squared Error](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/model_evaluation.html#mean-squared-error): the most commonly used metric that gives a higher penalty to large errors and vice versa, $[0, +\\infty)$\n\n$MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$\n\n```python\nsklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error\n```\n---\n- [Mean Squared Logarithmic Error](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/model_evaluation.html#mean-squared-logarithmic-error): practically, this is the same as MSE, but we take the logarithm of the series.

The most frequent questions asked are the following: what will happen with our metrics in the next day\/week\/month\/etc., how many user will install our app, how much time will they spend online, how many actions will users complete, and so on. We can approach these prediction tasks using different methods depending on the required quality of the prediction, length of the forecast period, and, of course, the time within which we have to choose features and tune parameters to achieve desired results.","0e768694":"Now with the previous 24 hours, we get the daily trend.","14c2ddeb":"First, let's make sure that we have features to drop and that the data has highly correlated features.","bfa1e624":"Now, knowing how to set up cross-validation, we can find the optimal parameters for the Holt-Winters model.

Besides manual inspection, we can apply regularization. Two of the most popular regression models with regularization are Ridge and Lasso regressions. They both add some more constrains to our loss function. \n\nIn the case of Ridge regression, those constraints are the sum of squares of the coefficients multiplied by the regularization coefficient. The bigger the coefficient a feature has, the bigger our loss will be. Hence, we will try to optimize the model while keeping the coefficients fairly low. \n\nAs a result of this $L2$ regularization, we will have higher bias and lower variance, so the model will generalize better (at least that's what we hope will happen).\n\nThe second regression model, Lasso regression, adds to the loss function, not squares, but absolute values of the coefficients. As a result, during the optimization process, coefficients of unimportant features may become zeroes, which allows for automated feature selection. This regularization type is called $L1$. ","2d452383":"## Forecast quality metrics\n\nBefore we begin forecasting, let's understand how to measure the quality of our predictions and take a look at the most commonly used metrics.","341e8bee":"We can clearly see some coefficients are getting closer and closer to zero (though they never actually reach it) as their importance in the model drops.","dace6fae":"We can visualize the resulting features.","2a80ee99":"The model needs features, and all we have is a 1-dimentional time series.

Therefore, in order to minimize our loss function, we have to choose an algorithm that supports constraints on model parameters. In our case, we will use the truncated Newton conjugate gradient.","77d0a2fe":"## Time series cross validation\n\nBefore we start building a model, let's first discuss how to estimate model parameters automatically.\n\nThere is nothing unusual here; as always, we have to choose a loss function suitable for the task that will tell us how closely the model approximates the data. Then, using cross-validation, we will evaluate our chosen loss function for the given model parameters, calculate the gradient, adjust the model parameters, and so on, eventually descending to the global minimum.\n\nYou may be asking how to do cross-validation for time series because time series have this temporal structure and one cannot randomly mix values in a fold while preserving this structure. With randomization, all time dependencies between observations will be lost. This is why we will have to use a more tricky approach in optimizing the model parameters. I don't know if there's an official name to this, but on [CrossValidated](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/14099\/using-k-fold-cross-validation-for-time-series-model-selection), where one can find all answers but the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, the proposed name for this method is \"cross-validation on a rolling basis\".\n\nThe idea is rather simple -- we train our model on a small segment of the time series from the beginning until some $t$, make predictions for the next $t+n$ steps, and calculate an error. Then, we expand our training sample to $t+n$ value, make predictions from $t+n$ until $t+2*n$, and continue moving our test segment of the time series until we hit the last available observation. As a result, we have as many folds as $n$ will fit between the initial training sample and the last observation.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/habrastorage.org\/files\/f5c\/7cd\/b39\/f5c7cdb39ccd4ba68378ca232d20d864.png\"\/>","eb6c5096":"Now that we know how to set the initial parameters, let's have a look at the final plot once again and set the parameters:","d5f4e375":"When we applied daily smoothing on hourly data, we could clearly see the dynamics of ads watched.
