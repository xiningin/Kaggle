In divisive (top-down) clustering method, all observations are assigned to a single cluster and then that cluster is partitioned to two least similar clusters, and then those two clusters are partitioned again to multiple clusters, and thus the process go on. In agglomerative (bottom-up), the opposite approach is followed.
