In my experience, it works rather well for negative comments. The problems arise when the tweets are ironic, sarcastic has reference or own difficult context.\n\nConsider the following tweet:\n*\"Muhaha, how sad that the Liberals couldn't destroy Trump.  Marching forward.\"*\nAs you may already thought, the words **sad** and **destroy** highly influences the evaluation, although this tweet should be positive when observing its meaning and context. \n\nTo improve the evalutation accuracy, we need something to take the context and references into consideration. As my project 2.0, I will try to build an LSTM network, and benchmark its results compared to this nltk Machine Learning implementation. Stay tuned.
