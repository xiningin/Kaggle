The `detectMultiScale` function executes the classifier stored in `face_cascade` and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.  \n\nIn the above code, `faces` is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face.  Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face.  The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as `x` and `y`) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box.  The last two entries in the array (extracted here as `w` and `h`) specify the width and height of the box.\n\n### Write a Human Face Detector\n\nWe can use this procedure to write a function that returns `True` if a human face is detected in an image and `False` otherwise.

In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%.  In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.\n\nWe mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  \n\nBrittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel\n- | - \n<img src=\"images\/Brittany_02625.jpg\" width=\"100\"> | <img src=\"images\/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg\" width=\"200\">\n\nIt is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  \n\nCurly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel\n- | -\n<img src=\"images\/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg\" width=\"200\"> | <img src=\"images\/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg\" width=\"200\">\n\n\nLikewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  \n\nYellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador\n- | -\n<img src=\"images\/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg\" width=\"150\"> | <img src=\"images\/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg\" width=\"240\"> | <img src=\"images\/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg\" width=\"220\">\n\nWe also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  \n\nRemember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.

The output should always be an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive.\n\nBefore writing the function, make sure that you take the time to learn  how to appropriately pre-process tensors for pre-trained models in the [PyTorch documentation](http:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/torchvision\/models.html).","276f6a3d":"### (IMPLEMENTATION) Train and Validate the Model\n\nTrain and validate your model in the code cell below.

Also, more image augmentations trials (flipping vertically, move left or right, etc.) will improve performance on test data.\n\nHyper-parameter tunings: weight initializings, learning rates, drop-outs, batch_sizes, and optimizers will be helpful to improve performances.\n\nEnsembles of models","4956c00f":"__Answer:__ \n\n(conv1): Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))\n\nactivation: relu\n\n(pool): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)\n\nactivation: relu\n\n(conv2): Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))\n\nactivation: relu\n\n(pool): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)\n\n(conv3): Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))\n\n(pool): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)\n\n(dropout): Dropout(p=0.3)\n\n(fc1): Linear(in_features=6272, out_features=500, bias=True)\n\n(dropout): Dropout(p=0.3)\n\n(fc2): Linear(in_features=500, out_features=133, bias=True)\n\nexplanations First 2 conv layers I've applied kernel_size of 3 with stride 2, this will lead to downsize of input image by 2. after 2 conv layers, maxpooling with stride 2 is placed and this will lead to downsize of input image by 2. The 3rd conv layers is consist of kernel_size of 3 with stride 1, and this will not reduce input image. after final maxpooling with stride 2, the total output image size is downsized by factor of 32 and the depth will be 128. I've applied dropout of 0.3 in order to prevent overfitting. Fully-connected layer is placed and then, 2nd fully-connected layer is intended to produce final output_size which predicts classes of breeds.","ef6e693f":"__Answer:__ \n(You can print out your results and\/or write your percentages in this cell)","ad696b2a":"---\n<a id='step4'><\/a>\n## Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)\n\nYou will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify dog breed from images.
