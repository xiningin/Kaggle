I wanted to use continuous wavelet transform to plot a spectrum of the dataset to get quick insights. Wavelets are specially well suited for this job. I expected to be able from **python** to do something like `view(data, scales)`,  and get a plot with *meaningful* labels on the axis.  As I did not used wavelets for quite some time, it did not went that way and I spent quite a long time to get painfully some visualization with the Y axis labelled either in frequency or periods units. Very frustrating!\n\nHence as wavelets should be easyly accessible from python I wrote a simple PyPi module `scaleogram` dedicated to plot the continuous wavelet transform.  It has been written to be easily accessible to complete beginners, provide usefull error  messages and packed with online help explaining what is computed under the hood. The following examples are based on this module.","771ead71":"## Periodic variations with non sinusoidal shape\n\nWe have seen than cos waves appear as stripes on the CWT, \nlet's try another periodic signal and see what' happens:\n* A triangle wave with a 30s period\n* With assymetry: the signal is increasing 80% of the time","fb563a97":"## Synthesis\n\nThe scaleogram has been \n* Built from normalized data (mean removal)\n* Log-scaled to be more readable at all scales","d9711d5a":"Discrete events produce **cone shaped** structures on the scaleogram, that are also known as the **cone of influence**.\n\n**Smooth spikes** (gaussians) are often closer to real data structures and build cones extending toward larger scales.\nIf you look at the horizontal guide lines you can see that its base is related to the approximative period in time of the bumps (*2s*, *10s*, *20s*). \nHence a bump is similar to a periodic signal with ... one period. This example show you how wavelets are appropriate to detect *variations* localized in time.\n\n**Steps** are much more like abnormal values for one sample (*w1*), and missing data for large number of samples (*w3*).\n\nHowever the steps case is more tricky. While the first two steps are small enough to look like a gaussian bump, the large one is different.\nRemember that the wavelet detects *variations in time*? Well this is that: the stepping up is considered as one variation alone at small scales as it is for the step down. Which lead to two cones with the same shape (but more energy\/intensity on the Z axis) that the very short step in time.\n\n\n\n## How noise looks like on a scaleogram?\n\nBellow is the result of processing gaussian noise obtained with `randn()`","5293daf9":"# Conclusions\n\nIn this notebook we have seen how the basic kind of signal variations translate onto\na scaleogram. Next an example time ordered dataset has been used to demonstrate step\nby step how the CWT apply to standard data.\n\nThe same methodology can be extended to network traffic analysis to detect unusual behaviours. Try by yourself on your favorite time\/space ordered dataset. The CWT is a powerful tool that is growingly used as input for neural networks and can be usedto create new features for classification or anomaly detection.\n\nI did not dive into the variety of wavelet function that can be chosen depending on the property of your signal. Still you can change the `set()` value at the top of this notebook to try other functions like `mexh` or `gaus5`. \n\nHave fun and plussify if you liked this ;-) !\n","fffa1bb9":"\nThe pulses appear at the expected Y location matching their respective periodicity, they are **localized in periodicity (frequency)**. They are also well **localized in time**, the stripe beginning an end match the pulse. You can also observe that the stripes width scale with the period length (scale). This is a known property of the wavelet transform: when the scale increase, the resolution in time decrease. It is also known as the tradeoff between time and frequency. When you are looking at this kind of spectrogram you are doing *multiresolution analysis*.\n\nThe same plot in frequency domain and details on *multiresolution analysis* can be found [here](https:\/\/www.weisang.com\/fr\/dokumentation\/timefreqspectrumalgorithmscwt_fr\/).\n\nYou may also wish to read further [How the scale parameter relates to period and frequency?](https:\/\/github.com\/alsauve\/scaleogram\/blob\/master\/doc\/scale-to-frequency.ipynb)","d2e588d0":"## Zoom on the feature","846585d2":"## Normalization\n\nRemoving the mean value is mandatory, otherwise the borders of the data are considered as *steps* which create a lot of spurious cone shaped detection.\n\nAfter removal of the mean value (no scaling) the scaleogram looks like:","39ecd0a4":"Now it's clear the suspect looks like an end-of-year effect:\n* Christmas: the 23\/24\/25 December shows abnormally low number of births and these days depart from the weekly pattern\n* The [starter kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggleusercontent.com\/kf\/12226085\/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..sg37wxxpESt5qPN4cj_xTw.dlanSYjQUrjzh2rRGbtqiX1m7e8ykg1nucKJEl50aT2odhsMGTUsc_TwkBH5Jlw6GKGnRiXl1qhqJh4CGzlY_B79mrmHO6V0N4h9_4_TqVTEYxbqQFlNmJJjM2-hkgIxsQtj0wXu_Vhvse772UwlTnk-zxtp_5z-cxFIcACGiYg.aTIWJ-KWMoRHslUTFSJqfg\/__results__.html#Check-monthes-with-abnormal-birth-values) does not show missing data for December, which is consistent with the presence of some value for the affected dates\n* The 1st and 2nd of january are also affected which is understandable as there are usually less personnal available on these dates","beeb07df":"Noise displays usually as a patchwork of features and some bumps can look like real data features, so you have to be careful when using real data to check the level of noise when appropriate. I recommend this fairly complete paper on the [significance level](https:\/\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\/hal-00318404\/document) by *Z. Ge.* if you have some time.  \nThe upper plot will be different each time this notebook is run so try  by yourself! \n\nNow that the most common kind of signal variations have been detailed, it is time to go for the real thing!\n\n# Analysis of a real dataset : hail to the babies!\n\nThe dataset is birth data from the CDC providing the number of children born each day with consistent filling between 1969 and 1988 included. \n* Birth rate is known to have natural seasonal variations\n* It can also be influenced by many other factors like working habits\n* These influences are expected at different time scales\n* The impact of all these factors can also change with time\n\nFor all these reasons, multi resolution analysis is a tool of choice for this kind of data. \n\nManual preliminatory analysis is available in this [starter kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/asauve\/births-variation-over-the-week). The code bellow just load the data, and extract the daily number of birth per day in the 1969-1988 year range.\n\n## First naive visualization\n","5c007732":"This is much better, we now see very well a yearly variation and also an approximately 6 month one! \n\nHowever now the small scale weekly variations are invisible.\n\n\n## Using logaritmic scale\n\nTo be able to see the small periods and the large ones at once, it is better to use logarithmic scale on the Y axis. This is achieved with the `yscale='log'`option.","63d22c9d":"**Observations**\n* births per day  : The birth data shows periodic features as expected at the year scales and smaller ones\n* Scaleogram : This first scaleogram is not very impressive. Still an horizontal line shows up at about 7 days periodicity\n\nHigh values do appear near the bordersof the scaleogram which are a normal behaviour of the wavelet processing. These effects are well known as the *cone of influence*, this is why an (optional) mask is overplot on this area.","d66f1f30":"The periodic signal appear now as an **horizontal continuous stripe** at location *Y=p1*, which intensity vary with the amplitude of the periodic signal. You can observe some fuzzyness in the detection as the band width is not null, this is due to the fact that wavelets does not detect a single frequency but rather a *band*. It appears visually as the width of the band on the *Y* axis. This effect is related to the *bandwidth* of the wavelet.\n\nIn other words the CWT measure\n* the periodicity (Y axis) of a signal at a given location (X axis)\n* the amplitude of the oscillations (Z axis)\n\nOk until now? Then let's test with some other signals!","4e553557":"## Adjusting the scales\n\nThe amplitude range of the color map (Z axis) is now set with the `clim=(0,2500)` parameter. The exact value for the amplitude of variations is dependent of the wavelet but will stay close to the order of the real value, see the cos wave plot for hints.\n\nTo see the yearly features an appropriate scales range is generated with `period2scales()`."}}
