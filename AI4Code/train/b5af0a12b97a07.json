Prime Video (owned by Amazon) have maximum number of movies hosted on their platform which accounts to 12,354 (71.1%).\n2. Netflix stands second with around 3560 movies hosted on it's online streaming platform (i.e, 20.5%).\n3.

We all love watching family centric movies loaded with emotions and happy fairy tale endings.**\n2. **Documentaries have now evolved with time and the spectrum of topics is quite wide. From Veganism to Capitalism, there are quite interesting documentaqries especially on Netflix.**\n3. **Surprisingly Action genre is the 15th in the queue, which might be because of its limitations with respect to age.**","6c270b83":"# What is the Rating range for movies ?","4274302a":"**Russian and Swedish movies are making a mark on OTT platforms, followed by Arabic,German,Spanish,French,etc.**","e61644cf":"# The unfortunate pandemic changed the dynamics of various businesses across the globe and one such industry is 'Media & Entertainment'.\n# With Cinema halls closed,OTT platforms witnessed a massive surge in its adoption. ","2efa4c26":"1. **David Letterman's 'My next guest' tops the list. I remember watching the episode where he interviewed SRK at his house (Mannat,Bandra-Mumbai) and then in the studio. It is one of the best interviews I have seen in my life. Both of them are equally smart and humorous. It is streaming on Netflix. I urge you to watch it if you haven't.**\n2. **Second on the list is this famous sports movie called \"Down, But Not Out!\" captures all the action of four amateur women boxers as they step for the first time into the ring. Each fighter, ANNA, DARIA, AGA and ALICJA go all out to win as they are challenged to face an unknown opponent at a box competition organized by the amateur boxing association within their league**\n3. **Surprisingly 'Natsamrat', which is a well-renowned Marathi drama written by V.V.Shirvadkar,now made into a movie stands in top 10 with an IMDb rating of 9.1. Nana Patekar starred in the movie which was directed by Mahesh Manjrekar.**","5ff0b36c":"1. **Jay Chapman who is a renowned showrunner in Hollywood tops the list.**\n2. **Joseph Kane who is 2nd in the list has some world class movies to his name - 'Flame of Barbary Coast(1945)' to name one of them**","06e5efc9":"1. **Surprisingly , maximum number of movies ever made in this century were in the year 2017 (around 1401)**\n2. **This number fell down to just 689, two years later (less than 50%)**\n3. **In the year 1913, a total of only 2 movies were made**\n4. **This year i.e,2020 it is visible the movie production taken a massive hit due to the pandemic with only 147 movies in the kitty**","c90f69bd":"# Let me show you a snippet from the interview :)","2a8c0fe6":"# Which OTT platform hosted maximum and minimum no.of movies ?","54c732ee":"*Rotten Tomatoes seem to have around 69% of missing values.Hence, drop it\n#Age too doesn't seem to add much value to our analysis.

Movies,Cricket and Politics rest in our blood as they say. Many regional cinemas are now coming in the mainstream and are being hosted on OTT platforms. They are one of the major contributors. India has around 1064 movies on OTT right after USA.**\n3. **What came to my surprise though is that France and Canada have prestigious Film festivals in the world to their name. TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) is a badge of honour for many film makers acros the globe.**\n\n","70f494dd":"**Roughly all the movies are well below 200 mins (i.e 3hrs) and mostly it peaks at around 120 mins**\n\n**Hence, most movies are roughly anywhere between 100-130 mins**","e600ff13":"# Analysing 'Language-Runtime' relationship:","0ca1f5e5":"# Which movie had the longest Runtime ?","4d298cc9":"1. **Action,Adventure, Drama,Romance& Western - has the highest runtime on OTT platforms accounting to 1256 hours.**\n2. **Surprisingly, the least of these 15 is 'Drama,Mystery,Thriller accounting to 240 hours.

It seems the audience enjoys knowledgeable content to watch and their taste is not only limited to Romance, Comedy,Action,etc.**\n2. **France and Canada is known to host world class film festivals but fail to host good amount of content on the OTT platforms. Combined they have hosted around 317 movies only. If they host the movies (though in other languages with subtitles enabled) it would be a great contribution to loyal world cinema audience, who love watching meaningful content. Had Narcos abstained itself from hosting on Netflix bacause of it's spanish language, they would have never garnered such love and attention from corners of the world. Same applies to 'Money Heist' as well.**\n3. **Though Prime Video is not the major source of income for global e-commerece giant Amazon, Prime Video is hosting 71.1% of the total OTT content while Netflix, whose entire business is dependant on the publishing video content ,is hosting around 20%. This is something the OTT competitors have to look into and seems an interesting area of research.**\n4. **Genre-specific OTT platforms can prove to be an interesting area to experiment as a content creator and as an investor as well. More foreign content acros geographies have an excellent opportunity to break the walls.**","c1e174ee":"# What is the staple range of runtime across the platforms?","7092637f":"# If enjoyed, please UPVOTE.
