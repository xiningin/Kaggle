When working on the answer this question and the several of the ones that follow, keep the following \"gotcha\" described in the tutorial:\n\n> `iloc` uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. \n`loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. \n\n> This is particularly confusing when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `df.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `df.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `loc`, you will need to go one lower and ask for `df.iloc[0:999]`.
