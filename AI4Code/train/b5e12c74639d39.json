Let's assume that this company makes new arrangements on its website to increase its revenues. As a result of the new regulations, we record the transactions made by the customers. After a certain amount of time, we want to compare the earnings from the old website with the earnings from our new website. We can use random methods to decide whether the returns as a result of the change are meaningful. But we may wish to explain our methods with a scientific and statistical method.

(\u03bc1 = \u03bc2)\n* H1: There is a difference between the number of products purchased. (\u03bc1 != \u03bc2)\n\nAs a result of the statistical inferences, there was a statistical difference between the control and test groups no significant difference was found. \nAs a result of these tests, it can be said that the two groups are statistically similar to each other.\n\n\nThe Shapiro test was applied to test whether the control and test groups conformed to the normality assumption.Since it provided the assumption of normality in both groups, the next step was the homogeneity of variance. Levene test was used to observe the homogeneity of variance of the two groups. When the values obtained as a result of the test are examined It was observed that there was a similarity between the homogeneity of variance of the groups. Since it also provides variance homogeneity, the difference between the two groupsIndependent Two-Sample T-Test was applied to reveal statistical meanings.\n\nThe p-value obtained after the Independent Two-Sample T-Test was applied was examined. H0 hypothesis could not be rejected because our value was not less than 0.05.\nEven if there is a difference between the means of the control and test groups, it has been determined as a result of the analyzes that this is not statistically significant.\n\nA new test with more samples can be made to re-examine the new system added to the website.","724b22b1":"# AB Testing"}}
