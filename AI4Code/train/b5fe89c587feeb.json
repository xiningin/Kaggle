This is highly problematic and I would like to diagnose the root cause behind this decline in travel bookings. \n* From [exploratory data analysis](https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/profile\/malcolmng#!\/vizhome\/ArgoSolutions\/Dashboard), we see that the decline in bookings (and revenue) is happening at the same rate across all dimensions regardless of company, agency, gender, fare class, origin, and destination. Further analysis across different measures show that number of users (customer base) have also been declining. Therefore we can conclude that the decline in sales is driven by lower volume, which in turn is driven by a dwindling customer base. We need to address this issue across all customer segments and flights.\n* Let's assume one possible use case is that business travellers need to book hotels together with flights. This is quite a reasonable assumption as most companies do allow travel to be expensed. In this case, it would be useful to dive into all paired bookings and its trend over time.","9b2205dc":"## Metrics to improve\n* Customer base\n* Revenue\n* Retention\n* Conversion\n* User engagement\n\nThese are some example high level business metrics that will correlate with customer experience.
