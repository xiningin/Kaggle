Whereas for bad quality wine, the residual sugar content increases gradually with the increase in alcohol content.  \n- This analysis can help in manufacturing the good quality wine with continuous monitoring and contrilling the alcohol and residual sugar content of the red wine.","864fd057":"#### Classification using Sklearn's RandomForestClassifier:","6baf75ed":"### Conclusion\n- We observed the key factors that determine and affects the quality of the red wine. Wine quality is ultimately a subjective measure. The ordered factor _'quality'_ was not very helpful and to overcome this, so we created another variable called _'rating'_.\n- To make predictions of wine quality and any other if required, we trained two models. As seen, the statsmodel and sklearn's Linear Regression model along with Random Forest Classifier. The Random Forest Classifier performed marginally better and we decided to stick with it if we had to make any more predictions.\n- The usage of this analysis will help to understand whether by modifying the variables, it is possible to increase the quality of the wine on the market. If you can control your variables, then you can predict the quality of your wine and obtain more profits.","4e4ac3ee":"### Setting up the development environment by importing required libraries and modules:\n- *Numpy:* It will provide the support for efficient numerical computation.  \n- *Pandas:* It is convenient library that supports dataframes.
