Relation of the vehicles with value and comparing the value for different countries.","c190a85f":"Okay so this is something interesting. While comparing the count of each vehicle the variation was a lot less.\n\nBut on seeing the number of people who crossed using those vehicles got much higher.","ca57b9ac":"Moving to the next question","58cd7879":"Now this is a very particular question.\n\nFor answering this first I need to decide which seasons to choose and what months will each season comprise of.\n\nRather than seasons lets divide the year into 4 quarters(each of 3 months).\n\nLets check this logic for 2019.","3fdd80a1":"# 5. Is there any pattern in the number of crossings with respect to any season of the year?","bf4f0abb":"Now I can see that crossing are low in 1st and 4th quarter and increases in the 2nd quarter to highest.\n\nLets now visualize this for all years to see if same pattern is followed.","4efe7604":"Okay so there are only 15 states involved with ports. This will be quick to analyse.\n\nLet's see which state let most of the crossings in US in 2020","107d6130":"Now for each of the years, I will check out the busiest port and try to visualise them.","ff109ba7":"Okay now this is something very interesting. While the count of crossing is very high frm the Canada border, as we have analysed in a previous question.\n\nMore number of people are actually from Mexico.","99195865":"So it is confirmed that the dataset don't have any missing values at all.\n\nNow let's decide on what qustions do I want to answer using the dataset.","1a14340e":"Moving on to the second part.\n\nFor the second part we need to separate the values on the basis of the border and compare using value","d5ef9747":"So now some interesting data came up.\n\nEastport is proved to be the most busiest port since 2003 but one thing to notice is that the number of crossing border is mostly same for consecutive years.\n\nSo it will be right to assume that the Eastport was built mainly for this purpose on 2003 and hence it saw huge rise.","f760ee37":"This notebook is used as a part of the day 6 and 7 of my data stories.\n\nCheck my other notebooks for more data stories","ada699b8":"# Data Story 6 and 7","6ed1e58a":"So the Eastport seems to be the most busy among other ports. Let's check what state is it in, it's port number and also how much value it is brining to US.\n\nBut before all that I need to check the number of unique values in the dates columns once.","833b7f08":"# 1. Which is the busiest port?","9284e212":"It can be seen that the port Otay Mesa remained in the top 5 till 2016 but then it got out of sight. \n\nIt can be assumed that the port was closed for some reason.\n\nNow that we have found out the busiest I think it's about time I move to the second question.","2de9a5fe":"So I took the mean in the above cell for the 'Value' column because sum is directly proportional the number fo such vehicles which we already saw is highly different.\n\nSo I took the mean to avoid any ambiguity.","87a7513c":"So it can clearly be seen that personal vehicles are the ones that are used the most.\n\nOne thing is surprising is that pedestrian count is more than all types of rail vehicles. This means there is low frequency of rail vehicles to cross the border.","52d95b62":"# 2. Which state is having the highest border crossing through?","da36fd7c":"So we can see that the US-Canada Border maintains a higher border crossing count since 1996.","feb29d41":"# 4. Which country is most associated in the border crossings?","8b510042":"For now these libraries are just fine. Let's check the data and then decide whether I will need more or not.","e3b2778e":"Moving on to the next question.","a2cc59c6":"Okay so the dataset is huge. \n\nIt's not possible to analyze all at once. \n\nSo it's better to break down the population into various samples and try to analyze them.","b3dffebe":"From the previous question(busiest port) itself we came to know that Canada is the Country involved in highest number of US Border crossing.","bf68ed76":"So the final conclusion is 2nd and 3rd quaretrs are when most crossing occur.","3361d94f":"Let's try and analyze which borders were the most busy in 2019","63f0a813":"Some of the questions that come to my mind after seeing the columns names are as follows:-\n\n1. Which is the busiest port?\n2. Which state is having the highest border crossing through?\n3. Which borders are the most used?\n4. Which country is most associated in the border crossings?\n5. Is there any pattern in the number of crossings with respect to any season of the year?\n6. What type of vehicles are mostly used for crossing border?\n7. Relation of the vehicles with value and comparing the value for different countries.","0fd0942d":"So looking at the date column in partiular it is clear that the data contains info on every month from January 1996 to February 2020","e7927145":"Today I am going to analyze the data about US border crossings for various purposes.\n\nLet's see what I can make out of the data","84cb84c7":"Okay so there are a total of 12 different types of vehicles used for crossing the borders\n\nLet's visualize their usage","d49f0287":"It is found out that EastPort appears in the dataset most frequently.\n\nBut one thing to remember is that checking the port on an yearly basis may give us more insights.","b2b55c50":"So the answer to the current question is also Canada.\n\nThis also provides us with some insights on the relation between the countries US and Canada.","bc9cde2b":"# Good Bye. See you aain in a new dataset tomorrow","f0e3eab6":"Now I have two options to choose the state bringing most crossings. Either I choose the count as I did in the case of ports.\n\nOr I can choose the state based on the summation of all values that the state has brought in.\n\nThe second way looks a bit ambiguous since it is directly related to the measure(vehicle) used for crossing. \n\nThe count looks more fair and hence I will stick to it.","58d73b74":"So the state with the most crossing is found to be North Dakota. Lets visualize the top 5","4d492aee":"Moving to the next question.","23c6f99f":"So I will end my analysis on this dataset there. Hope you find it insightful.\n\nIf ou find any value then please upvote. It means a lot to me.","d048734d":"So it can be clearly seen that in 2019, US-Canada Border was the busiest but is that the same case for all of the previous years.\n\nI think it's worth a try.","6939d585":"# 3. Which borders are the most used?","264ff61e":"Let's break it up into two parts:-\n\n1. How is the vehicle related to the 'value' column?\n2. How each country Canada and Mexico are related to the 'value' column?\n\nBut first let's see what the 'value' column actually signify.\n\nAccording to the data dictionary\nValue -----> Counts of people crossing","6adfadc7":"Okay so similar pattern is observed in most cases but 2016 shows some high variation.\n\nThe 1st and 2nd quarters are much higher compared to the others.\n\nNot sure why.","6ecc166f":"Now let's plot the 5 busiest ports for each year","079ec510":"So let's start from the first question and move down the list.","22dd4040":"For measuring this I will make use of the 'Measure' column because that's the column that contains data about what vehicles are used for the crossing.\n\nLet's first see how many unique type of vehicles are there.","d4ca9cc0":"If you are wondering what population and samples are then check the link below.\n\n[https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/what-is-the-difference-between-population-and-sample-e13d17746b16](http:\/\/)\n\nSo samples are basically chunks of data used for a partiular task.(correct me if I am wrong)","207ae235":"Okay so let's continue with the third question."}}
