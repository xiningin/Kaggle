As a fan, it makes sense because the quality of teams in the middle is much more difficult to determine and seemingly more subjective than either end of the seeding spectrum. \n* Some conferences are much easier to predict than others. This is partly a function of the number of teams selected from a conference. The difference in model accuracy between the SEC and Pac-12 is fairly large. \n* Of the bigger conferences, the SEC and ACC seem to - on average - get a slightly favorable seeding with the Big Ten getting unfavorable seedings. \n* In only two instances over three years did my model disagree with a seeding by three or more positions - once to the benefit of South Carolina and once to the detriment of Wichita St. Only one team made the list twice - Michigan St - both over and under seeded. \n* Overall, as much as fans love to debate fairness of athletics, it seems there's no significant bias for the NCAA men's tournament.

I only use systems that go back to 2003 and have existed every year since. We'll drop the systems where media and coaches vote on the quality of teams: the USA and AP. \n<p>Besides using the ordinals, we'll create four derived input variables. They are a ratio using the WLK system, and the max, min and standard deviation from the group of eight systems we use. The ratio looks at a team's ordinal on either day 99 or 100 (depending on the year) and their ordinal on the last day of the season (133 except 2020 which is 128).

The goal is to have the validation data perform as well as or better than the cross validation results. The reason may not be intuitive but makes for sound logic. We're modeling this as a binary decision: will a team receive an at-large bid? The model can only interpret the input data and provide a probability of a selection. It doesn't reconcile for the limited number of available bids directly. It should approximate historical results; however, it will find too many deserving teams in some years and too few in others.

Andy Katz posted his on March 11th and the other two had an update after the tournament cancellation. I didn't do an extensive comparison but here are a few interesting call-outs.\n* Duke is a three or four seed in AK, BR, and SBN but I have them as a one seed. \n* I have BYU higher than the other three predictions as a four seed.\n* We all agree that Creighton and Florida State are two seeds and that last year's Champion Virginia is a six seed. \n* I have Arizona St as the first team out (even with a 58% at-large chance) but the other predictions have them between an 8 and 10 seed.\n\nUltimately, our results aren't that different from the national publications which is useful as a sanity check. Over the last three years, our model correctly seeded an average of 34 of 68 seeds and 59.7 of 68 within one seed (either +\/-). It would have been interesting to have an actual comparison to the actual results. Here's to 2021! ","027ddfcb":"Now that we have a data frame in a usable form, the first step is to create input variables. The two problems we're automating use a lot of the same variables which isn't a surprise because there's implied overlap to the problems; the reasons to select a team are also reasons to assign a seeding. We'll create one master data frame that will be used as a base for both the at-large and seeding selection. My original data frame was approximately 150 input variables but most proved to provide no additional insight into solving these two problems. By excluding these variables, we are able to speed up the training process. A lot of the standard box score stats - steals, rebounds, etc. were tried but didn't improve model performance. ","b688929c":"<div id=\"intLink1\"><\/div>\n# Data Wrangling\nWe first need to create a data frame that shows each regular season game as two instances with each team listed as the primary and secondary (opponent) team. This makes compiling each team's statistics significantly easier. We won't include the game location and overtime inputs as they don't factor into any of our analytics.","29f23ae2":"<div id=\"intLink8\"><\/div>\n# At-Large Selection Feature Importance\nInterestingly, the plot results don't show that all of the input variables have feature importance. I suspect the primary reason it doesn't is because I originally modeled seasons 2003-2014 and left 2015-2019 for validation. Nonetheless, the results are no worse. Seeing that five of the inputs are computer models suggests that the committee uses them for decision support. This makes sense when trying to objectively evaluate between hundreds of teams even if not all teams are being seriously considered. ","b6e46088":"\n# Seeds to Input Variable Correlation \n\n","0b247543":"#    **At-Large and Seeding Automation via Machine Learning:** \n<p>The NCAA Men's basketball season can be viewed in three distinct sections. The first is the regular season. This is when all non-conference and conference games are played. The second and shortest is the conference tournament where teams can earn a chance to play in the NCAA Tournament. Lastly, the third section - reserved for only 68 teams - is the tournament used to crown the champion.  It could be fairly stated the reason NCAA men's basketball teams play the regular season is for the opportunity to play in the NCAA tournament. Some teams are guaranteed this opportunity by winning their end of season conference tournament. Teams that don't win their conference tournament may still receive an invitation via an at-large selection as a result of the high quality of their regular season and conference tournament play.<\/p>\n<p>After the selection committee chooses the at-large teams, it must assign all teams, both conference tournament winners and at-large selections, a seed. The purpose of this notebook is two-fold: first, to model the at-large teams and second, to assign each team a seed. Both processes will use machine learning approaches to derive the results.<p\/>\n<p>Along the way, we'll compare the expected versus actual results. Who made it into the at-large field under the wire and who was left standing in the cold? Who received higher or lower seeding than expected?<p\/>\nWith a high degree of accuracy, can we automate the at-large and seeding process for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament? How do we handle the 2020 season?","47213fc0":"<div id=\"intLink10\"><\/div>\n# Model Creation: Team Seeding\nThe next step is to assign each team a seed. This is a more difficult modeling problem because each team can be assigned one of 16 seeds. We won't see accuracy near the performance of the At-Large Selection model.  \nThe goal is to correctly predict a team's seeding. As a secondary goal, we'll also measure the accuracy of a result of +\/- 1 of the seed. \nAfter extensive testing, the best results came from modeling this as a regression problem, ranking the results, and assigning those rankings a seed.\nUsing a multi-classification approach returned accuracy results in the mid 40%'s. We'll see from the validation set that we can do better than that. ","c82d09bc":"The next step is similar to the strength of schedule calculation. This time, we want to see how a team's offense performs in relation to the offenses of its opponents. It's a little tricky to explain but an example makes it simpler. If a team's average offense for a season was 75 points and its opponents allowed an average of 72 points, this team performed 3 points better than its opponent's opponents. This metric helps to control for a weaker strength of schedule.","0b735102":"# Table of Contents\n\n1.  [Data Wrangling](#intLink1)\n1.  [Strength of Schedule](#intLink2)\n1.

It was a journey.  \nIf you made it this far, I appreciate your time and hope you found something of interest within this notebook. Sports analytics is a passion and hobby of mine. As much as the cancellation of this year's tournament was a disappointment, being able to model the at-large and seeding process was rewarding and a nice way for me personally to offset not being able to model the tournament itself. \n\nKaggle folks: Thanks for making this competition available for the first time and here's to an NCAA ML Comp in 2021!\n\nFinally, this is my first notebook as a contributor. Feedback is welcome and greatly appreciated. \n\nBen\n\n","1edf630d":"<div id=\"intLink13\"><\/div>\n# The Tournament We Wanted:\nWe\u2019ve created two models: the first determines the at-large selections and the second model's seedings. Up to this point, these two processes haven\u2019t been linked. We\u2019ve predicted the first step but didn\u2019t use the results in the second step. The reason is because we didn't achieve 100% accuracy and the second model won't be accurate without correct target variables. However, we didn\u2019t get the at-large selections for 2020, so for this year, the results from the at-large picks will be imported into the seeding model. The results will give us an idea of what may have happened this year had the season finished. ","bbb56e79":"<div id=\"intLink7\"><\/div>\n# At-Large Selection Model Results\nThe results are good. The overall error rate is slightly lower than our cross validation results at 1.3% and we correctly predicted the 2017 season. 2018 and 2019 gave us 33 of 36 correct selections. For the three combined years, we correctly picked 102 of 108 at-large bids. The actual process is done via a 10 member committee with members serving a five year term with two members being replaced every year. To be able to replicate their selections this closely given the turnover is exciting.","3ab1f537":"The code below finds the min, max, and standard deviation for each system. Other metrics were tried but didn't prove to be useful. Having the actual system ratings and not just the ordinals would provide additional insight. There is significant difference in the quality of the best team and 20th as compared to the 180th and 200th.

The first represents number of bids with the second representing average seeding. \nAny league not shown had one bid with the lowest seed being a 12. This suggests that having multiple good teams in a conference helps with the seeding as well. ","1b05d84f":"This step does a few things:\nIt brings in a few other inputs we'll need to derive additional metrics and it brings in a team's conference affiliation. After extensive testing, knowing if a team is in a mid-major conference, a 'minor' conference, the Pac-12 or SEC proved to be informative to the models. While there is no official designation for what constitutes a mid-major or a minor conference, by using data going back to 2003, it's fairly clear by looking at conference winning percentages and bids in the NCAA tournament what group a team should be in. Major conferences were assigned their own variable because they received the most at-large bids by a large margin. Mid-majors have won between 34%-52% of their NCAA tournament games having between 27-89 bids. Minors have won between 0%-24% and the big six conferences are all greater than 56% with all having over 150 bids. ","ce0fbb4d":"<div id=\"intLink3\"><\/div>\n# Modified Pythagorean Expectation\n\nFirst, we'll group the dataset using only the variables that will be in the final models. Because of the way the data was originally structured, we can take the mean of all calculated columns. After the data is grouped, we will calculate a modified version of the Pythagorean Expectation which is explained [here](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pythagorean_expectation#Use_in_basketball). Different exponents have been used but after using an optimization process, 9.5 for offense and 9.2 for defensive were chosen as they were the most predictive for NCAA Tournament modeling. Generally, the exponent is the same in the numerator and the denominator but not in our case. ","80037c93":"<div id=\"intLink5\"><\/div>\n# Aggregate the Data\nBelow we join our datasets into a training dataset to model the at-large teams. The imported file 'at_large' is a data frame of all teams, seasons, and booleans for at-large selections and conference winners. The results were scraped from Wikipedia. If a team won a conference and received an automatic berth, it will be filtered from the training dataset. ","b611fcd1":"<div id=\"intLink9\"><\/div>\n# Wrangling the 2020 data\nEarlier, we created the predictions for this year for at-large teams in the pred_df data frame. We\u2019ll filter it for 2020 and use it to assist us in determining the conference tournament \u2018winners\u2019. But before we start, there is an issue to resolve with our process. Only 13 of the 32 conference tournaments crowned a champion meaning there are still 19 at-large positions for 19 conferences that remain unfilled. We could create a model or many models to determine the winners of those tournaments, however for simplicity\u2019s sake, we\u2019ll use the at-large model\u2019s probabilities instead as it\u2019s a reasonable proxy for team strength. The teams with the highest probability of being selected for an at-large bid will be given their conference\u2019s automatic bid. Some of the conference tournaments were partially complete at the time they were cancelled, so any team that was eliminated won\u2019t be considered. There are two conferences where all teams share the exact same probability of ~ .005%: the MEAC and SWAC. In these two instances we\u2019ll take the top remaining seed from each which is NC Central and Prairie View. In four of the power conferences - ACC, Big East, Big 12 and the SEC - the top two or three performing teams share the same probability of 96.96% so we'll use the same approach and award the highest seed the conference automatic bid. The remaining teams will still receive an at-large bid. We then need to update the team selection for the American East Conference from 1467 to 1271 as team 1467 was eliminated in their conference tournament and 1271 was the highest remaining seed. Lastly, we have to update the variable \u2018won_final_game\u2019 for the 32 teams receiving auto-bids and for the 36 at-large teams as it was created to identify conference tournament winners."}}
