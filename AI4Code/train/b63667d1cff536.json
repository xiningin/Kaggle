VADER is one example of such method. Wtihe VADER, the sentiment score of a sentence is the normalised sum of sentiment scores of each word in that sentence.\n\nThe machine learning method is applied when an pre-labeled dataset is available and uses it as a training dataset to predict the sentiment of a new text. This is essentially a prediction\/classification problem.","34feb181":"The charts show that the majority of the reviews are positive (i.e. compoung score > 0). ","cc3f9399":"Samsung buyers are in general happy about the value-price combination. They also complained abbout battery life and screen condition.","693646be":"There is a strong correlation between the sentiment score derived by VADER and the actual rating from the reviewers. The VADER model proves to be a very powerful tool for sentiment classification.","811f7397":"Samsung and Apple are most rated brands, while Xiaomi has the highest average rating. Hence we will look deep into these three brands later.","3afeda01":"# Word Cloud\n\nGiven the size of the dataset, we created wordclouds only for the latest 1000 positive and negative reviews for Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi separately. The wordclouds are based on the frequency of words.","ca7886ff":"The LDA topic modelling confirms our findings from the wordcloud:\n* Apple buyers complain about battery life.\n* If the buyer bought a refurbished iphone, he would pay particular attention to batter health and screen condition.","b8889b47":"# Intro\n\nThis dataset contains 82,815 reviews from Amazon about cell phones from 2004 up until Sep 2019. Each review can be associated with an item and brand name and comes with a rating ranging from 1 to 5. This makes the dataset a perfect sample for text analytics and sentiment classification.\n\nWith multiple wordclouds and bar charts we found out that the two most popular brands are Apple and Samsung, and 96% iPhone offerings are renewed\/refurbished models sold by carriers. Among all brands Xiaomi has the highest rating. Therefore we would deep dive into these three brands.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Since almost all iPhones sold on Amazon are refurbished phones sold by carriers, buyers are satisfied when their purchases are in a (nearly) new condition and would complain if they find any scratches on the screen or the battery health is bad.\n\n\ud835\ude4e Samsung buyers are in general happy about the balance between quality and price. Their complaints are also mostly about battery and screen.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf3e Xiaomi buyers show specific appreciation about camera and the price-quality ratio - they really believe it's a good deal! However, they also complain about battery problem and some users have troubles in making phone calls.\n\nThe project also includes a non-supervised sentiment classification using VADER in the end. There is a strong positive correlation between the sentiment and the rating, which shows that VADER model is actually a very powerful tool.\n\nUpvote me if you like my solution! This means a lot for me and will keep me motivated for my next project!\n","9ab5ec9a":"For topic modelling we employ LDA model.

If we simply count the occurence of each word in each document, the highly frequent words start to dominate yet those words may not contain that much \"informational\" content (e.g. \"the\").
