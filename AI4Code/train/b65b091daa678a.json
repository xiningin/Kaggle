The embedding layer is much like a normal layer of a neural network that transforms an input matrix into a learned representation at each node, in this case each node in the layer is a word and the parameters of the layer will depict where that word sits in vector space relative to other words.\n\nFrom the docstring below we can see that the embedding layer receives a 2D vector with the shape (sample size,input length) where the input length is the length of our questions modified above. The output of the embedding layer is then (sample size,input length, embedding dimension).
