In reality, this is not always true as sometimes noisy, irrelevant splits may appear in the tree. Moreover, working with not useful features will cause your training to go slower.\n\nGenerally, widely recognized benefits of featue selection are:\n\n* simplification of models to make them easier to interpret\n* shorter training times,\n* to avoid the curse of dimensionality,\n* more generalization by reducing overfitting (reduction of variance)","f167f824":"![immagine.png](attachment:941cf5aa-8564-475b-ac05-5e2505a85605.png)","637f373c":"## Happy Kaggling!","d5d22f91":"#### Now we pick our best model and let Boruta-SHAP run a few experiments (usually 50 are enough) before getting the results.\n\n#### We cross-validate our experiments in order to ascertain that we are indeed picking the right variables\n\n#### as the results are prepared and we can plot them to visualize the Z-scores intervals of our features.
