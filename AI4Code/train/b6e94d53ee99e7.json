This scales the values in the particular feature such that they lie within 0 and 1.

What about the numerical features?\n\nShall we use histograms for this?\n\nWe can use histograms, but it suffers from binning bias. I would go with the Probability Density Function which says the probability of a random variable x picked at a time. Since the variable is continuous, we have chosen PDF.\n\nWe also have something called Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function, which says the probability of getting a value less than or equal to a random value picked at a time. Simple! This is a cumulative distribution function basically, except the fact that the CDF works on samples whereas the ECDF works on the real data.\n\nLet me write a simple function which can plot both ECDF and PDF. ","78975190":"Hello Viewers!\n\nThanks for viewing my notebook on classifying the Penguins to different species based on available attributes.

While we feed the system the input features, we also say the expected output. In this case, we are training the system with predictors (independant variables) along with the target (dependant variable).\n\n### Classification:\nClassification is a subset of supervised learning where the output or dependant variable is discrete. We have the 'Species' feature as the target which is discrete.\n\nHence this is a classification problem. However this dataset can also be used to carry out clustering tasks as well. We are not covering clustering in this notebook.","48fb1a12":"Did you notice the mean is now in the same range?\nAlso the min and max of every variable are 0 and 1. So the dataset is now normalized.

Look at the value in y-axis corresponding to the mean. It is somewhere around 0.5. \n\nThis infers that the probability of getting a value less than the mean culmen length is 0.5!\n\nQuite interesting right?\n\nLet's now look for the probability of getting a value less than the culmen length 40mm. It is around 0.2, which means there is only a 20% chance of the culmen length to be less than 40mm if you randomly pick a value.\n\nYou got the logic?","d5a4416f":"Since we are all set, let's start the modelling.
