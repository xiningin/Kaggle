The plot is known as one axes and the canvas is known as a figure.\n\nAn axes is a part of a figure where we will be plotting data. One figure can have more than one axes. To create more than one axes, we have to use a function called `subplots` and that function will return two objects - object of the figure and the list of axes. We can pass the number of axes in each row and column as the arguments. If no argument is passed, it will assume that there is just one axes.","06bfe075":"## Stack Plot","c79b1519":"# Different graphs in Matplotlib\n\nNow, we will try plotting different types of graphs using matplotlib.
