So, parallel to our traditional test-based classes, we had a virtual environment capable to support online interations and posts (forum-like).\nSo, given both real interactions (exams, named of sk_number_classroom) and online interactions (forum votes) some questions came up:\n1. Is there any pattern between online behavior and exams performance?\n2. Is it possible to predict student sucess based on his purely online interactions?\n3. Any statistical study in order to bring insights","1044759c":"So, in this notebook, I'll try to fit the **second** question, trying to predict their success based on the online posts reactions received. This way, the learning environment could help teacher to support low interactive students and better understant their lacks.","d5857ad0":"# 2. Feature Scaling and target","d796e0b5":"# 5.

But I can see a lot of improvements on it to make it more robust:\n1. Use some minority oversampling technique to improve data points (i.e SMOTE);\n2. Hyperparameters tuning and more models;\n3. A nice feture engineering;\n4. An unsupervised approach."}}
