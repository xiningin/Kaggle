There were 60 women solo travellers in Pclass 3 compared to 84 non-solo woman travellers and it is here that perhapes we see the 4th and the greatest act of altruism seen aboard the the Titanic. While there can be other reasons for this, in my view this happened because the women here travelling with their husbands and male children(>12 years of age) did not possibly want to leave them even though they had a chance to do so!! Some individual acts of chivalry and altruism have been recognized on the Titanic, but this perhapes is the greatest of them all and it is a pity that this has not been called out so far.","1b914472":"Fare & Ticket number seem to be interesting columns and will need some exploration. If fare is low it may be possible (though not appropriate) that the chances of survival could be low. Low fare also could mean low Pclass. There are 3 Pclass indicating whether passenger is travelling 1st, 2nd or 3rd class. Common sense (partially influenced by Hollywood) dictates that  Pclass=3 has higher risk of mortality compared to Pclass=2 who have higher risk of mortality compared to Pclass=1 \n\nCabin seems to have lots of NaNs (missing data). Not sure if this is really going to be useful.\n\nThe NAME has the title which can be used to derive the Sex column and can also help in guessing missing ages. **Master** Title is used for male child though **Miss** is used for both girl child as well as grownups. Since there are so many missing ages, this column can definitely help in 'guessing' some of the missing ages. Of course we can 'feed' this data (with missing ages) as-is to the ML algorithm but it will not perform so good in that case. If we clean up the data a bit by filling in good estimates of missing values, it will perform so much better. Of course we could use one more ML model just to guess the missing ages as so many kernels on Kaggle have done and then feed it to the main ML which predicts the survival. At this stage I dont want to comment without checking the data but I feel Age (in terms of its numerical value) is not a very strong indicator of survival. However the fact whether the person is a child or a middle aged person or a senior citizen could play an important role. Since we dont want to use a electric hacksaw where a small chisel more than capably does the job, we will use simple logic to fill the missing age data and call upon our ML model friends only when perdicting the survival.\n\nThe surname could help us group the individuals into families.

Print *train_data.isnull().sum()* and see for yourself. As we discussed, the o\/p is a '**Series**' object and returns the count of all nulls for each column..  \n\nDividing that by the length will give you the %age of missing values.

With some experience gained in real competitions (a modest 3 bronzes in last one year with weekend Kaggling), I went back to this code which was my first Kaggle program and hence special to me. There is one strong positive and one strong negative message I want to convey about this code. The negative message is about the readability & simplicity of the Python code. When moving from other conventional languages to Python, a lot of people often tend to get quite excited about the wonders 1-line of Python code can achieve. I too went overboard with the 1-liners trying to make the Python code as compact as possible and in the process the whole program has lost its simplicity and beauty. This is not how a program is meant to be written. If there is one thing I have learnt in the past year, it is that code should be kept as simple as possible and this kernel is definitely not at that standard. Simplicity has been compromised to make the code more compact. \n\nThe GOOD news is that I still find the EDA very relevant and highly impactful. After 1 year year, if I had to go back and re-do the EDA and come up with observations about the dataset, I couldnt have done a better job than what is already done. Titanic competition is a decade old and yet the EDA has at least 5-6 interesting observations which havent been reported by anyone before in the last 10 years and is worthy of further investigation. Hence I will not be deleting this kernel, but would like to request users not to upvote the same unless the code is simplified. In simplicity lies elegance and just like the code your model too should reflect that simplicity. Guanshuo Xu is the Kaggle number 1 and his profile page carries a simple message - \"Build a model is very simple, but build a simple model is the hardest thing there is\". Very profound.\n\nWishing you all the very best on your Kaggle journey\n***************************************************************\n\n\n# Captivating conversations with the Titanic Dataset using Python\/Pandas\n![Screen%20Shot%202020-06-08%20at%2010.12.08%20PM.jpg](attachment:Screen%20Shot%202020-06-08%20at%2010.12.08%20PM.jpg)\n\nIf you are a newcomer, this easy EDA notebook which has less than 70 lines of code takes you thru' the entire data exploration & visualization stage from beginners to advanced perspective.

Some of them well documented in the past and some not. A few samples:\n- *Would you feel safer if you were traveling Second class or Third class?* Contrary to popular opinion made famous by Hollywood movies, you had **DOUBLE** the chance of surviving the Titanic as an adult male if you travelled **THIRD** class instead **SECOND** class. You many not see too many other kernels talking about this interesting fact\n- \"*What's in a Name? That which we call a rose, By any other name would smell as sweet*\" -  Act II, Scene II - Unfortunately the Titanic data set seems to violently disagree with Juliet (& the old Bard) for people with short names had extremely high mortality rate on the Titanic compared to people with long names\n- *A case for Altruism on the high seas* - Darwin was proved wrong that night, but does the data speak of any other acts of altruism that went undocumented?\n- *Oops Errata on the Titanic dataset tutorial blogs* - One original mistake, several copies\n- *Females on the Titanic may have been charged a little more* - But males paid with a lot more \n- *Correlation is not Causation* - The fallacy of the 'Survival of the Groups' conclusion\n- *What is the single biggest indicator of survival on the Titanic data set* - No it is none of the 11 columns listed in the dataset\n- *No matter what the leaders say - going solo does not necessarily mean you had lower chances of survival*. If you were a female, you **WOULD** want to fly solo in order to survive the Titanic. Upon probing why, the data narrates a heart-wrenching tale involving the ultimate act of sacrifice that played out on that fateful night more than 100 years back...\n\nThe Titanic competition was hosted in late 2012. It involved predicting whether passengers on the Titanic would survive or not..given a set of characteristics like their age, Sex, class of travel, port Embarked  etc. The data set consists of a training data file and a test data file in CSV form. The files are very small. The aspiring data scientist is supposed to make his model 'learn' from the training data set (which contain an additional column on whether the passenger survived or not) and apply these 'learnings' to the test data set and predict which of the passengers in the test dataset survives. I thought of peppering my code with enough documentation so that it can act as a Tutorial for other new comers like me. \n\nThese are just recorded transcripts of a series of fascinating conversations I had with a very old dataset (a centenarian) over the course of many Sundays. These conversations were in Python - a language I tried to learn just to talk to her. A bit of ML theory is good-to-have while going thru' this code, but even if you don't have that it is perfectly fine as you will be able to easily understand the code & the intent. It is not necessary for you to know either Python or Pandas to understand the 70 odd simple lines of code that follow. Interestingly enough, though I wanted this to be a beginners exercise, it ended up being an extremely inquisitive research into this dataset..leading to some very startling observations. A bit of programming experience in any language is all that is needed as a pre-requisite. Each time, I use a new Python or Pandas command, I explain what it does... So the whole code reads somewhat like an interesting story (at least that is my hope).\n\nFrom 2012 to 2017, scores on the leaderboard for the Titanic competition moved upto a high of 81-82%. About couple of years back, there was a renewed interest in this data set and the needle was pushed by to 83-84% where it is currently stuck. The renewed interest was primarily due to Chris Deotte (currently Kaggle number 1 on the discussion board and number 2 on Notebooks board) who applied some innovative models to squeeze out more info from the dataset and inspired others to come up with similar such solutions. In fact, not only did Chris raise the bar higher but he also actively participated in many discussions around this dataset on Kaggle prompting, helping and motivating people to do better. Of course the Titanic survival outcomes are well-known and hence in recent times, one has seen multiple scores of '100%' without accompanying details. These along with some semi-complete models (with pre-tuned parameters) giving ridiculously high scores can be ignored as there were several 'unknown' factors at play that night on the Titanic (one simple example is - few people were 'doomed' to die but survived simply because when the ship sank, they happened to be near a lifeboat that had some space & some kind souls). Also as it is a beginners competition, many get excited on seeing scores of 90%+ on the training dataset and blog about it only to then get disappointed when they apply their model to the actual test data. But we will not worry about scores at all. The whole intent is to use this as a learning experience (though you will be pleasantly surprised to know the final score we end up with). We will SOLELY use the Kaggle dataset to come to our conclusions and will NOT refer to any external source of data. Some Kagglers do take into account all public information available other than survivorship (for e.g. which all cabins on the Titanic were located closer to the lifeboats) while designing their models but we will not do this. \n\n*\"Talk is cheap. Show me the code\"* - Linus Travolds\n\nCouldn't agree more, Sir! Here we go.. \n\nbut cannot resist adding one additional line to your immortal quote. Considering the plethora of modern day free software libraries available:\n\n*\"Talk is Cheap, Code has also become cheap. Show me the (engineered) Data\"*","a8c6a5ad":"All these observbations are statistically significant and cant be explained by any reason other than maybe there were more children in those groups? Unfortunately there are too many age=nulls here. The only other reason I could assume for high survival among Port Q Pclass 3 females is that there were more percentage of solos there. A quick check shows this to be true 25 out of 33 females embarked at Q were solos and 19 of them survived (out of total survived of 24). For port S - 19 out of 58 non-solo females in Pclass 3 survive wheras 14 out of 30 solos survive. So the low %age of survival among Port S Pclass 3 females and high % of survival among Port Q Pclass 3 females can be explained by the %afe of solos amongst them. There could be other explanations but this seems to be a logical one. \n\nFor males the data is bit inconcusive\n* 1 in 10 Pclass 3 Port Q males with families survive. 2 out of 29 without families survive. Total 3 out of 39\n* 5 out of 33 bachelors survive in Pclass 3 C port. 5 of 10 with families survive. Total 10 out of 43\n* 9 out of 63 family men in Pclass 3 Port S survive. 25 out of 202 bachelors. Total 34 out of 265\nIt does appear that fate dealt a poor hand to males @ Port Q and a better hand to males @ Port C. We may want to discard the Embarked column along with the Cabin col as that too does not seem to add much value, but we will keep it for now. Maybe folks on certain ports were allocated rooms closer to the lifeboats..There is a slim chance of this but we will keep this column for now\n\nWe havent still analyzed the Name and the Ticket columns. When checking the corelations between variables, I found something unbelievable..Those people with lengthy Names had clear high chances of survival! Then it stuck me that maiden names are part of the name for married females. Thus if we sort by the length of the name, we get mostly all the women first and then later the men. Since it is undeniable that Woman across all Pclasses have clearly higher mortality than men, this explained the corelation. Do create a new col containing the length of the person's name and plot it against survival rates using any of the above graphs we discussed.\n\nThe second aspect is that Names combined with Tickets allow us the ability to Group people. They will provide us valuable hints to who all are travelling together...which brings us to the last and most important point. I realized this while plotting the group size versus survival. While analyzing the data I realized that while there is no connection between large groups and survival, there was a definite connection between survival of members within a team. This - more than Sex, Pclass and Age determines if a person survives or not for a vast majority of the population (barring Pclass 1 and 2 females who almost always survive). More specifically within a group, if we do a sub-grouping based on Sex, we can get to a fine degree of prediction of survival. So we must now build families and groups on the Titanic which is our next job!\n\nNext 3 kernels due are:\n- Imputing the missing values - https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allohvk\/titanic-missing-age-imputation-tutorial-advanced\n- Building families on the Titanic\n- Feature engineering and ML modelling\n\nYour votes will motivate me to spend a lot of time docuemnting my code like I did this one.","528f2a04":"It appears as if solo travellers are at high risk. From 2-4 groups though the survival rate is high and then 5 onwards the survival rate dips completely. This observation is made by almost all Kaggle posts and indeed some of the very tall leaders have also made this observation in their analysis. Intuitively it may seem true - If you are travelling in a larger group, you would perhapes be made aware faster of the impeneding tragedy because of the sheer size of the group. On the other hand solo travellers, may have been fast asleep in their bunks and may have gotten the news late. As group size increases, perhapes it became more and more difficult to collect everyone & make a dash for safety and so maybe with larger groupsize the trend turns negative and survivals dip.\n\nMy initial conjecture was while this could be true, I felt that this could be a case of corelation instead of causation. Causation explicitly applies to cases where a factor X causes outcome B. On the other hand, correlation is simply a relationship. B happens when X happens but it does not necessarily mean that X causes B. In other words, correlation does not imply causation. What I mean by this is that while I felt that the above observation is true (the probability of survival is less if group sizes >4) but it does not mean that it is 'caused' by the same. In other words having larger groups did not 'cause' the survival rate to plunge. What I felt was actually happening is that large group sizes were more prevelant in Pclass 3 who anyway had a lower chance of survival based on the class of travel. In other words Pclass=3 was the causation of high mortality and groupsize>4 was just corelated to higher mortality. However I did feel that being solo DID increase mortality rate. Let us quickly see if all this is true.","c847077b":"Lo and behold, Indeed in Pclass=1, there is **2.5 times more survival chance** if you are between 20-30 as compared to 65. As the Pclass changes we can see how the survival gap narrows between the 2 age groups. Is this an act of altruism? Letting the younger males live? Why is this limited only to the first class? A quick analysis of data shows that Pclass 2 and Pclass 3 have statistically insignificant older males who survived. Perhapes this is skewing the data. Ok. But Pclass1 has 17 people greater than 60 which is not a insignificant number. Or is it that there were more males among the elderly and more females among the middleage group in Pclass 1..so that is the reason for the disparity. A quick series of commands reveal that only 2 males >60 out of 19 in pclass 1 survive as compared to 9 out of 19 for middle age group. Thus even after accounting for all parameters we see that this 14% survival versus a near 50% is a mystery. It is not that the middle age folks pushed around the older lot. In fact much of the evacuation was orderly except for the very last few unfortunate minutes. Most of the folks who exipred were able bodied middle aged males..which is why I talked about Darwin beng proved wrong that night as the first act of altruism. But looks like there is a twist to this theory as far as first class passengers are concerned. It does look like some of the older males voluntarily made way for the younger males..Could this be the 2nd act of altruism on the Titanic? The data is very small but not insignificant and it does point towards that direction.\n\nSo AGE definitely plays a factor in survival and this is not just limited to the kids getting a higher survival rate. There are other factors at play as well. It is imp to get the missing ages right and we should not be relying just on the mean to fill the same.\n\nAnother stunning data presents itself when we further add the sex condition to the filter and calculate the above formulas once again. We see that NONE of the 33 Pclass 2 males in the middle age group (20-30) age group survives (there is 1 survivor in the elderly group but that is stastically insignificant). Ideally, there should be around 16% survival chance for Pclass 2 Males as per our earlier observation. In fact it is so curious that I extend the age ranges and found that 4 out of 77 males between 20-60 age group survived. Thisis just 5%, the survival rate for Pclass 2 males should be 16%. This could mean either of 2 things: Eitherin Pclass 2 more kids survived than normal or there were more %age of kids in Pclass 2 males. This means that adult males in Pclass 2 had actually less survival chance compared to Pclass 3 and kind of turns popular theories around the head. Let us check this...\n","3f0969f3":"Unbelievably fascinating and a wonder this has not been documented so far. Let me again paraphrase it - 'Adult males travelling in Pclass 3 had MORE THAN TWICE the chances of survival as compared to adult males travelling in Pclass 2' or to put it bluntly if you were an adult male, you had double the chances of survival if you got yourself booked in 3rd class on the Titanic rather than 2nd class! This does turn popular theories on the head.. The data was lying all out there waitingfor someone to unravel it. But more importantly how many more insights are still there - waiting to be unravelled. We have discovered 3 acts of altruism so far on the Titanic. The first one was well known. The second is not very conclusive due to lack of enough data but is not statistically insignificant. The third was a big surprise to me. A huge chunk of Pclass 2 males voluntarily gave up their lives so that more females and children (from all classes) survive. Are there any more acts left? Let us see.","a746f072":"Aah now the curious observation we made earlier about Pclass 2 males can be clearly seen. See how narrow the green plot is from age 16 onwards? Survival rate is far more worse than Pclass 3 if you can compare. Let us jot what all we can see from this graph apart from the above.\n* All children upto age 18 survive in Pclass 1 male. All children up to age 16 survive in Pclass 2. \n* Above age 45, almost all Pclass 3 males expire. Between 16-40 Pclass3Males have a decent survival chance, way above Pclass2Males and almost comparable to Pclass1Males in that age group\n* Pclass3female kids have lesser chance of survival than Pclass3Malekids\n* Pclass1female kids show higher mortality than all other class. As 97% Pclass1females survived, this may be a statistically insignificant data. \n\nWe will revirify all this once again later during feature engg. Another observation is that during feature engg, we may want to combine Pclass and Sex..Together they give a lot more info rtather than separately as we just saw. The ML model may also appreciate this 'small' decision of yours vastly :)","ab6eb0dc":"Let us also see if calculating the actual fare makes any sense. If Ticket num is same, then fare is the sum of all tickets having the same ticket number. So divide fare by the number of (same)tickets to get actual fare. Note that here we HAVE to dip into \"test\" data frame to get this data. Normally this is frowned upon as this results in a leak from test to train but for below purpose it is OK. Let us add a new column called PeopleInTicket which will list count of persons per each ticket. But before that let us combined test & train data and create a 'combined' dataframe. We use a 1 line Append command.\n\nNext, we will use the value_counts() command which is like the swiss knife in the Pandas arsenal. value_counts() returns a \"**series**\" object containing the frequency of the column in question. You can print it and see. So try printing combined['Ticket'].value_counts()\n\nThe command we will use is:\ntrain_data['PeopleInTicket']=train_data['Ticket'].map(combined['Ticket'].value_counts())\n\nWe will pass the series object o\/p returned by value_counts() to a map() command which acts on a \"series\" object X using a \"series\" object Y as input. Here X is Combined['Ticket'] and Y is combined['Ticket'].value_counts(). Print both invidivually and see if you have any confusion. map() maps the values from two series that have a common column. In this case Ticket is the common column. The net effect of above command is to add a new column in train_data which holds the number of people in each ticket. In other words, we can use map to perform a lookup on the key and return the corresponding 'mapped' value. Now calculating Fare per person is a simple job.."}}
