It can be seen that the Ages from 27 to 39 are very much frequent but there is no clear pattern, we can only find some group wise patterns such as the the older age groups are lesser frequent in comparison.

There are few people who earn more than 100 US Dollars. Most of the people have an earning of around 50-75 US Dollars. Also, we can say that the least Income is around 20 US Dollars.\n\n\n2. The most regular customers for the  has age around 30-35 years of age. Whereas the the senior citizens age group is the least frequent. Youngsters are lesser in number as compared to the Middle aged people."}}
