HTX are products with high R&D intensity, as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD has identified specific products in this category in the sectors of aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, electronics-telecommunications, scientific instruments, electrical machinery, chemistry, non-electrical machinery and armaments.\n\nWith an accelerated fourth industrial revolution and rising consumption of R&D-intensive goods, global trade in high-technology products can be expected to remain a key growth driver. India, a leading provider of software exports, can emerge as a key player in the evolving HTX regime.\n\nCite -[ Confederation of Indian Industry](https:\/\/www.ciiblog.in\/technology\/indias-high-technology-exports\/)","d523a521":"# Importing Necessary Libraries","4d70fbfe":"**Percentage of manufactured goods that were exported.**","c12d264c":"***Work in progress.*** \n\n*  Edit 1 21\/10\/2020\n*  Edit 2 24\/10\/2020\n*  Edit 3 29\/10\/2020","4dfb54ed":"*Use this to scale percentages with the exports*","517f3d7e":"**All the columns do not have the same units.** \n\nSome are in US$, some are pure numbers of application and some come as a (%) of GDP or person per million estimates. \n\nLet's make sure we don't compare columns with different units.","7c04af24":"# Data preprocessing"}}
