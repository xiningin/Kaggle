The set of included instruments changes daily and is determined based on the amount traded and the availability of information. This means that there may be instruments that enter and leave this subset of data. There may therefore be gaps in the data provided, and this does not necessarily imply that that data does not exist (those rows are likely not included due to the selection criteria).\n\nThe marketdata contains a variety of returns calculated over different timespans. All of the returns in this set of marketdata have these properties:\n\n- Returns are always calculated either open-to-open (from the opening time of one trading day to the open of another) or close-to-close (from the closing time of one trading day to the open of another).\n- Returns are either raw, meaning that the data is not adjusted against any benchmark, or market-residualized (Mktres), meaning that the movement of the market as a whole has been accounted for, leaving only movements inherent to the instrument.\n- Returns can be calculated over any arbitrary interval. Provided here are 1 day and 10 day horizons.\n- Returns are tagged with 'Prev' if they are backwards looking in time, or 'Next' if forwards looking.\n\nWithin the marketdata, you will find the following columns:\n\n- time(datetime64[ns, UTC]) - the current time (in marketdata, all rows are taken at 22:00 UTC)\n- assetCode(object) - a unique id of an asset\n- assetName(category) - the name that corresponds to a group of assetCodes. These may be \"Unknown\" if the corresponding - assetCode does not have any rows in the news data.\n- universe(float64) - a boolean indicating whether or not the instrument on that day will be included in scoring. This value is not provided outside of the training data time period. The trading universe on a given date is the set of instruments that are avilable for trading (the scoring function will not consider instruments that are not in the trading universe). The trading universe changes daily.\n- volume(float64) - trading volume in shares for the day\n- close(float64) - the close price for the day (not adjusted for splits or dividends)\n- open(float64) - the open price for the day (not adjusted for splits or dividends)\n- returnsClosePrevRaw1(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenPrevRaw1(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsClosePrevMktres1(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenPrevMktres1(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsClosePrevRaw10(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenPrevRaw10(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsClosePrevMktres10(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenPrevMktres10(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenNextMktres10(float64) - 10 day, market-residualized return.

For a given story, alerts and articles have separate sequences.\n- provider(category) - identifier for the organization which provided the news item (e.g. RTRS for Reuters News, BSW for Business Wire)\n- subjects(category) - topic codes and company identifiers that relate to this news item. Topic codes describe the news item's subject matter. These can cover asset classes, geographies, events, industries\/sectors, and other types.\n- audiences(category) - identifies which desktop news product(s) the news item belongs to.

As a result, the entire news item's text (headline + body) will be used to determine the sentiment score.\n- relevance(float32) - a decimal number indicating the relevance of the news item to the asset. It ranges from 0 to 1. If the asset is mentioned in the headline, the relevance is set to 1. When the item is an alert (urgency == 1), relevance should be gauged by firstMentionSentence instead.\n- sentimentClass(int8) - indicates the predominant sentiment class for this news item with respect to the asset. The indicated class is the one with the highest probability.\n- sentimentNegative(float32) - probability that the sentiment of the news item was negative for the asset\n- sentimentNeutral(float32) - probability that the sentiment of the news item was neutral for the asset\n- sentimentPositive(float32) - probability that the sentiment of the news item was positive for the asset\n- sentimentWordCount(int32) - the number of lexical tokens in the sections of the item text that are deemed relevant to the asset.

The ubiquity of data today enables investors at any scale to make better investment decisions. The challenge is ingesting and interpreting the data to determine which data is useful, finding the signal in this sea of information. Two Sigma is passionate about this challenge and is excited to share it with the Kaggle community.\n\nAs a scientifically driven investment manager, Two Sigma has been applying technology and data science to financial forecasts for over 17 years. Their pioneering advances in big data, AI, and machine learning have pushed the investment industry forward. Now, they're eager to engage with Kagglers in this continuing pursuit of innovation.\n\nBy analyzing news data to predict stock prices, Kagglers have a unique opportunity to advance the state of research in understanding the predictive power of the news. This power, if harnessed, could help predict financial outcomes and generate significant economic impact all over the world.\n\n## Data Description\n\nIn this competition, we need to predict future stock price returns based on two sources of data:\n\n**Market data (2007 to present) provided by Intrinio **\n\nIt contains financial market information such as opening price, closing price, trading volume, calculated returns, etc.\n\n**News data (2007 to present) Source: Thomson Reuters**\n\nIt  contains information about news articles\/alerts published about assets, such as article details, sentiment, and other commentary.\n\n- Each asset is identified by an assetCode (note that a single company may have multiple assetCodes). Depending on what you wish to do, you may use the assetCode, assetName, or time as a way to join the market data to news data.\n\n## Data Mining\n\n**Important Note : **\n\nBefore we actually go into the details of market data and news data we will start with an data mining section to fetch the data from the Kaggle DataFrames provided as below \n\n### Import Libraries ","ff1f2180":"Now let us explore the data in detail .Firstly lets look at Market Data .\n\n## Market data","672d94f1":"Data mine both market data and news data from Kaggle ."}}
