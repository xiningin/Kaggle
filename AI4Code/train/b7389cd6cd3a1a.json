IMDb stores information related to more than 6 million titles (of which almost 500,000 are featured films). The dataset can be found here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/stefanoleone992\/imdb-extensive-dataset. The data was scraped from the website on 1\/1\/2020.\n \n\nWe will cover the following topics in this tutorial:\n1.

An example from our past bar chart is if we hover over the bar for drama, it will tell us exactly the number of movies this bar refers to. (12,543 Movies)\n\n#### - Compare data on hover: A very useful option, especially when you have subplots or more than one factor you are looking at, helping you to compare between values really easily.","7e64159d":"Then before we create our boxplot, we will have to modify the years representation so we show to Plotly how are we grouping.\n\nTo do that, we will replace every 10 years in a specific span with one value to represent them all.\n\nFor example, all years between 1980-1981 will be replaced by '1980' to represent a decade (10 years) and so on.","5581da94":"The movies dataset includes 85,855 movies with attributes such as movie description, average rating, number of votes, genre, etc.\n\nThe ratings dataset includes 85,855 rating details from demographic perspective.

Then I found Plotly, and it made my life easier.\n\nThis tutorial will introduce some basic methods to visualizing data using 'Plotly Express', a great library that provides interactive, responsive and  easily readable plots. There are many great visualizing libraries that currently exist and have a lot of great capabilities, but none has the interactive capabilities that Plotly Express offers to its users.\n\nAny figure created in a single function call with Plotly Express could be created using graph objects alone, but with between 5 and 100 times more lines of code. Visualizing data is great, but being able to interact and apply edits and filters instantly to any chart, increases the value we can get from every line of code! It allows us to further analyse every aspect in a chart or a plot and explore new theories.","58062a5a":"<a id=\"11\"><\/a> <br>\n# Summary & References:\nThis tutorial highlighted just a few elements of what can be possibly achieved using Plotly Express.

Loading Data and plotting\n\nNow after we have installed and loaded all the relevant libraries, lets load our data. We are going to load the data in a dataframe format.\n\nIf you are going to follow this tutorial on your own machine, download the files from the dataset link on Kaggle: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/stefanoleone992\/imdb-extensive-dataset. Then unzip the `archive.zip` file to create a `archive` folder with a bunch of csv files inside. Rename the folder to `IMDb`. This folder contains the files we will need in order to properly use the dataset. So, you will need to copy this `IMDb` directory into the same folder as this notebook. Then you can load the data using the following commands:","c1dc5cf3":"Now using px.histogram(), we will map out the distribution","79b48d99":"Then we will only save the top 10 rows","522d3907":"Finally, now we can create a Plotly Bar chart in one line, the same way as we did in the past example, the only difference is that this time the color will be based on the total number for each genre.","4a9619f6":"From this we can see that the number of voters is actually decreasing, even though we noticed the number of movies is not.\nTo make it easier to analyse and compare, we can select the \"Compare data on hover\" option from the top bar:\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/AndrewEdward37\/tutorial_images\/master\/compare_button.png)\n\nThen every time we hover over the male votes on a specific year for example, Plotly Express's interface will show us the coressponding value for females on the same year like this image:\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/AndrewEdward37\/tutorial_images\/master\/compare_example.png)","88464a72":"There we go! We have our dataframe ready, now we will create a box plot, simply using px.box() same the others. This time, we want to create different box plots for each decade and compare them side by side, so we will do that using the 'facet_col' parameter. This parameter helps us create subplots based on our 10 years grouping.\n\nAnother new parameter - But is explicitly for box plots - is the 'points' parameter. The parameter offers a lot of options to make adjustments to how a box-and-whisker diagram looks like. \n\nSome of the useful arguments that you can use for it is \n\n'all': which shows all points also on the plot\n\nFalse: Which hides the points from the plot\n\nFor this example we will set points to be False just because there are many points and depending on your computer it might crash it, but feel free to change it and see how it looks.","5e38445d":"Another amazing part about Plotly is the customization it allows to every chart.\n\nFor example, lets say instead of having to hover over every bar to find the number of movies created in that genre, we want to just see it on the graph. we can do that through the *text* parameter","b7048fe7":"### A. Seaborn","b9d1af57":"<a id=\"4\"><\/a> <br>\n# 4. Plotly's responsivity\n\nLets first explore the responsive options and buttons that Plotly's interface offers:\n\nAs you hover over the chart you should see an options bar at the top that looks like this:\n\n![x](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/AndrewEdward37\/tutorial_images\/master\/bar.png)\n<!-- [<img src = 'images\/bar.png' >]\n -->\nIf you want to disable this responsiveness, all you need to do is set the responsivity to False and pass that config variable to the show function:\n\n```config = {'responsive': False}```\n","87fba561":"<a id=\"9\"><\/a> <br>\n\n# 9. Box Plots\nThe plot type we will explore in this introductory tutorial is how to create a box plot using Plotly express and how also we can use subplots to compare data.\n\nLets say if we want to see what is the average and maybe optimal duration for movies and if that has changed drastically over the years from the 1980s till 2019. We will explore that using a series of boxplots created in a very simple way.\n\nFirst we will create a new DataFrame split to exactly the max and min years we want and is sorted by year ascendingly.","a441e1df":"<a id=\"3\"><\/a> <br>\n# 3. Bar Charts\n\nLets start by creating a simple bar chart using Plotly Express. Lets look at the 10 genres that have the most produced movies in all time.\n\nFirst lets group the movies in the dataset by genre in a new DataFrame","4af45f3e":"All of the new objects we just loaded are Pandas DataFrames.\n\nWe will merge both movies and ratings so we can use the ratings given to movies in our charts and use the .info() function to take a closer look at the columns in the IMDb dataset.","49e0322d":"As expected, we can see that USA, India and the UK have most shares. \n\nWhat if we want to exclude USA and we want to look at India's share of producing movies compared to the rest of the world (the other 8 countries in this case)?\n\nUsing other libraries, you would typically create a new Dataframe where USA is excluded and run again, or maybe we can just start calculating it.\n\nWith Plotly's responsive layout, all we need to do is click once on 'USA' in the legend and automatically Plotly will exclude it from the plot like this:\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/AndrewEdward37\/tutorial_images\/master\/pie_chart_exclude.png)\nSo now we can easily conclude with one-click that out of all the countries outside of USA, India produces 24.7% of all movies.","19bee78c":"Another great responsive feature that Plotly offers is that you can compare between segements in each bar separately, giving you more insights into the data and help you look at trends.\nFor example, if we want to look at how the number of *Horror* movies produced overtime in the 2000s separately, all we need to do is double click on the \"Horror\" tag in the legend on the right side and it will transform the graph to show only \"Horror\" movies numbers like the image below:\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/AndrewEdward37\/tutorial_images\/master\/horror_filter.png)","30f2ba2f":"For this task, we will look at the top 10 companies with most movies produced in the world, lets see how we can visualize this using the three libraries.","d941c96e":"Plotly also offers a great way to look at details in each bar that are beyond showing the total number of movies represented.\n\nLets look at the next example, this time we will look at the movies produced in the 2000s. We will look at the number of movies created every year and with the help of Plotly, we will find out which genres were the most popular. \n\nFirst we will create a new DataFrame using the groupby() function, grouping the rows by year and genre and then using the count() function we will get the number of movies for year and genre.","f06c9b2d":"Then since the budget column is currently not in a numeric type, we will fix that first.","671bb109":"<a id=\"1\"><\/a> <br>\n\n# 1. Installing the libraries\n\nBefore getting started, you'll need to install the various libraries that we will use. You can install 'Plotly' using pip:\n\n    $ pip install plotly==4.11.0\n\nor using conda:\n\n    $ conda install -c plotly plotly=4.11.0\n\nIf this install does not work for you, please consult with the documentation of the library. After all installs are run, make sure the following commands work for you.","3fdbb103":"<a id=\"6\"><\/a> <br>\n# 6. Scatter Plots\nScatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables using dots to represent the values. In Plotly Express, it is very easy to create one!\n\nIn this section, we will use a scatter plot to examine the relation between the scores given to movie by critics (Metascores) and the budgets spent on the movies by production companies for all movies produced in the year 2018.\n","f1d31ebf":"Now, all we need to do is call px.scatter() and input our x and y and color (How do we want Plotly to color the points).\n\nThe only point is that for this one we will add two new arguments.\n\n1- `hover_name:` Basically on hover over any point, what data should the plot present to you? For the purpose of this, we will make it the title of movie.\n\n2- `color_discrete_sequence:` Allows you to choose any color scheme you want, either setting it yourself or through the set color schemes that Plotly offers. For more info you can check this page: https:\/\/plotly.com\/python\/discrete-color\/\nAlso other themes exist for continous sequences, but since ours in here is qualitative, we will use this.","58ba1018":"<a id=\"8\"><\/a> <br>\n# 8. Histograms\n\nPlotly Express offers us the ability to creat histograms, helping us identify in a group of ranges, what is the distribution of some numerical data. So, lets try to create a histogram using Plotly Express to identify how the number of votes for movies had been changing over the years.\n\nFirst we will create a DataFrame from our main dataset to group all data by year and get the sum of votes for movies produced in every year.","80835087":"Then lets save the top 10 genres to a new df","9b4c0403":"<a id=\"5\"><\/a> <br>\n# 5. Line Plots\nNow lets look at another type of charts in Plotly: Line charts! Lets look over the years if the precentage of male vs female voters for movies on IMDb has changed. And what is better than a cool line chart to do that!\n\nWe will create a new DataFrame and save in it the total number of of male and female voters for movies by year."}}
