In this notebook I let two run_left agents play against eachother. One run_left agent runs towards his own goal and disappears from the field. The other player also a run_left agent runs towards the ball, gets the ball, turns around and puts the ball in his own goal!?? At this moment I cannot explain its behavior, maybe someone else has an explanation.\n\n[Football](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Association_football) is a game played with two teams of eleven players, including one goalkeeper. The object of the game is to outscore the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. The team with the higher number of goals wins the game. The game is played on a retangular field with a length between 100 and 110 meters and a width between 64 and 75 meters.\n\nBefore we can play football we need to install required tools:","03ab40df":"Here you can see the configuration of the game.","75b6c969":"The enviroment comes with four agents that can play football, well that is running to right, running to the left or doing nothing. One agent uses the builtin AI.","af13c3f9":"# Submit to Competition\n1. \"Save & Run All\" (commit) this Notebook\n1. Go to the notebook viewer\n1.

The run_left_agent function returns 1. This means that the agent runs to the left. The same applies for the 80ths step. At this point I don't know why the left_agent behaves in this particular way. If someone has an answer, please tell me.","c43e8870":"# Play some football\n\nTo get get a feeling of the game, lets play some football using the agents that are already present and render the game in the notebook (First I used the safari webbrowser and there was nothing to see, with chrome as a webbrowser I can see the game being played)","459fb1e0":"One run_left agent runs towards his own goal and disappears from the field.
