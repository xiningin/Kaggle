Further analyses could explore how different types of crimes vary in time and space. I didn't even consider the less serious UCR Part Two and Part Three crimes, which are far more common than Part One crimes, but include interesting categories such as drug crimes. Another interesting direction would be to combine this with other data about Boston, such as demography or even the [weather](http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/data\/ct-crime-heat-analysis-htmlstory.html), to investigate what factors predict crime rates across time and space.","631f5a46":"We can now associate high crime rates with particular districts, most noteably A1 and D4, which correspond to the most crowded areas of downtown Boston. There is also a very high crime region visibe in district D14.\n\nLet's make things pretty by using Folium to make an interactive heatmap of Boston crimes. I will use the 2017 data only for this plot.","fd5b65a6":"Larceny is by far the most common serious crime, and homicides are pretty rare. \n\n# When do serious crimes occur?\n\nWe can consider patterns across several different time scales: hours of the day, days of the week, and months of the year.","e958b5dd":"# Introduction\n\nThis EDA looks at crime incident reports in the city of Boston from June 2015 to September 2018. I use Folium for plotting an interactive heatmap of Boston, and seaborn for everything else.\n\nThe data is originally provided by Boston's open data hub, [Analyze Boston](https:\/\/data.boston.gov\/dataset\/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system). This [kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kosovanolexandr\/crimes-in-boston-multiclass-clustering) by [Kosovan Olexandr](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kosovanolexandr) helped me get started with this dataset, and this [other kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/daveianhickey\/how-to-folium-for-maps-heatmaps-time-analysis) by [Dave Fisher-Hickey](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/daveianhickey) helped me get started with Folium. ","bd7b9d37":"Hm, I'm not seeing any clear signals here. In fact, many of these holidays appear to line up with especially low crime rates, particularly Thanksgiving and Christmas. Of course, this is data from just a single year, and detecting an association between a given holiday and crime rates would require a lot more data and a model that accounts for other factors. However, this does cause me to question the general idea that crime increases surrounding holidays - if that *is* true, it isn't super obvious from a birds-eye view of the data. Even the entire [\"holiday season\"](https:\/\/www.cpss.net\/about\/blog\/2013\/11\/stay-safe-crime-rates-increase-during-holiday-season\/) from Thanksgiving to Christmas doesn't seem to be especially elevated compared to the summer.  \n\n# Where do serious crimes occur?\n\nWe can use the latitude and longitude columns to plot the location of crimes in Boston. By setting the alpha parameter to a very small value, we can see that there are some crime 'hotspots'. ","76e47e9e":"That looks like Boston alright. If you are at all familiar with Boston, you will not be too surprised to see that downtown Boston has the darkest points, but there are also some localities outside of the city center that have especially high crime rates. \n\nLet's make another scatterplot, but this time we'll color points by district to see which districts have the highest crime rates.","63153d9d":"Crimes rates are low between 1-8 in the morning, and gradually rise throughout the day, peaking around 6 pm. There is some variation across days of the week, with Friday having the highest crime rate and Sunday having the lowest. The month also seems to have some influence, with the winter months of February-April having the lowest crime rates, and the summer\/early fall months of June-October having the highest crime rates. There is also a spike in crime rates in the month of January. \n\nAre any other temporal factors associated with crime? [According to some crime experts](https:\/\/www.oxygen.com\/homicide-for-the-holidays\/blogs\/its-the-most-dangerous-time-of-the-year-why-do-crimes-increase), several types of crime tend to increase around the holidays, particularly larsony and robbery. This can occur for many reasons: crowded shopping centers create more cover for thieves, travelers leave their homes vulnerable to burglary, and increased alcohol and drug use can raise the likelihood of conflict-related crime. Let's see if there is any evidence for this in our data, focusing in on the year 2017. I also added in a couple of days that are known to be especially rowdy in Boston, even though they aren't official holidays: St. Patrick's Day and the Boston Marathon.","7614f20a":"# Types of serious crimes\n\nLet's start by checking the frequency of different types of crimes. Since we have subsetted to only 'serious' crimes, there are only 9 different types of offenses - much more manageable than the 67 we started with.","ae6c27a1":"First, let's clean up and simplify this data set. I am going to focus on the two years with complete data (2016 and 2017). I will also narrow in on [UCR Part One](https:\/\/www.ucrdatatool.gov\/offenses.cfm) offenses, which include only the most serious crimes."}}
