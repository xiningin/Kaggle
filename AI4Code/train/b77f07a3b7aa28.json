survival.\n-  With better technologies coming the rate of survival increased slightly for patients who where treated after 1966.\n-  The max impact on survival is of the number of positive axillary lymph nodes found in the patient. The lesser the no of lymphs found the higher is the chance of survival.\n-  90% of the patients have less than 8 and 20 axillary nodes for positive and negative result patients respectively.\n-  The mean of no of axillary nodes is 2.8 for patients who survived for atleast 5 years and 8.5 for patients who didn't survive for 5 years.","6d50e3e6":"> ### 3.2 Box Plots and Violin Plots\n> **Box Plot** is a simple way of representing statistical data on a plot in which a rectangle is drawn to represent the second and third quartiles, usually with a vertical line inside to indicate the median value. The lower and upper quartiles are shown as horizontal lines either side of the rectangle.<br>\n> **Violin Plots** are similar to box plots, except that they also show the probability density of the data at different values. It has four layers. The outer shape represents all possible results, with thickness indicating how common. The next layer inside represents the values that occur 95% of the time. The next layer (if it exists) inside represents the values that occur 50% of the time. The central dot represents the median average value.","ffc8933a":"# Haberman's Cancer Survival Dataset: EDA","2717a67f":"### Observations:\n-  No good separation can be done between the classes based on the pair plots.\n","a19a1954":"## 2.
