We need to build a forecasting model to help in the decision process.\n\nIn this particular notebook, we are going to load and explore the time series data provided in the Tabular Playground Series for Jan 2022.\n\nWe are going to cover the following steps:\n1. Import Libraries.\n2. Load Time Series Data\n3. Explore Time Series Data.\n4.
