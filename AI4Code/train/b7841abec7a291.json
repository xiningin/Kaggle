This simple template uses this fact to help saving time and GPU ressources during submission.\n\nWhat it does:\n* during saving it will just copy the `sample_submission.csv`.\n* it will detect if it is run against the private dataset since `sample_submission.csv` is different in the private environment. As far as I can see this does not count towards the GPU quota.\n* if you want to run everything during saving (for debugging etc.) choose `QUICKRUN=False` "}}
