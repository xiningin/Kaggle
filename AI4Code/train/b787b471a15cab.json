But in this mode, you can only find Overview, Variables Information and sample of the dataset! \nIt doesn't provide Interactions of numerical features, correlations info about the dataset but it works faster than full report!","4fb9aa0d":"## Introduction\n### In this tutorial,I only explain pandas_profiling library: it's sample usage and it's advantages and disadvantages!\nMost of us start modeling with the exploration of the data and for this reason we use describe, shape and some built-in features. \nAlso, we check missing percentages of the data etc.\n**pandas_profiling** does all of these works for us with single line code!\nLet's have a look at it!","c48d9982":"# **Some last words**\n\nThis is my first notebook and I just want to share useful information before starting the modelling. So if you have any ideas to feedback please let me know in comments, and if you liked my work please don't forget to vote, thank you!","9552750a":"As you see in the profiling report, this library gives us detailed information about the data which are Overview, Variables Information, Interactions of numerical features, correlations, missing value information and sample of the dataset. Now, let's look at the it's advantageous and disadvantageous\n\n**Advantages:**\n* It helps us to get a faster and easy analysis of the data.\n* It has a lot of informative features about the dataset.\n* Easy to use and interpret!\n* You can save the output as html for later! \n\n**Disadvantages:**\n* If you have a big dataset, you need to wait the creation of the profiling report.\n* If you have a lot of features in the dataset, it can be a little bit messy to interpret the results.\n* There can be some detailed information which you don't wanna work with them.\n"}}
