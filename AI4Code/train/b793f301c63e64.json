Here it is less likely that the pixels in opposite corner of the images will contribute to the classification. Therefore, I used the convolutional layer \n\n* Max Pooling Layer - It selects the maximum element from the region of the feature map covered by the filter. So, the output would be a feature map containing the most prominent features of the previous feature map.\n\n* Batch Normalization - It is technique for training very deep neural networks that standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch. This has the effect of stabilizing the learning process and dramatically reducing the number of training epochs required to train deep networks.\n\n* Dropout - It is a way of cutting too much association among features by dropping a specific percentage of weights randomly.\n\n* Flatten -  It is used when we get multidimensional output and want to make it linear to pass it onto a Dense layer. It is equivalent to numpy.ravel (Look at the shape before and flatten in the model summary)\n\n* Dense - are used when association can exist among any feature to any other feature in data point\n\n**The output layer in a classification problem should always be a softmax layer with the number of output classes as its paramter**\n\nNote - The choice of parameters are not explained here as it would take a good deal of understanding\/explanation.
