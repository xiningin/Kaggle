Conclusion\n\nWhilst the USA historcially accounts for the most CO2 emissions (since 1975) amongst all entitys, China accounts for 27% of global CO2 emisisons in 2017 with USA contributing ~ 15% and India ~ 7%. Global CO2 emissions have seen a sharp increase since the 1990's (approx), however in recent years this increase has slowed down with increasing global awareness for CO2 emissions and new global policies to combat CO2 emissions (e.g. Paris 2050 and Kyoto 2020). It is safe to predict that the CO2 emissions will eventurally come to a steady-state, but this cannot be achived without proactive efforts from all countries, especially, China, USA, India, ****and Russia.","749c7b43":"### Barchart","902dc150":"# Data Description\n\nThe CSV file gives all CO2 emissions for each country (from 1750 to 2017).\n\nOne line will give you an emission value for a given country at a given year.","47ce1e61":"### Treemap ","baf2b786":"### Barchart","4935ba53":"# 1.
