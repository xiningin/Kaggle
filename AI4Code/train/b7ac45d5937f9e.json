All dominant platforms in the EU market belong to Nintendo who also owns the highest-grossing games.\n\nPerhaps, this raises a significant insight. Marrying console and game makes optimal delivery to the consumer. Marketing coupling between medium and product may signify high ROI's and market segmentation on the console\/games level yields the optimal.\n\nFor example, whereas Xbox or the PS make mostly for individual gaming, Nintendo can market consoles and games together for the whole family and kids. \n\nOnce families are locked into the Nintendo ecosystem, it becomes easier to sell games accustomed to the specific demographic the ecosystem encompasses.\n\nMoreover, party games such as Wii Sports encourage shared buying of the console and games both within a family, as well as individuals sharing living spaces. \n\nThis makes it easier to sell higher volumes and lowers the potential buyer's remorse.","58f987e9":"It will be interesting to see what is the distribution of worldwide sales historically amongst publishers regarding the top 100 highest-grossing games.\n\nBy now, everybody expects Nintendo to have dominated the 80's and 90's until the upsurge of the Playstation and Xbox platforms.  We would expect the market to become more and more segmented as we move towards the present with Nintendo falling behind in the late '00s","519d640e":"In this notebook, we have performed a study on gaming sales data throughout history.\n\nThe ultimate winner -by far- in the gaming wars throughout the years has been Nintendo.\n\nBoth highest grossing games, as well as, highest-grossing platforms are owned by Nintendo. This proves that platform-game coupling is the ultimate combination of market dominance.\n\nAlso, younger ages, as is the primary Nintendo market, appear to be the most profitable demographic. \n\nFurthermore, aiming for family fun boosts sales potentiality. It is a fact that though multiplayer gaming has been on the rise since the early days, physical interactions as encompassed in Wii Sports are more fun.\n\nLastly, we have seen that platform exclusives are the driving force behind a platform adaptation. Comparing Xbox versus PS games\/console sales, this message becomes transparent. Not surprisingly, Microsoft has taken an offensive approach in incorporating game studios in an ultimate effort to beat Sony in the following gen-gaming wars.\n\nWhatever the outcome, consumers seem ever less inclined to care!...\n\nDiminishing game sales the last decade show that unless fresh ideas or novel gaming approaches come along,  the market may keep losing interest. \n\n","b149e91e":"When it comes to best selling genres, we see that Action-packed games, gross the highest. \n\nBut what is an action game?

Perhaps this means that the game has not been released in Japan or other countries. Perhaps, there is no sales data recorded for these regions. \n\nWe can only assume...\n\nFurthermore, the platform that contains missing publisher values often is GBA and the year 2004. \n\nAdditionally, in all of these entries but one, we encounter the 'misc' generalization in the Genre column.\n\nThese entries consist of bad data. We should consider dropping them.  Apart from the GBA titles, we also see a prevailing number of zeroes in the sales columns for the other platforms. \n\nTaking all these into account, it is clear that,  the sales volumes constitute small numbers that won't make a significant impact on total sales  if dropped.\n\n","524d5de9":"Now, let us have a look into the Sales numbers for each region","40c38510":"All in all, the gaming industry has been steady, devoid of innovation throughout the years.\n\nSuper Mario Bros, Wii Sports, Pokemon, and Tetris prove that it is not graphics nor budget extravagations that make a hit. We clearly see that as budgets rose and the industry has been multinational, the sales have been decreasing.\n\nPerhaps, what the industry needs nowadays, more than ever, is ideas and concepts! Long have we been playing the same game mechanics in different suits on different consoles. The variety in offerings is nowadays that huge, that nothing can create the hype that Nintendo managed to create back in the day.\n\nWe need more juice and not more stale eye-candy. We need more experiences and less repetition. Same old shall hold no more place in gaming ever-more.","4db501af":"Let's do some basic Data exploration asking questions and getting answers from the data.\n\nSome interesting insights we can get are:\n\n1. The top 5 best selling platforms \n2. The top 50  best selling games of all time\n3. The top 5 best selling platforms\n4. Gaming profiles by Regions. What Genre do they play? What platform has dominated?\n\n","ea9d9134":"Clearly, there has been some misunderstanding !!\n\nWe see that high grossing platform and sports games have been registered as 'Action'. Super Mario Bros should have been registered as 'Platform' and Wii Sports or Wii Fit should fall under the Sports category. \n\nMoreover, the 'action' classification should not have been used at all. It is merely an umbrella term encompassing multiple Genres like shooters, fighting games, etc. \n\nMismatching genres in such a magnitude constitute data exploration impossible as data corruption will skew any results.\n","b647fba2":"The only obvious transformation at first glance is the decimal format in the year column, is a pain in the eyes! Let's fix it :\n","7c719907":"There are the most interesting conclusions to be drawn here!\n\nFirst of all, we have to keep in mind the demographics. On a macroscopic level, Japan's Population is smaller than the EU, which in turn is smaller than North America's.\n\nHaving said that, we see NA sales getting a head-start in the early 80's which can only be attributed to the introduction of Atari home entertainment.\n\nFollowing on, we see the with the introduction of NES we see sales rise in all regions. The adoption of NES on the Japanese domestic market has been so successful, that in the early days, sales reached the North American numbers briefly.\n\nAt the year 1985 with the introduction of Super Mario, the console market peaks in Europe, and all game sales reach the first all-time high!\n\nAfterward, as we have seen before, the rise of Tetris has propelled sales even more.\n\nThe final peak can be attributed to the rise of Pokemon in the late 90's where once again, Japan crosses North America in sales numbers.\n\nAfterward, we see no such drastic ups and downs up to the present day. It seems that the Japanese market has never loved a publisher or console as much ever since, as  the sales numbers remain low compared to Europe and North America.\n\nThere is a considerable rise in sales at around the introduction of the present-day generation which, however, seems to be slowing down significantly.\n\nAll in all, the gaming market seems to homogenize completely as the years go by. This can all be clearly attributed to the rise of the internet and media globalization.","8d00cd1a":"In this graph, we see that retro gaming sales were the highest point the industry ever achieved. In particular, NES and GameBoy have made waves unsurpassed by any other platform or console generation.\n\nWe also see, with regards to Sony platforms, Playstation has been gaining steady, ever-increasing popularity, whereas Microsoft has faced ups and downs with the Xbox Platform.\n\nPerhaps, this is more a case of the popularity of the video games released in those Platforms themselves, rather than the medium.\n\nSony has found the wave to the consumer's heart whereas Microsoft was lacking behind in great releases ...\n\nLet's have a deeper look at the battle between these two rivals.\n\n","44497397":"There is an important message in this graph. Taking Nintendo out of the frame, we see that modern-day gaming comes into focus. \n\nWe see that the prevailing categories in global sales are shooters (first and third person), action games (like Assasin's Creed), and sports (Mainly Electronic Arts). This is easily concluded as the strongest publishers in this graph ( e.g. Microsoft, Activision, or Ubisoft) focus primarily in these categories.\n\nWe also, for the first time see Sega coming into play as it is no longer dwarfed by Nintendo.\n\nIt is fair to say, after the diminishing of Nintendo innovations, the gaming industry has become more standardized in its offerings.\n\nIn a way, the publishers try to brute-force each other battling in the same standardized Genres.\n\nPerhaps, this has given rise to the battle for ever greater horsepower under the hood in modern Consoles, instead of innovations in areas like player experience.\n\nNintendo has strongly proven that this approach is not a guarantee for higher sales. In almost all instances, its hardware has always been inferior to the competition. Gaming experiences, however, have always been what made the bang and bucks.","43045083":"There are 4 outliers in the global sales vs year graph above. The years 1985, 1989, 1996, and 2006 consist of releases that have sent sales through the roof!\n\nI guess that the 1985 release that has achieved as such is Super Mario Bros.  Can you guess the other three?\n","40f4633a":"Good news indeed! The zero sales numbers appear zero for countries the game has not been released in. \n\nWe arrive at this conclusion because of the fact that there are no zeroes in the Global_Sales numbers. Furthermore, looking at each region separately, we see that there is no more than one region with zero sales recorded at an instance.\n\nKeep in mind that in the null values data frame we dropped, we had instances where we had zeroes in all regions and nulls in the publisher column( e.g. entry 6105).\n\nSo, in the end, we need no further drops and can confidently carry on trusting our data deeper!!","bdd625eb":"Indeed, things turn out as expected! Nintendo has dominated game sales for three decades. Up until the gradual fall of Wii sports and the Wii platform in general.\n\nIt is also interesting that Sega, despite the aggressive marketing campaigns,  painted a bigger picture of itself than the numbers suggest. Globally, when it comes to the 100 highest-grossing games in history, its presence is menial.\n\n\nThis has paved the way for the rise of the present-day giant publishers like Activision or Ubisoft, as well as, Take-Two Interactive with the one-hit wonder: GTA\n\nThere steems another important message from these results. As games tend to copy one-another and the genres become more standardized like Shooters or third-person shooters, the lack of innovative ideas and concepts (like the Wii Platform and Wii sports) keep the industry stale and in decline. \n\nThe contenders fight for an ever-decreasing market pie and each new title similar to all the previous, however the small sales boost, saturates the market even more. \n\n","4720f63d":"> Data Transformation","610d8efe":"# **Conclusion","eaf4d061":"> The top 5 Best - selling platforms of all time","c214786b":">  Data cleaning","f78d5e8f":"Japan has always been a different beast on its own! \n\nAlthough we see many similarities between the European and North American markets, Japan has been mostly dominated Pokemon!\n\nWhy the Pokemon phenomenon has struck such a nerve within the Japanese market could constitute a qualitative study on its own and is far beyond the scope of this analysis.
