However only 11 artists have more than 200 paintings available here.\n* To reduce computation and better training, I decided to use the paintings of these 11 artists only.\n* Since this is an imbalanced datset (Van Gogh has 877 paintings whereas Marc Chagall has only 239), `class_weight` is important. Infact, it improved model performance substantially.\n* I used Keras `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation. This is not a traditional object detection problem, hence the augmentation approch should be used very carefully.\n* I couldn't experiment in detail, but so far `zoom_range` worked well. \n\n## Modelling and Training:\n* Use convolutional neural network based approach, with a pre-defined architecture as baseline.\n* I tried multiple architectures, however `ResNet50` worked well so far.\n* Pretrained weights on `imagenet` helped the model train better.\n* The objective is to identify artist and not objects in the images. So the model should understand the style of the image better rather than the final output. Hence, training of shallow layers is more important than the deeper layers.\n* The above statement is based on my understanding of the problem and experiments and observations.\n* Training the model for more iterations might improve the performance, at the cost of computation resource.\n\n## Predictions:\n* <b>The final model could identify the artists with an approximate accuracy of 99% on training set and 85% on cross-validation set.<\/b> ","165684e2":"## Evaluate performance","4f02695a":"# This portion is just for fun :) Replace the variable `url` with an image of one of the 11 artists above and run this cell.","1a05d047":"# Objective: \nDevelop an algorithm which will identify the artist when provided with a painting, with state of the art precision.","aad7ad9d":"# \"I dream of painting and then I paint my dream.\" - Vincent Van Gogh\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.vincentvangogh.org\/images\/paintings\/self-portrait-with-straw-hat.jpg\" width=\"400px\" height=\"200px\"\/>","c4c937d4":"# Let's implement \"DeepArtist\" :)","d32b6133":"## Training graph","6ed8c324":"## Confusion Matrix.

The ability of communicating imagination sets us apart from all other beings. Painting, being an expression of visual language, have attracted and connected the brilliant human minds since the dawn of civilization - from early drawings on walls of caves to paper or glass paintings of modern times, from charcoals in prehistoric times to water, oil, or pastel colors of today. We have travelled a long way, and have finally reached a stage where not only humans but computers, another brilliant creation of human minds, is creating paintings.\n\nFor an enthusiast of arts, identifying the paintings of her favorite artists is not that difficult, given years of careful practice and research. Given a painting, she can easily identify if it was painted by a painter she is passionate about. But can a computer do the same? Can a machine without emotions identify who the genius is behind a mindblowing painting?\n\nIn this kernel, let us try to explore that direction, using techniques of deep learning.\n\n#### Special thanks to [Icaro](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ikarus777) for sharing this wonderful dataset with us!","465b7d4b":"## Data Processing","a4cae488":"## Read data","dfa2417c":"## Build Model"}}
