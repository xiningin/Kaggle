This is because the Annual inflation rate was negative from 1930 to 1933, which means your 100 dollar's intrinsic value actually went up!\n\nOn the other hand, the lowest would be at 2020 where you can only afford 5.2 apples with your 100 dollars. ONLY 5 APPLES!!! \n\nThis is because after 1933, the annual inflation rate was always positive with some high inflation rate around 1950 and 1979 (Peaks of red point graph).\n\nThis is how scary inflation rate are!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n","e42be948":"**Lowest intrinsict value of 100 dollar : 5.21 at year 2020**"}}
