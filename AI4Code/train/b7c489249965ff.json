If you choose to do so, make sure that you have already joined the competition by clicking on the **Join Competition** button at [this link](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/home-data-for-ml-course).  \n\n1. Begin by clicking on the blue **Save Version** button in the top right corner of this window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n2. Ensure that the **Save and Run All** option is selected, and then click on the blue **Save** button.\n3. This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **Save Version** button.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen.  Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n4. Click on the **Output** tab on the right of the screen.  Then, click on the **Submit to Competition** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n\nYou have now successfully submitted to the competition!\n\n5. If you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the blue **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your model and repeat the process.
