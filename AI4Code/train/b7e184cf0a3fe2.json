So, I tried to diff the layers in any case. The most interesting part is maybe that they appear to be circular slices, with some static noise surrounding the actual \"beef\" in each layer:","96ef0339":"## Tilt\n\nThe patients and devices are sometimes tilted and positioned in different ways. Some of this data is available in the image metadata, but rather than try to play with that, perhaps some level of **rotation** is another useful augmentation to try?","43d8b057":"### Listing and Ordering the DCM files**","99358b3a":"## Shiny Objects\n\nBesides the above \"ray storm\", there were also multiple images with a shiny part emitting rays across.

Some images seem to show patients in different positions \/ angles both horizontally and vertically.\n- Adding noise. Some images had more static noise look than others. Not many very heavily, but some variation could be interesting to try.\n- Rotation levels. The angle of body changes in some images.\n- Dropping some parts of image. There is some variation in different parts being visible at different times.\n\nHow to best apply these to a 3D set of 2D images is another interesting question.. Or to model the 3D\/2D aspect in general.\n","e49b4f28":"## Patient Genders","5ab40e21":"## Glowing Eyes\n\nNot sure what this person had in their eyes.","7c8e265b":"And this one is much more so:","0ce605cd":"# Image Visuals","e0688666":"## Flat Shape 2\n\nThis one has the bones colored brighter white.
