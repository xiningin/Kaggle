However, because variables are correlated in this case, it didn't give us much information. \n\nMore applicable insights can be drawn from the EDA analysis. Customers with higher monthly bills are more likely to churn, especially for people who use calling service alot. The group that is most likely to churn are \n- customers who did not purchase a data plan, but still use our roaming service. \n- customers who did not purchase a data plan and still using our calling service aboved the average.

Maybe I can look into what might relate to them so that I can amplify the difference during feature engineering. \n* Group *\"Churned\"* has a disporpotionally high **DataUsage** of 0. It is hard to see why it is the case for now. However in generally DataUsage is highly skewed with lots of 0. \n* For **CustomerServiceCalls**, group *\"Stay\"* is as likely to make a call as Group *\"Churn\"* and the mode is around 2 calls. However, when it is more than 3 or 4 calls, it's mostly only Group *\"Churn\"*. \n\nNoticeable things between two different variables:\n* **DataUsage** has a linear relationship with **RoamMins** for the ones that are not 0. This needs further investigation to see if we can just use one of the variables. \n* **MonthlyCharge** has a positive relationship with **DataUsage**, **DayMins** and **OverageFee**","c4d56f8c":"- DataPlan: Customers who did not purchase a data plan has a significant larger change to churn. I wonder if this is because they still use data though without a data plan, which result in a higher fee. \n\n- ContractRenewal: Customers who did not renew our plan has a significantly larger churn. Thus, this can be a good variable to use in our prediction. However, we need to keep in mind that we have very uneven sample size. So the difference might only due to incomeplete data collection. \n\n- DataUsage: Customers who did not use data at all has a 7% larger churn rate. This could help us in the perdiction. THus, I will add the categorical feature. \n    - I wonder if this relates to they would call more often. And Calling time has a positive relationship with Monthly fee.

Over 90% of the customers use our roaming servcie and for those who didn't purchase a data plan, they have a high churn rate.
