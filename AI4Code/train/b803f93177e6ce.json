TotalBsmtSF          \n\n### So really we have only 7 variables left that share strong correlation with SalePrice. Everything else is less stronger than the above 7 variables. \n\n### We are going to try to work with and around them to accentuate(if possible) and construct a few more variables that might be better predictors of SalePrice.\n\n### To these, seven we will add some of the features which we cleaned up in our last step. The features we will be including are:\n\n**Hot Features:** These are the features that have the strongest correlation with SalePrice. \n\n**Basement based features:** These are stored in the list below called bsmt_feats. \n    Since area related features are very important to determine house prices, we add one more feature which is the total area of basement, first and second floor areas of each house (*Courtesy Serigne*)\n\n","4a275229":"### Let's create a DataFrame to keep track of what percentage of values in each column\/feature are missing or empty.

However, I don't feel comfortable moving ahead with columns that have over 80% missing values. At such a point, I feel like we are injecting bias if we replace them with say None or some other values. \n\n","da98a036":"### Let's take a look at this graphically too what percentage of the total values in each column are either missing or 0.

Not bad!!! \n\n### Let's train some regression models and make some predictions!!!\n\n### Before, we do that we need to handle the categorical variables. Luckily for us Pandas has a library to do just that called *get_dummies*.
