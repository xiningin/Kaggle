By any definition a gene must involve more than one nucleotide base pair. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) thus do not occur at loci, but rather in and around loci, and in this book we shall not write SNP markers as being \u201cat\u201d loci. Because of the confusion that occurs when SNPs are described as occurring at loci, some use the term \u201cgene-locus\u201d, but we shall always use the term locus for the location of a functional gene. We shall, however, allow SNP markers to have alleles and use the original term for their locations: \u201csites\u201d within loci or, more generally, sites within the region of a locus or anywhere in the genome.\"\n\n\"If in the population only one allele occurs at a site or locus, we shall say that it is monomorphic, or monoallelic, in that population. If two alleles occur, as is common for SNPs, we shall use the original term diallelic which, apart from having precedence, is etymologically sounder than the now commonly used term biallelic. If many alleles occur, we shall describe the polymorphism as polyallelic or multiallelic (the former term is arguably more logical, the latter more common). When there are just two alleles at a locus, the one with the smaller population frequency is called the minor allele. In genetics, the term allele\" \u201cfrequency\u201d--which is strictly speaking a count--is used to mean relative frequency, i.e. the proportion of all such alleles at that locus among the members of a population; thus the term minor allele frequency is often used for diallelic markers.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4450815\/","4970213d":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Genetic Terminology<\/h1>\n\nCitation: Elston RC, Satagopan JM, Sun S. Genetic terminology. Methods Mol Biol. 2012;850:1-9. doi:10.1007\/978-1-61779-555-8_1\n\n\"Common terms used in genetics with multiple meanings are explained and the terminology used in subsequent chapters is defined. Statistical Human Genetics has existed as a discipline for over a century, and during that time the meanings of many of the terms used have evolved, largely driven by molecular discoveries, to the point that molecular and statistical geneticists often have difficulty understanding each other. It is therefore imperative, now that so much of molecular genetics is becoming an in silico and statistical science, that the authors have well-defined, common terminology.\"\n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Gene Concept<\/span>**\n\n\"The concept of a gene (the word itself was introduced by Bateson) is due to Mendel, who used the German word \u201cFactor\u201d. Mendel used the word in the same way that we might call \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d factors, not in the way that we call \u201ctemperature\u201d a factor. In other words, his Factor was the level of what statisticians now call a factor. In the original terminology, still used by some population geneticists, genes occur in pairs on homologous chromosomes. In this terminology the four blood groups A, B, O and AB (defined in terms of agglutination reactions) are determined by three (allelic) genes: A, B and O.\"\n\n\"Nowadays molecular geneticists do not call these three factors genes, but rather \u201calleles\u201d, defined as \u201calternative forms\u201d of a gene that can occur at the same locus, or place, in the genome. Whereas Drosophila geneticists used to talk of two loci for a gene, and human geneticists used to talk of two genes at a locus, modern geneticists talk of \u201ctwo alleles of a gene\u201d or \u201ctwo alleles at a locus\u201d; this last, which is nowadays so common, is the terminology that will thus be used in this book. It then follows (rather awkwardly) that two alleles at the same locus are allelic to each other, whereas two alleles that are at different loci are non-allelic to each other. A gene is commonly defined as a DNA sequence that has a function, meaning a class of similar DNA sequences all involved in the same particular molecular function, such as the formation of the ABO red cell antigens. (Note the common illogical use of the phrase \u201ccloning genes\u201d by molecular geneticists when, by their own terminology, \u201ccloning alleles\u201d is meant). Some restrict the word gene to protein-coding genes, but there are many more sequences of DNA that have function by virtue of being transcribed to RNA without ever being translated to DNA and protein-coding, so this restricted definition of a gene would appear to be unwarranted.\u201d.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4450815\/","529ca0fc":"**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Late Age of Onset Genes<\/span>**","a0445f25":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Allelic association, linkage disequilibrium, gametic phase disequilibrium<\/span>**\n\n\"If the alleles at one locus are not distributed in the population independently of the alleles at another locus, the two loci exhibit allelic association. If this association is a result of a mixture of subpopulations (such as ethnicities or religious groups) within each of which there is random mating, the association is often denoted as \u201cspurious\u201d. In such a case there is true association, but the cause is not of primary genetic interest. If the association is not due to this kind of population structure, it is either due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) or gametic phase disequilibrium (GPD); in the former case the loci are linked, i.e. they co-segregate in families, in the latter case they are not linked, i.e. they segregate independently in families. Owing to an unintended original definition, loci that are not linked have often been mistakenly described as being in LD.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4450815\/","c510bdef":"**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Primarily bulbar onset Genes<\/span>**","df63b86e":"**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Acknowledgments<\/span>**\n\n\"ALSgeneScanner: a pipeline for the analysis and interpretation of DNA sequencing data of ALS patients is an EU Joint Programme - Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND) project.
