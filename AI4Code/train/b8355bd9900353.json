This notebook is about \"Splitting and CV\"\nGood day everybody! In this competition, one important aspect is that **\"Public LB is based on 13% of total test data, which is only 476 examples\"**. So it is intuitively clear that our own CV score is more reliable than public LB, e.g. if we do 5-folds split, we will have 20% of training data, around 1200 examples. Moreover, we can average over 5-folds and get even more reliable number, right? It seems to me that in this *imbalance-multi-label* problem (explained below), splitting is not easy. So in this notebook, we will investigate and compare 3 splitting approaches which I know of:\n\n- `KFold`\n- `GroupKFold`\n- `MultilabelStratifiedKFold`\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to compare CV from these methods among themselves, and also to Public LB. Since this notebook is not about optimizing LB, we will save time by using a very fast model training from [@abhishek's kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abhishek\/distilbert-use-features-oof) which in turn originated from [@abazdyrev's kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abazdyrev\/use-features-oof). \n\n**We will see that this same model will have different CV behaviors depending on splitting methods. Therefore, when talking about CV vs. LB, it's important to understand this different behaviors. In particular, when teaming up with other people, be sure that different CV calculation (if any) will not mislead your team.**\n\nNote that this is all I know about splitting. At the end of the article, if anybody know a better method, or have better insights, and would like to share in the comment section, it will be very much appreciate!!\n","3e68b6fc":"Here we construct features from **Universal Sentence Encoder** and some smart extra features credited to original authors mentioned above.","fb83aff8":"# Summary for 4 folds","84120c26":"Here, we got `nan` in the last fold, so we have to fix it. **NOTE the absurdly high CV for `np.nanmean` in the last fold! So don't use it**. If we exclude the nan-fold properly, see `rho_kfolds_group_nonan`, we will get a good CV in this case.","d2534f94":"## GroupKFold - 4 folds","1c2f7bae":"# 2. Take-away message \n\n## 2.1 CV vs. LB\nFor anybody who doesn't want to bother with the detailed experiments below, I summarize the main finding here. This summary is based on the fact that the baseline got 0.36x LB (after removing Elastic Network).\n\n(1) For small number of folds e.g. `NUM_FOLDS=4` both `KFold` and `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` give similar CV results. I found CV is consistently around 0.02x more than LB possibly due to the leakage problem mentioned above. (If you choose an unlucky SEED, `KFold` can also give `nan` in some fold) \n\nIn contrast, `GroupKFold` has much more chance to have a `nan` CV, and this is true with the default `SEED=42`. If we ignore the nan-fold, we will get a smaller gap of 0.01x between CV and LB. This should be because `GroupKFold` doesn't have the mentioned leakage problem. However, I also note that using `np.nanmean()` to average the results can lead to over-estimated CV. Therefore, do not use `np.nanmean()`.\n\n(2) When `NUM_FOLDS=10`, `GroupKFold` will inevitably has at least two nan-folds due to its definition. In `SEED=42`, `KFold` will also face `nan`. Only `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` will not have a nan fold. Moreover, `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` should give the most stable estimation since the label distributions are similar (less biased toward extreme) to all folds.\n\n## 2.2 Be careful, when teaming up !\nDoes not mean to discourage about teaming up, but I think we should make sure that all people in the same team use the same CV methodology, since if one person gets over-estimated CV, and another person gets less-over-estimated CV, it can mislead the team's best combination.\n\nAnother issue is that this problem is quite small, so one person alone can train many models. But there is a 2-hours running-time limitation, so the team should handle number of inference models for each member carefully.\n\n### My personal note\n- I would like to avoid `nan` completely, so I personally go to `MultilabelStratifiedKFold`. Therefore, my own CV will always be a bit over-score (gap around 0.02x). But still LB and CV are very consistent. Whenever CV increase, I always observe LB increases in similar magnitudes.","702f5060":"## 1.1 Should we simply do K-folds split?\nSo we should just use `sklearn.model_selection.KFold` and that's all? Unfortunately, in this problem, they are at least two subtleties which we have to be careful!\n\n### Problem A. There can be leakage between train and validation\nThis [nice EDA kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sediment\/a-gentle-introduction-eda-tfidf-word2vec) shows that there are some questions that appear many times (with different answers each time). For example the most frequent question is\n\n> What is the best introductory Bayesian statistics?\n\nwhich appears 12 times in the training set. Therefore, this means that **if we split the data naively, this same question can be in both train and valid sets, and since many labels are related to \"questions\", there will be leakage between train and valid sets**.\n\n> So naive `KFold` can give you an over-estimated CV\n\n## 1.2 GroupKFold\n\nIn contrast, this [top kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/akensert\/bert-base-tf2-0-minimalistic) from my friend @akensert smartly avoid this problem by using `sklearn.model_selection.GroupKFold` instead! By using `GroupKFold` it is possible to guarantee that *all data with the same question, will always stay in the same fold*. Therefore, the above leakage will not happen, and CV is more likely to be more accurate compared to `KFold`.\n\nSo does `GroupKFold` solve the problem? In my understanding, unfortunately, we will face the other issue instead. As we can see from his kernel (Version 5), that in some fold, we cannot get the CV score! (`nan`). Why does this happen ??\n\n### Problem B. Some labels having very few non-zero values, possibly causes `spearmanr = nan`\nConcretely, if you take a look at the label `question_type_spelling`, there will be only 11 \/ 6079 non-zero values!!! That's are very few! And if we are not careful it will make CV score `nan` (explained below)","db07bf3e":"Therefore, \n\n> `GroupKFold` has higher chance than `KFold` to get `nan` especially when increasing the `NUM_FOLDS` number\n\nAnd we have to be careful, when we *average* the `GroupKFold` performance, not to include the nan fold, (You will see later that `np.nanmean()` will not help too).\n\n## 1.3 Multi-label Stratified-KFold\nUnlike the above two methods, `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` is designed directly for multi-labels problem. It will try to make *each fold have similar number of examples for each label*. Therefore, `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` is a method with the least chance to have  `nan` problem. Also, it should give the most stable estimation since the label distributions are similar (less biased toward extreme) to all folds.\n\nHowever,it still have a leakage problem. So we still have a possibly over-estimated CV value. Here is [a very good slide](https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/tsoumakas\/on-the-stratification-of-multilabel-data) explaining how it work.\n\nIn order to use `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` offline, you can use this script which copied from the [original repo](https:\/\/github.com\/trent-b\/iterative-stratification)\n\n- https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ratthachat\/ml-stratifiers (In your notebook\/kernel --> **go to File, and select \"Adding utility script\"**).

Experiments Outline\n\nAs mentioned, we will compare different CVs of [@abhishek's kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/abhishek\/distilbert-use-features-oof) which got LB 0.36x (removing Elastic Network to speed up). We will run the following 6 experiments.\n\n### 4-fold splitting for the 3 methods. \nHere, you will see that \n- both `KFold` and `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` have the leakage problem, so CVs are around 0.38x. But they will not have `nan` problem. Therefore, there are around 0.02x gap for these methods.\n- `GroupKFold` will have `nan` in one fold. In this case, if we ignore the `nan` fold, we will get CV 0.37x which is closer to LB. Therefore, ignoring `nan`,  there are around 0.01x gap for this method.
