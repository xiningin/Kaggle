For example, the mean tells you what the average (or \u201cmiddling\u201d) number is in a set of data.\n* Calculate measures of spread**: these tell you if your data is tightly clustered or more spread out. The standard deviation is one of the more commonly used measures of spread; it tells you how spread out your data is about the mean.\n* **Make future predictions based on past behavior**. This is especially useful in retail, manufacturing, banking, sports or for any organization where knowing future trends would be a benefit.\n* **Test an experiment\u2019s hypothesis**.
