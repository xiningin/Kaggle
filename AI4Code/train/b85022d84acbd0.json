Besides, if this is not enough to convince us to use this tool, it also generates interactive reports in web format that can be presented to any person, even if they don\u2019t know programming.\nIn short, what pandas profiling does is save us all the work of visualizing and understanding the distribution of each variable. It generates a report with all the information easily available."}}
