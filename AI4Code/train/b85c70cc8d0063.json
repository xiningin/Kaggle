If you can remember how to use `help()`, you hold the key to understanding just about any other function in Python.","b07a9c3a":"Python evaluates an expression like this from the inside out. First it calculates the value of `abs(-2)`, then it provides help on whatever the value of that expression is.\n\n<small>(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers! In Python, even something as simple-seeming as an integer is actually an object with a fair amount of internal complexity. After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the voluminous help output above will make more sense.)<\/small>\n\n`abs` is a very simple function with a short docstring. `help` shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like `print`:","ad887f2a":"We can even ask Python to print `f` out:","ba99d551":"Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of \"null\" in other languages.)\n\nWithout a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. **We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen).** Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.","83b28d3e":"## Defining functions\n\nBuiltin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.","6b2b2654":"# Functions and Getting Help\nIn this lesson, we'll be talking about functions: calling them, defining them, and looking them up using Python's built-in documentation.\n\nIn some languages, functions must be defined to always take a specific number of arguments, each having a particular type. Python functions are allowed much more flexibility. The `print` function is a good example of this:","e8cee645":"**Common pitfall:** when you're looking up a function, remember to pass in the name of the function itself, and not the result of calling that function. \n\nWhat happens if we invoke help on a *call* to the function `abs()`? Unhide the output of the cell below to see.","34bdd5aa":"> **Aside: example calls**\n> The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The `>>>` is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example of, see [this docstring for the numpy function `np.eye`](https:\/\/github.com\/numpy\/numpy\/blob\/v1.14.2\/numpy\/lib\/twodim_base.py#L140-L194).","212d688e":"But if we don't specify a value, `sep` is treated as having a default value of `' '` (a single space).","dabc38b1":"Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:","0080aa95":"Or maybe the `help()` function can tell us something about it.","3ebc92ab":"This creates a function called `least_difference`, which takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\nFunctions start with a header introduced by the `def` keyword. The indented block of code following the `:` is run when the function is called.\n\n`return` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.\n\nIs it clear what `least_difference()` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:","b4a9c357":"### Lambda functions\n\nIf you're writing a short throwaway function whose body fits into a single line (like `mod_5` above), Python's `lambda` syntax is conveniently compact.","3d6a29b5":"You probably won't often define [higher order functions](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Higher-order_function) like this yourself, but there are some existing ones (built in to Python and in libraries like pandas or numpy) that you might find useful to call.

But if we pass in a function using the optional `key` argument, it returns the argument `x` that maximizes `key(x)` (aka the 'argmax').","22536b42":"# My turn!\n\nHead over to [the Exercises notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ephemerai\/python-exercise-functions-and-getting-help) to get some hands-on practice working with functions and getting help.","e13775ce":"Unsurprisingly, Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description.
