The augmentation can change many characters in one word, making the new word too far from the original.\n5.

For this I've picked a very simple augmetation, KeyboardAug, that uses adjacency of keys on the keyboard to simulate typos. Alongside the original and annotated text, I'm printing the length of the text run through split() - if that changes the discourse_start and discourse_end annotations given in train.csv will no longer be valid.","0d1c16b4":"That looks usable.\n\n# SynonymAug\n\nNow SynonymAug, that replaces some words with synonyms.","9457ef02":"Some interesting swaps there!

I could just have used 'pip install nlpaug', but I've installed it from a dataset to allow this notebook to run with internet turned off.\n\nDocumentation is available at: https:\/\/nlpaug.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/","ae3fc4a6":"# Introduction\n\nMore data can help train models to be more general, with less overfitting. One convenient way to generate additional data is simply to transform the given data into something slightly different, such that it still represents the assigned labels. As well as helping during training, augmentation can also be used when running inference (Test Time Augmentation or TTA).\n\nFor an image based challenge, flips, rotations, etc. can be used to generate a new image that still presents the same class of object as the original. But how do we do this for a NLP challenge?\n\nThere are a wide variety of approaches, from character and word substitutions, all the way to translating the text from the source lanaguage to another and then back to get a setence with (hopefully) the same meaning, but a different structure.\n\nFor more info, vad13irt has already posted a great survey here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/feedback-prize-2021\/discussion\/295277\n\nFor this notebook, I want to focus on what the application of some of these methods actually looks like for the feedback-prize-2021 dataset. In particular, I'll be looking at methods that can be used while preserving the discourse_start and discourse_end annotations given in train.csv."}}
