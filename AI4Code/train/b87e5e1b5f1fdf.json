Need to comment the start of the program - what is the program going to accomplish? what is the program about? Need to break each fucntional section of the program into parts using comments. All students were reminded of this need during multiple classes.\n\n5\/10 **Difficulty & Effort**. Class was given four (4) full 90-minute blocks for this project. Scope and level of difficulty is not sufficient for the intended 6 hours (minimum). \n\n5\/10 **Idea** is well thought out and makes sense as one program. The idea of adding height and age as a qualifier does not make real world sense.The scope of this program is slight in meaning and in coding rigor.\n\n8\/10 **Print statement(s)** included in meaningful way and works. Printing for the inputs and the concluding output is needed. Printing the value of height+age\/\/10 has no relevance to the user as there is no text to associate the value with a qualifier. \n\n10\/10  **User Input** meaningful and works\n\n10\/10 An **int\/float variable** is appropraitely created and used. Good job converting your inputs into integers for math operations.\n\n15\/20 **Math Operators**: At least one +, -, *, \/ and one \/\/, % are included and used properly. Both are used properly, but not meaningfully. "}}
