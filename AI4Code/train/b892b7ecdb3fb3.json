Today we will be implementing a simple decision tree model to classify iris plants into three species using the lengths and widths of their petals and sepals, a [classic data set](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iris_flower_data_set) in the machine learning community.\n\nThe iris samples in question fall into three species: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*.  At first glance, the three species can look remarkably like each other, and this is especially the case for the latter two.  However, thanks to the careful measurements taken and presented by Anderson and Fisher, an individual sample may be classified with a high degree of accuracy via machine learning models if the relevant measurements are taken.","9687fbc8":"Decision tree models are the simplest form of tree-based models, and are arguably the simplest form of supervised multivariate classification models. A series of logical tests (generally in the form of boolean comparisons) are applied to the sample entries and their resulting subsets in turn to arrive at a final decision. It is very easy to visualize the decision process in a simple flowchart to trace the rational of every assignment made by a decision tree model, making it among the most interpretable of models.\n\nThe following code, strongly derived from [scikit-learn's documentation](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/tree\/plot_iris_dtc.html), shows how a simple decision tree model may be applied and visualized.","4e4a2879":"Seven conditionals to yield only one misclassified sample out of 150 using only the two most important features out of the four available.  Not bad at all, but is there a better way? \n\nIn subsequent postings I'll be using other models on the iris dataset in an effort to compare and contrast the different approaches.","15246d9d":"We begin by running the standard import cell common to kaggle notebooks.","c5e271dc":"Let us now go about applying the decision tree model in a pairwise fashion to the available features to see some simple applications of how decision trees can assign classifications to individual samples.  Since the data set is small and we aren't concerned today with validation, we won't bother with a train-test split.","1b4d4b47":"The very short and simple code below shows the results of a decision tree model when all four parameters are considered via the plot_tree() function.  As it turns out, only two parameters, petal length (X\\[2\\]) and petal width (X\\[3\\]), are needed to provide a very high degree of accuracy, yielding results very similar to what is achieved when considering only two parameters. The X\\[1\\] parameter for sepal width is also brought to bear to make the finest distinctions, but ultimately doesn't bring much value.","c8be69fa":"Once imports are complete, we may define a few parameters for later use...","f1da930a":"Having made this improvement using the full dataset, let's now circle back to that last subplot which also used only petal length and petal width and see how it shows in plot_tree().","6c521aa3":"This leaves (no pun intended) us with only four misclassified points by applying a total of four tests, and trimming one level sooner, i.e., setting max_depth to 2, would only have six errors out of the 150 points. \n\nAnother approach we might consider is to mandate that there must be a significant increase in impurity for the split to occur.  Setting the min_impurity_decrease parameter will allow us to restrict splits to those that significantly improve the results of the overal model behavior.","c1fd7365":"... and load the data set in question.","fe7249c9":"Note that in the above plots, there are occasionally generated small islands or peninsulae of classification which show us the Achilles' heel of Decision tree models: their tendency to overfit the data. While these small cutouts improve the accuracy of the model on the training data, they also result in a model that applies increasingly implausible critera to the data which likely won't stand up when new data is used to test the model. \n\nIt is also interesting to note that with only two parameters available, a very high degree of accuracy is achievable in the last subplot using only petal length and petal, width with only a single modest and sensibly positioned peninsula.\n\nWe'll come back to this last subplot at the end of this posting.","7b95d35c":"We may very simply add the max_depth parameter to the model with a value of 3 and observe the effect of forcing some simplicity on the tree, akin to pruning all the smallest branches of a tree down to a few points of divergence closest to the trunk.","789f4743":"# Using Scikit-learn to Implement a Simple Decision Tree Classifier","8c25eefe":"This approach gets us to three misclassified points out of 150 with the same number of tests as before with *max_depth* = 3, but we are now able to apply the questions a bit more efficiently.
