keras.application package. To train it for more epochs I piplined kernels to load previously trained model and continue whole process. It was annoying, but it helps me to save a lot of money on AWS or other cloud computing.<br>\n\nBecause network were trained from generator and there were a lot of data (3.4kk), each epoch means 500 batches for 488 examples.<br>\nFor the first time I used ReduceLROnPlateau callback and have learned that properly reduced LR can provide much better results. After 10 epochs without progress its reduced learning rate by half which usually gives noticable drop of loss value and helps network to converge.","d8b1b47c":"# Visualization of validation batch","c7e53151":"Below we can observe mentioned loss drop after reducing LR.","34be4b0d":"# Visualization of image encoding for \"ambulance\" class\n\nBelow is visualization of encoding for some ambulance images.

Doodle Recognition Challenge.<br>\n\nI used MobileNet from keras.application package. Earlier I tried Resnet18 with Stochastic Depth, but it converged slower and had slightly lower performance. Changing model was first key decission to improve my score.<br>\nAfter that I experimented with image size and stroke encoding. It resulted with another rise of accuracy. Everything is described later in kernel.<br>\nI made some mistakes with reducing learning rate on plateou. LR was reduced to early and network hadn't possibility to converge because of too small learning rate. After increasing patient parameter to 10 was noticed significant advance.<br>\n\nI also experimented with some RNN-CNN solutions, but there were worse than normal CNN.\n\n","c6d9edb3":"# Visualization of trainging batch","f0037067":"# Learning and data hyper parameters<br> \nIf **AUGMENTATION** set True, images were flipped horizontaly with probability equals to 0.5.<br>\n**BATCH_SIZE** were reduced from 512 to 448, because there were a problem with memory when used loaded keras model. There is a issue ticket on keras github where people have the same problems.<br>\nIn keras MobileNet documentation is stated that models trained on less downsized images have better accuracy. In this case, accuracy improvment was observed after changing **IMAGE_SIZE** from 64 to 128.<br>Strange image size which is not power of 2 is selected because of my typo in implementation, 126 would be much better choice. \n","c6f3dde0":"# Image encoding\n\nFrom raw stokes I created 3 images with different encoding. Encoded images were concatenated to one image of size 128x128 and 3 channels.<br>\n* First channel represents presence of line. Single point had 255 value if there were stroke or 0 otherwise.\n* Second channel encoded strokes in time. Usually people firstly draw outline of object and details later. This assumption were used to set weights of each stroke. First stroke was encoded with 255 value which was deacreased with every next stroke by 13,  down to 125.\n* Third channel encoded stroke points in time. There are some patterns in stroke directions. For example when I draw a spider, I start draw legs from body, not the other way. First point of a stroke have 255 value which was deacreased gradually down to 20.<br>\n\nLater you can find some visualisation of presented encodings.\n"}}
