respondents have a Bachelor\u2019s degree, while most of the expert respondents have a Master\u2019s degree. This is because  most of the expert respondents are older than the non-expert respondents, which indicates that expert respondents have more time and opportunities to continue their studies.","4907f0bb":"It can be seen that most of the non-expert respondents are between 18-21 years old, while most of the expert respondents are between 30-34 years old. An interesting pattern can be seen from the graph, as the age range get bigger, the ratio between experts and non-experts get higher. This is because the older you get, the more experience you have.","73659f06":"# **Type of computing platform Experts use Most Often for Data Science Projects**","384f6a02":"This graphic illustrates the number of people who are experts in programming.","31aa3965":"# **Hosted Notebook Products Experts use on Regular Basis**","6551f4eb":"Entering the industrial revolution 4.0 era which is marked by the development of work automation that utilizes robots, machines, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Human resources are required to learn new skills in order to compete in an industrial environment. One of the most important skill to learn is programming skills. People who want to start learning about programming often get confused because there are a lot of languages, notebooks, and hardware that can be used in programming.\n\nIn this notebook, we will discuss the languages, notebooks, and hardware used and recommended by people who have experience in writing programs using the results of Kaggle 2021 survey. We assume that non-experts are people who have programming experience less than 5 years and experts are people who have programming experience from 5 to 20 years.\n\n","bfacbedb":"It can be seen that 68.5% of respondents have less than 5 years experience in programming, while only 27.4% of respondents have more than 5 years experience in programming. This is probably because the need for programming has increased recently. So that makes many people start learning to write programs.","d3c39fa1":"# **Highest Education**","53bb25a2":"# **Types of Specialized Hardware Experts use on a Regular Basis**","3293444b":"Expert respondents more often use Python and SQL as programming languages that are used daily. According to the Tiobe Index, Python is one of the top 3 languages used by professional web developers. So, many people are experts in using the Python language. This may be because most of the respondents have experience working as Data Scientists, where this job requires high Python and SQL skills.","b24bfda6":"This graphic below describes the age ratio of experts and non-experts in programming.\n","55cac2ae":"Most of the expert respondents suggested learning python as their first programming language. This further shows that the python programming language is a language that MUST be learn by anyone who wants to enter the world of data. This can be due to:\n1. Python is the most popular programming language in the world, so people who know Python can work in a wider range of fields and places.\n2. Python language is easy to learn so it is suitable for people who are just starting to learn programming.\n\nBased on graph 6a, Python is the language most often used by expert respondents.\n","c275dc92":"Most of the professional respondents prefer to use a laptop as a platform for working on data science projects. This is because laptops are easy to carry everywhere and are more efficient.","7e10cbc4":"Below is the graph of people who are experts in programming and their highest education.","267f16f1":"# **Program Languages Experts Use on Daily Basis**","e9e6e8e3":"# **Experts and Non-Experts Group of Age**","6cdbcca9":"Many people are interested to learn programming. There are many programming languages you can learn starting from Python, Java, C, and others. But, you might get confused about what programming language you should learn first and what expert use to write their programs. From the survey data that we have analyzed, it can be seen that the programming languages used often by experts are Python and SQL. In addition, experts also recommend Python as a language that beginners can learn for the first time, this further strengthens the reason why Python is a programming language that beginners must learn.\n\nExperts also prefer Jupyter Notebook as the IDE to use, while collab notebook and kaggle notebook are chosen by professionals as hosted notebooks for daily use. In writing programs, the experts also choose a laptop as a computing platform that is often used. In looking for information, the experts choose youtube, kaggle, and blogs as their main sources of information.\n","0d2a93ea":"Most of the expert respondents prefer Colab Notebook and Kaggle Notebook as hosted notebooks that are used on a daily basis.

Recently, Data Scientist became one of the jobs that's growing rapidly. One of the possible reasons why people with experience in prograaming choose Data Scientist is because this job has a nice work environment with very low stress levels. The high salary also makes many people want to become data scientists.

But NVIDIA GPUs are the best choice given by expert respondents when there is a question of what hardware is often used by expert respondents.","490b0d03":"We can see that expert respondents prefer to use Jupyter Notebook the most as their daily IDE. This can be because the Jupyter Notebook is a very effective IDE to be used to build an application because one of its capabilities is in the visualization aspect. Visualization can be in the form of comment text, images or mathematical formulas. The format of the Jupyter Notebook can be easily integrated with Google Colab.","bc92300b":"# **Program Experience**","a1fad69b":"There are various sources used by expert respondents in finding information, but most expert respondents choose Kaggle, Youtube, and Blogs as sources of information. Kaggle is the largest platform for finding information, this may be because the survey conducted has respondents who are mostly Kaggle users. In addition, Kaggle offers convenience and advantages such as having various data sets, codes from various users, community data analysts and data scientists. who are ready to share knowledge, and competitions with various attractive prizes."}}
