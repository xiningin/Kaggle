Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000\/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.\n\nJust like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called \u2018sum assured\u2019) to the customer.\n\nBuilding a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.\n\nNow, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.\n\n***Evaluation Metric***\nThe evaluation metric for this hackathon is ROC_AUC score.","af73c798":"**Feature Selection**","cef7cf58":"> *Hyperparameter Boosting -> XGBOOST*","8cf14bfb":"**Visualizations using\n* Countplots\n* Dist Plot \n* Scatter Plot\n**","9707ca61":"**Feature Engineering**","d4a062dc":"**End of Notebook**\n* Please Upvote if you like it!!\n* Comment down about the NoteBook.\nThankyou!!","5241480a":"**Modeling and Evaluation**","d5a7d9aa":"Data dimensions,information,null values check.","5abd5778":"''''\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV,GridSearchCV\n\nparamss= {\n        \"learning_rate\": [0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30],\n        \"max_depth\": [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15],\n        \"min_child_weight\": [1, 3, 5, 7],\n        \"gamma\": [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],\n        \"colsample_bytree\": [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7]\n\n    }\n\n\ngbc=xgboost.XGBClassifier()\nmodel2=RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=gbc,param_distributions=paramss,\n                cv=5,scoring=\"roc_auc\",\n                verbose=10,n_jobs=-1)\n\nmodel2.fit(X,Y)\n\nprint(model2.best_params_)\nprint(model2.best_index_)\n\n''''\n\n\n","b5d7cb63":"*2.Feature Selection - SelectKBest ,chi2*","90e6cffc":"Data loading","df8079fc":"*1.
