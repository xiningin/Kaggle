I became aware of the possibility of active shootings in any public place, by taking a look at the gun violence data, it is my hope to better educate ourselves and others about common questions about these horrific incidents. The significance of researching gun violence is that it can help shed some light on our pre-existing domain knowledge of gun violence in America. Apart from that, it can help determine other insightful information such as the highest percentage of gun violence based on location.\n\nIn this Kernel I will be exploring four datasets : 1- US Mass shooting (2018-2020) 2- Gun violence (2012 - 2014) 3- Persons granted U.S. legal permanent resident status during a given fiscal year  4- a gun violence dataset from kaggle (2013-2018). \n\n\nMy previous questions : \n\n1. How much gun violence is there in the U.S from the overall mortality rate?\n1. do gender and age correlate to gun violence? is there any correlation between race, age , gender?\n1. which states experience the most gun violence?   over the years, did gun violence went up or down?\n\nDue to the difficulty of locating datasets that included mortality rates and fatality incidents, I thought I can change the question to correlation between immigration and gun violence.\n\n\n**Instead ,My research questions will focus on the following:**\n\n1. Is there any correlation between immigration to the U.S and gun violence between the years 2013 - 2018?\n1. Which states experienced the most mass shootings over the past two years ?\n1. who are the suspect demographics of gun violence between 2012-2014? What about race? sex and intent?\n\n","200aef0a":"# **Conclusion**\n\nWe conclude that there is a positive correlation between immigration and number of people killed between(2013 - 2018), in addition, California experienced the most mass shootings between 2018 - 2020, while alarming, I found it very interesting that California and illinois have the highest number of mass shooting incidents even though both has some of the strictest gun laws in the nations. We also found it bizzare that in terms of states. Furthermore,exploring 2012-2014 dataset, it seemed that  higher gun violence demographics (suspects) are aged between 18 and 35, with the most suspects being male. Additionally , Suicide seems to be the top one intent with an average age of 50 years old between (2012 - 2014) with more than 60k incidents. ","35c1bfc9":"# 2.

Additionally , we can see a sharp increase in the 1990s and that can be explained by the \"Immigration act of 1990\" signed into law by Geroge.H.W Bush in which It provided family-based immigration visa, created five distinct employment based visas, categorized by occupation, and a diversity visa program that created a lottery to admit immigrants from \"low admittance\" countries or countries where their citizenry was underrepresented in the U.S.","9073544e":"# Future Work\n\nIn the future, we can separate the analysis of gun violence incidents by race to also include intent to give us more of an idea about the intent distribution in addition to the race. We can also include data about the population percentages of each race to have an idea about the rate of incidents per capita of a certain race.\nWe can also dive deeper into the immigration data to see if we can extract gun crime committed by immigrants and compare that to the rate committed by citizens, to try and formulate an estimated rate of danger from immigrants and maybe even come up with prediction models that can predict the potential increase (or decrease, which is quite likely) of gun crime related to accepting new immigrants in a certain state.","7cbf24f1":"# **Data Profile**\n\nThe Datasets I will be working with today are the following:\n\n1. gun-violence-data_01-2013_03-2018.csv - The CSV file contains data for all recorded gun violence incidents in the US between January 2013 and March 2018, this dataset is avaliable kaggle, and was originally downloaded from gunviolencearchive.org.\n1.
