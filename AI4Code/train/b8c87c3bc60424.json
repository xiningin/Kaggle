When a team that is winning games by significantly outperforming their xG, it may indicate that the team's form in unsustainable.

The drawbacks being that 1) every time new data is loaded to the site the files would have to be manually extraced again and 2) there is not a dataset for all match logs from every team so we can easily compare xG trends across teams.
