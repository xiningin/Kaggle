Findings from this study are reviewed and updated.\n\nFrequency distributions of plasma glucose and HbA1(Hemoglobin, Alpha 1) are bimodal in Pima adults, and substantial risk of the specific vascular complications of diabetes is confined to those in the higher components of these distributions. These findings contributed to the adoption of internationally recognized criteria for classification of glucose tolerance. Diabetes in the Pimas is strongly familial, and probably of genetic origin, although the precise nature of the gene or genes involved remains unknown. Obesity, which is at least in part environmentally determined, is a major factor interacting with the presumed genetic susceptibility to result in diabetes.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8422779"}}
