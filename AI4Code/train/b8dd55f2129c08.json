There were no load-shedding in 2016 and 2017. \n\n## Data cleaning & Processing\n- As I said earlier, the measurements are taken with different intervals in between. So to standardlize the time series, I use daily\/weekly and aggregate the \"stages\". \n- However, the stage itself is difficult to aggregate. I have two approaches: \n    1. Times the stage with 1000, that would be the energy in Megawatts corresponding to the stage. Then aggregate on sum of the energy, which would be the total amount of energy shedded on that day\/week.\n    2. Aggregate on the count of entries (if doesn't equal stage 0). That would constitute as the number of blackouts on that day\/week.\n\n- I chose the first one, because it accounts for the intensity of each blackout.\n","9860be3b":"# Interpretation of the Electricity Production Plot\n- There is a yearly seasonality and a clear upward trend from 1985 to 2008-ish. There is a noticeable dip in 2009\/01\/01. And the electricity production is low-key decreasing after 2009. \n## Inspirtation questions:\n1. What happend in 2009 January and a little before that?\n2. What is the climate like in South Africa? Can the climate change explain the electricity production yearly seasonality?\n\n\n# After Some research...\n## 1. Analysis on the \"Dip\" in 2009\n- Refer to the WikiPedia Site for more details : https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/South_African_energy_crisis\n- Basically, the first energy shortage emerges in late 2007 and lasted until at least May 2008. \"The problem is related to the supply of coal to the coal-fired power plants.[11][12] Several other causes have been postulated, including skills shortages[4] and increasing demand for electricity around the country\"\n- Before the crisis, South Africa has been exporting its electricity to neighboring African states.\n- On January 2008, South Africa delares to cease exporting power. \n- If we only look at electricity production in July of each year, then the pattern is clearer. Before Jul 2007, the trend is upward with 3-4 small drops. Since Jul 2007, the trend has been downard and with another \"dip\" in 2015. (2015 is the second period of load shedding after 2007-2008)\n\n## 2. Analysis of the seasonality\n- Since South Africa is in Southern Hemisphere so the seasonality should be the opposite of what the Northern Hemisphere has.\n![image](\/kaggle\/input\/datathon\/south_africa_temperature.png)\n\n- This image is the temperature model in South Africa over the years.\n- The lowest temperature is in July (corresponding to highest electricity Production) averaged at 30 F, and the highest temperature is in January (corresponding to low electricity production) averaged around 90 F. Extreme weather at either end requires more electricity to generate heaters or coolers. There is an association between the production of electricity and the temperature.\n","77efa2c7":"# time required to get electricity (days)\t\n- What does it mean-'Time required to get electricity is the number of days to obtain a permanent electricity connection. The measure captures the median duration that the electricity utility and experts indicate is necessary in practice, rather than required by law, to complete a procedure.'\n- This data is only available from 2009 to 2019, while South Africa already encountered the energy crisis. So we don't know how it does before the crisis.\n\n- In 2009-2014 South Africa had the highest number of days to get electricity. \n- In 2015, the number plummeted. What happened during that time is unknown. However, still, the time required to get electricity for South Africa is above the world's average. ","c684c920":"# Energy Shortage Prediction for the Following Year\n- I will be using the estimated\/predicted electricity production for the next year, from the Prophet Model I have just built earlier as features. The features include the trend and the y-hat (the actual prediction).\n\n- The first prediction model is Gaussian HMM. \n\n- The second method is using peak estimation. Power shortages often come in \"clusters\". By calculating the number of \"peaks\", the average height of each \"peak\" and average duration of each \"peak\", then multiplying the three things together, we can get an estimate on the average number of blackouts to expect for every year. \n","6ac759ad":"<h1>Energy Crisis In South Africa: what happened at each cohorts of blackouts?\n    <\/h1>\n    <a src =\u201dhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/South_African_energy_crisis\u201d>Link to the website<\/a>\n<p>Loading shedding startedThe Majuba power plant lost its capacity to generate power after a collapse of one of its coal storage silos on 1 November 2014. The Majuba power plant delivered approximately 10% of the country's entire capacity and the collapse halted the delivery of coal to the plant.[20] A second silo developed a major crack on 20 November causing the shut down of the plant again, this after temporary measures were instituted to deliver coal to the plant.[21]\n    <\/p>\n\nOn 5 December 2014, Eskom started major stage three load shedding in South Africa after the shut down of two power plants on 4 November (of said year) due to diesel shortages. It was also reported that the Palmiet and Drakensberg Pumped Storage Schemes were also experiencing difficulties due to a depletion of water reserve to the Hydro plants. Stage three was the highest degree of load shedding then.[22]\n\nOn Thursday 4 November, Eskom fell 4,000 megawatts (5,400,000 hp) short of the country's electricity demand of 28,000 megawatts (38,000,000 hp). The power utility has the ability to produce 45,583 megawatts (61,128,000 hp) but could only supply 24,000 megawatts (32,000,000 hp) due to \"planned and unplanned\" maintenance. One turbine at Eskom\u2019s Duvha Power Station is still out of commission due to an \"unexplained incident\" in March 2014.[23] Load shedding was scheduled to resume in February 2015, due to industry start up, after the December holiday period. on[](http:\/\/) 5 December 2014,","1608641d":"# What need to be done & get noticed:\n## Production\n1.

The time series is not measured with the same time interval. There might be multiple blackouts per day, or there might be no blackouts at all, and those days are missing in the datetime column. \n3. Group by dates and either count the number of blackouts, or the average stage level on that day, or the maximum stage level on that day.\n4. We need to impute these missing values with stage level 0 (that means no blackout)\n5. P.S. Higher stage level indicates more electricity is being shedded. And the amount of electricity is proportional to the stage level number. So there is no need to transform this feature into the electricity corresponding to the stage level.
