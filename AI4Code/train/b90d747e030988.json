Each of these values assigns an observation to a corresponding group, known as a *category*, which reflects some qualitative property of this example. *Binary* variables are an important special case of categorical variables when the number of possible values is exactly 2. If the values of a categorical variable are ordered, it is called *ordinal*.\n\n##### Frequency table\n\nLet\u2019s check the class balance in our dataset by looking at the distribution of the target variable: the *churn rate*. First, we will get a frequency table, which shows how frequent each value of the categorical variable is. For this, we will use the [`value_counts()`](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.Series.value_counts.html) method:","ac8cd3ee":"#### 4.3 t-SNE\n\nLet\u2019s create a [t-SNE](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) representation of the same churn data we have been using. \n\nThe name of the method looks complex and a bit intimidating: *t-distributed Stohastic Neighbor Embedding*. Its math is also impressive (we will not delve into it here, but, if you feel brave, here is the [original article](http:\/\/www.jmlr.org\/papers\/volume9\/vandermaaten08a\/vandermaaten08a.pdf) by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton from [JMLR](http:\/\/www.jmlr.org\/)). Its basic idea is simple: find a projection for a high-dimensional feature space onto a plane (or a 3D hyperplane, but it is almost always 2D) such that those points that were far apart in the initial n-dimensional space will end up far apart on the plane. Those that were originally close would remain close to each other.\n\nEssentially, *neighbor embedding* is a search for a new and less-dimensional data representation that preserves neighborship of examples.\n\nNow, let's do some practice. First, we need to import some additional classes:","cdbe3cf8":"From this chart, we can see that the greatest discrepancy in distribution between the two groups is for three variables: *Total day minutes*, *Customer service calls*, and *Number vmail messages*. Later in this course, we will learn how to determine feature importance in classification using *Random Forest* or *Gradient Boosting*; there, we will see that the first two features are indeed very important for churn prediction.\n\nLet's look at the distribution of day minutes spoken for the loyal and disloyal customers separately. We will create box and violin plots for *Total day minutes* grouped by the target variable.","d0fabbaf":"Sometimes, such a visualization may help draw conclusions about data; but, in this case, everything is pretty clear with no surprises.\n\n#### 3.2 Quantitative vs. Categorical\n\nIn this section, we will make our simple quantitative plots a little more exciting. We will try to gain new insights for churn prediction from the interactions between the numerical and categorical features.\n\nMore specifically, let's see how the input variables are related to the target variable Churn.\n\nPreviously, you learned about scatter plots. Additionally, their points can be color or size coded so that the values of a third categorical variable are also presented in the same figure. We can achieve this with the `scatter()` function seen above, but, let's try a new function called [`lmplot()`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.lmplot.html) and use the parameter `hue` to indicate our categorical feature of interest:","989a934a":"Now, let's build a t-SNE representation:","096e68ac":"The function [`jointplot()`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.jointplot.html) plots two histograms that may be useful in some cases.\n\nUsing the same function, we can also get a smoothed version of our bivariate distribution:","d5c0a5c7":"Its output is mostly self-explanatory. *25%*, *50%* and *75%* are the corresponding [percentiles](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Percentile).","8554b04b":"It seems that our small proportion of disloyal customers lean towards the top-right corner; that is, such customers tend to spend more time on the phone during both day and night. But this is not absolutely clear, and we won't make any definitive conclusions from this chart.\n\nNow, let\u2019s create box plots to visualize the distribution statistics of the numerical variables in two disjoint groups: the loyal customers (`Churn=False`) and those who left (`Churn=True`).","b9c05366":"A histogram groups values into *bins* of equal value range. The shape of the histogram may contain clues about the underlying distribution type: Gaussian, exponential, etc. You can also spot any skewness in its shape when the distribution is nearly regular but has some anomalies. Knowing the distribution of the feature values becomes important when you use Machine Learning methods that assume a particular type (most often Gaussian).\n\nIn the above plot, we see that the variable *Total day minutes* is normally distributed, while *Total intl calls* is prominently skewed right (its tail is longer on the right).\n\nThere is also another, often clearer, way to grasp the distribution: *density plots* or, more formally, *Kernel Density Plots*. They can be considered a [smoothed](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kernel_smoother) version of the histogram. Their main advantage over the latter is that they do not depend on the size of the bins. Let's create density plots for the same two variables:","e4b96369":"## 4. Whole dataset visualizations","ed2c4959":"At first glance, it seems that the churn rate in *New Jersey* and *California* are above 25% and less than 6% for Hawaii and Alaska.

Each of them can be considered as a dimension in the space of data points. Consequently, more often than not, we deal with high-dimensional datasets, where entire visualization is quite hard.\n\nTo look at a dataset as a whole, we need to decrease the number of dimensions used in visualization without losing much information about the data. This task is called *dimensionality reduction* and is an example of an *unsupervised learning* problem because we need to derive new, low-dimensional features from the data itself, without any supervised input.\n\nOne of the well-known dimensionality reduction methods is *Principal Component Analysis* (PCA), which we will study later in this course. Its limitation is that it is a *linear* algorithm that implies certain restrictions on the data.\n\nThere are also many non-linear methods, collectively called *Manifold Learning*. One of the best-known of them is *t-SNE*.","1a577c65":"## 3. Multivariate visualization\n\n*Multivariate* plots allow us to see relationships between two and more different variables, all in one figure. Just as in the case of univariate plots, the specific type of visualization will depend on the types of the variables being analyzed.\n\n#### 3.1 Quantitative vs. Quantitative\n\n##### Correlation matrix\n\nLet's look at the correlations among the numerical variables in our dataset. This information is important to know as there are Machine Learning algorithms (for example, linear and logistic regression) that do not handle highly correlated input variables well.\n\nFirst, we will use the method [`corr()`](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) on a `DataFrame` that calculates the correlation between each pair of features. Then, we pass the resulting *correlation matrix* to [`heatmap()`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.heatmap.html) from `seaborn`, which renders a color-coded matrix for the provided values:","b6696822":"Let's see how to interpret a box plot. Its components are a *box* (obviously, this is why it is called a *box plot*), the so-called *whiskers*, and a number of individual points (*outliers*).\n\nThe box by itself illustrates the interquartile spread of the distribution; its length is determined by the $25th \\, (\\text{Q1})$ and $75th \\, (\\text{Q3})$ percentiles. The vertical line inside the box marks the median ($50\\%$) of the distribution. \n\nThe whiskers are the lines extending from the box. They represent the entire scatter of data points, specifically the points that fall within the interval $(\\text{Q1} - 1.5 \\cdot \\text{IQR}, \\text{Q3} + 1.5 \\cdot \\text{IQR})$, where $\\text{IQR} = \\text{Q3} - \\text{Q1}$ is the [interquartile range](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interquartile_range).\n\nOutliers that fall outside of the range bounded by the whiskers are plotted individually as black points along the central axis.\n\nWe can see that a large number of international calls is quite rare in our data.\n\n##### Violin plot\n\nThe last type of distribution plots that we will consider is a *violin plot*.\n\nLook at the figures below. On the left, we see the already familiar box plot. To the right, there is a *violin plot* with the kernel density estimate on both sides.","99c33d8e":"Let\u2019s color this t-SNE representation according to the churn (blue for loyal customers, and orange for those who churned).","00627380":"The difference between the box and violin plots is that the former illustrates certain statistics concerning individual examples in a dataset while the violin plot concentrates more on the smoothed distribution as a whole.\n\nIn our case, the violin plot does not contribute any additional information about the data as everything is clear from the box plot alone.\n\n##### describe()\n\nIn addition to graphical tools, in order to get the exact numerical statistics of the distribution, we can use the method [`describe()`](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html) of a `DataFrame`:","a5faeca1":"In this case, the violin plot does not contribute any additional information about our data as everything is clear from the box plot alone: disloyal customers tend to talk on the phone more.\n\n**An interesting observation**: on average, customers that discontinue their contracts are more active users of communication services. Perhaps they are unhappy with the tariffs, so a possible measure to prevent churn could be a reduction in call rates. The company will need to undertake additional economic analysis to find out whether such measures would be beneficial.\n\nWhen we want to analyze a quantitative variable in two categorical dimensions at once, there is a suitable function for this in the `seaborn` library called [`catplot()`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.factorplot.html). For example, let's visualize the interaction between *Total day minutes* and two categorical variables in the same plot:","9cd8ec43":"We also need to normalize the data. For this, we will subtract the mean from each variable and divide it by its standard deviation. All of this can be done with `StandardScaler`.","2530473b":"# <center>Topic 2.

The easiest way to create it is to use the `seaborn`'s function [`countplot()`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.countplot.html). There is another function in `seaborn` that is somewhat confusingly called [`barplot()`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.barplot.html) and is mostly used for representation of some basic statistics of a numerical variable grouped by a categorical feature.\n\nLet's plot the distributions for two categorical variables:","7b8ad5fc":"## 1.

We do preliminary checks and analysis using graphics and tables to summarize the data and leave out the less important details. It is much more convenient for us, humans, to grasp the main points this way than by reading many lines of raw data. It is amazing how much insight can be gained from seemingly simple charts created with available visualization tools.\n\nNext, when we analyze the performance of a model or report results, we also often use charts and images. Sometimes, for interpreting a complex model, we need to project high-dimensional spaces onto more visually intelligible 2D or 3D figures.\n\nAll in all, visualization is a relatively fast way to learn something new about your data. Thus, it is vital to learn its most useful techniques and make them part of your everyday ML toolbox.\n\nIn this article, we are going to get hands-on experience with visual exploration of data using popular libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.","9cf0a495":"## 6.

As we will see in the following articles, this fact may imply some restrictions on measuring the classification performance, and, in the future, we may want to additionaly penalize our model errors in predicting the minority \"Churn\" class.","ddfe7e16":"**An observation**: when *International Plan* is enabled, the churn rate is much higher; the usage of the international plan by the customer is a strong feature. We do not observe the same effect with *Voice mail plan*.\n\n##### Contingency table\n\nIn addition to using graphical means for categorical analysis, there is a traditional tool from statistics: a *contingency table*, also called a *cross tabulation*. It shows a multivariate frequency distribution of categorical variables in tabular form. In particular, it allows us to see the distribution of one variable conditional on the other by looking along a column or row.\n\nLet's try to see how *Churn* is related to the categorical variable *State* by creating a cross tabulation:","6cb4ca0b":"While the histograms, discussed above, and bar plots may look similar, there are several differences between them:\n1. *Histograms* are best suited for looking at the distribution of numerical variables while *bar plots* are used for categorical features.\n2. The values on the X-axis in the *histogram* are numerical; a *bar plot* can have any type of values on the X-axis: numbers, strings, booleans.\n3. The *histogram*'s X-axis is a *Cartesian coordinate axis* along which values cannot be changed; the ordering of the *bars* is not predefined. Still, it is useful to note that the bars are often sorted by height, that is, the frequency of the values. Also, when we consider *ordinal* variables (like *Customer service calls* in our data), the bars are usually ordered by variable value.\n\nThe left chart above vividly illustrates the imbalance in our target variable. The bar plot for *Customer service calls* on the right gives a hint that the majority of customers resolve their problems in maximum 2\u20133 calls. But, as we want to be able to predict the minority class, we may be more interested in how the fewer dissatisfied customers behave. It may well be that the tail of that bar plot contains most of our churn. These are just hypotheses for now, so let's move on to some more interesting and powerful visual techniques.","504c1783":"We will leave out the *State* and *Churn* features and convert the values \"Yes\"\/\"No\" of the binary features into numerical values using [`pandas.Series.map()`](http:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.Series.map.html):","d591c94f":"#### 4.1 A naive approach\n\nWe have been looking at different *facets* of our dataset by guessing interesting features and selecting a small number of them at a time for visualization. We have only dealt with two to three variables at once and were easily able to observe the structure and relationships in data. But, what if we want to display all the features and still be able to interpret the resulting visualization?\n\nWe could use `hist()` or create a scatterplot matrix with `pairplot()` for the whole dataset to look at all of our features simultaneously. But, when the number of features is high enough, this kind of visual analysis quickly becomes slow and inefficient. Besides, we would still be analyzing our variables in a pairwise fashion, not all at once.","46a63162":"Here is the description of our features:\n\n|  Name  | Description | Value Type | Statistical Type |\n|---         |---       |---     |---\n| **State** | State abbreviation (like KS = Kansas) | String | Categorical |\n| **Account length** | How long the client has been with the company | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Area code** | Phone number prefix | Numerical | Categorical |\n| **International plan** | International plan (on\/off) | String, \"Yes\"\/\"No\" | Categorical\/Binary |\n| **Voice mail plan** | Voicemail (on\/off) | String, \"Yes\"\/\"No\" | Categorical\/Binary |\n| **Number vmail messages** | Number of voicemail messages | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total day minutes** |  Total duration of daytime calls | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total day calls** | Total number of daytime calls  | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total day charge** | Total charge for daytime services | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total eve minutes** | Total duration of evening calls | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total eve calls** | Total number of evening calls | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total eve charge** | Total charge for evening services | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total night minutes** | Total duration of nighttime calls | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total night calls** | Total number of nighttime calls | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total night charge** | Total charge for nighttime services | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total intl minutes** | Total duration of international calls  | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total intl calls** | Total number of international calls | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Total intl charge** | Total charge for international calls | Numerical | Quantitative |\n| **Customer service calls** | Number of calls to customer service | Numerical | Categorical\/Ordinal |\n\nThe last data column, **Churn**, is our target variable. It is binary: *True* indicates that that the company eventually lost this customer, and *False* indicates that the customer was retained. Later, we will build models that predict this feature based on the remaining features. This is why we call it a *target*.","f3b6d53b":"In the case of *State*, the number of distinct values is rather high: 51. We see that there are only a few data points available for each individual state \u2013 only 3 to 17 customers in each state abandoned the operator. Let's ignore that for a second and calculate the churn rate for each state, sorting it from high to low:","eae7c34e":"In the first article, we looked at the data on customer churn for a telecom operator. We will reload the same dataset into a `DataFrame`:","d1ccafb7":"It is also possible to plot a distribution of observations with `seaborn`'s [`distplot()`](https:\/\/seaborn.pydata.org\/generated\/seaborn.distplot.html). For example, let's look at the distribution of *Total day minutes*. By default, the plot displays both the histogram with the [kernel density estimate](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kernel_density_estimation) (KDE) on top.","0d2993c7":"From this, we could conclude that, starting with 4 calls, *Total day minutes* may no longer be the main factor for customer churn. Perhaps, in addition to our previous guess about the tariffs, there are customers that are dissatisfied with the service due to other problems, which might lead to fewer number of day minutes spent on calls.\n\n#### 3.3 Categorical vs. Categorical\n\nAs we saw earlier in this article, the variable *Customer service calls* has few unique values and, thus, can be considered either numerical or ordinal. We have already seen its distribution with a *count plot*. Now, we are interested in the relationship between this ordinal feature and the target variable *Churn*.\n\nLet's look at the distribution of the number of calls to customer service, again using a *count plot*. This time, let's also pass the parameter `hue=Churn` that adds a categorical dimension to the plot:","6a538a25":"## 2. Univariate visualization\n\n*Univariate* analysis looks at one feature at a time. When we analyze a feature independently, we are usually mostly interested in the *distribution of its values* and ignore other features in the dataset.\n\nBelow, we will consider different statistical types of features and the corresponding tools for their individual visual analysis.\n\n#### 2.1 Quantitative features\n\n*Quantitative features* take on ordered numerical values. Those values can be *discrete*, like integers, or *continuous*, like real numbers, and usually express a count or a measurement.\n\n##### Histograms and density plots\n\nThe easiest way to take a look at the distribution of a numerical variable is to plot its *histogram* using the `DataFrame`'s method [`hist()`](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.hist.html).","665677ea":"To get acquainted with our data, let\u2019s look at the first 5 entries using `head()`:","608f18bd":"This is basically a bivariate version of the *Kernel Density Plot* discussed earlier.\n\n##### Scatterplot matrix\n\nIn some cases, we may want to plot a *scatterplot matrix* such as the one shown below. Its diagonal contains the distributions of the corresponding variables, and the scatter plots for each pair of variables fill the rest of the matrix.","a69e1751":"Now it is clear that, for example, many dissatisfied customers who canceled their subscription are crowded together in one cluster representing the people with the international plan but no voice mail.\n\nFinally, let's note some disadvantages of t-SNE:\n- High computational complexity. The [implementation](http:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/generated\/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) in `scikit-learn` is unlikely to be feasible in a real task. If you have a large number of samples, you should try [Multicore-TSNE](https:\/\/github.com\/DmitryUlyanov\/Multicore-TSNE) instead.\n- The plot can change a great deal depending on the random seed, which complicates interpretation. [Here](http:\/\/distill.pub\/2016\/misread-tsne\/) is a good tutorial on t-SNE. In general, you shouldn\u2019t make any far-reaching conclusions based on such graphs because it can equate to plain guessing. Of course, some findings in t-SNE pictures can inspire an idea and be confirmed through more thorough research down the line, but that does not happen very often.\n\nOccasionally, using t-SNE, you can get a really good intuition for the data. The following is a good paper that shows an example of this for handwritten digits: [Visualizing MNIST](https:\/\/colah.github.io\/posts\/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST\/).\n\n<img src='https:\/\/habrastorage.org\/webt\/-j\/j2\/c8\/-jj2c8zv1jwqo0sygezbmfvu8zo.png' \/>"}}
