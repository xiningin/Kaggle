we mentioned before, there are 2  reasons behind non-stationarity of time series\n    * Trend: varying mean over time. We need constant mean for stationary of time series.\n    * Seasonality: variations at specific time. We need constant variations for stationary of time series.\n* First solve **trend(constant mean)** problem\n    * Most popular method is moving average.\n        * Moving average: We have window that take the average over the past 'n' sample. 'n' is window size.","d4bb2122":"* Green line is mean temperature that is measured in Bindukuri.\n* Blue markers are bombing dates and bombing date temperature.\n* As it can be seen from plot, USA bomb at high temperatures.\n    * The question is that can we predict future weather and according to this prediction can we know whether bombing will be done or not.\n    * In order to answer this question lets first start with time series prediction.\n  ","3f09e699":"<a id=\"9\"><\/a> <br>\n### Forecasting a Time Series\n* We learn two different methodsthat are **moving average and differencing** methods to avoid trend and seasonality problem\n* For prediction(forecasting) we will use ts_diff time series that is result of differencing method. There is no reason I only choose it.\n* Also prediction method is ARIMA that is Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages.\n    * AR: Auto-Regressive (p): AR terms are just lags of dependent variable. For example lets say p is 3, we will use  x(t-1), x(t-2) and x(t-3) to predict x(t)\n    * I: Integrated (d): These are the number of nonseasonal differences. For example, in our case we take the first order difference. So we pass that variable and put d=0 \n    * MA: Moving Averages (q): MA terms are lagged forecast errors in prediction equation.\n* (p,d,q) is parameters of ARIMA model.\n* In order to choose p,d,q parameters we will use two different plots.\n    * Autocorrelation Function (ACF): Measurement of the correlation between time series and lagged version of time series. \n    * Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF): This measures the correlation between the time series and lagged version of time series but after eliminating the variations already explained by the intervening comparisons. ","f0286583":"* Our first criteria for stationary is constant mean. So we fail because mean is not constant as you can see from plot(black line) above . (no stationary)\n* Second one is constant variance. It looks like constant. (yes stationary)\n* Third one is that If the **test statistic** is less than the **critical value**, we can say that time series is stationary. Lets look:\n    * test statistic = -1.4 and critical values = {'1%': -3.439229783394421, '5%': -2.86545894814762, '10%': -2.5688568756191392}. Test statistic is bigger than the critical values. (no stationary)\n* As a result, we sure that our time series is not stationary.\n* Lets make time series stationary at the next part.","5b69ecd0":"* Constant mean criteria: mean looks like constant as you can see from plot(black line) above .

Therefore, this time series has seasonality trends.\n* Another example, lets think we dice one time every day during 1 year. As you guess, there will be no scenario like that number six is appeared mostly in summer season or number five is mostly appeared in January.
