The images of within the same patient will be used to determine the likelihood of identifying melanoma with the help of building a predictive binary classification model. The model will predict whether the lesion in the image is benign or malignant denotated by values 0 and 1 respectively. The binary classification model of Image analysis tool will be useful to automate the diagnosis of melanoma which will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. A model with higher and better accuracy to detect melanoma will have a positive impact on millions of people.","fab1bfbe":"### ***Dataset Description:***","6298603b":"Melanoma is a dangerous skin cancer. The skin which is our body\u2019s largest organ stores water and fat and produces vitamin D. The skin made up of 3 main layers namely: Epidermis- the outer layer, Dermis: the inner layer, Hypodermis: the deep layer of fat. The deepest layer of the epidermis just above dermis contains cells called melanocytes which produces pigment melanin which is responsible for skin color. Melanoma begins in melanocytes. Melanoma forms when the healthy melanocytes change and grow out of control forming a cancerous tumor.","3da7aab8":"It is observed that in train set 81% observations have unknown diagnosis.
