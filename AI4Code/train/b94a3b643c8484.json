Good to know -- no more digging in this direction.* \n\nI have run across [this nice script](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ymatioun\/santander-linear-model-with-additional-features) by Youri Matiounine in which a number of new features are added and linear regression is performed on the resulting data set. I was surprised by the high performance of this simple model: the LB score is about 0.894 which is close to what you can get using the heavy artillery like LighGBM. At the same time, I felt like there is a room for improvement -- after all, this is a classification rather than a regression problem, so I was wondering what will happen if we perform a logistic regression on Matiounine's data set. This notebook is my humble attempt to answer this question. \n\nMatiounine's features can be used in other models as well. To avoid the necessety of re-computing them every time when we switch from one model to another, I show how to store the processed data in [feather files](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/feather-format\/), so that next time they can be loaded very fast into memory.
