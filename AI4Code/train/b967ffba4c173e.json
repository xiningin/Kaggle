The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence and convenience. During the 1920s, cars had another benefit: \"couples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\"\n\nSimilarly the costs to society of car use may include; maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life; and can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. Societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability of humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)"}}
