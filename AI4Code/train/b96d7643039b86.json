than men in the places with the least probability, while in the countries where disease is most likely, there is a much larger gap; around 20%.","5f6a5e86":"The places with the most air contamination have the most lower respiratory infections, followed by ischaemic heart disease. However, the countries with the least air pollution have ischaemic heart disease as their most common complication. Also, on average, females are slightly more likely to get consequences from air pollution than men.","c47cf760":"Welcome to my WHO world data analysis notebook, where today we will be analysing different health statistics provided by WHO.

The data which is taken is in the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015.","3595fe30":"Another conclusion we can make is that the places with the lowest longevity (Burundi, Central African Republic and Zambia) are in Africa, whereas two thirds of the countries with the highest life expectancy (Republic of Korea and Japan) are in Asia. This could suggest that the healthcare in Asia is much better than the one in Africa.","80944c6d":"# Road traffic deaths","ebf56ef5":"# Violence against women","72d14de0":"Three out of the five countries which have the most deaths are in Africa (Liberia, Zimbabwe, Burundi), while three out of the five countries which have the least amount of deaths are in Europe (Norway, Switzerland and San Marino). This could suggest that the road traffic in Europe is much more controlled than in Africa, however, some of this might be due to San Marino having a significantly lower population (34,000).","eec96169":"## Country comparison","0f2b318b":"# Air pollution death rate","45073aa6":"The trend seems to be decreasing in all the countries, meaning that every place is working to lessen the chance of sickness.","cd30528e":"Some of the countries with the most violence are in Central and West Africa (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Liberia), suggesting that possibly Africa is a more violent place for women to be in.","adf77bb0":"The final visualisations in this dataset is comparing the different age groups for the countries with the largest violence against women: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Equitorial Guinea.","b59ce4e6":"Now we turn our attention to air pollution in the next analysis and compare the different complications that arise from it.
