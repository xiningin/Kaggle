This method is not very reliable as train and test data not always have same kind of variation like original data, which will affect the accuracy of the model. Cross validation solves this problem by dividing the input data into multiple groups instead of just two groups. There are multiple ways to split the data, in this article we are going to cover K Fold and Stratified K Fold cross validation techniques.\n\nIn case you are not familiar with train test split method, please refer [this](https:\/\/satishgunjal.com\/train_test_split\/) article.\n\n\n# Inner Working of Cross Validation <a id =\"2\"><\/a>\n\n* Shuffle the dataset in order to remove any kind of order\n* Split the data into K number of folds. K= 5 or 10 will work for most of the cases.\n* Now keep one fold for testing and remaining all the folds for training.\n* Train(fit) the model on train set and test(evaluate) it on test set and note down the results for that split\n* Now repeat this process for all the folds, every time choosing separate fold as test data\n* So for every iteration our model gets trained and tested on different sets of data\n* At the end sum up the scores from each split and get the mean score\n\n![Inner_Working_KFold](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/satishgunjal\/images\/master\/Inner_Working_KFold.png)\n\n# K Fold Cross Validation <a id =\"3\"><\/a>\n\nIn case of K Fold cross validation input data is divided into 'K' number of folds, hence the name K Fold. Suppose we have divided data into 5 folds i.e. K=5. Now we have 5 sets of data to train and test our model. So the model will get trained and tested 5 times, but for every iteration we will use one fold as test data and rest all as training data. Note that for every iteration, data in training and test fold changes which adds to the effectiveness of this method. \n\nThis significantly reduces underfitting as we are using most of the data for training(fitting), and also significantly reduces overfitting as most of the data is also being used in validation set. K Fold cross validation helps to generalize the machine learning model, which results in better predictions on unknown data. To know more about underfitting & overfitting please refer [this](https:\/\/satishgunjal.com\/underfitting_overfitting\/) article.\n\nFor most of the cases 5 or 10 folds are sufficient but depending on problem you can split the data into any number of folds.\n\n![KFold_Cross_Validation](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/satishgunjal\/images\/master\/KFold_Cross_Validation.png)\n\n\n# Stratified K Fold Cross Validation <a id =\"4\"><\/a>\n\nStratified K Fold used when just random shuffling and splitting the data is not sufficient, and we want to have correct distribution of data in each fold. In case of regression problem folds are selected so that the mean response value is approximately equal in all the folds. In case of classification problem folds are selected to have same proportion of class labels. Stratified K Fold is more useful in case of classification problems, where it is very important to have same percentage of labels in every fold.\n\n![Stratified_KFold_Cross_Validation](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/satishgunjal\/images\/master\/Stratified_KFold_Cross_Validation.png)\n\n# Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection <a id =\"5\"><\/a>\n\nNow you are familiar with inner working of cross validation, lets see how we can use it to tune the parameters and select best model. \n\nFor hyperparameter tuning or to find the best model we have to run the model against multiple combination of parameters and features and record score for analysis. To do this we can use sklearns 'cross_val_score' function. This function evaluates a score by cross-validation, and depending on the scores we can finalize the hyperparameter which provides the best results. Similarly, we can try multiple model and choose the model which provides the best score.\n\nNote: In this article I will do the model parameter tuning using for loop for better understanding. There are more sophisticated ways like using GridSearchCV() to do hyperparameter tuning. To know more about it please refer [this](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/satishgunjal\/tutorial-hyperparameter-tuning\/) article\n\n# Advantages <a id =\"6\"><\/a>\n\n* We end up using all the data for training and testing and this is very useful in case of small datasets\n* It covers the variation of input data by validating the performance of the model on multiple folds\n* Multiple folds also helps in case of unbalanced data\n* Model performance analysis for every fold gives us more insights to fine tune the model \n* Used for hyperparameter tuning\n\n# Disadvantages <a id =\"7\"><\/a>\n\nK Fold cross validation not really helpful in case time series data.
