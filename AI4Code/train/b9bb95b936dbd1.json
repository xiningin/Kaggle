The National Football League (NFL) has used previous Kaggle competitions to focus on offensive plays, but as the old proverb goes, \"defense wins championships\". Though metrics for analyzing quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers are consistently a part of public discourse, techniques for analyzing the defensive part of the game trail and lag behind. Identifying player, team, or strategic advantages on the defensive side of the ball would be a significant breakthrough for the game.\n\nThis competition uses NFL's Next Gen Stats data, which includes the position and speed of every player on the field during each play. You'll employ player tracking data for all drop-back pass plays from the 2018 regular season. The goal of submissions is to identify unique and impactful approaches to measure defensive performance on these plays. There are several different directions for participants to 'tackle' (ha)\u2014which may require levels of football savvy, data aptitude, and creativity.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nThe 2021 Big Data Bowl data contains player tracking, play, game, and player level information for all possible passing plays during the 2018 regular season. For purposes of this event, passing plays are considered to be ones on a pass was thrown, the quarterback was sacked, or any one of five different penalties was called (defensive pass interference, offensive pass interference, defensive holding, illegal contact, or roughing the passer). On each play, linemen (both offensive and defensive) data are not provided. The focus of this year's contest is on pass coverage.\n\nTo be able to start with the EDA, we should upload the data:","ed1c47a3":"To be able to apply most of the ML algorithms, we should encode some of our variables. Let's check our types:","eb5d030e":"The columns *o*, *dir*, *position*, *jerseyNumber* and *nflId* also contains some missing values but even so, it's less than a 1% of the total. Then, we could remove those rows containing missing values:","6837b948":"We have lot of data frames so we are going to analyze them one by one.\n\n### Game data\n\nFirst of all, we could have a look at how our data looks like:","65ff4b6e":"## Random Forest","758a64f6":"Other relevant information we could get is the games played at home and away:","4d5d0bad":"The `games.csv` contains the teams playing each game. The key variable is `gameId`.\n- `gameId`: Game identifier, unique (numeric)\n- `gameDate`: Game Date (time, mm\/dd\/yyyy)\n- `gameTimeEastern`: Start time of game (time, HH:MM:SS, EST)\n- `homeTeamAbbr`: Home team three-letter code (text)\n- `visitorTeamAbbr`: Visiting team three-letter code (text)\n- `week`: Week of game (numeric)\n\nOnce we have seen our data, we should check if we have missing values as follows:","9896d47f":"This time, we have too many columns to be displayed so we could check their names as follows:","94d3a7c0":"Analyzing the plays, we have some measures related with the intesity: some players plays more focus when the game score is tight or when they have the obligation of go up.\n\nTo simplify the model, we could make one simple assumption: players always play at his best level. Then, we could remove the following list of variables from our list of predictors:\n- *quarter*\n- *down*\n- *preSnapVisitorScore*\n- *preSnapHomeScore*\n- *gameClock*\n\nWe already include information about the yardline when we made all the *x* components go in the same direction so we could avoid to include the *yardlineSide* and the *yardlineNumber*. We could also remove the *play description* since its content will be difficult to process:","54a7d3e7":"Furthermore, we could get the most common positions according to the number of players for each one:","483926f9":"As we can see, the percentage of missing values for column *route* is big, around 72%. This column contains the ran by offensive player which could be interesting to know. \n\nHowever, with less than a 30% of information we're not going to be able to learn anything interesting so we could remove the column:","3f1c6496":"In the same way, we could obtain the number of games by game time:","4f614487":"Then, we could start analyzing the data by ploting the number of plays per team:","628ea61a":"### Player data\n\nAgain, we start looking at the data:","0ed6e7c6":"Play data: The `plays.csv` file contains play-level information from each game.

For purposes of this contest, the most important penalties are Defensive Pass Interference (DPI), Offensive Pass Interference (OPI), Illegal Contact (ICT), and Defensive Holding (DH). Multiple penalties on a play are separated by a ; (text)\n- `penaltyJerseyNumber`: Jersey number and team code of the player commiting each penalty.
