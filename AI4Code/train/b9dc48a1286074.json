We have a dataset on Avocado prices and volume sold by region and date. I thought this would be a great dataset for any beginner to start playing around with visualizations. I'm sharing few basic concepts of visualizations using this data here. \n\nI've mainly focused on creating simple graphs and customizing them to pose a great look. I've used Seaborn predominantly throughout this kernel. However Seaborn has many sophisticated visuals, I have not used everything here as it is not necessary.
