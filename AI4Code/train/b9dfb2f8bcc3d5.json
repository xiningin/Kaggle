The graph may mean that people are not really growing within the company so they tend to leave. We can see more percentage wise that there are more people working overtime and also leaving. It seems that there may be a pattern of people leaving because they are not promoted although they work hard. \n\nSecond graph shows that those who rated their work-life balance relatively low were travelling longer to work in comparison with those who rated their work-life balance as really good. This difference is more pronounced in the group of those who are not in the company anymore, suggesting a possibly influential attrition factor.\n\n\nThird graph shows a trend that most of the people staying are not doing overtime which makes sense. On the other side, the people that are leaving the company are very close. There is a small difference in favor of overtime which makes sense.\n\n\nForth graph shows that people who are staying in the company are satisfied with their job. Those employees are doing more overtime which coincides also with them stating there is a good work environment. Opposite to logic, people that are leaving are working less overtime. However, it can also mean that these people are less willing to work in the company.\n","71c56589":"In this report we will do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify the most significant variables that could effect attrition. \n\n#### Problem: \n\nThe company is worried about the departure of the most valuable talent to other firms. The HR department is designing a new HR program to reduce the employee attrition by identifying and retaining the most valuable talent subject to leave. \n\n\nInitially we are going to analyze the whole dataset and understand what is in it and how the variables are distributed.\n","87b2f698":"### Conclusions\n\nAttrition can be explained mostly based on the imbalance of the income. The salary is the most sensitive variable to describe it. It specially applies to employees working overtime with low incomes. The income is reflected in different variables such as Education, Job Level, Overtime, Year at company and more. \n\nWe have also found that different variations of work-life balance might represent an issue for our employees. \nThere seems to be a link between attrition and age as well as the number of companies worked for.\nAlso, there seems to be a clear pattern that the people who left travelled more frequently compared to the others. This might have also been a big reason behind them leaving. \n\nIn order to fight attrition, we believe that we should focus on the following variables: \nWe considered Age, Monthly Income, OverTime, Marital Status, JobLevel, YearsAtCompany, Number of Companies worked for, Business Travel.\n \n","fa958674":"### Tableau","0bbe7010":"First Graph shows that the people that are leaving are traveling freqently a bit more than those that are staying. Other than that it seems like it there's not much of a difference between the leaving and staying people in terms of traveling.\n\nSecond graph shows that in general, people that are leaving are also earning less, no matter what level of education they have. It also shows that people that are earning a lot and have a high education, are staying. It just points out the importance of the salary for the employees.\n\nThird graph shows that most of the peolpe that are leaving are single no matter the sex. While people that are staying, it is mostly married. It shows that an unstable marital status like single are more prone to change their jobs.\n\nForth graph, it shows that income is the most sensitive variable to predict attrition. Job satisfaction is simnilar across the board. It does not vary so it is not sensitive for the attrition model."}}
