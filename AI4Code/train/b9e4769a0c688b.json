For example, `max`.\n\nBy default, `max` returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional `key` argument, it returns the argument `x` that maximizes `key(x)` (aka the 'argmax').","1b77e67d":"## \"What does this function do again?\"\n\nI showed the `abs` function in the previous tutorial, but what if you've forgotten what it does?\n\nThe `help()` function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn.

","c574ac99":"When applied to a function, `help()` displays...\n\n- the header of that function `abs(x, \/)`. In this case, this tells us that `abs()` takes a single argument `x`.

The indented block of code following the `:` is run when the function is called.\n\n`return` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.\n\nIs it clear what `least_difference()` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:","e49babcd":"...though what it shows isn't super useful.\n\nNotice that the code cells above have examples of functions (`type`, and `print`) taking *another function* as input. This opens up some interesting possibilities - we can *call* the function we receive as an argument.","76d72a82":"## Defining functions\n\nBuiltin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.","611059e6":"# Functions and Getting Help\nIn this lesson, we'll be talking about functions: calling them, defining them, and looking them up using Python's built-in documentation.\n\nIn some languages, functions must be defined to always take a specific number of arguments, each having a particular type. Python functions are allowed much more flexibility. The `print` function is a good example of this:","0ec9d914":"## Default arguments\n\nWhen we called `help(print)`, we saw that the `print` function has several optional arguments. For example, we can specify a value for `sep` to put some special string in between our printed arguments:","8c9ec7ef":"Unsurprisingly, Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description. However, when I write a function, I can provide a description in what's called the **docstring**.\n\n### Docstrings","9ae0b439":"**Common pitfall:** when you're looking up a function, remember to pass in the name of the function itself, and not the result of calling that function. \n\nWhat happens if we invoke help on a *call* to the function `abs()`? Unhide the output of the cell below to see.","76b185d2":"But if we don't specify a value, `sep` is treated as having a default value of `' '` (a single space).","e42401fc":"Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of \"null\" in other languages.)\n\nWithout a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.","c22257c6":"The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. When we call `help()` on a function, it shows the docstring.","6bf68a40":"# Your turn!\n\nHead over to [the Exercises notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/1275158) to get some hands-on practice working with functions and getting help.","6bbbb9d5":"Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:","c1652b15":"> **Aside: example calls**\n> The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The `>>>` is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function.
