You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat\u2019s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat\u2019s marketing strategy.\n\nQuestions to be answered (hopefully)\n1. what are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. how could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. how could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategies?\n\nBusiness task\nThe goal is would be to figure out potential opportunities for growth and recommandations to present to the client, all this based on trends in smart device use.\n\nFirst things first, load some packages","934ab3a3":"![](https:\/\/3c62f15c088d4767904b875f776509dc.app.rstudio.cloud\/graphics\/ccf867c0-cdce-4b42-8c1b-de4d3b6ba45c.png)","943154fd":"what do all this tell us?\n1. the average sedentary time is of 16 hours (median LightActiveMinutes: 199.00), in a day made of 24 hours, if you take out the sleeping time...that clearly is too much\n2. moreover, the majority of participants are lightly active\n3. on average,people sleep in one go for 7 hours (median TotalMinutesAsleep: 433.00)\n4. average steps per day are 7406. Which is not a lot considering the fact that the CDC and the WHO tell to go for 10 000 (if you do not have a physical activity, in which case you could go for lower step count)\n5. finally, the average BMI is of 24.39 which is at the very end of the HEALTHY WEIGHT status, just below the OVERWEIGHT status that starts at 25 of BMI","28773d96":"we can see how linear the relationship is.

That can be linked to the fact that we spend energy and that exhausts the body. The reverse process is also valid, the more we sleep, the less sedentary we are, because we are rested and have high energy levels and motivation to move.
