With growing digital media and ever growing publishing \u2013 who has the time to go through entire articles \/ documents \/ books to decide whether they are useful or not? Thankfully \u2013 this technology is already here.\n\nHave you come across the mobile app inshorts? It\u2019s an innovative news app that converts news articles into a 60-word summary. And that is exactly what we are going to learn in this article \u2014 Automatic Text Summarization.\n\nAutomatic Text Summarization is one of the most challenging and interesting problems in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is a process of generating a concise and meaningful summary of text from multiple text resources such as books, news articles, blog posts, research papers, emails, and tweets.\n\nThe demand for automatic text summarization systems is spiking these days thanks to the availability of large amounts of textual data.\n\nThrough this article, we will explore the realms of text summarization. We will understand how the TextRank algorithm works, and will also implement it in Python. Strap in, this is going to be a fun ride!\n\n## Understanding the TextRank Algorithm\n\nBefore getting started with the TextRank algorithm, there\u2019s another algorithm which we should become familiar with \u2013 the PageRank algorithm. In fact, this actually inspired TextRank! PageRank is used primarily for ranking web pages in online search results. Let\u2019s quickly understand the basics of this algorithm with the help of an example.\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Pagerank11.png)\n\n\n## TextRank Algorithm\n\nLet\u2019s understand the TextRank algorithm, now that we have a grasp on PageRank. I have listed the similarities between these two algorithms below:\n\nIn place of web pages, we use sentences\nSimilarity between any two sentences is used as an equivalent to the web page transition probability\nThe similarity scores are stored in a square matrix, similar to the matrix M used for PageRank\nTextRank is an extractive and unsupervised text summarization technique. Let\u2019s take a look at the flow of the TextRank algorithm that we will be following:\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn.analyticsvidhya.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/block_3.png)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n","a06bbf7e":"# 3 Making the Article Summarizer","26d8ed56":"# 2 Exploratory Data Analysis","0530680d":"# 1 Importing the required Libraries"}}
