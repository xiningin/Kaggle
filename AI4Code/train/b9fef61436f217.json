The status 2 patients were also likely to have a higher aux. node count.","45adb5fa":"### Observations on univariate analysis\n\n1.  High number of patients of age 45-65 years and the patients within 40-55 years of age fell under status 2 (died within 5 years of the operation).\n2.  Patients under 40 had very few cases that fell under status 2.\n3. Initially (in 1958) there were a huge number of patients but as time went on, we can see a dip in the number of patients (which could be due to various reasons like tech advancement, awareness etc.).\n4. In 1964, the ratio of patients in status to status 2 was really poor and we can see the status2 curve climbing which indicates poor performance. \n5. While the min nodes found were 0 and the max was 50 but majority of the patients had none or 1 auxiliary nodes found. (Median = 1, Mean = 4.2) so we can expect the presence of outliers. [We can see that 80% of the dataset has <= 8 nodes.]\n6. Patients with 0 aux. nodes found tend to live longer after the operation.\n7. As number of auxiliary nodes increases, the more dangerous it gets for the patient, although there are few cases with high number of nodes.\n","263ab061":"A large number of patients incoming were of age 40-60 with 0-1 aux nodes.","a8df3bc2":"The combination of features are not easily separable.","2387a6a7":"## Observations\n1. As per the analysis, the given data is not linearly separable.\n2. Most patients had 0 or 1 aux. nodes found but as the number of auxiliary nodes increases, the more dangerous it gets for the patient, although there are few cases with high number of nodes.\n3. High number of patients of age 45-65 years and the patients within 40-55 years of age fell under status 2 (died within 5 years of the operation).\n4. In 1964, the number of patients falling into status 2 class increased but majority were still in status 1. This trend followed every year but was the worse in 1964.\n5. In the long run, the total number of patients decreased with time.\n6.

That means a lot of data points lie together and can't be separated. \n\nNodes vs Status boxplot shows the least overlap which was already explained as most patients with status = 1 had less nodes and as the aux. nodes increased, the danger tends to increase and the more likely they are to falling in status = 2  group. Hence, there are some status 1 patients with high aux. nodes found as well."}}
