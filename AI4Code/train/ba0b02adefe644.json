The purpose may be to obtain goods or services or to make payment to another account, which is controlled by a criminal. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is the data security standard created to help financial institutions process card payments securely and reduce card fraud.\n\nCredit card fraud can be authorised, where the genuine customer themselves processes a payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal, or unauthorised, where the account holder does not provide authorisation for the payment to proceed and the transaction is carried out by a third party. In 2018, unauthorised financial fraud losses across payment cards and remote banking totalled \u00a3844.8 million in the United Kingdom. Whereas banks and card companies prevented \u00a31.66 billion in unauthorised fraud in 2018. That is the equivalent to \u00a32 in every \u00a33 of attempted fraud being stopped.\n\nCredit cards are more secure than ever, with regulators, card providers and banks taking considerable time and effort to collaborate with investigators worldwide to ensure fraudsters aren't successful. Cardholders' money is usually protected from scammers with regulations that make the card provider and bank accountable. The technology and security measures behind credit cards are becoming increasingly sophisticated making it harder for fraudsters to steal money.","ede17fdf":"**Reshaping the Amount column to 2D**","92791a80":"**Descriptive statistics of the data**","2214fc5e":"**Importing the csv file**","e0b24137":"**Finding out if there are any null value**","cbbb6ac3":"**80% - Training Value**\n\n**20% - Testing Value**","ecf3bb62":"* The model has 99.83% accuracy","3f60bb72":"**Findidng out the percentage of fraud and no fraud values**","dc321255":"* 0.173% values are found to fraud","f47a34b4":"# Credit Card fraud Detection EDA + Regression","f857c6cc":"* There are more non fraud values","8c395413":"**Assigning the amount column as independant(X) and clas as dependant(y) variables**","9ae1c94a":"**Importing packages for Analysis**","febaf5e3":"**Amount taken with seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset**","ea37f177":"**Importing Logistic Regression**","ae16b668":"**Finding out the accuracy of the model**","75868718":"**Distribution of the presence of fraud and no fraud data**\n\n0 - No Fraud\n\n1 - Fraud","feb68e37":"**Setting an index**","bb15d3ad":"**Predicting the Values fitted**"}}
