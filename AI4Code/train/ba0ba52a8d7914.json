You're basically designing how your data gets generated.  Learning the shape and properties of various probability distributions is an essential background step to specifying models, but it's also deeply gratifying.  \n\nHere, we basically have an ordinary logistic regression model with a twist: every variable in the model also is multiplied by a binary indicator `xi` which acts to include or exclude that variable from the model.  \n","212ec99d":"# Spike-and-Slab Model:  An attempt to imitate the winning stategy from Don't Overfit I\n\nBayesian tools have come a long way since Tim Salimans wrote his own Gibbs sampler for the first competition.  These days, it's extremely rare for people to write their own samplers.  Instead, higher level modeling languages like PyMC3 and Stan are used to specify the model with a back-end \"inference engine\" doing the sampling.  \n\nHowever, learning how to specify models properly and using the high-level tools to fit them still requires overcoming a learning curve and thinking a bit differently than the traditional data science workflow, so here's a notebook to help get started.  \n\nI actually prefer Stan, but the Spike-and-Slab model has discrete parameters that are not possible to fit.  \n\nEDIT:  I've changed the prior on the coefficients to StudentT(3,0,1).  We don't want to over-regularize the included variables.  \n\nEDIT (again):  A normal prior works even better.  For .86 score, use p=.05 for hyperprior on `xi` and N(0,.75) as a prior for `beta`.","150e1e59":"# Sampling\nThis part is hard if you do it yourself.  There's a lot of room for mistakes, so this is generally not something you want to open the hood on if you can avoid it.  I won't go into sampling diagnostics here, but the Stan documentation has tons of good information.  \n\nI recommend using more chains in your own work, but I used just one here as I was having some trouble with the kernel.
