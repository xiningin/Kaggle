the survival probability the most. ","70a274c9":"**Final Conclusion:**\n\n1. With all the above analysis, we can conclude that the feature \"Positive Axillary Nodes\" plays a crucial role in determining the survival probability of the patient. I,e will the patient survive for more than 5 years or not. We observe that the survival probability drops from 82% to 42% when the number of \"Positive Axillary Nodes\" increases from 3 to more than 8.\n\n2. Patient Age on the other hand, is a big factor that impacts the survival probability but only when the patient has \"Positive Axillary Nodes\" between 3 and 8. In this group of patients, the survival probability drops from 82% to 48% when the patient age increases to more than 50.","b0966890":"**Observation:**\n\n1) The data set has 305 data points of the cancer patients. \n\n2) For each patients there are 3 features that possibly influences the patients probability to survive more than 5 years.\n\n3) These features has been renamed as 'PatientAge','OperationYear','PositiveAxillaryNodes','SurvivalStatus'\n\n4) From the above summary table we can conclude the following:\n    a) Of all the patient the mean age is 52 yrs with minimum age being 30 and maximum age being 83\n    b) The patient data was captured between the year 1958 to 1996\n    c) Of all the patient the mean Positive Axillary Nodes is 4 but the median is 1 with standard deviation of 7.

Lower the value indicates better chance at survival.\n\n5) Of all the patients who survived more than 5 years, the feature Positive Axillary Nodes has a mean of 2.7 with median as 0. This means that 50% of survivors did not have any Positive Axillary Nodes. 75% of survivors had Positive Axillary Nodes as 3 or less than 3. 90% of the survivors had Positive Axillary Nodes as less than equal to 8.\n\n6) Of all the patients who survived less than 5 years, the feature Positive Axillary Nodes has a mean of 7.4 with median as 4.
