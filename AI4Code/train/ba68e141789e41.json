If this helped you out, please drop an upvote for this notebook just under this cell!

HTML \/ Markdown\nMy favourite method is this one. Just incoporate this HTML code in a *Markdown* cell:\n\n`<img src=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-competitions\/kaggle\/15767\/logos\/header.png?t=2019-08-21-16-25-52\"\/>`\n\nAlternatively: this markdown code has a similar effect. Thanks to @leifuer for pointing this one out. \n\n`![Image](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-competitions\/kaggle\/15767\/logos\/header.png)`\n\nBelow you will see the result. This is the picture header for the learn together beginners' competition in Kaggle. Always do acknowledge where you are referencing your image for courtesy.","2896bc63":"So you can reference even pictures that are stored on your website. \"src\" refers to source.\nTo use your own image, just follow this format:\n\n`<img src=\"https:\/\/yoursite.com\/yourpic.png\/>`\n\nor \n\n`![Image](https:\/\/yoururl.com)`\n\n\nNote: The code only works in a markdown cell and not a code cell.","c5b653d2":"<a id=\"section-two\"><\/a>\n# 2. Python Image Library\n\nNow this one involves actual use of some Python code. It is slightly more involved but nothing that you can't implement within 5 minutes.\nI have uploaded an image into this notebook via the \"+ Add Data\" button on the top right.\nYou will see this button when you copy and edit this notebook for yourself.","4f56c0ca":"<a id=\"section-three\"><\/a>\n# 3. Javascript\n\nThis is where it gets more advanced. I would only recommend this if you have experience in coding with Javascript. The advantage of using this method is that you are able to add your own customizations.","e49721c6":"# Attaching Images to Notebook\n\nCreated nice code, and wanting to make your notebook public? Congratulations on you getting to that point!\nNow before sharing, juice up your notebook just a bit with some images. Add just that final bit of polish onto your creation. You can do this easily. One of the methods below will teach you how just a line of code!\n\n**Ways of attaching Images**:\n1. [HTML \/ Markdown](#section-one)\n2. [Python Image Library](#section-two)\n3. [Javascript](#section-three)\n\nI recommend using either the first two, they are far by the easiest to implement.","d62e45d6":"Congratulations! With these two lines of codes, you can also add images to your notebook.\nPretty simple and easy to implement!\n\nPhoto by vectorolie.
