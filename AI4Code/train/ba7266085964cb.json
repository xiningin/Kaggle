We can firmly say that there is a positive linear correlation between lcavol independent variable and lpsa dependent variable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRegardless of the statistical analysis, we need to first formulate a problem statement and understand the collection of data. We can do this by collaboration with domain experts, surveyers or business stakeholders. By following the simple steps of data summary statistics such as summary of numerical variables, distribution, correlation, outliers, data errors and data types, we can point data errors and define analytical approach including Linear Regression. For us to be able to use linear regression accurately, we need to make sure the linear regression conditions are met. As we are looking at the data not from a researchers perspective but rather from a data analyst or data scientist vision, we do not neccessarily perform every test for each condition but rather make assumption of these conditions by looking at certain distribution plots. ","cc37a4be":"As we dont have any pysical background on the domain of gambling, we can create an example problem statement in order to guide our analysis. This can simply be \"Why do British teenagers gamble?\" or \"Does income or status have any impact on British teenager's gambling habit?\" or \"Can education help reduce gambling in British teenagers?","35398642":"Based on our problem statements we defined earlier (\"Does income or status have any impact on British teenager's gambling habit? for example), the independent or response variable \"y\" is \"gamble\". We can see that there are some linear correlation between gamble and income. We do see some other correlations between verbal and status for example, however, since we are trying to find a solution to a specific problem, we can focus on gamble response variable and income dependent variable(predictor). ","f6983ad4":"There are no missing values in our dataset. Looking at summary statistics can give us some indication if there are any data errors. For example, there are teeangers that dont spend any money on gambling. I think that is believable. The minimum income is 0.6 pounds per week. Does that make sense? Since we dont see any obvious errors such as \"0\" income or \"2\" sex value, let's assume that the person who did the survey was accuarate gathering these data. ","739e365b":"Before we start looking to create regression model, predictive value, errors ,intercept or slope, we should look to see if the current relationship between income as the predictor and gamble as the response variable meets certain assumptions and conditions that is required for linear regression. \n\nIn order for us to create a linear regression model, we need to make sure the relationship is linear, there is independence of errors meaning, the residuals are not influencing each other and they are not following a certain pattern, there is homoscedasticity between income and gamble so that the data does not look like a funnel and normality of error distribution where the observations are mostly around the predicted value and evenly distributed. \n\nWhen we look at our regression line and the positions of each observation, we can see that there is somewhat linearity, the errors are not dependent from each other, residuals are not creating any funnel look alike pattern and they are distributed normally. This means that, as our independent variable income increases the spending on gamble (our dependent response variable) increases as well. There is a definate positive, linear relationship between income and gamble. \n\nWe wont be expanding our analysis any further and create regression model in this article as this meant to be an intro to linear regression however we can explore other datasets in a similar way.\n\nLet's look at another study where we look at 97 men with prostate cancer who were due to receive a radical prostatectomy. ","366a79eb":"When we look at the correlation between variables, let's keep in mind we are focusing on the defined response variable of lpsa, we see that cancer volume has the strongest relationship.","915c8445":"## Introduction to Linear Regression\n\nBefore we start diving into Linear Regression, I would like to emphasize how important it is to understand the problem before starting working with data. We often see statisticians start talking about the slope, distribution and other actual analysis without formulating the problem. As Albert Einstein once said, \"The formulation of a problem is often more essential than it's solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skills\". Hence, like every other data analysis execution, we need to formulate the problem by collaborating the matter experts in order to understand the background of the particular domain, the objective of the anlaysis, the alignment of the output and further put together the problem into statistical terms. \n\nUnderstanding the data collection is as important as formulating the problem, since certain collection processes will have an impact on the data and without knowing certain aspects of the collection process, we might end up coming up with wrong conclusions at the end of our analysis. Best practices in terms of understanding the data collection are;\n\n- See if the data is collected from a designed survey.\n- Explore noresponse. Certain data that we didnt get response for might be very important to the problem and our analysis.\n- Find if there are any missing values, or possible data errors and perform sanity check.\n- See how the units of measurement set up and perform standardization if neccessariy.\n- See how the qualitative such as categorical variables are coded. \n\nOnce we formulate our problem and understand how the data was collected, we can perform cleaning and initial data analysis. We can simplify this by;\n\n- Look at the **summary of numerical** variables.\n- See the **distribution** of variables\n- Look for possible **correlation**\n- Explore any possible **outliers**\n- Look for **data errors** with data sanity.\n- Make sure **data types** are correct. \n\n## Use of Linear Regression\n\nRegression gives us simply the linear relationship of two or more variables within a dataset. We have an dependent variable (or predictor variable) and has a relationship with independent variable (response variable). \n\nLet's review some examples and see if we can find relationship between variables. As we are reviewing these datasets, we will also talk about the certain assumptions that we need to make or certain conditions that we need to meet in order to use linear regression properly. \n\nOur first data set is on teenage gambling in Britain.","ca5f81ee":"The description of the variables are self explanatory, however the values might need further explanation. \n\n- sex: 0=male, 1=female\n- status: Socioeconomic status score based on parents' occupation\n- income: in pounds per week\n- verbal: verbal score in words out of 12 correctly defined\n- gamble: expenditure on gambling in pounds per year","ff0133d8":"We have 97 observations, 9 attributes. When we look at the minimum and maximum values, the only questionable variables we have is svi: seminal vesicle invasion and pgg45: percentage Gleason scores 4 or 5. Unfortunately we wont be able to confirm if these values make sense or a possible data error without having any medical expertise. Hence, we will assume the statistican who worked on creating this data set did an accurate data collection. ","9f614245":"As we can see, we definately need to understand the variable descriptions and must consult to domain expertise around prostate in order to fully formulate the problem. Below are the description of each variable;\n\n- lcavol: cancer volume\n- lweight: cancer weight\n- age: age\n- lbph: benign prostatic hyperplasia amount\n- svi: seminal vesicle invasion\n- lcp: capsular penetration\n- gleason: Gleason score\n- pgg45: percentage Gleason scores 4 or 5\n- lpsa: prostate specific antigen\n\nLet's assume the problem statement is \" Are there specific attributes of men that contributes to prostate cancer?\". These data come from a study that examined the correlation between the level of prostate specific antigen and a number of clinical measures in men who were about to receive a radical prostatectomy.This means our y response variable (dependent variable) is lpsa: prostate specific antigen.
