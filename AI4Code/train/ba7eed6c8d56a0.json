Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun. Adjectives are one of the main parts of speech of the English language, although historically they were classed together with nouns.","6e4ac2a6":"### Text Subjectivity\n\nIn natural language, subjectivity refers to expression of opinions, evaluations, feelings, and speculations and thus incorporates sentiment. Subjective text is further classified with sentiment or polarity.","3dfdecfd":"### lets check the head of the dataset","a9bba573":"### Text Polarity\n\nIt is the expression that determines the sentimental aspect of an opinion. In textual data, the result of sentiment analysis can be determined for each entity in the sentence, document or sentence. The sentiment polarity can be determined as positive, negative and neutral.\n","ae95169f":"### Lemmatization\n\nThough stemming and lemmatization both generate the root form of inflected\/desired words, but lemmatization is an advanced form of stemming. Stemming might not result in actual word, whereas lemmatization does conversion properly with the use of vocabulary, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma.\nBefore using lemmatization, we should be aware that it is considerably slower than stemming, so performance should be kept in mind before choosing stemming or lemmatization.","99475950":"## lets plot the Wordscloud","d30300a6":"#### lets check the Value Counts for Variation ","8c7790a8":"### Text Polarity\n\nIt is the expression that determines the sentimental aspect of an opinion.
