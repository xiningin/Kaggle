Reason_1 column contains the main reason of the calls and Reason_2 column contains the explanations of the calls.\n\nSecondly, pd.to_datetime is used to create \"Hour\", \"Day\", \"Month\" and \"Year\" columns. These columns makes visualization easier.","92f364ce":"<h1>Introduction<\/h1>\n\n911 is an emergency telephone number in North America.  Like other emergency numbers around the world, this number is intended for use in emergency circumstances only. Emergency call types are analysed and visualized in this project.","6c36b96b":"<h1>Conclusion<\/h1>\n\nTo conclude, \nThe top three reasons of calls are EMS, Traffic and Fire.\nNumber of calls are decreasing over years. \nThis project can be imporved by using other visualization techniques such as Folium Library.\n\nIt is my first kaggle kernel, please comment and feedback."}}
