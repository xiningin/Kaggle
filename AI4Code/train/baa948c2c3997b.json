set[[1](https:\/\/www.itl.nist.gov\/div898\/handbook\/eda\/section3\/eda35b.htm)].\n\nA skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. A data or distribution is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of its center point.\n\n*Note: Skewness value nearing `0` shows normal distribution of data sets.*\n\nKurtosis on the other hand is a measure of whether the data are heavy tailed or light tailed relative to the normal distribution i.e. data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails or lack of outliers. \n\n*Note: Kurtosis value around 3 indicate less heavy tail, and kurtosis value away from 3 shows, data set is heavily tailed.*","31330813":"Earning `weight` is right skewned and kurtosis value shows, it is heavily tailed because kurtosis value is greater than 3.","0f7188af":"**Reference:**\n\n[1] Tutorial-on-reading-large-datasets(https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/rohanrao\/tutorial-on-reading-large-datasets)\n\n[2] Jane-street-eda-of-day-0-and-feature-importance(https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/carlmcbrideellis\/jane-street-eda-of-day-0-and-feature-importance)","2753bac4":"One needs to apply transformation to make the data normal or near normal because many classical statistical tests and models assume data normality i.e. normal distribution of data.
