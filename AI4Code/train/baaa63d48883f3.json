Typically, a drug should have 6 records (or a multiple thereof, if it was tried in multiple experiments) one for each combination of dose (two levels) and time (3 levels), but for various reasons some of these records may not exist leading to record numbers that are not a multiple of 6.\n\nKnowing which records are from the same drug enables different forms of cross-validation (e.g. always keeping all records of a drug within the same CV fold) that might more closely match the actual prediction task. \n\nSo, let's load this data and have a look at it.","c00eee83":"# How many records are there per drug?\n\nAs we can see quite a few (>100) drugs just have 1 record. 6 is the most common number, but 1, 5, 7, 12 nd 13 are also pretty common. Obviously, the 1866 records for one drug are all for vehicle records. I'd speculate that the really commonly occuring drugs (with 178 to 718 records) might be commonly used reference drugs with known properties, but that's just speculation.","c301b0f8":"# How many MoAs are there per drug?\n\nAs we can see, most drugs have 1 or no MoA, but there's even one drug with 7 MoAs.","46498b9a":"So, what does the new file look like?","3570225c":"The problematic MoAs (i.e. with <7 drugs) are these ones:"}}
