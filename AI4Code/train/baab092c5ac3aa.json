These data points are a set of observations at specified times and equal intervals, typically with a datetime index and corresponding value. Common examples of time series data in our day-to-day lives include:     \n\n* Measuring weather temperatures \n* Measuring the number of taxi rides per month\n* Predicting a company\u2019s stock prices for the next day\n\n\n## Components of Time\u00a0Series\n\nTime series data consist of four components:\n\n1. Trend Component: This is a variation that moves up or down in a reasonably predictable pattern over a long period.\n\n2. Seasonality Component: is the variation that is regular and periodic and repeats itself over a specific period such as a day, week, month, season, etc.,\n\n3. Cyclical Component: is the variation that corresponds with business or economic 'boom-bust' cycles or follows their own peculiar cycles, and\n\n4. Random Component: is the variation that is erratic or residual and does not fall under any of the above three classifications.\n\nTo make this concept more clear here is a visual interpretation of the various components of the Time Series.

In this article, we saw how pandas can be used for wrangling and visualizing time series data. \n\nWe also performed tasks like time sampling, time shifting and rolling with stock data. These are usually the first steps in analyzing any time series data.

In pandas, a single point in time is represented as a `Timestamp` and we can use `datetime()` function to create Timestamps from strings in a wide variety of date\/time formats.","b3d64444":"## Shifting based off time string code\n\nWe can also use the offset from the offset table for time shifting. For that, we will use the pandas `shift()` function. We only need to pass in the `periods` and `freq` parameters. The `period` attribute defines the number of steps to be shifted, while the `freq` parameters denote the size of those steps.\n\nLet\u2019s say we want to shift the data three months forward:","885b9937":"<div align='center'><font size=\"5\" color='#088a5a'>Getting Started with Time Series analysis using Pandas<\/font><\/div>\n<div align='center'><font size=\"4\" color=\"#088a5a\">An introductory guide to get started with the Time Series datasets in Python<\/font><\/div>\n<hr>\n\n![](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1200\/1*SkNISejyo-j4t8C8kpv4mQ.jpeg)\n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/free-photos-vectors\/business)\n\n","58dd2734":"The **blue line** is the original open price data. The **red line represents the 30-day rolling window**, and has less noise than the orange line. Something to keep in mind is that once we run this code, the first 29 days aren\u2019t going to have the blue line because there wasn\u2019t enough data to actually calculate that rolling mean.","ecdff4e2":"# Time resampling\n\nExamining stock price data for every single day isn\u2019t of much use to financial institutions, who are more interested in spotting market trends. To make it easier, we use a process called time resampling to aggregate data into a defined time period, such as by month or by quarter. Institutions can then see an overview of stock prices and make decisions according to these trends.           \n\nThe pandas library has a `resample()` function which resamples such time series data. The resample method in pandas is similar to its `groupby` method as it is essentially grouping according to a certain time span. The `resample()` function looks like this:","2b98c74f":"Below is a complete list of the offset values.
