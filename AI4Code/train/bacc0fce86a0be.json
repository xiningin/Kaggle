This number is greater than the one that represents Sedentary lifestyle (<5000). However, a 2020 [study](\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/how-many-steps-should-you-take-a-day\") found that participants who took 8,000 steps per day had a 51% lower riskTrusted Source of dying by any cause compared with those who took 4,000 per day. This trend continued with higher step counts, as participants who took 12,000 steps per day had a 65% lower risk of dying than those who took 4,000. This finding suggests that the benefits of walking increase with step count but also shows that people who cannot reach 10,000 steps in a day can still benefit from the activity.\n- Predominant number of sedentary hours causes less hours of sleep. This is proved by [this](\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/27830446\/\") article, that states that \"sedentary behavior to be associated with an increased risk of insomnia\".\n- Speaking of sleep hours, predominant number of people participated in the research have average sleep in the healty range of 7-9 hours. But there is a significant number of people having lack of sleeping hours. This might also be caused by casualities of data collection e.g. some people don't wear device every night.\n- The most active hours are 12-2 PM and 5-7 PM. ","1aeb699b":"# 5.
