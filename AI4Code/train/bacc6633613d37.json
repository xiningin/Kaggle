Which is, when we think linearly about cause and effect we view it as occurring within the same period displaying only obvious linkages, however, adopting systems thinking shows that cause and effect are separated in time and space. In the case of corporations, we first notice that the _Climate Liability_ they face is at least partially the result of their environmental impact from activities including, but not limited to, unregulated CO2 emissions, overconsumption of resources, poor waste management, and others that affect the health of the planet.\n\nBut in addition to that, we see an indirect association which highlights how these activites, due to their role in to various climate hazards, are closely related to and cause social issues. These issues disproportionately put the lives of the poor and vulnerable at risk, cause the loss of livelihoods, lead to mass migrations and population displacement, increase the transmission of infectious diseases, and in general affect resource availability and health. However, the world continues to view climate action by corporations as voluntary or goodwill, when in reality it should be their responsibility!\n\nIt is also of note that the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire for corporations, although comprehensive in terms of asking for climate related data, has hardly any mention of the social impacts related to corporate activities.","3abaf169":"<h1 style=\"color: #FFFFFF\" id=\"vulnerability-assessment\">6 Vulnerability Assessment<\/h1>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net\/project_modules\/fs\/191bb570799121.5baf64549e4ab.jpg\" width=480px>\n\nPhoto by [Neil V Fernando](https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/70799121\/Editorial-Illustrations)\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"city-vulnerability\">6.1 City Vulnerability<\/h2>\n\nWe explore the theme of vulnerability by starting with the impact of climate change on cities. Global cities inevitably face a higher risk of climate hazards such as cyclones, high winds, flooding, coastal erosion and deposition and sea-level rise.[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1177\/0956247807076725) With 68% of the world's population projected to live in urban areas by 2050,[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/www.un.org\/development\/desa\/en\/news\/population\/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html), cities face a growing responsibility to provide safe and equitable living conditions for all with sufficient opportunities for the citizens to earn their livelihoods. However, there is no denying the links between Climate Change and its impacts on the most vulnerable sections of society. These are expected to hit those\nliving in poverty the hardest, due to their more prevalent dependency on the very natural resources affected by climate change and also because they have less capacity to protect themselves, adapt or recuperate losses.[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/www.who.int\/globalchange\/mediacentre\/events\/2011\/social-dimensions-of-climate-change.pdf)\n\nCOVID-19 has already shown us how unregulated continuation of the status quo will contribute to increasing inequality. But Climate Change is far more serious problem, not to mention, a key contributor in the rise and the propagation of various infectious diseases.[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/www.who.int\/globalchange\/climate\/en\/chapter6.pdf)\n\nThrough this section, we aim to develop metrics that track climate risks in cities and assess their ability, present and future, to tackle these risks.\n\n<h3 id=\"vulnerability-and-preparedness\">6.1.1 Vulnerability and Preparedness<\/h3>\n\n---\n<p id=\"#metric1\">\n<strong><em>Metric 1: Vulnerability<\/em><\/strong><br>\n<i>The susceptibility of cities to the possible risks and negative impacts of climate change, due to inadequate preparedness, high exposure, or both.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n    \n$$Vulnerability_{city} = \\sum_{i=1}^{climateHazards}max(0, ClimateExposure_{i} - Preparedness_{i})$$\n\n**Rationale**  \nA basic understanding of climate threat requires a measure of the climate exposure, that is the amount, magnitude and time-frame of the impact of risks cities will deal with in the present and the future. However, _Vulnerability_ provides a more comprehensive view, allowing cities to assess the sufficiency of their preparedness agaisnt their climate exposure. This is determined through a simple arithmetic calculation that promotes high levels of preparedness for high levels of exposure, thereby immediately encouraging planning of mitigation and adaptation measures.\n\n---","d32dbd57":"The top half of this chart is primarily populated with cities that happen to be in more developed nations, such as USA, UK, Japan, and Denmark. This shows that it is significantly easier for cities in the developed parts of the world to plan and implement emission reduction projects which perform better over their lifetimes, and therfore the onus should first be on these cities to reduce their carbon footprints.\n\n---\n\n<h3 id=\"corporate-emissions\">7.1.2 Corporate Emissions<\/h3>\n\nThe Corporate Vulnerability section highlighted the negative impact of corporate action on the environment. Diving deeper into these impacts, with the visualization below, we find that the Fossil Fuel and Power Generation industries are, on average, responsible for the greatest amount of CO2e emissions. Given that corporations are accountable for a significant proportion of total worldwide GHG emissions, the responsibility to mitigate climate change and address the social inequality caused by climate hazards should not fall on the shoulders of governments alone.","bccaa5ad":"The facilities can once more be mapped out, but this time coloured by how they score on _Unsustainable Water Use,_ and overlaid on the baseline water stress at the country level.

There exists a strong focus on the societal impact that climate change plays in order for communities to thrive and survive. The long term lens has made it imperative now more than ever to look beyond and create a sustainable future, a future where cities and businesses work together to evaluate, rehabilitate and safeguard the world. \n\n[Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)](https:\/\/www.cdp.net\/en\/info\/about-us) a not-for-profit charity is working on accelerating an economic transition that works for the people and planet in the long term. CDP runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts on climate change, water security and deforestation. The disclosure system tracks the thousands of companies, cities, states and regions that supply information in its annual reporting process, and scores companies and cities based on their journey through disclosure and towards environmental leadership. The world\u2019s economy looks to CDP as the gold standard of environmental reporting with the richest and most comprehensive dataset on corporate and city action to measure and manage their risks and opportunities.\n\n<h2 id=\"21st-century-problem\">2.2 21st Century Problem<\/h2>\n\nThe data provided through the Questionnaires by CDP gives insight into the environmental impact of cities and corporations. As the data continues to grow, there is great potential in how these insights could be used in a consequential way. According to the [United Nations Human Development Report, 2019](http:\/\/report.hdr.undp.org\/), there exists an important issue which is often ignored when we consider the emerging and existing risks that we will face in the 21st century - the interwovenness of Climate Change and Inequality. Through this report, we aim to focus on the importance of integrating social equity into climate action. Using data from the questionnaires along with external datasets we aim to develop actionable Key Performance Indicators that can be adopted to track climate action geared towards solving social and environmental issues.\n \n<h2 id=\"journey-through-the-portal\">2.3 Journey through The Portal<\/h2>\n\nWe start this report by presenting the problem statement as defined by CDP\/Kaggle (Section 3).\n\nWe then move on to an explanation of our framework and methodology for developing KPIs (Section 4). Once these have been introduced, we provide a short overview of the various datasets used throughout the notebook (Section 5), and then dive into building our KPIs (Sections 6, 7, 8). The focus of our KPIs is on 3 main areas. \n\n- In Section 6, we look at Vulnerability and establish ways to measure the impact of climate change on cities and corporations, while discussing the broader social implications of these risks.\n- In Section 7, we look at 3 individual themes - Emissions, Energy, and Water - relating to Climate Impact, and assess the effect activities undertaken in these areas may have on making a more equitable society, or inversely, furthering social inequality and division.\n- In Section 8, we suggest a way to measure the Collaboration ability of cities and organizations to partner with one another and work together on mitigating shared risks and realizing their common goals and ambitions.\n\nFinally, we offer our final recommendations and closing thoughts in the Key Takeaways (Section 9).\n\n<h1 style=\"color: #FFFFFF\" id=\"problem-statement\">3 Problem Statement<\/h1>\n\n<br>\n\nAs per the [competition website](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions), the problem statement is as follows:\n\nDevelop a methodology for calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) that relate to the environmental and social issues that are discussed in the CDP survey data. Leverage external data sources and thoroughly discuss the intersection between environmental issues and social issues. Mine information to create automated insight generation demonstrating whether the city and corporate ambitions take these factors into account.\n\nThe website also provides a set of questions that could be used as guidelines when attempting a solution to the problem statement.\n\n- How do you help cities adapt to a rapidly changing climate amidst a global pandemic, but do it in a socially equitable way?\n- What are the projects that can be invested in that will help pull cities out of a recession, mitigate climate issues, but not perpetuate racial\/social inequities?\n- What are the practical and actionable points where city and corporate ambition join, i.e. where do cities have problems that corporations affected by those problems could solve, and vice versa?\n- How can we measure the intersection between environmental risks and social equity, as a contributor to resiliency?\n\n<h1 style=\"color: #FFFFFF\" id=\"methodology\">4 Methodology<\/h1>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/564x\/1b\/cb\/87\/1bcb8744497dca3ac1f44a5540cb3a58.jpg\" width=600><br>\n\nClimate Change and Social inequality are extremely complex issues that require a holistic approach to developing solutions. The current movement to transition to net-zero, at its core is a collective good, but there will always be disagreements and debates when it comes to creating a direction for sustainability transitions due to the ambiguous and contested nature of the concept. Keeping this in mind, we realised that to push for ambitious actions towards a collective good, we had to develop metrics that are able to prove accountability across our three main themes of Vulnerability, Climate Impact and Collaboration. Thereafter, using the data from the CDP questionnaires and a few of the external datasets, we were able to establish a relationship between inequality (in various contexts) and climate change, and bring to light unique properties which may not be visible when looking at the constituent parts separately from a reductionist approach.\n\nThe systemic nature of climate change based inequality required us to zoom out and look at its functioning as a whole unit. This is why we decided to apply a broad lens and analyse the data at the global level - because we understand that the performance of climate action and the nature of inequality varies in every country based on human capital, resources, technological advancements etc, and focusing with a narrow lens would give room for implicit biases to play out. This approach resulted in many of our personal biases not being justified when it came to looking at the data, in fact we saw them crash before our eyes, and this allowed us to gain new insights which contributed to helping us build _impact_ metrics that could be easily compared between cities and corporations for different regions.\n\nWhile the KPIs we developed were not exclusive to the S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) approach, this principle was crucial in building a foundation when it came to the process of selecting relevant metrics.\n\n<h1 style=\"color: #FFFFFF\" id=\"datasets-used\">5 Datasets Used<\/h1>","6cf1e0aa":"Visualizing the corporations ranked by electricity greed shows just how vast the divide is, with the top two corporates, Copper Tire & Rubber, and HudBay Minerals Inc., consuming roughly 2x and 0.5x the electricity required to provide enough to every single person who currently lacks it.\n\nIn addition to such indirect, comparitive, issues related to consumption, corporate energy activities have even more serious and direct impacts on human health, and that has to do with the fuels they use to fulfil their energy requirements. These will be addressed with the next metric.\n\n---\n<strong id=\"#metric9\"><em>Metric 9: Deaths by Corporate Fuel Use<\/em><\/strong>  \n_Number of deaths casused due to corporations' choice of fuels for energy generation._\n<br><br>\n\n$NoOfDeaths = \\sum_{i=1}^{fuels}Fuel Consumption(TWh)_{i} \\times DeathsPerTWh_{i}$\n<br><br>\n\n**Rationale**  \nMost of the world's energy continues to be generated by fossil fuels. As per [Markandya, A., & Wilkinson, P. (2007)](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/12681524\/Electricity_generation_and_health), the use of fossil fuels for energy generation is directly linked to deaths in people due to air pollution related illnesses, or accidents in low visibility conditions. _Deaths by Corporate Fuel Use,_ thereby, provides a means for corporations to assess their impact on human health and safety by enabling them to calculate the number of deaths they might be responsible for due to their energy consumption habits. \n\n---\n\nThe following data on the fuel specific deaths per TWh of energy generated, is sourced from [Our World In Data](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh), who themselves partially sourced it from the document linked above.","6f622833":"The performance of organizations at implementing cost-effective, impactful initiatives can be measured by averaging the scores received on the entirety of their initiatives. The following visualization compares annual and lifetime scores for some of the highest scoring companies. Looking at the corporations that comprise the top 20 by their initiative scores, it is found that a majority are in the energy and transportation industries, with high individual CO2e emissions. This is a positive finding, as it shows that some of the large corporations with massive carbon footprints are taking the right steps to be more climate friendly, but it also lends to the fact that the large emitters have a greater potential for implementing actions to counteract Global Warming.","e08b1407":"The exposure scores for individual hazards allow us to understand their overall impact, allowing us to determine which hazards, on average, pose the most serious risks to cities.","1d6dffc0":"We find that several initiatives are focussed towards Energy. In addition, Transport, Waste, and Water, seem to be noteworthy areas for collaboration. We can see that cities are actively making efforts to collaborate with businesses, so it would be extremely useful if there was a way to measure collaboration ability between a city and a corporation. And so we present our final metric.\n\n---\n<strong id=\"#metric12\"><em>Metric 12: Collaboration Strength<\/em><\/strong>  \n_A measure of the joint interest and expected mutual benefits from collaborative partnerships between cities and corporations on shared risks, opportunities, and initiatives._\n<br><br>\n\n$$ CollaborationStrength_{city,org}  = SharedRisk \\times CommonOpportunities \\times \\mathtt{SERO}Score_{city,org},$$\n<br><br>\n$\\begin{align} &\\text{where } \\quad  \\mathtt{SERO}Score_{city,org}  = 5 -\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{mitigationActions_{city}}\\sum_{j=1}^{reductionInitiatives_{org}}\\mathtt{WordMoversDistance}(i, j)}{No.ofMitigationActions \\times No.ofReductionInitiatives} \\\\ \\\\ & \\text{and } \\quad org \\text{ is a corporation headquartered in } city \\\\ \\\\\n(\\mathtt{SERO} &= \\text{Similarity in Emission Reduction Objectives})\n\\end{align}$\n<br><br>\n\n**Rationale**  \n_Collaboration Strength_ is a metric that applies to pairs of cities and organizations, and thereby seeks to provide a score for the shared incentives that may be realized through joint initiatives. It is measured by taking into account the shared risks and objectives of cities with the corporations that have a presence in them. The shared objectives themselves are derived by finding overlaps between the city and corporate responses in the CDP Questionnaires. These include common opportunities and similarities in their strategies for emission reduction. _Collaboration Strength,_ therefore, enables cities to find corporations that are most suitable to work with to achieve their climate goals.\n\n---\n\nSince we only consider collaboration possibilities between corporations and cities which contain their headquarters, larger cities with high numbers of listed corporations are going to have more possibilites of finding suitable collaboration partners. The following visualization shows cities by the number of disclosing corporations headquartered in them.","f90c6811":"<h3 id=\"water-stress\">7.3.2 Water Stress<\/h3>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/files.wri.org\/s3fs-public\/styles\/large\/public\/aqueduct_projections_20150409.png?itok=WISZGyCc\"> \n\nImage from [WRI](https:\/\/www.wri.org\/)\n<br>\n\nWater is a ubiquitous resource. However, massive quantities of it are consumed by multinational corporates to sustain the global scale of their operations. It is, therefore, to be expected that some, if not all, of this water is sourced from water-stressed regions. These may be overstressed river basins, or countries facing issues related to water scarcity at the national level. Due to this, it becomes essential for corporations to account for the level of their water consumption from stressed regions or resources.\n\nWe can use the responses provided by organizations, to visualize their facilities by their total water consumption in stressed and non-stressed regions - as reported by them.","4dde7ea0":"So far we have discussed incentive to adapt, but circumstances for every city differ, making it more difficult, in some cases, to be able to adapt even if the incentives are there. So with our next metric we look at _Adaptability._\n\n---\n<strong id=\"#metric3\"><em>Metric 3: Adaptability<\/em><\/strong>  \n_Ability of a city to adapt to climate change._\n<br><br>\n\n$$ \\begin{align} & Adaptability_{city} = AdaptabilityFactor_{city} \\times Proactiveness_{city} \\times (10 \\times HumanCapitalScore + \\log_{10}(1 + Funding)), \\\\ \\\\ \\text{where } \\\\ & AdaptabilityFactor= \\sum_{i=1}^{factors}Impact_{i} \\times Degree_{i}, \\\\ \\text{and } & Funding = \\text{Average estimated funding available per adaptation action} \\end{align}$$\n\n**Rationale**  \nOvercoming climate change risks involves both mitigative actions, such as to reduce GHG emissions, as well as adapting to actual or future climate changes.[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/go.nasa.gov\/2KRPBaP) The adaptation ability of a city depends on the available funding and human capital, along with the total proactiveness in terms of conducting the activities needed for successful adaptation or transition. _Adaptability_ measures the ease or difficulty associated with this process of adaptation.\n\n---\n\nWe use the World Bank [Human Capital Index data](https:\/\/datacatalog.worldbank.org\/dataset\/human-capital-index) to arrive at a rough estimate of the human capital available to each city to plan, perform tasks, and conduct activities needed to increase city resilience and mitigate climate risk. Proactiveness is a measure of the city's drive to bring about positive change. This is estimated from the number of adaptation actions they are implementing.\n\nThe Adaptability Factor is calculated as a sum of products of the degree and impact of factors affecting adaptation efforts, as reported by cities in question `2.2`. Here the impact may be one of \"Challenges\" or \"Supports\", while the degree is the associated magnitude of the impact.\n\nThe funding available to cities is estimated from the history of implementation of adaptation actions by the city. Here we assume that the funding in the future is likely to remain in the range of the average funding for previous adaptation related actions. ","e05f199e":"A way to measure this inadequacy of renewables in cities would be to find a way to compare city capacity the total energy demand, and that brings us to our next metric.\n\n---\n<strong id=\"#metric7\"><em>Metric 7: Renewable Energy Public Demand<\/em><\/strong>  \n_Years of renewable energy generation required, at the current capacity, to meet annual energy demand for a city._\n<br><br>\n\n$\\begin{align} & Demand_{years} = \\frac{TotalEnergyUse_{MWh}}{RenewableEnergyCapacity_{MW} \\times 8760}, \\\\  \\\\\n \\text{where } \\\\ & TotalEnergyUse_{MWh} = Population_{city} \\times PerCapitaEnergyConsumption_{MWh} \\\\ \\\\ \n (8760 & = \\text{Number of hours in a year}) \\end{align}$\n<br><br>\n\n**Rationale**  \nA good methodology for cities to evaluate their renewable energy capacity is to calculate how sufficient it would be in, hypothetically, meeting the city's total energy requirements. This metric provides a way to do so by calculating the number of years of operation, at current capacity, required to fulfil the citizenry's annual energy demand.\n\n---\n\nIt must be noted that the above calculation is based on the assumption that the per capita energy consumption in cities is the same as the national average. Although, in general, the energy consumption is cities is likely to be higher than rural and suburban areas, [in some cases](https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/7043741.pdf) this might even be reversed. Due to lack of city-level data for energy consumption, we were forced to work with the national average, however, cities may easily rectify this by substituting the corresponsing city level values in the calculation.\n\nCities with the lowest performance on this metric have been plotted in the next bar chart. It really says something about city management when your renewable capacity is so low that you need over 120,000 years of it in a given year...","6f35494b":"### Collaboration by Emission Reduction Initiatives\n\nNext, we try to judge the similarity between city and corporate emission reduction strategies. For this, once we have grouped them by location, we calculate Word Mover's Distances (WMD) between each set of responses by a given city\/corporate pair. Word Mover's Distance uses pre-trained Word Embeddings to calculate a distance (or negative similarity) score between strings, where an exact match returns 0. For our model, we use Google's [pre-trained word embeddings](https:\/\/code.google.com\/archive\/p\/word2vec\/). The average WMD distance between a city-corporate pair is then subtracted from 5 to invert values such that a higher similarity results in a hgher SERO score.","29310033":"<h3 id=\"adaptation\">6.1.2 Adaptation<\/h3>\n\nOur next set of metrics looks at adaptation. In particular, how much motive exists for cities to adapt and in doing so what are the challenges they are likely to face.\n\n---\n<strong id=\"#metric2\"><em>Metric 2: Adaptation Incentive<\/em><\/strong>  \n_Motive for cities to adapt to climate change._\n<br><br>\n\n$\\begin{align} & Adaptation Incentive_{city} = \\sum_{i=1}^{climate Hazards}(Vulnerability_{i} + OpportunityPayoff_{i}), \\\\ \\\\\n  \\text{where } \\\\\n & OpportunityPayoff_{i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{action Type_{i}}(No Of Opportunites_{j} \\times {No Of Actions}_{j} \\times \\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^{actions_{j}} C_{k}}) \\\\ \\\\\n & (C = \\text{No. of Cobenefit Areas})\\end{align}$\n\n**Rationale**  \nWith cities responsible for [75% of global CO2 emissions](https:\/\/bit.ly\/3l9uM6Y), they are also the most prone to climate change, yet [no country is doing enough](https:\/\/cnn.it\/37dRFBg) to keep the earth\u2019s temperature from rising. While high levels of vulnerability require adaptation to be a necessity. However, the opportunities associated with adaption actions, such as clean energy initiatives, new revenue streams, efficient technologies, implementation of carbon taxes provide an even greater incentive for cities to adapt to the risks posed by climate change. \n\nAs such, _Adaptation Incentive,_ calculated as a sum of the vulnerability from each climate hazard, and the expected payoff from implementing adaptation actions that enable cities to realize identified opportunities, assigns a score to the combined incentive - from risks and opportunites - for cities to adapt. Cities with a greater number of opportunities that are directly tied to their adaptation efforts are more likely to score better on opportunity payoff. In addition to the ability to realize opportunities, the opportunity payoff also considers the number of additional cobenefits they are expected to provide.\n\n---\n\nTo analyse the responses to Question `6` of the 2020 Questionnaire, we do topic modelling using [LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation). This classifies the responses into a set of \"topics\", each identified by a group of keywords that are closely related to the content of the corresponding topic. The topics assigned by LDA can be visualized alongside the Opportunity Category from the questionnaire. This helps us find correlations between them, which, if they exist, validate our classifications.","035420ff":"We can now finally get around to calculating _Vulnerability._ In case of this case, again, the calculation is first done at the hazard level, and then aggregated at the city level. The minimum vulnerability to a hazard can only be 0 even if the level of preparedness is much higher than the exposure to that particular hazard.\n\nWe now visualize city _Vulnerability_ in the next two charts, first as the absolute value, and thereafter as it compares to _Climate Exposure._ In the second plot, the distance from the red diagonal represents the total **\"functional\" preparedness**, that is, the amount of preparedness that actually contributes to the vulnerability calculation.","ce067a36":"Given that a majority of these facilities are located in water stressed regions, we present a way for corporations to evaluate their water consumption.\n\n---\n<strong id=\"#metric11\"><em>Metric 11: Unsustainable Water Use<\/em><\/strong>  \n_Measure of water consumption from water-stressed regions and resources._\n<br><br>\n\n$$UnsustainableWaterUse_{riverBasins} = \\sum_{i=1}^{facilites}(WaterStressScore_{riverBasin_{i}} \\times \\log_{10}(1 + WaterConsumption_{i}))$$\n<br><br>\n$$UnsustainableWaterUse_{countries} = \\sum_{i=1}^{facilites}(WaterStressScore_{country_{i}} \\times \\log_{10}(1 + WaterConsumption_{i}))$$\n<br><br>\n\n**Rationale**\n_Unsustainable Water Use_ takes into consideration the water stress at the river basin and country level for each facility belonging to a corporation, and assigns a pair of scores to the company tied to their total consumption from all facilities. \n\n---\n\nThe water stress scores for the largest, most populous river basins, and for all of the countries are available on WRI as part of their [Aqueduct Country and River Basin Rankings](https:\/\/www.wri.org\/resources\/data-sets\/aqueduct-country-and-river-basin-rankings).

In all these cases, corporate actions such as GHG emissions, use of unclean fuels, and over consumption of water from stressed resources, are seen to disproportionately affect those who are already prone to worst affects of climate change. This makes it clear that climate change, in addition to being a health issue and an existential issue, is more importantly a social issue. It is a challenge that is extremely complex and does not have a one size fits all solution, but it's a challenge that can drive human innovation to create sustainable solutions.\n\nUsing the Questionnaire data, we start by looking at the ways cities are already collaborating with businesses in the city and then create metrics that encourage collaborative actions.","0d27d554":"\n\nMoreover, we can find the exact kinds of initiatives that perform best, by grouping on the category of the initiative.

But by itself, it may not give us the complete picture of a city's _Vulnerability_ to climate change. To calculate vulnerability, which is our aim, we need to be able to evaluate the preparedness of a city to meet the expected challenges.\n\nIn question `3.0` of the 2020 Cities Questionnaire, cities are asked for responses to the actions being taken to adapt. These actions are visualized in the following heatmap along with the specific climate hazards they help mitigate.\n\nThe Word Cloud ,thereafter, sheds light on the focus areas of city efforts by plotting keywords from their action descriptions. Right off, we see a good majority of the mentions happen to be about water-related risks. This is confirmed from the heatmap where we see water-related hazards such as rainstorms and various kinds of flooding are amongst the primary reasons for considering adaptation actions. This makes sense, as cyclones, rainstorms and flooding were ranked number 1 4, and 5 respectively, in terms of their expected _Climate Exposure_. Hazard number 2 and 3, by total exposure, were extreme hot days and heatwaves, both of which too feature strongly on the heatmap, implying the requisite actions being implemented.","a3db8b1e":"---\n***Metric 1(a): Climate Exposure***  \n_Total level of risk faced by cities due to long and short term impacts of climate change._\n<br><br>\n\n$$\\begin{align}&Exposure_{city} = \\sum_{i=1}^{hazards}((5 \\times CurrentMagnitude \\times CurrentProbability) + (TimeScale \\times FutureMagnitude \\times FutureIntensity \\times FutureFrequency)), \\\\ \\\\\n\\text{where } & TimeScale \\text{ is the expected time frame for changes in frequency and intensity of climate hazards}\\end{align}$$\n<br><br>\n\n**Rationale**  \nThe lack of comparability of different climate related risks between different cities creates a gap in comprehending the level of impact on a global level. Through _Climate Exposure,_ we assign a cumulative exposure score to **each climate hazard** faced by a city, thereby allowing comparisons of risk exposure at the intra as well as intercity levels. In the calculation, the multiplication of current risks with 5 assigns a greater weight to the existing risks. This is similar to how the TimeScale is used to weight future risks. In effect, this (sub)metric would itself allow National Governments to **focus resources** towards the specific risks and cities that are most exposed to climate change, **providing opportunities** for collaboration amongst cities facing similar problems. In addition, exposure plays a key role in measuring vulnerability, as we shall see now.\n\n---\n\nWith this metric we can now visualize and compare cities on their exposure.","278f0923":"### Collaboration by Shared Risks\n\nTo find the shared risks between cities and corporations, we return to the risk mapping we had used earlier in our vulnerability assessment for corporations. As a reminder, the mapping is between the climate change and water-related **physical risks** that corporations face and climate hazards and water security risks which cities are prone to. This can be used with the idea that corporations located in cities facing similar issues as them have a greater incentive to work together in tackling these problems.","daa8f260":"This shows us there exist strong incentives for the possibilities of city-corporate collaborations, allowing cities and corporations to tackle the challenges that affect both adversely. \n\nWith more stakeholders, cities have a greater responsibility towards making more positive changes, even so, collaboration efforts should not be limited to those between corporates and cities. Although in this section we do not explore business-business collaboration, the approaches discussed here for city-corporate collaboration might just as easily be applied to businesses looking to work together. \n\nWith the data showing issues like inequality of resources, inequality of climate exposure and health impacts, unequal consumption, and a lack of emphasis on social issues by corporates, there is an urgent need for finding ever more avenues for city-city and business-business collaborations. 21st-century issues like the \u201cInterwovenness of Climate Change and Inequality\u201d require collective action and mass mobilisation. Tackling this issue is the duty of every individual, government and organisation, making it essential for all of humanity to work together in creating a new future that is equitable and habitable. \n\n\n\n<h1 style=\"color: #FFFFFF\" id=\"#key-takeaways\">9 Key Takeaways<\/h1>\n\nWhen analysing the CDP Questionnaire we noticed sections to which we had no access. However, we believe the responses could be used to make more environment and economic centric metrics.\n- Questions C2.1a, C2.2a, C2.2b, C3.3a from the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire - Calculate liability from fines as a percentage of expected financial impact and use that to measure climate change insurance.\n- Section C11: Carbon pricing from the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire - Assess the effects of internal pricing on carbon emissions for corporates and measure carbon credits incentive.\n \n\n- These metrics act as a risk assessment toolkit, while also highlighting the recurring issue of inequality in various contexts, showing that vulnerable populations are the most prone to climate change, and poorer cities not equipped to make economic transitions to adapt.\n- The role of businesses has changed over the last decades. Businesses control the significant flow of resources, from food to oil. As a result, it is imperative to hold businesses accountable and engage them in solving the global climate crisis and related inequality issues.\n- The transition to sustainability lies in the ability to collaborate and uplift vulnerable populations, cities and businesses. Climate change is an opportunity to push human innovation and challenge the status quo. It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next.\n\nThank You!\n","6fc2e5a4":"With the mapping, we can now assess the contribution of the totality of adaptation actions towards realizing opportunities. This can be visualized as a simple count of the sum of opportunities for city actions.","e6be7118":"The data skews highly towards the USA simply because the responses are from companies located in the USA and Canada, and it is likely that most of the facilties will be located there too. However, we can still calculate the _mean Unsustainable Water Use_ score for each country to get an idea about how much an average facility located there might be impacting water resources. ","ea5823e6":"Unsuprisingly, we see that the poorer sections of society, along with the elderly, are the most at risk and therefore the most disadvantaged due to climate change.\n\nThe average exposure to services and assets gives us an idea as to where cities must focus their adaptation and resilience-building efforts. As per the reported data, it is seen that climate change is going to have big impacts on public services such as health and sanitation, and affect people where they live, possibly resulting in mass migrations due to resource scarcity or uninhabitable conditions - both also reasons that might impact the general health of people.\n\nThe following heatmap looks at climate exposure through the coorrelated between various social issues and vulnerable populations.  We again see the elderly and the poor are disproportionately affected with a majority of the social impacts. The heatmap also highlights, once again, that increased demand for public services is more likely with unchecked climate change, confirming it is going to be one of the key social issues hurting vulnerable populations.","8e012237":"The cumulative average score for the entire set of actions implemented by cities gives us some insight into the efficiency of cities at mitigating emissions. Here, we see how the top scoring cities compare with those that make up the tail end with respect to the _Mitigation Score._","64fb73f7":"However, the requirements of cities differ depending on their populations. To get a better understanding of this, we plot city renewable energy capacities alongside city populations, and we see that a majority of the cities having higher than average populations do not even match the _median_ levels of renewable energy capacity.","9911a433":"Now that we have all the components for the metric we can finally move on to calculating it.","0d14e681":"Positive steps taken by corporations to reduce their emissions can play a huge role in meeting the central aim of the Paris Agreement - limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees celcius this century.

A straightforward increase of renewable capacity to 40 MW results in annual emission reductions of approximately 200,000 metric tonnes for each city!\n\nThis shows that transition to Renewable Energy has the potential to equip cities with a wide range of opportunities that improve economic, social and environmental conditions. That being said, we must understand the reasons behind cities having low renewable energy. Lack of resources, funding, and technology, in poorer cities, results in them being unable install adequate renewable sources, and instead cities turn to cheap fuels to help with economic growth. But climate change is a global issue and such scenarios require a call for action where the developed countries, whose past emissions have led them to where they are, lend a hand in making renewable energy accessible and available for all. \n\nNext, let's look at the role of corporations in energy consumption.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"corporate-energy-consumption\">7.2.2 Corporate Energy Consumption<\/h3>\n\nAccess to energy is fundamental to improving the quality of life and is key for economic development. With the world's demand for electricity set to grow by 85 per cent by 2040 - this increase is more than today's total use of electricity in the USA, the European Union, China, Russia, Japan, Australia and India.[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/www.theworldcounts.com\/challenges\/climate-change\/energy\/global-electricity-consumption\/story) An important question we must ask is how much of this electricity use is absolutely necessary, and how much simply the result of availability and lack of awareness. This is because a unique kind of inequality plagues the world, called Energy Poverty, which is the lack of access to modern energy services. \n\nEnergy poor households experience inadequate levels of essential energy services due to a combination of reasons, such as high energy expenditure, low household incomes, inefficient buildings and appliances, and specific household energy needs. It is estimated that more than 50 million households in the European Union alone face Energy Poverty.[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/www.energypoverty.eu\/about\/what-energy-poverty)\n\nWith this section, we apply the inequality lens to understand the issue of corporate energy overconsumption and the impacts of their fuel use. We start with electricity consumption, and with the next two visualization understand the gap we are trying to address.","51904219":"_Climate Exposure_ also enables us to obtain a more comprehensive view of the broader implications of climate change. \n\nGrouped by the social issues that go hand in hand with climate risks, we see that all areas on average see a medium to high exposure, with Increased conflict and\/or crime seeing an average score close to the upper quartile of 137.","eb126510":"Since total exposure actually depends on the combined exposure for individual risks and hazards, we can compare the top 20 cities by their risk breakdowns.","946ae3db":"Similarly, we can find country-level _Unsustainable Water Use_ by scoring corporation water use by the country\/region they operate in. The scores for the top 20 companies for any single region are presented below. ","64ac8a7a":"There is a significant correlation between the impact of organizations on the environment, and the liability they face due to climate risk. Moreover, we see there is absolutely no association between Environmental Cost and Revenue\/Income, which tells us that that there are cleaner, more profitable, ways to seek high returns for shareholders.\n\nNext, we map the primary climate-related **physical risk** drivers for organizations with natural hazards (faced by cities) wherever there is a high degree of overlap or relatedness in their underlying cause. This enables us to look at the coexisting social issues corresponding to the climate risks companies face. The mapping also includes the physical risks listed in the Water Security Questionnaire, but these will be used in a later section.","33fbb3b6":"The following visualization shows us that a significant proportion of the cities responding to the 2020 Cities Questionnaire face immediate risks from various Medium to High magnitude climate hazards. Proving it's essential that cities keep track, over time, of the various risks they face and moreover, continuously assess their exact level of exposure to each of them. Keeping this in mind to obtain the Vulnerability metric, we start with first calculating the _Climate Exposure_ and city _Preparedness_ below.","668044b0":"Just like we saw in the Emissions section, the top culprits are corporations utilizing large quantities of fossil-fuels for energy generation and transportation.\n\n___\n\nWith nearly a billion people still without access to electricity in the developing world, the sheer scale of corporate energy consumption makes them come off as extremely complicit. Meanwhile, in energy poor areas, besides the obvious hardships, the use of dirty or polluting fuels has serious consequences on people\u2019s health and wellbeing by exacerbating respiratory and cardiac illnesses, and mental health issues.\n\nFurther, by calculating _Deaths by Fuel Use,_ we discover the magnitude of corporate impact on people's lives due large scale corporate fossil-fuel consumption. The number of people affected by the activities of corporations such as Vistra Corp., Duke Energy and American Electric Power Company, shows the toxic nature of the corporations that value profits over life. \n\nIn view of all of this, we advocate that corporations need to take yet more notice of the extended consequences of their actions, and take steps to address the energy access problem. This is not only the right thing to do, but also opens doors to opportunities. For example, The World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation (IFC) recently estimated the market size for modern energy services at US$37 billion \u2013 roughly equivalent to the amount those without access today spend on kerosene for lighting and biomass for cooking. In addition to the direct revenue opportunities providing access to energy bring, the domino effects - namely broader economic and socio-economic development - can lead to yet more opportunities.[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/accntu.re\/33rApI0)\n\n\n<h2 id=\"water-risks\">7.3 Water Risks<\/h2>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/750x\/0d\/fd\/51\/0dfd512f7fb956eacbdf20afefe147ce.jpg\">\n\nIllustration by [Sebastien Thibault](https:\/\/www.behance.net\/sebastienthibault)\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-costs-of-electricity\">7.3.1 Hidden Water Costs of Electricity<\/h3>\n\nThere have been numerous reports in the past year that talk about the depleting water sources, rising droughts and future water shortages to be faced by the world.

Their approach and calculations for the factor score are described in [Guidance for Calculating Water Use Embedded in Purchased Electricity](https:\/\/www.wri.org\/publication\/guidance-calculating-water-use-embedded-purchased-electricity). Since CDP has provided response data only for organizations in the USA and Canada, water consumption factor values for these 2 countries are all that we will need. These are displayed in the table given below.","f048fad0":"The heatmap confirms the existence of correlations. Looking at the topic keywords we find that not only are they closely matching the opportunity categories, which was to be expected, but they also hint at the underlying actions that go hand in hand with these opportunities.

However, there exists a need for an indicator to evaluate the actual _performance_ of each action. The _Lifetime Mitigation Score_ provides a methodology for evaluating emission reduction actions over their lifetimes based on the direct and indirect reduction in emissions. It is, therefore, to be used to judge the lifetime viability and utility of actions, and the dedication of cities in battling their climate concerns.\n\n---\nThe indirect reduction is calculated from energy savings\/generation data - by approximating the amount of CO2e emissions that would otherwise take place if the specified mitigation action is not implemented. This figure is found (using the [EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator](https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/energy\/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator)) to be 0.707 metric tonnes of CO2e per MWh of energy generation.","5dbaa6c6":"To use the water factor values, we must once again create a mapping between the dataset and the responses. Although all fuels from the CDP Questionnaire are not listed in the water factor dataset, we can make some assumptions in order to map them to the most similar fuels.\n\nFor example, Bituminous and Subbituminous coal have similar calorific content compared to Hard Coal (Anthracite), and hence, would result in a similar water consumption factor.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/21\/Coal_Rank_USGS.png\/1024px-Coal_Rank_USGS.png\" alt=\"Coal Caloric Value\" width=\"400\"\/>\n\n<br><br>\n\nIn some of the other cases, we map high-grade derivatives of a fuel to the fuel itself (Natural Gas) with the assumption that derivatives would, in general, have a higher water factor than the raw fuel.

Our key findings related to these issues are as follows:\n- Most cities face medium to high levels of climate exposure, resulting in effects that will be felt universally, however, the poorest and elderly populations will see a disproportionate amount of the impact directed towards them.\n- These impacts will lead to significant increases in crime and conflict, and fluctuating socioeconomic conditions. These will be closely related to increases in demand for resources.\n- Climate change will also play a significant role in aggravating health issues, particularly for those already vulnerable, which will put additional stress on and disrupt healthcare services due to increasing demands.\n- Cities facing high levels of exposure can adopt relevant adaptation actions to build resilience to battle climate risks. However, a number of cities face serious shortages of resources  which may seriously hamper their ability to adapt.\n- Cities can be incentivized to adopt early adaptation efforts by identifying parallel opportunities for social and economic benefit.\n- A number of cities face serious shortages of resources which may seriously hamper their ability to adapt.\n- There is a bilateral relationship between the impact corporations have on the environment, and the level of financial liability they face from climate change. Further, there is a correlation between the climate risks they face and the broader social issues that co-occur with these risks.\n- There is a noticeable lack of questions addressing the social issues related to, and arising from, climate change in the CDP Corporations Climate Change Questionnaire.\n- There are strong positive correlations between emissions and GDP, but also more developed cities find it easier to implement emission reduction actions - highlighting how they should take a leading role in tackling Global Warming.\n- Corporations in the Fossil Fuel\/Energy and Transportation industries contribute inordinately towards GHG emissions, due to which they have a greater potential of reducing emissions.\n- There is currently a divide between the developed and developing world in the amount of energy generated from renewable sources. Due to unequal conditions, poorer cities may find it difficult to install sufficient sources of renewable energy to balance out their use of unclean fuels, and thereby have to depend even more on fossil fuels.\n- A small proportion of all corporations, such as those in the manufacturing and materials industries consume much higher proportions of electricity than others, shedding light on the disparity in available resources in electricity poor parts of the world.\n- Corporate fuel use is a direct cause of adverse effects on human health, and can be connected to deaths due to air pollution and accidents in low visibility conditions. \n- Electricity generation for corporate use results in significant amounts of water consumption. Corporations, especially those part of the energy sector, must pay special attention to this to avoid worsening water related issues.\n- A significant number of corporate facilities source their water from resources that are water-stressed or located in water-stressed regions, worsening the problems related to water-scarcity.\n- The existence of shared opportunities and risks between cities and corporations presents added incentives for the two to work together in solving key climate issues.\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">KPI Summary Table<\/h2>","3ae67a86":"---\nMitigation of climate change is a crucial step for cities to prosper, but on viewing cities that perform best on their mitigation actions, we notice how developed cities score better.

Applying metrics such as the Lifetime Mitigation and Reduction Initiative scores allows both, cities and corporations, to assess their emission reduction strategies and thereby enable themselves to better counteract the social affects of global warming.\n\n---\n\n<h2 id=\"energy\">7.2 Energy<\/h2>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/media\/00599b646cc4bf49445f1c8cc2ceb886109cd291\/0_0_2560_1536\/master\/2560.jpg?width=1020&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e257bb67e7de4462155ae2e654d98c06\" width=800><br>\n\nIllustration by [Sebastien Thibault](https:\/\/www.behance.net\/sebastienthibault)\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"renewable-energy\">7.2.1 Renewable Energy<\/h3>\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that the energy sector plays an important role in the severity of climate change due to high levels of GHG emissions. Using more renewable energy can lower the prices of and demand for natural gas and coal by increasing competition and diversifying our energy supplies.[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/www.ucsusa.org\/resources\/benefits-renewable-energy-use)\n\nOver the last few years, the greater levels of awareness, cheaper technologies, and concerns regarding our fast heating planet, have resulted in an increasing shift towards renewables. Plotting the data reported by cities provides an idea about the distribution of renewable energy around the world. It is seen that renewable energy capacity is directly correlated with the level of development of the city, existing in orders of magnitude higher quantities in cities in the more developed nations\/continents. This intra-city level inequality shows how developing countries will suffer strong climate change impacts due to the lack of technological advances required to increase their transition efforts resilience.","3aa6cc75":"On calculating _Adaptability,_ we see there exists a massive divide between the top 20 and bottom 20 cities in terms of how easy it may be for them to adapt. The table following the bar chart attempts to shed some light on the reason for this divide, and we see just how important the different components of _Adaptability_ are, in order for a city to score highly.","510be99a":"It can be seen that large swathes of the world are facing high levels of water stress, and barring Central Africa and parts of South America, all continents have above-median baseline water stress scores. These scores will be used as weights for calculating each facilities' contribution towards the corporation's _Unsustainable Water Consumption,_ but to use the water stress data, we must, once again, create a mapping between the river basins in the dataset and those provided in the CDP Questionnaire. The mapping will allow us to directly associate facilities to their corresponding river basin's baseline stress scores as provided in the Aqueduct data.","17d59512":"---\nThe visualisations and metrics discussed so far are a starting point for vulnerability assessment, and establish a thorough understanding of the impacts of climate change, and the needed governance. They work to expose the key issues of inequality in terms of the high climate exposure on the poor and elderly. The data further calls attention to the many risks that are often ignored, like the future strain expected on health and sanitation, law and order, food availability, education etc. \n\nThe root-level analysis undertaken to calculate _Vulnerability,_ shows the ambitious attempts of highly exposed cities to build resilience against climate hazards, and thus, their commitment towards protecting their populations. Next, we develop a methodology to determine how climate action leads to environmental and social opportunities, for example, Real-time risk monitoring (adaptation action) resulting in Development of climate change resiliency projects (opportunity), and how this opportunity payoff may provide further motivation for cities to implement forward looking adaptation actions.\n\nFinally, we assess the ability of a city to build resilience by mobilizing the economic and professional potential of its citizens. This results in bringing out the vast divide between the top and bottom cities in their ability to adapt.  \n\n\n<h2 id=\"corporate-vulnerability\">1.2 Corporate Vulnerability<\/h2>\n\nClimate change is a universal problem and its repercussions will be felt by many businesses. The issue has pushed many companies to start disclosing data on their climate change related financial impact, and in 2018, CDP measured these losses to be equivalent to $1 trillion. Many of these financial impacts are expected to materialize within the next five years.[<sup>[Link]<\/sup>](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/06\/04\/climate\/companies-climate-change-financial-impact.html) The warming planet has made it clear that business as usual is no longer a feasible option in the long term and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Solving this problem involves getting to the root of it, and that requires us to adopt a systems approach to dealing with complex interrelationships between entities and objectives, causes and effects.\n\nWith our next metric, we aim to shed light on some of these relationships by quantifying the financial and strategic impact of climate change on corporations and comparing it with their impact on the environment and people. Finally we establish a way for CDP to find relevant social issues for corporations to address.\n\n\n---\n<strong id=\"#metric4\"><em>Metric 4: Climate Liability<\/em><\/strong>  \n_A measure of the total risk to corporations from aggregated financial and strategic impacts of climate change._\n<br><br>\n\n$$\\begin{align} & ClimateLiability_{org} = \\sum_{i=1}^{risks}(LiabilityFactor_{i} \\times TotalCost_{i}), \\\\ \\text{where } \\\\ & LiabilityFactor_{i} = Magnitude_{i} \\times Likelihood_{i} \\times Timeframe_{i} \\end{align}$$\n\n**Rationale**  \nThe risks from climate change run deeper than a simple dollar value of the total financial impacts incurred. Alongside these, various other factors such as indirect consequences on employees and stakeholders, changes in markets and preferences of customers, and effects on the social community at large must also be considered, as these in turn affect business operations. In view of this, we present a metric that, in addition to the financial impacts, uses the company's self assessment of the magnitude, likelihood and timeframe of expected climate risks, and scores the total liability to the company in terms of the extended, indirect issues.\n\n---\nThe total cost related to a climate risk is calculated as a sum of the cost of response and the direct financial impact. We then calculate liability for each risk, and aggregate values for all risks to find total _Climate Liability._","94ea6d1a":"By filtering for common location, and applying the risk mapping to match corporates with cities, we can measure the number of shared risks.","32b73b18":"So the responses to this question provide an accurate representation of the relevant mitigative actions taken by cities to prepare for climate impact. But how would we use that to calculate _preparedness?_\n\n---\n***Metric 1(b): Preparedness***  \n_The resiliency of cities, from the sum of adaptative actions being implemented, towards the climate hazards they are exposed to._ \n<br><br>\n\n$\\begin{align} & Preparedness_{city} = \\sum_{i=1}^{actions}{Progress * FundingStatus * \\sqrt{C}}, \\\\ \n& \\text{where } C = \\text{No. of Cobenefit Areas} \\end{align}$\n<br><br>\n\n**Rationale**  \nAs mentioned above, it is imperative to gain insight into the degree of preparedness with respect to tackling climate change. Adaptation actions being implemented contribute towards a city's resiliency and provide an estimate of the cities' engagement towards mitigating climate risk. In our calculation, we assume that each action contributes as a weighted sum towards total city preparedness based on how far along it is in terms of progress, acquiring funding, and the number of additional co-benefits it might offer. _Preparedness_ too, like _Climate Exposure,_ may be calculated at the hazard level allowing cities to determine whether they are sufficiently equipped to battle the risks from particular climate events.\n\n---","0ffe67be":"1.

These include the densely populated cities in the developing world, but also highly industrialized cities in more developed nations. We can see this in the map below. Moreover, there is a strong positive correaltion between city GDP and total emissions, as seen in the scatter plot below for cities in the OECD nations.","9662e9ad":"It must be noted that these results are somewhat incomplete.

Moreover, it could be applied to calculate hidden water costs for organization facilities located near stressed water resources and generating their own electricity.
