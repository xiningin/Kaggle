Note that the `boxplot()` function detects outliers (called \"fliers\") and does not include them within the whiskers. Specifically, if the lower quartile is $Q_1$ and the upper quartile is $Q_3$, then the interquartile range $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$ (this is the box's height), and any score lower than $Q_1 - 1.5 \\times IQR$ is a flier, and so is any score greater than $Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR$.","8150befc":"# Multioutput classification","e1cc08b5":"Okay, the **Age**, **Cabin** and **Embarked** attributes are sometimes null (less than 891 non-null), especially the **Cabin** (77% are null). We will ignore the **Cabin** for now and focus on the rest. The **Age** attribute has about 19% null values, so we will need to decide what to do with them.

Some reached 100%, but since you can easily find the [list of victims](https:\/\/www.encyclopedia-titanica.org\/titanic-victims\/) of the Titanic, it seems likely that there was little Machine Learning involved in their performance! ;-) So let's try to build a model that reaches 80% accuracy.","19e1dab8":"Let's get more info to see how much data is missing:","e79b650f":"**Warning**: this output (and many others in this notebook and other notebooks) may differ slightly from those in the book. Don't worry, that's okay! There are several reasons for this:\n* first, Scikit-Learn and other libraries evolve, and algorithms get tweaked a bit, which may change the exact result you get. If you use the latest Scikit-Learn version (and in general, you really should), you probably won't be using the exact same version I used when I wrote the book or this notebook, hence the difference. I try to keep this notebook reasonably up to date, but I can't change the numbers on the pages in your copy of the book.\n* second, many training algorithms are stochastic, meaning they rely on randomness. In principle, it's possible to get consistent outputs from a random number generator by setting the seed from which it generates the pseudo-random numbers (which is why you will see `random_state=42` or `np.random.seed(42)` pretty often). However, sometimes this does not suffice due to the other factors listed here.\n* third, if the training algorithm runs across multiple threads (as do some algorithms implemented in C) or across multiple processes (e.g., when using the `n_jobs` argument), then the precise order in which operations will run is not always guaranteed, and thus the exact result may vary slightly.\n* lastly, other things may prevent perfect reproducibility, such as Python dicts and sets whose order is not guaranteed to be stable across sessions, or the order of files in a directory which is also not guaranteed.","9f0490fe":"We are now ready to train our first spam classifier!
