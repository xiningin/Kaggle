As a rule of thumb, it is usually better to compare data by using a bar chart.  \n\nIn the example above, **women**, **1st class** and **2nd class** looks very similar in size, and without the percentage explicitly written, it would difficult to tell the difference.  \n\n## Doughnut chart\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/d365b4e7-0e08-49f6-b387-3a26e37dde3b\/donut.png\"\/>  \nThis is a pie chart with the centre cut out, but it has many advantages over a pie chart for the following reasons  \n* It is more accurate depiction because it focuses on the arc and circle circumference\n* It is a cleaner data and more readable\n* It is more space efficient as you can use the centre for adding more information\n\n\n## Pyramid chart\nIn order to display a simple hierarchy, use a pyramid chart. It stacks data on top of each other, from least to most or vice versa.  \n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/ed6d97fa-ad4e-4fe1-9e14-681281ca555e\/javascriptpyramidchart.png\"\/>\n\n## Treemap chart\nIt compares a lot of data by using nested rectangles.     \n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/0e4c8920-8fa7-4cc1-b2e4-13bbfebea925\/treemap.png\"\/>  \nThe sizes of each rectangle indicate the relative size of each data, hence it's easy to spot patterns in treemap charts.      \n\n\n## Funnel chart\nIt is used to compare the different stages, usually sales and identify the numbers.   \n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/45dc376d-783f-4a52-9caf-f38f5cceed44\/funnel_chart_1.jpg\"\/>   \nIt shows an increasing amount where the initial stage is always bigger than the next stage, and the first stage will be 100%.  \nIt is like stacking bar charts on top of each other.   \nFor example, to compare the number of people who viewed the apps, the number of people who downloaded it and finally the number of people who are using it.      \nAs shown above, we start with the number of conversation with sales reps(100%), to finally the total number of sales.   \n\n[Top](#0)","1bea13ea":"<hr\/>","bd5095f4":"<hr\/>","be034ec8":"<hr\/>","8650f683":"<a id=5><\/a>\n# Gauging Performance\n## Linear and Circular gauge\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/398d10db-0a18-47d0-8ac1-3578851d3910\/thermometerstylechartexcel2010ingauges.jpg\"\/>  \nThis is used when a data indicates something like speed, height, electricity, temperature etc.\nThermometer and Odometer are excellent examples of **Linear** and **Circular gauge** respectively.\n\n\n## Bullet Chart\nThis is a variation of a bar graph, but it contains more information like\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/52fef9e8-811a-45cd-911c-29d2cb94ee03\/Bullet_graphs_multiple.png\"\/>  \n1.

For example, the heart rate of people in 20s have heart rate of 71$\\pm$3\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/a6de2e0e-d237-49a9-a546-09cc513265a6\/phperrorchartsgraphs.png\"\/>\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/2c4b9961-da6d-477e-93d0-b93be35f7a97\/phperrorlinechartsgraphs.png\"\/>\n\n## Heatmap\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/2a80e0d8-0f72-415d-9ef2-196a96a7149e\/heatmap1140.jpg\"\/>  \nIt is used to compare two large or complex dataset and make it very easy to visualizes their relationships. You can use it as a gradient to indicate things like severity, correlation, concentration etc.\n\n\n## Range (Diverging) Chart\nIt is used when the ranges are important, and you want to focus on the outermost values. It's basically stacking of bar charts\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/372f1dca-5061-4359-8055-f732459ffeb3\/jsprangebarchartsgraphs.png\"\/>\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/8a7f27db-eda2-4d41-8355-de81a27fc172\/rangechartsdivergingbarchart.png\"\/>\n\n## Polar Chart\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/c79a0e3b-f366-492e-8883-b808c13c7d11\/stackrose_g.png\"\/>  \nAlso called: Coxcomb chart, Rose chart, Polar Area Chart.    \nThe Polar Area chart is similar to the usual pie chart. It measures data based on angles and how long it extends from the centre. It is for data which are best represented by angles.\nThis chart above is used to show both the wind direction and speed accurately.\n\n[Top](#0)","98916d6a":"<hr\/>","b5ddab1e":"<a id=0><\/a>\n# Table of contents\n1.

However, in order to compare multiple data over a duration, we will need to use **line chart**.\n\n\n## Spline Chart\nBasically line chart with points, perhaps to highlight somethings like the peak, nadir, important date etc.\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/79ad24f6-9933-4472-8f9b-2a2fd790ce37\/spline_charts.gif\"\/>\n\n## Area Chart\nIt is based on line-charts; in fact, line charts can be converted into area charts and vice versa.\nOverlapping data are indicated by using adjusting transparency.    \n### Choosing between Line and Area chart.\n1. When there are **more than two** overlapping data, you should use line chart. The more the data, the harder it is to show in area chart.\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/a6c4a5cf-d2a7-4bfb-b066-189bdd4138a1\/US_and_USSR_nuclear_stockpilessvg.png\"\/>\n2. When you have a **part to whole data**, you should use area chart.\n<img style=\"max-height: 300px\" src=\"https:\/\/ucarecdn.com\/a12bfb09-6340-47ff-8ec1-b6265bf71f81\/areacharthotelssample.png\"\/>\n3.

We could also stack all these variables on top of each other in a stacked bar chart if we are to treat them as part of a whole.\n\n[Top](#0)","24421237":"<a id=6><\/a>\n # Project data\n ## Gantt Chart\n This is used to monitor progress and illustrate the schedule of a project.
