Repeat this process, increasing the k, and see which k is the best for your model.\n\nWe can calucalte the accuracy of KNN for different Ks.","018847c0":"#### Plot  model accuracy  for Different number of Neighbors ","d0820d84":"Checking to see if there are any Null or NaN values in our dataframe.

Doing a train and test on the same dataset will most likely have low out-of-sample accuracy, due to the likelihood of being over-fit.\n\nIt is important that our models have a high, out-of-sample accuracy, because the purpose of any model, of course, is to make correct predictions on unknown data. So how can we improve out-of-sample accuracy? One way is to use an evaluation approach called Train\/Test Split.\nTrain\/Test Split involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are mutually exclusive. After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set. \n\nThis will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that have been used to train the data. It is more realistic for real world problems.\n","1509eada":"<h3> INTRODUCTION <\/h3>\nIn this Kernel, I will have a look at Exploratory Data Analysis of Breast Cancer dataset.\nI'll use a popular machine learning algorithm for classification,called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). \nI'm going to use this classification algorithm to build a model based on the data from patients and corresponding tumor data.\nAfter training data, Im going to predict the class of unknown data,using this trained model, to find if the tumor is M = malignant or B = benign.\n\nThis Kernel is mainly build for those who are new to **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning**.
