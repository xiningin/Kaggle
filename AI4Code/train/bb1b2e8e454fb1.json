A majority of them are married with at least one child. \n* **What are their spending habits?**\n\nOur customers spend the most on meat and wine products. Those without children seem to spend more on average than those without children. It seems as if the highest spending customers prefer to shop in stores rather than online or from the catalog.\n* **How can this analysis help our company's marketing campaign?**\n\nThrough this analysis we can better understand the spending habits and demographics of our customers. An area to focus on for marketing could include advertizing the wine products with a focus on single \/ unmarried customers. Another focus could be on discouts and deals though the online store, since it seems like those who spend the least on products vist the website the most frequently.

Now what about the age of our customers?","3604456e":"Lets visualize the number of website visits in the past month from each cluster.","0fd06abe":"# Introduction\n\nThis notebook serves as an exploritory data analysis (EDA) on the *customer-personality-analysis* dataset. The project task for this dataset is to preform clustering to summarize and understand customer segments and behavior. \n\nThe clustering technique used in this EDA can be found here https:\/\/thecleverprogrammer.com\/2021\/02\/08\/customer-personality-analysis-with-python\/\n\nAll other analysis on this dataset are my own.\n\nPlease feel free to provide sugesstions and comments on this notebook below!","756cc4a7":"We will do the same for the *Catalog* and *Store* columns","21131db1":"Lets look at more spending habits of our customers.","ce9c9140":"seems as if our missing values are only in the *Income* column. This could correspond to customers with no income so imputation would not make sense here. This dataset is large enough where we can omit these rows.","87c5e41c":"We seem to have some users that are extremely old, the oldest customer is 128 years old! This data might be incorrect. Lets take a closer look.","f06e9b29":"# Analysis\n\nLets begin to vizualize our data. We will start with the *Education* feature.","1f795b39":"Next we will want to get a better idea of the ages of our customers. We do not currently have an *Age* column in our dataframe so lets create one using the *Year_Birth* feature.","6c557be8":"Seems like we have a larger number of unique values for this column. Some of these values are similar in definition so lets group them togheter to make our analysis easier.","bb53f77b":"Finally, lets rename some of our column names.","40803b70":"note: a futher breakdown of this method of clustering is provided here https:\/\/thecleverprogrammer.com\/2021\/02\/08\/customer-personality-analysis-with-python\/","414906b6":"The age of our customers varies over a wide range. However it seems like most of our customers are middle aged (40-60 years). ","5fa6ea8f":"Looking at a breakdown of our clusters and their features.","bdf4b5f1":"Next lets create some new features in our dataframe. The first being a total sum of all the spending for each customer titled *Spending*. We will also create another feature that includes the number of months each customer has been with the company. This will allow us to cluster the customers in groups of new and old as well as big and small spenders."}}
