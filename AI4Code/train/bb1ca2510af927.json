Titanic was a passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her first voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US. The sinking of Titanic caused the deaths of 1,502 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. Titanic was the largest ship at the time and was called 'the unsinkable'. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n\nAfter leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm (ship's time; GMT\u22123). The glancing collision caused Titanic's hull plates to buckle inwards in a number of locations on her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea. Over the next two and a half hours, the ship gradually filled with water and sank. Passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partly filled. A disproportionate number of men -- over 90% of those in Second Class -- were left aboard due to a \"women and children first\" protocol followed by the officers loading the lifeboats. Just before 2:20 am Titanic broke up and sank bow-first with over a thousand people still on board. Those in the water died within minutes from hypothermia caused by immersion in the freezing ocean. The 710 survivors were taken aboard from the lifeboats by RMS Carpathia a few hours later.\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.","9fe05e26":"## About This Dataset\n***\nSource: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/titanic\n\n**Overview: The data has been split into two groups:**\n\ntraining set (train.csv) test set (test.csv) The training set should be used to build machine learning models. For the training set, the outcome is included (also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d) for each passenger. My model will be based on \u201cfeatures\u201d like passengers\u2019 gender and class.\n\nThe test set should be used to see how well my model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. For each passenger in the test set, use the model to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n\ngender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.\n\nData Dictionary Variable\tDefinition\tKey survival\tSurvival\t0 = No, 1 = Yes pclass\tTicket class\t1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd sex\tSex Age Age in years sibsp\t# of siblings \/ spouses aboard the Titanic parch\t# of parents \/ children aboard the Titanic ticket\tTicket number fare\tPassenger fare cabin\tCabin number embarked\tPort of Embarkation\tC = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton Variable Notes pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES) 1st = Upper 2nd = Middle 3rd = Lower\n\nage: Age is fractional if less than 1.
