Android app dev also seems very popular. It is also surprising to see more Game Dev and Unity jobs compared to Javascript and React etc.","d2f27e14":"The word cloud shows the top 50 keywords. Telecom, Business\/BI and Marketing domains seem common. Jobs requiring mobile app developers to work on AI were also found.  ","22de5c9f":"Islamabad has more DS\/AI jobs as compared to Lahore, unlike general software development and the difference between Islamabad\/Lahore and Karachi is even larger. Finding posts from Swat was also a bit surprising.","751dabaf":"The companies with most DS\/AI jobs are also new and a bit surprising for me as I've done considerable research on local DS\/AI companies. I only knew about three of them. However there are only 1 or 2 job posts from these companies and the results might have been different if the dataset was larget and more representative.","55073c5c":"Software Development and Data Science\/AI\/ML jobs are being filtered about by looking for some keywords, at least one of which is very likely to be in all relevant job descriptions.\nThere are many irrelevant jobs mistakenly placed in the department, which are also being filtered out.","1831d5ff":"It can be observed that there were only 32 Data Science\/AI\/ML jobs which is only 1.5 % of 2096, the number of Software Development jobs. However I personally come across a lot of DS\/AI\/ML jobs and the dataset is probably not focused on good platforms for such jobs, and CS\/IT jobs in general. Still it's true that those jobs are currently a small fraction of all CS\/IT jobs. ","9f9de3f2":"It can be observed that most jobs are for 1-2 years experience, however jobs for fresh graduates are not much lower than that. Jobs for > 2 years experience decline."}}
