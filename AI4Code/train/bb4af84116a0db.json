rainy season hits \u2013 local disaster planning will be key, by Lee Miles\n\nThe government of Sierra Leone called a state of emergency on March 25, seven days before the first case of COVID-19 was even confirmed. The virus has spread steadily since then, with 1,272 cases confirmed and 51 deaths as of June 19.\n\nAt the same time, the country has begun the rapid countdown to the full onset of the annual rainy season, which raises challenges of its own, especially for the flood-prone local communities in the capital, Freetown. In mid-2019, Freetown and other major Sierra Leonean cities were engulfed in major flooding. Before this, in 2017, more than 1,000 people died in major mudslides in the capital.\nhttps:\/\/theconversation.com\/sierra-leone-faces-coronavirus-as-rainy-season-hits-local-disaster-planning-will-be-key-139604","9fa903ac":"#What Sierra Leone\u2019s Ebola experience can teach us about COVID-19, by Clare Ahern  06 may, 2020\n\nFor many of us around the globe, COVID-19 is our first experience of an epidemic of any kind, let alone a pandemic. For the people of Sierra Leone, there is an eerie familiarity to what is unfolding in their country. But how will their experience of the Ebola virus shape their response to this crisis?\n\nIn May 2014, an outbreak of Ebola that originated in Guinea made its way across the border into Sierra Leone. It marked the start of an epidemic that would take almost two full years to be officially declared over. Just shy of 4,000 people lost their lives to the deadly virus in that time.\n\nWhile this Coronavirus is very different to Ebola, many of the response strategies \u2013 quarantine, school closures, safe burials \u2013 are all too familiar to the people of Sierra Leone. What the rest of the world is only just grappling with now, Sierra Leoneans have already learnt the hard way.https:\/\/www.concern.net\/news\/sierra-leone-ebola-covid19","2fa0d6af":"#Health System\n\nIn some ways, Ebola has helped to improve the health system in Sierra Leone, as the number of health centres in remote locations has increased considerably. However, with no ventilators reaching those locations, their effectiveness in the fight against COVID-19 will be questionable. Where they could make an impact is in helping to reduce the number of secondary deaths that come with a health crisis such as this one.\n\n#School Closures\n\nDuring the Ebola crisis, schools were closed for eight months, resulting in an entire lost year of schooling.  It is a year of schooling that children can ill afford to lose. At the time, we supported the government to implement a remote learning programme, using radio to deliver lessons to school children stuck at home. It was a successful strategy that helped to bridge the gap in schooling and it is one that we are thankfully in a position to lend our support to once more.\nSierra Leone had a huge spike in teenage pregnancy during Ebola,since people stay indoors more time.https:\/\/www.concern.net\/news\/sierra-leone-ebola-covid19","9c7c0ed9":"In recent years, there has been a strong focus among those who plan for disasters to build more robust forms of resilience in local communities. Not least in Sierra Leone, where \u2013 like most of Africa \u2013 disaster management relies heavily on local volunteers and traditional forms of community leadership.\n\nAcross Africa, there are many poverty-stricken slums and informal settlements. These are vulnerable to natural hazards such as flooding, suffer from overcrowding, and often lack running water and electricity.\n\nAs past experiences of Ebola in west Africa demonstrated, it\u2019s also important to focus on the local communities. Poor handling of pandemics and other natural disasters by national governments and international institutions can lead to resistance, inertia and non-compliance among communities and influential community leaders. In the case of the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, there were many instances where local communities did not trust or were slow to heed advice that ultimately delayed responses to the disease and ended up costing further lives. https:\/\/theconversation.com\/sierra-leone-faces-coronavirus-as-rainy-season-hits-local-disaster-planning-will-be-key-139604","ed5a168a":"#Handwashing\n\nOne of the few positive legacies of the Ebola outbreak is the proliferation of public handwashing in Sierra Leone, as it became one of the most visible features of the battle to contain the virus.\n\nPeople are used to washing their hands before they enter a building. They are very aware of the necessity of hand hygiene. However, not everyone has the supplies to practice it properly.\n\nThey are addressing this by setting up hand-washing stations at strategic locations like transport stations, petrol stations and markets. These consist of large buckets, soap and water tanks. But it\u2019s not just the material items that are in short supply.\n\nIn urban centres in Sierra Leone, such as the capital city, Freetown, most people pay for their water. Running water is scarce. 2.9 million people don't have access to it in their homes. So those who can afford, pay for it. However, not everyone can afford to, so their team is providing rainwater harvesting tanks to increase the supply of water. https:\/\/www.concern.net\/news\/sierra-leone-ebola-covid19","9574ba2a":"#Climate threat\n\nSecond, the practical, discernible impacts of climate change mean that many local communities are already facing worsening dry seasons with increased fires and droughts, followed by more unpredictable and erratic rainy seasons. Cities in west Africa, such as Accra in Ghana or Freetown in Sierra Leone, or central African cities such as Yaounde in Cameroon, now endure almost annual experiences of flash flooding and landslides that threaten to overwhelm poverty-stricken communities.\n\nThere is a growing paradox of frequency here. Local disaster managers and volunteers must meet public expectations to handle ever more frequent disaster. But they also recognise there is very little real time to build this local knowledge and review capacity before the onset of the next deluge, flood or fire. https:\/\/theconversation.com\/sierra-leone-faces-coronavirus-as-rainy-season-hits-local-disaster-planning-will-be-key-139604","f9f5ffb2":"#Traditional practices\n\nOne of the barriers to building trust during the Ebola outbreak was that some of the messages being shared came into direct conflict with the traditional beliefs and practices of many Sierra Leoneans.\n\nOne example of this is the popularity of traditional healers. Rather than attending a hospital or health centre, people would go to see traditional healers when they fell ill. This meant they didn\u2019t receive the medical attention they desperately needed and the likelihood that they would spread the virus increased. So, they began to reach out to traditional healers, asking them to change their practices and refer people to medical facilities instead.\n\nThis was not an easy process. \u201cAt the start, it was difficult for the healers, because that was their only means of making a living. So telling them to stop their usual practice, it was not easy. But later with education and constant training, they were able to stop their practice. When they themselves started becoming infected, that scared them, so they stopped immediately.\u201d \n\nThose hard-won relationships with the traditional healers have been maintained in order to tackle malaria and other diseases. They have since become vocal health advocates in their communities, and are in the perfect position to convey the right messages about COVID-19.\nhttps:\/\/www.concern.net\/news\/sierra-leone-ebola-covid19","07d2e753":"#Local coronavirus awareness raising in Funkia Market, Sierra Leone.

A major issue in tackling the outbreak was the spread of misinformation and a lack of trust in the authorities and organisations who were heading up the response.\n\n#Getting the message out\n\nA major focus of the response to Ebola was helping to get the right messages out there. These messages were going to save people\u2019s lives, and ultimately help to bring an end to the outbreak, so they did this using all available means. They produced and shared educational materials such as leaflets and posters, and they produced radio ads to ensure the message was received far and wide.\n\nThey also trained staff and health volunteers to share those messages within their communities. The fact that the information was coming from trusted community members made a huge difference. Gradually, strategies like this began to work.\n\nTheir team\u2019s expertise and experience in this field has meant they\u2019ve been able to turn around similar materials relating to COVID-19 very quickly and they have the systems and networks in place to share the message widely. https:\/\/www.concern.net\/news\/sierra-leone-ebola-covid19","d0fded3d":"#Risk of flooding\n\nThe floods create crisis at the best of times, despite best efforts; they lead to illnesses and disrupted livelihoods. Homes are destroyed and families are displaced. During COVID-19, they could be disastrous, both in terms of the capacity to respond and the likelihood of the virus spreading.\n\n#The economy, poverty and hunger\n\nThere will be many devastating consequences of COVID-19 for Sierra Leone, both in the short-term and the long-term. But by far, the most damaging aspect of this pandemic will be economic. They have seen this ourselves in Ireland, with business closures, pay cuts and job losses. The difference is that Sierra Leone is a low-income country, with no social safety nets. With more than half the people already living below the poverty line, starvation is a very real risk for them.\n\nThe single biggest difference between the Ebola crisis and this COVID-19 crisis is that during the former, the country was able to rely on international assistance coming in. This time, as every country tries to fend for itself and the world economy is in turmoil, there is nowhere else to turn.https:\/\/www.concern.net\/news\/sierra-leone-ebola-covid19","c3c00f84":"#Coronavirus transmission\n\nFirst, there is the impact of COVID-19. Community transmission is becoming a stark reality. The situation in both Sierra Leone and elsewhere in Africa remains highly challenging given the fragile state of many African health services and the limitation of bringing external humanitarian assistance on the ground during the crisis. It\u2019s possible that overcrowded urban communities in some parts of Africa will become sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks and even be an endemic source of reoccurring COVID-19 incidents in the future.\n\nCurrent COVID-19 prevention tools, such as social distancing and the prevention of mass gatherings to reduce the spread of the disease, are highly challenging to administer in such areas. In many ways, the local communities in Sierra Leone \u2013 and Africa more widely \u2013 often do the best they can with what is available. Yet, the reality is that COVID-19 is likely to have an impact on the local communities. https:\/\/theconversation.com\/sierra-leone-faces-coronavirus-as-rainy-season-hits-local-disaster-planning-will-be-key-139604","848c034c":"#Overlapping disasters\n\nLocal communities in Africa are increasingly aware that they also face multiple hazards that are very likely to overlap over the rest of 2020.\n\nThere will be major difficulties in delivering effective responses to flood and pandemics such as COVID-19 simultaneously. The standard response to flooding in Freetown is to move those affected to the safety of a large stadium or hall or school, placing them out of harm\u2019s way in often large, robust locations. Yet this poses challenges for carrying out measures needed to contain COVID-19, such as avoiding large gatherings or social distancing.\n\nLocal communities need to think more deeply through how they plan for these combinations of possible disasters to save lives in the future. And yet, this raises a very serious challenge in that the local areas often lack even the most basic and accessible documentation, guidance and training in risk assessment and disaster management plans.\n\nIt\u2019s often said that all disasters are local. The rest of 2020 is likely to prove this point more than ever for resource scarce, often poverty-stricken local communities in Africa. There is an urgent need here that must be addressed as quickly as possible.https:\/\/theconversation.com\/sierra-leone-faces-coronavirus-as-rainy-season-hits-local-disaster-planning-will-be-key-139604","af2cf56e":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata  @mpwolke"}}
