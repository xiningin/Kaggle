It represents approximately 6.283185 in radian of a full circle (equivalent to 2*pi). \n\n2) If \"tau\" in reverse order is \"uat\". It can be defined as \"user acceptance testing\".","e45a44b7":"**Explanations:**\n\n1) Are there anything in common? Let's say we slice the word \"today\" to \"to\" and \"day\". It gives us the clue to standardize past, today and future in standard unit measure by day. Why is it significant? We have 24 hours in a day. According to NASA, the sidereal day is 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds. The earth rotates at angular velocity approximately 7.292124 * 10^-5 rad\/s. For example, it is useful for space launching applications.\n\n2) Why is it important? User acceptance testing is used in software development. Perform testing in real life scenarios. \n","6905242d":"**Reference:** https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ws7KS39jMBU","204e4869":"# Data Manipulations","ad8a0b55":"**Reference:** \nhttps:\/\/www.mathsisfun.com\/geometry\/radians.html\n"}}
