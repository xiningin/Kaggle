It is impossible to create a perfect field and control the weather.  It is possible to design a cleat that will prevent non contact injuries.","f49c6e5e":"#### <a id='ml'><\/a>\n<div class=\"h2\"> Machine Learning Model <\/div>\n**Variables**\n1. Calculated the differences in dis,direction,orientation, and angle (direction-orientation) from one row to the other. I used dis as a proxy for speed because speed appeared to have some data quality issues.\n2. Rolling mean and standard deviation over 5 and 10 rows (0.5 to 1 second).  This time period was picked because it correlates with approximately the time it takes an athlete to perform a cut.\n\n**Initial Results**\n\nThe first model showed that playerkey was by far the most important variable. In other words, the best way to know whether a surface is natural or synthetic is to focus on the actions of an individual player on both.  For the next models, I used only the data from one player.\n\n**Models Created**\n1. Predict Turf given next gen stats (AUC = 0.94).  The most important feature by far was weather. \n2.

To avoid drawing false conclusions on small sample sizes, I grouped data.  I simplified weather into wet or dry surface.  Roster positions were divided into skill positions and lineman. The adjusted injury counts are what the injury count would be if 100% of the games were played under that condition. \n\nThe Analysis shows that there are 3 large risk factors for turf\/cleat injuries -- Weather, Field Type, and Roster Position.  All three factors indicate support the theory that surfaces are currently at a delicate balancing point between too much and too little traction.","fc98e527":"This report identifies high risk factors for cleat-surface interaction injuries. I created novel player movement metrics using next gen stats and then created a machine learning model to predict the surface. As expected, this model shows that there are significant performance differences between synthetic and natural turf.  What surprised me is that it showed that weather, specifically wet or dry fields, are equally important.  The combination of surface type and weather, which I call surface conditions, play a key role in non contact injuries.  \n\nThe primary cause is simply the sport of football. The skill position players make very sharp cuts at high speeds, which are dangerous on all surfaces. Even if we replaced all synthetic fields with grass, that would only prevent 27% of the injuries. Turf design is currently constrained by the opposite objectives of high traction for performance and the need to not \"catch\" cleats to prevent injuries.  The way to escape that constraint can be found in a 50 year old idea -- breakaway cleats.  Whether ski boot style bindings or sheer pins on individual spikes, breakaway cleats would allow greater performance and greater safety.  If turf can ignore the \"catch\" requirement, they could focus on other areas such as concussion prevention.
