The model is first run without image augmentations and to improve the model it was then run again using the albumentation arguments \"HorizontalFlip\", \"RandomBrightnessContrast\" and \"Blur\".","2d8ad99f":"## Discussion\nAs wheat is such an important global food source, the ability to sucessfully identify wheat heads from a set of images, can help farmers predict their yield, to aid food security issues.\n\nThe outcome of this study shows that the use of augmentations are essential to running and improving the accuracy of a model. Although the model was successful in detecting wheat heads, further analysis of the wheat heads is needed to support farmers in predicting wheat yields.\n\nThe model used has the potential to be developed through further analysis of images taken throughout the growing period, to recognise the development of the crop through the growth stages. This would give farmers more information to help them with decision making of requirements such as irrigation and fertilisation. Accurate images could also indicate the health of the crop by detection of disease and pest infestation.\n\nThe global agri-tech sector is experiencing exponential growth, with government support and investment, to deal with challenges facing the global agricultural sector. The use of technology is slowly becoming cricial in the industry, to feed a growing global population with added constraints on land and farming inputs. With the demand of farmers to produce higher yields; if we continue with traditional farming methods, the security of the food chain could be put at risk.\n\nMany farmers have turned to intensive farming strategies to meet this demand, although this has increased productivity, it comes at a cost to the environment (Mennerat et al., 2010). Agri-tech improves yields, profitability and efficiency, whilst reducing the impact on the environment and by building sustainablity and resiliance across crop cultivation.\n\nFarm work is historically manual, however, more and more farmers have begun to consult data about essential variables such as soil, crops, irrigation, fertilisers and weather (Goedde et al., 2020). The benefits of adopting technologies would free up significant time for farmers to pursue work outside their core industry. Farmers must embrace change to a digital future, to overcome increased demand and disruptive forces.\n\nDrones use computer vision to analyse field conditions and are giving farmers the ability of surveying crops quicker over large areas, to relay real-time data (Goedde et al., 2020). The collected data could be used with machine learning to quickly analyse crop yields and to aid to farmers decisions.\n\nWith advances in the Agri-tech sector, the application of machine learning using imagery  will aid yield prediction and should be considered as an essential tool for farmers in the future.","b0df4c92":"## References \nAlom, M.Z., Taha, C., Yakopcic, C. et al., A state of the art survey on deep learning theory and architectures. *Electron*, 8:3, pg. 292.\n\nBrisson, N.P., Gate, P., Gouache, D., Charmet, G., Oury, F.X. & Huard, F.

This involves recognising the dominant content in a scene, which is given the strongest confidence score, irrespective of the location, scaling or rotation.\n\nAn example of this would be recognising the dominant feature within an image, such as cat or dog. Classification does not consider where the dominant feature is.\n\nDetection differs from classification, as it involves the classification and localisation of an object (Tuzel et al., 2006). For this study, we would like to be able to determine the wheat heads and their location, thus it is a detection problem.\n\n\n### Data Preprocessing\nThe data needs to be formatted into appropriately pre-processed floating point tensors before being run through the model. \n\nFirstly, the bounding box coordinates must be extracted to create separate columns.","a466625f":"# Deep Learning Detection and Classification of Wheat Heads to Estimate Yield","34c0c4e9":"The images from the training data is then split into train and validation sets using a 80:20 split. Once the data has been split, it is integrated back with the metadata. This can then show how many bounding boxes are in each data set, training and validation.\n","7e8a7606":"### Model\nThe model used for this study was a pretrained Faster R-CNN ResNet50. This model extends the Faster R-CNN, whilst only adding a small overhead, running at 5 fps. Additionally, this model outperforms all existing single-model entries for segmentation, bounding-box object detection and person keypoint detection.\n\nThe model was firstly trained on a model with no image augmentation and 20 epochs. This was then improved by adding several image augmentations and reducing the number of epochs.\n\nThe model needs to be downloaded and the head of the model changed to a more appropriate predictor. The number of classes, input features, device, parameters, optimisers and epochs are also defined. ","cebee5a5":"In the graph below you can see that adding in the augmentations has significantly reduced the validation loss of the model to just below 0.825.","a87b5544":"## Background\nWheat is a core cereal that is relied on around the world in our diet. In the 1920s wheat breeding was introduced to increase yields and to build immunity against disease (David et al., 2020). \n\nWheat's popularity as a staple food product, has meant that farmers globally have had to grow different varieties to suit their growing conditions. This is  vital for food security to ensure successful harvests. Breeding has significantly increased yields, however, this rate of increase has plateaued since the early 1990s (Brisson et al., 2010). Farmers now need to look at other ways to increase and estimate wheat yields. \n\nDemand for high yielding wheat has initiated wide research, with the creation of a large database, including a set of images which will be studied in this investigation. The images are made up of \"wheat heads\" which are the spikes at the top of the plant's stem. The wheat head holds the plant's nutrition and is harvested and processed into cereal for food consumption. It would be of benefit to farmers if they were able to estimate the density and size of the wheat heads to predict wheat yields.\n\nWith the advance in GPU performance, deep learning has become more accessable to individuals as well as institutions to perform object detection on large datasets (Alom et al., 2019). Although deep learning can be an accurate way to look at large datasets, it can come with limitations. As the images are taken of wheat fields outside, images are often distorted or blury, with movement in the wind. Also, different varieties, at different growth stages and the orientation of wheat heads can appear differently. This can make it more challenging to identify single wheat heads.\n\nThe Global Wheat Head data is led by 9 research institutions from across the world, with the joint ambition of accurately detecting wheat heads. These institutions include The University of Tokyo, Institut National de Researche pour L'Agriculture, L'Alimentation et L'Environment, Arvalis, ETHZ, University of Saskatchewan, University of Queensland, Nanjing Agricultural University and Rothamsted Research.\n\n### Problem outline\nThe accurate classification and detection of wheat heads would give farmers an invaluable tool in the prediction of wheat yields. Using the Global Wheat Head data, this study will attempt to successfully identify the location of wheat heads within provided images.","f94f54f2":"## Methods\n\n### Data\nThe data set was found on Kaggle (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/global-wheat-detection).\n\nThe data includes 2 folders of images, test and train and metadata giving further information of the bounding boxes.\n\nThere are 3422 images in the training folder and 10 images in the test folder.
