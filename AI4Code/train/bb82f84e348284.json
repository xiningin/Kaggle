Specifically Rosling talks about how child mortality is not anymore the same that it was back then and how the countries of the world have improved in providing better health services for their citizens. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then he displays a graphics, a dynamic graphics of how child mortality (children that survive to reach 5 years old) with respect to children per woman in the different countries of the world has changed in the last 70 years. <\/p>\n    \n<p>So why this notebook ? Here are some points: <\/p>\n    \n- I love that presentation in particular the dynamic graph and I wanted to find a way to reproduce it in a Jupyter Notebook. \n\n- Here I share the code. \n    \n- If you haven't seen it then here is the video on Youtube : https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w    \n\n<\/p>\n"}}
