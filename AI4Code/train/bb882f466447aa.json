Or if not, at least you should focus on Python first.\n\nBasic methods such as linear or logistic regression are the most frequently used algorithm. Since it constructs a vital foundation for more complex models, you may want to start digest those basics first.\n\n> There\u2019re still few respondents who use evolutionary approaches on their regular basis, in all subgroups. Huge respect for evoluationary approaches!\n\nIn computer vision world, downstream tasks like image classification and object detection may become a routine for professional or research scientist. Hence, methods which deal with that kind of tasks are among the 3 most used methods, along with other general-purpose vision tools, like PIL, cv2, skimage, etc.\n\nAt the same time, in the NLP world, word embedding like word2vec or fastText is among the most used NLP methods. This is because word embedding\/vectors are required to apply other advance methods, like encoder-decoder models or Transformers language models.\n\nNext, if we inspect the above visualization about core activities at work for SEA countries and global, they have the same level of urgency in what they do at work. As we all can see, **analyzing and understanding data to influence products and business decisions** become a regular thing yet the most important one.\n\nWhile in Indonesia, analyzing data to influence products is still the most selected core activities, but data infrastructure still the second have-to-do activity. Only then, they focus on prototyping, deploying model, and then research. Even iteration to improve the existing model is the lowest citizen in the work if you compare with other 2 subgroups.\n\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n* Most data professionals in Indonesia are bachelor graduate compare to data professionals globally which are master graduate. We can\u2019t say whether this is a lack, though.\n* Python is still, by far, irreplaceable programming language to use for data science.\n* Traditional software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets is the main statistical tools to analyze and exploring data. While globally, the local development environment like JupyterLab or RStudio is the main tools, as well as in other SEA countries (almost the same with traditional software)\n* Vital foundational methods like linear or logistic regression still worth to learn first. Besides it\u2019s foundational, they are still used either as a first model iteration or it\u2019s just the right model to use with the lowest cost and good performance.\n* Although Coursera is the most popular MOOC in other 2 subgroups, respondents from Indonesia mostly use Kaggle Learn Courses to learn data science.\n* Data pipeline may be still an issue in Indonesia since most respondents state it as second important work after analyzing and understanding data.\n* Data talents in Indonesia could be still in the development phase where they try to connect all important end-to-end data pipeline while they also learn to apply fancy machine learning models.","a73e1226":"## The Survey At A Glance\n\nAfter we have cleaned the dataset, let's dive in deeper to understand the data. Since we are not interested in building a model, we just want to analyze and make some visualizations to answer those questions stated earlier.","e69fcea4":"From above figures, the respondents are dominated by those who have bachelor's and master's degree, with most of them reside in India. **Indonesia**, our main focus here, take the 15th position with less than 500 respondents. For those aspiring data scientist, according to this survey, you're encouraged to learn Python as your first weapon.\n\nSome of this characteristics will act as a comparison to all Indonesian respondents's. We may add more characteristics as we look at more questions.\n\nFirst, we split the data into 3 groups to suit our motivation, they are respondents who reside in **Indonesia**, **SEA country** other than Indonesia, and the **global**.","42dfe3d7":"There are so many tools, library, or platform that can help in doing data science projects. Most of them are open-source, some are paid.\n\nOf course, Python is the main programming language used regularly in Indonesia and for other 2 subgroups, along (maybe, parallel) with SQL and R. This gives rise to the most used IDE that, still, belongs to the Jupyter family (Lab, Notebook, etc.).\n\nOne interesting thing is that in Indonesia, Julia hasn\u2019t been used at all, for either learning or in a data science project. While in other SEA countries and globally, some respondents have tried to use Julia.\n\nWhile for **hosted notebooks**, Colab and Kaggle notebooks took the first and second place, respectively. In my case, I started to use Deepnote and some of my notebook projects was turned into interactive notebooks using Binder. But, seems other respondents don\u2019t use it, compare to other subgroups.\n\nIn terms of **libraries**, the combination of Matplotlib and Seaborn is the most used visualization libraries. The same story applies to machine learning libraries where Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch in decreasing order.\n\nWhat surprised me is that **local development environment**, like JupyterLab, RStudio, etc., is the primary tool used in 2 other subgroups, while most respondents in Indonesia are still using basic software such as Excel or Google Sheets as their primary tool to analyze data.","5d029bd4":"This one is interesting. The 467 rows of missing values (and only 467 rows) shows that all rows in other columns are missing. Also, since there are 351 missing values in each row, and we have 355 columns in total with the first 4 columns are complete, all the values in each column are missing. Therefore, we can **drop those rows**.","955eac8f":"The dataset must have a lot of missing values since, as Kaggle has stated in their survey methodology document, more experienced respondents will get more questions that the less experience ones, especially for the multiple-selection questions.\n\nSo, we inspect the missing values in multiplte-choice questions below.","aedc98da":"We've already created a dictionary to map each column name to corresponding question. Using this, we are easier to know what columns consists of answers to what questions.\n\nNow, for those questions with multiple choice, the corresponding columns have the word `Part` in its name. Let's define two subgroups of questions with only one answers and multiple choice.","e9eabd77":"# How You, Aspiring Indonesia Data Scientist, Should Learn Data Science\n\n<span style=\"color:gray\">Findings from 2020 Kaggle Data Science & Machine Learning Survey for Aspiring Indonesia Data Scientist<\/span>\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe year is 2020 and we are in a pandemic. A lot of bad things happen, from career shifting for professionals to online learning for students. People are struggling. One common characteristic is that we **learn** to adapt in a flash.\n\nThe government have tried to tranquillize us using data. In Indonesia, IMO, some of it makes sense, but most of it doesn't. But, at least the decision-making processes are **based on data**.\n\nUnfortunately, people who are in charge of extracting insights and contributing to those decision-making processes are still wanted. We have the resources in terms of people, but we still need more of them.\n\nSo...\n\nIs Indonesia lack data scientist, or generally speaking, data talents a lot?\n\nOver and above that, how are exactly Indonesian data scientists or machine learning engineers' state?\n\nFor aspiring data scientists, how should they learn data science, driven by (post-)pandemic circumstances?","2f6ad465":"## Data Talents in Indonesia\n\nWe refer to data talents as anyone who deals with data in their day-to-day work or anyone who are learning and want to work that relies on data to a great extent, e.g. data engineer, data analyst, or any titles that exist in the survey data.\n\nTo be able to understand the state of data talents in Indonesia, we inspect their job titles and educational backgrounds.","3f244300":"Looks like there is no missing values from the first columns until the fourth. Missing values exist from Q4 until the last multiple choice question. For multiple selection questions, definitely contain missing values since they are scattered into one column for one selection. Hence, we don't interested in this.","6c8b8892":"Consider the formal educational background for professional or non-professional respondents plans to attain within the next 2 years above.\n\nAlthough Master's Degree is the most educational background overall respondents have, the case is different from Indonesia. Most background Indonesian respondents have is Bachelor's Degree. One deviation would be Machine Learning Engineer whose most background is Master's Degree.\n\nIf we compare to the global\u2019s state, Master's Degree is the most common educational background. In fact, Research Scientist requires a higher degree, Doctoral or Master\u2019s, while in Indonesia there is an only slight difference between a bachelor, master, and doctoral. It\u2019s not so much though compare to global.","79ee5d12":"## Points At Issue\n\nMotivated by previous \"why\"-es, I explored the 2020 Kaggle Data Science & Machine Learning Survey to at least try to uncover the answers for some questions below.\n\n* How are data talents in Indonesia?\n* What are the most used data science tools and platforms?\n* How does someone, especially Indonesian, should learn to break into the field of data science?\n\nLet's gather the dataset and inspect the first 5 rows.","839f2776":"My first expectation was that Data Scientist is the most popular role selected in the survey (well, it\u2019s a survey from Kaggle). But, as we can see, **Student is the most selected role**. In fact, it\u2019s the most selected role for all subgroups.\n\n> This signifies a lot of respondents are in the middle of their learning path.\n\nAnother similar character between those 3 subgroups is that the bottom 3 roles selected are **Data Engineer, Statisticianand DBA\/Database Engineer**.\n\nIt seems like respondents from other SEA countries are more of non-professional aspiring data scientists compare to Indonesia\u2019s and global\u2019s. Data Scientist is in the top 5 roles in Indonesia and Global. It\u2019s even the second most selected job title in Indonesia."}}
