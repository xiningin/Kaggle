Reported cases remained relatively low and were largely confined to imported cases, until localised clusters began to emerge in March; the largest cluster was linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering held in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur in late February and early March, leading to massive spikes in local cases and an exportation of cases to neighbouring countries. Within a few weeks, Malaysia had recorded the largest cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia, breaching over the 2,000 mark in active cases by the end of March from fewer than 30 at the start of the month. By 16 March, the virus is reported in every state and federal territory in the country. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Malaysia","2a3fa48f":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar\u00edlia Prata   @mpwolke","51bc0523":"newslab.malaysianiki.com"}}
