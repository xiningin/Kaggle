A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step. \n*-Lao Tzu*\n\nI came across Kaggle recently; in the process of heading towards Data Science. This is my very first notebook which I am publishing. \n\nI see folks here tremendously showcasing their works and exploiting the datasets to get the gem out of them. I thought of starting with a small dataset which can be more linked with me. So, I am performing a short data analysis on my walking activity by analysing the step counts I make every day.\n\nI have recently installed an app in my mobile which tracks my steps - the outdoor and the basic ones; on hourly basis. \n    \n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/a8p80vDm.png) \n        ","0df7ca8e":"**Let's see how are my steps across the day divided.**","5bd58d74":"*It seems I walk more in home on weekends.
