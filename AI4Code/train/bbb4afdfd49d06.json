The pandas df.describe() function is great but a little basic for serious exploratory data analysis. EDA is all about knowing the data, its like analyzing the datasets to summarize their main cahracteristics, often with visual methods. As a definiton one can say that \"EDA refers to process of performing investigations on data so as to discover the patterns, to spot anomalies and to check our assumptions wih the help of summary statistics and graphical representations\".","4708664c":"As you can see there is a deatiled analysis of the dataset, which allows user to save more time analysing the data. But there might be few error which can occur during this profile report analysis. One such error i encountered while using ProfileReport is \n\n\"***concat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'join_axes'***.\n\nTo solve this error we should update to ***latest pandas_profiling module i.e. v2.4.1 or v2.4.0***\n","24eda3be":"Command for importing the pandas_profiling module in anaconda is \n**conda install -c conda-forge\/label\/cf202003 pandas-profiling**.\n\nIf u have already installed the pandas profiling module and it is not working, u can check the version of module by command **conda list \"module_name\"**\n"}}
