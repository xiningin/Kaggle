To be a good scientist you have to indulge in a degree of lateral or creative thinking, in terms of constructing new questions. I normally say that a mark of a good scientist is the quality of questions they ask. So that would be the hallmark of a good scientist for me: asking questions that no-one has asked before.\"\n\nAccording to Friston: \"Medicine is rewarding in the sense that you make a difference in people\u2019s lives \u2013 and you can see the benefits of your transactions with patients or other healthcare colleagues.

He invented statistical parametric mapping (SPM), voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM). These contributions were motivated by schizophrenia research and theoretical studies of value-learning, formulated as the dysconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia. Mathematical contributions include variational Laplacian procedures and generalized filtering for hierarchical Bayesian model inversion. Friston currently works on models of functional integration in the human brain and the principles that underlie neuronal interactions. His main contribution to theoretical neurobiology is a free-energy principle for action and perception (active inference). Friston received the first Young Investigators Award in Human Brain Mapping (1996) and was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1999). In 2000 he was President of the international Organization of Human Brain Mapping. In 2003 he was awarded the Minerva Golden Brain Award and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2006. In 2008 he received a Medal, College de France and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of York in 2011. He became of Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology in 2012, received the Weldon Memorial prize and Medal in 2013 for contributions to mathematical biology and was elected as a member of EMBO (excellence in the life sciences) in 2014 and the Academia Europaea in (2015). He was the 2016 recipient of the Charles Branch Award for unparalleled breakthroughs in Brain Research and the Glass Brain Award - a lifetime achievement award in the field of human brain mapping. He holds Honorary Doctorates from the University of Zurich and Radboud University.https:\/\/www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk\/~karl\/","70b39271":"slideplayer.com","f11b3443":"Paul Mooney codes to read txt files","bb7df0de":"bloomsburyfestival.org.uk"}}
