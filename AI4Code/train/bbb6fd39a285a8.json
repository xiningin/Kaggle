It is interesting that there are no values between 2.6 and 3. These variables are qualitative since they are a judgement as to how strong the letters are.

","7501a76e":"### Create a histogram of GRE scores \nThis is helpful to visually see how the data is dispersed. A histogram shows how often each data value in the particular data set occurs. There are different general categories of distributions. For GRE scores, the data looks pretty evenly distributed, perhaps skewed to the left a bit. It would make sense that graduate application data values would be skewed to the left as candidates with lower scores would probably not apply as often, while many over-qualified candidates apply to at least one safety school.

","1616c131":"To look at the data more closely, look at the measures of central tendency: mean, mode, and median of the GRE scores variable. Note that the median and mean are close which means there are not many outliers (which we could see in the histogram). Median is the reflects the middle position of the data values. The median is 317 and the mean is 316.5, so the mean is slightly less than the median which is one indicator of a slight skew.","62c79570":"### Create a histogram of the TOEFL scores\nThis histogram is slightly skewed to the left.","e3dc3169":"### Evaluate the SOP variable\nIn looking at the mean, mode and median - the mean is close to the median.

One thing to note (as seen above in the info() method, there are no null values. The GRE values hare spread from a minimum score of 290 to a maximum score of 340. The TOEFL scores range from 92 to 120. The rating range is from 1 to 5. Letters of recommendation's range is from 1 to 5, and cgpa is from 6.8 to 9.92. Finally, the range for research is from 0 to 1.

This makes sense, since the GRE has two parts, math and English, and TOEFL is for English-language proficiency. If one scored highly on at least the English portion of the GRE they would also score highly on the TOEFL, and vice versa. CGPA, TOEFL, GRE, and chance of admittance are all highly correlated. Again, this makes sense because admittance to university would be related to how high they scored on the exams and how will they did during their undergraduate education (CGPA).","f7c8e2d1":"### Create a histogram of the Rating variable\nMost values are 3"}}
