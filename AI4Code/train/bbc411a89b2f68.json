Neighbor Algorithm?**\n\nAs explained by Wikipedia:\n\n> In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression: \n- In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. \n- In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.\n\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation.","fe75c4ca":"To begin with, let's make all the necessary imports to start working.","fe16b03c":"## Testing the Model\nApply the model.

So, the process of choosing the optimal hyperparameters for the learning algorithm is called Hyperparameter Tuning.\n\nWe will be using the *Grid Search Cross Validation* technique to choose the hyperparameter (n_neighbors) that would perform the best, for our model.\n\n**What is Grid Search Cross Validation technique?**\n\nAs explained by Wikipedia:\n\n> The traditional way of performing hyperparameter optimization has been grid search, or a parameter sweep, which is simply an exhaustive searching through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. A grid search algorithm must be guided by some performance metric, typically measured by cross-validation on the training set or evaluation on a held-out validation set.\nSince the parameter space of a machine learner may include real-valued or unbounded value spaces for certain parameters, manually set bounds and discretization may be necessary before applying grid search.","5b838a64":"#### Analysis\nIn the dataset provided, we have extracted the information regarding the columns and rows. Rows are refered as *observations*. Each column in this data set tells us something about each of our observations, like their width, height, or shade. These columns are called *Features* or *Predictor Variables* of our dataset. Columns like wood-type and wood-slab classifies our dataset and are considered as *Target Variables*. \n\nFrom the above information, this can be figured out that we have **3 Predictor Variables** of data type float-64 and **1 Target Variable** of data type object, represented by **4** data columns.\n\n**Features**\n- Slab Height\n- Slab Width\n- Slab Shade\n\n**Target** \n- Wood Slab\n\nAlso, we have been provided with **791 observations**, ranged from 0 to 790.","8fb2516b":"In this notebook, first, we examined the data to understand it and extracted information required to know the *features* and *target*.

We have splitted our data into testing and training data sets, as well.
