But organizing a gift exchange with your friends, family, or coworkers can be a bit more complicated. Here are the steps for hosting a traditional Secret Santa game in-person:**\n\n* Write down each name on a piece of paper.\n* Have everyone write down a gift suggestion or two.\n* Draw names to randomly assign a Secret Santa to each player.\n* Plan a gift exchange party. \n* Guess who drew your name. \n\n**But okay this is the traditional way, Why and What has Python to do with any of it?**\nWe use python that randomly draws people's name and assigns them to be secret santa and all this is done using nothing but using email! Great right?!
