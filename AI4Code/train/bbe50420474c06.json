Evaluating training results and model performance\n\nOnce training is finished, **evaluating the training curves** can help us **tune our hyperparameters** in subsequent experiments by telling us if we're **underfitting** or by showing us when the model begins to **overfit**.\n\nFinally, we will demonstrate the model output on the test data set (in this case, one of each type of radiograph).\n\n>At the end of your experiments, you want to evaluate network performance on an **independent, *held-out* test data set**, as the model will be *indirectly* exposed to the validation data set over successive experiments, potentially **biasing the model hyperparameters** toward overfitting to the validation data.","c780850a":"## 1.

In this kernel, we will use fast.ai and the MIMIC-CXR database to see if we can detect chest tubes in AP chest x-rays. We will be using 6,000 images in our dataset: **3,000** with ET tubes and **3,000** without.\n\nThe central point of this exercise is to demonstrate that \"deep learning\" hardly requires tech expertise, and that a few lines of code can easily be recycled to look at positive and negative examples of just about anything.\n\n>Moreover, cloud computing is so powerful now that we don't need to have our own supercomputer to run experiments. This experiment runs on cloud computing provided to us for free from Kaggle (and Google, by extension).\n\n# How to use this kaggle kernel\n\nTo explore this model and data set, please <kbd>Fork<\/kbd> the notebook in the menu above (i.e. create a copy under your Kaggle profile). \n\n>When you get into the draft environment, please ensure that you see **\"GPU on\"** and **\"Internet on\"** under **Settings** so you can utilize the cloud GPU for faster model training.\n\nIn this Notebook editing environment, each block of text is referred to as a **cell**.  Cells containing formatted text are **Markdown** cells, as they use the *Markdown* formatting language. Similarly, cells containing code are **code** cells.\n\nClicking within a cell will allow you to edit the content of that cell (a.k.a. enter **edit mode**). You can also navigate between cells with the arrow keys. Note that the appearance of Markdown cells will change when you enter edit mode.\n\nYou can **run code cells** (and format Markdown cells) as you go along by clicking within the cell and then clicking the **blue button with *one* arrow** next to the cell or at the bottom of the window. You can also use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>SHIFT<\/kbd> + <kbd>ENTER<\/kbd> (press both keys at the same time)."}}
