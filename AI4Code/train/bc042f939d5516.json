Yards gain data is not distributed by a normal distribution: in fact it is right skewed since the chance of getting positive yardage is much higher than getting negative yards. Therefore we want to try to fit a lognormal distribution which is also righted skewed to see the goodness of fit.\n\nNGBoost package both natively support CRPS and lognormal distribution which is a perfect candidate to test its performance","edd847ef":"In an ideal fit we would expect the bars are close to the dotted line, indicate that it's a somewhat bad fit which is the same case as above.\n\nTo sum up even this competition require using cummulative distribution as competition score, the data is hard to fit by one single distribution so a combination of distribution like Gaussian Mixture model is required.","577c0a66":"In lognormal distribution the data has to be distributed above zero so a transform is needed to fit the data","6b6d9bb0":"Stanford ML group have release a package call NGBoost (Natural Gradient Boosting) which aims to provide a probablistic estimation on top of a gradient boosting model. Since the competition don't allow internet connection nor external data it's unlikly to be helpful to competition score so it shall only be a demostration.","7f390b5f":"Here is the histogram of rushing yards and the fit of lognormal distribution. Here we can see the fit is just soso since football data have a sharp peak of 3-4 yards gain and it's difficult to fit by a smooth distribution function. Next we will use NGBoost to see how it works"}}
