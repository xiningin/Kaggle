Each polygon is a buffer of 2 miles (or, 2\\*5280 feet) around a different air monitoring station.","f3431fee":"Or, we can get the closest monitoring station.","dc0adcf0":"Using the calculated distances, we can obtain statistics like the mean distance to each station.","ee210dd4":"# Measuring distance\n\nTo measure distances between points from two different GeoDataFrames, we first have to make sure that they use the same coordinate reference system (CRS).  Thankfully, this is the case here, where both use EPSG 2272.","d9484bd0":"We also check the CRS to see which units it uses (meters, feet, or something else).  In this case, EPSG 2272 has units of feet.  (_If you like, you can check this [here](https:\/\/epsg.io\/2272)._)\n\nIt's relatively straightforward to compute distances in GeoPandas.  The code cell below calculates the distance (in feet) between a relatively recent release incident in `recent_release` and every station in the `stations` GeoDataFrame.","47b98511":"Now, to test if a toxic release occurred within 2 miles of **any** monitoring station, we could run 12 different tests for each polygon (to check individually if it contains the point).\n\nBut a more efficient way is to first collapse all of the polygons into a **MultiPolygon** object.  We do this with the `unary_union` attribute.","00f4e4ca":"We use `folium.GeoJson()` to plot each polygon on a map.  Note that since folium requires coordinates in latitude and longitude, we have to convert the CRS to EPSG 4326 before plotting.","405d1568":"But not all releases occured within two miles of an air monitoring station!","5613a0dc":"You'll also work with a dataset that contains readings from air quality monitoring stations in the same city.","c682e28c":"# Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll explore several techniques for **proximity analysis**.  In particular, you'll learn how to do such things as:\n- measure the distance between points on a map, and\n- select all points within some radius of a feature.","b83c3132":"# Your turn\n\nIn the **[final exercise](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kernels\/fork\/5832147)**, you'll investigate hospital coverage in New York City.","5dd1fa30":"We use the `contains()` method to check if the multipolygon contains a point.  We'll use the release incident from earlier in the tutorial, which we know is roughly 3781 feet to the closest monitoring station."}}
