As the ***Data*** section of the competition states:\n> Your model must be named submission.zip and be compatible with TensorFlow 2.2. The submission.zip should contain all files and directories created by the tf.saved_model_save function using Tensorflow's SavedModel format.\n\nNow question is what exactly in the [SavedModel](https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/tutorials\/keras\/save_and_load#savedmodel_format) format do we need to submit.\n\nAlso, majority of us don't want to use tensorflow to train our models. And we don't know how to preprocess. So we'll tackle two things mainly.\n\n1. Use our own keras model in submission.\n2. How to preprocess.\n\nLet's get started."}}
