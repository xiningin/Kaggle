However, the machines must first be programmed to learn from data. **\n\n** Unsupervised learning problems can be further grouped into clustering and association problems.  \n**\n1. Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behaviour. \n2. Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y. \n\n\n","07a9e3e2":"# Ridge Classifier CV","5b0df355":"**Model and Accuracy**","1aeda975":"**Library and Data**","b76d1318":"# Machine Learning","814fae0b":"# **LDA**","cf393ffc":"# KNN \n**KNN does not learn any model. and stores the entire training data set which it uses as its representation.The output can be calculated as the class with the highest frequency from the K-most similar instances.
