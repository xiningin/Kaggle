Hypotheses to be explored\n\nDoes the time for reading incongruent words differ from that reading congruent ones?  \n\nFirst of all, since the dataset we are considering has few samples, i.e. less than 30, we will assume that the population fits into a normal distribution. From this assumption we can then consider the sample mean as equivalent to the population mean. However, once we do not have the standard deviation of the population, it will be appropriate to consider a t-distribution. \n\nFurthermore, through the t-test we could infer how different the two population means (simbolized as $\\mu_c$ and $\\mu_i$ for congruent and incongruent set of words, respectively) are from each other, considering the measured samples.

","2205fc5d":"<a id='sec1.1'><\/a>\n### 1.1. The Stroop Effect\nAccordingly to <a href=\"#[1]\">[1]<\/a>, the *Stroop Effect* is defined as follow:\n> (...) the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., \"blue\", \"green\", or \"red\") is printed in a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g., the word \"red\" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935.\n\nThese situations are defined as *congruent*, when the name of color is equivalent to the name, or *incongruent*, when the name denotes to another color, as shown in the following example sets.","083a3e2b":"Since we have defined an $\\alpha$ level, it is know we are considering a *p-value* less than $\\alpha$, i.e. $p < 0.05$.

Conclusions\nRegarding the *Stroop Effect*, according to <a href=\"#[2]\">[2]<\/a> it can be understood as an evidence in experimental psychology that a selective attention by properties is either nonexistent or incomplete. This is due to early experiments that seemed to indicate that if an object is attended, some of its properties would be processed in an automatic way, even when the observer were trying to ignore them. The findings from Stroop Effect bring evidences that selective attention to color may not be possible after all. Still according to <a href=\"#[2]\">[2]<\/a>, the Stroop interference also occurs when subjects are asked to name an object that is drawn in outline around the name of a different object, for example. \n\nIn this analysis we presented the Stroop Effect and applyed a t-test to collect statistic evidence to support this perceptive phenomenon. In doing so, we have gone through the steps necessary to test a hypothesis as well as gain confidence that the method can be valid even for a small number of samples, provided certain conditions.

Also, the same observations are valid for the *difference distribution* ($\\bar{X}_d$, $S_d$). Despite the outlier measurements in the distribution from *incongruent* word set and the skewness in the *difference*, it can be noticed that all of them follow an approximately normal curve.

In this case, the independent variable is **the condition of the set of words**, i.e. whether the words are congruent or not. Put another way, we can imagine our independent variable *condition* assuming the value 0 when the words are congruents or assuming the value 1 if not.  \n\n* **Dependent variable**: on the other hand, the dependent variable varies accordingly to each sample.
