Log4j is embedded into numerous applications and is used to log activity such as visitors to a website. The vulnerability can be remotely exploited by adversaries to gain unauthorized access to systems.\n\nOn Friday, December 10, a critical software vulnerability known as Log4Shell was broadly publicized. Alarmingly, this vulnerability is widespread, affecting organizations worldwide and putting numerous Stanford systems at risk. The Information Security Office (ISO) has detected related activity targeting our systems and has been working around the clock with IT teams throughout the university to apply fixes as quickly as possible.\n\nLaptops, desktops, and mobile devices may be using this software, but they are not generally at risk. The most vulnerable systems are servers and web-based applications. We are prioritizing internet-facing services, as these are the most susceptible of all.","3a3831c3":"### Now we have idea of the data and cleaned it up we will now determine what questions this data can answer for us. \n\n- What are the top platforms and countries originating the attacks?\n- Is there any colleration information we can add to the IP that would yeild more insights?\n- Can we identify which Platforms have sub par abuse policies and enforcement times.\n- Of All the data what percentage of the attacks were verified?","2c7da161":"## Cleaning the dataset "}}
