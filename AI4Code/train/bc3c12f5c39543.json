This research is a joint collaboration between GitHub and the Deep Program Understanding group at Microsoft Research - Cambridge.\n\nThe primary dataset consists of 2 million (comment, code) pairs from open source libraries. Concretely, a comment is a top-level function or method comment (e.g. docstrings in Python), and code is an entire function or method.\n\nThe aim of this notebook is that users of the dataset can get started quickly."}}
