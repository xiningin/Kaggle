(You might pick more than one option.)\n- Incorporate the safety features of regular vehicles.\n- Test the system in a variety of environments.\n- Hire an internal \u2018red team\u2019 to play the role of bad actors seeking to manipulate the autonomous driving system. Strengthen the system against the team\u2019s attacks on an ongoing basis.","0ed649fa":"# 5) Detecting misinformation\n\nA social media platform is planning to deploy a new AI system to flag and remove social media messages containing misinformation. Though the system has proven effective in tests, it sometimes flags non-objectionable content as misinformation. \n\nWhat are some ways in which the social media platform could allow someone whose message has been flagged to contest the misinformation designation?","020f5c2f":"# 1) Reducing plastic waste\n\nA Cambodian organization wants to help reduce the significant amounts of plastic waste that pollute the Mekong River System. Which of the following would be an appropriate way to start?  (Your answer might use more than one option.)\n \n- Watch the people currently addressing the problem as they navigate existing tools and processes.\n- Conduct individual interviews with the people currently addressing the problem.\n- Assemble focus groups that consist of people currently addressing the problem.\n\nAfter you have answered the question, view the official solution by running the code cell below.","6419bbed":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

This tiring and repetitive work requires an expert eye. Your team wants to create a technology solution that helps pathologists with this task in real-time, using a camera. However, due to the complexity of the work, your team has not found rule-based systems to be capable of adding value to the review of images. \n\nWould AI add value to a potential solution? Why or why not?","c97cf224":"In the tutorial, you learned about human-centered design (HCD) and became familiar with six general steps to apply it to AI systems. In this exercise, you will identify and address design issues in six interesting AI use cases. \n\n# Introduction\n\nBegin by running the next code cell.  \n- Clicking inside the code cell.\n- Click on the triangle (in the shape of a \"Play button\") that appears to the left of the code cell.\n- If your code is run successfully, you will see `Setup Complete` as output below the cell.","58636055":"# Keep going\n\nContinue to **[identify bias](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/alexisbcook\/identifying-bias-in-ai)** in machine learning applications.","1869ce81":"# 3) Flagging suspicious activity \n\nA bank is using AI to flag suspicious international money transfers for potential money laundering, anti-terrorist financing or sanctions concerns. Though the system has proven more effective than the bank\u2019s current processes, it still frequently flags legitimate transactions for review. \n\nWhat are some potential harms that the system could cause, and how can the bank reduce the impacts of these potential harms?","3ad6b16e":"# 4) Prototyping a chatbot\n\nDuring an ongoing pandemic outbreak, a country\u2019s public health agency is facing a large volume of phone calls and e-mails from people looking for health information. The agency has determined that an AI-powered interactive chatbot that answers pandemic-related questions would help people get the specific information they want quickly, while reducing the burden on the agency\u2019s employees. How should the agency start prototyping the chatbot?\n- Build out the AI solution to the best of its ability before testing it with a diverse group of potential users.\n- Build a non-AI prototype quickly and start testing it with a diverse group of potential users.","86d530d0":"**This notebook is an exercise in the [AI Ethics](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/learn\/ai-ethics) course.
