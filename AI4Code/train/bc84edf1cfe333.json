Things are kept simple so that it's easier to understand the steps and modify it.\n\nFeel free to `Fork` this notebook and share it with your modifications **OR** use it to create your submissions.\n\n### Prerequisites\nYou should know how to use python and a little bit of Machine Learning. You can apply the techniques you learned in the training program and submit the new solutions! \n\n### Checklist\nYou can participate in this competition the way you perefer. However, I recommend following these steps if this is your first time joining a competition on Kaggle.\n\n* Fork this notebook and run the cells in order.\n* Submit this solution.\n* Make changes to the data processing step as you see fit.\n* Submit the new solutions.\n\n*You can submit up to 5 submissions per day. You can select only one of the submission you make to be considered in the final ranking.*\n\n\nDon't hesitate to leave a comment or contact me if you have any question!","fe36381a":"Now we're ready to generate the submission file.
