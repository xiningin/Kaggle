That\u2019s why for now I leave this type of investment for further explorations.\n\nThis research is just a tiny step towards estimation of ML&CCS worth for economic development of countries, its value for companies\u2019 business improvement and for professional growth of any individual. There are many aspects in this huge field of research which definitely cannot be covered in such a small notebook but it shows that at least\n**in financial way if You invest in ML&CCS your profit will be one of the best which modern markets can offer,\neven better than Gold.**\n","e5ddbd6b":"For better visualization let\u2019s make radar chart:","cfeee9e8":"**How intervals in Q24 and Q25 answers are aggregated?** Since the answers for Survey Q24 and Q25 are intervals, for the first-time estimation we\u2019ll take their average for calculation Return On Investment as we don\u2019t have any additional parameters to build segmentation or distribution inside these intervals (it might be point for a further development of this research). For Q25 answer \u201c100,000 or more (USD)\u201d we\u2019ll use in calculation value 100,001 USD as we don\u2019t know how much money more than 100,000 USD were spent for ML&CCS in corresponding answers and this category of answers is the most valuable for the sum of spendings so any tiny shift of its value could influence greatly on the result. For the same reasons for Q24 answer \u201c> 500,000\u201d in calculations we\u2019ll use value 500,001 USD.","9278ea28":"After calculating we got **ROI 1,57** (or **157%**) for ML&CCS. Roughly speaking it means that sum of X USD invested in ML&CCS in 5 years will bring (1,57X) of profit. \n\nGreat! Now we know the present profitability of ML&CCS but to understand how attractive it is in terms of investment **we need to compare it with other assets\/investment projects.** The variety of latter can be mindblowing: they differ by the structure, periods, interest, national context and many other things. So let\u2019s take a look at some types of assets which have been already internationally recognized as stable and profitable for already long time \u2013 precious metals, namely, gold, silver, platinum and palladium. As we compare profitability of 5 year investment projects, we need to find how prices for these metals grew from 2015 to 2020. This growth will be equal to their profit. As modern economic, financial and political worlds change extremely rapidly we will compare our 2015-2020 ML&CCS investment projects with other investment projects only for the same years 2015-2020 (not with any average of 5 year investment projects of different years).\n\n**Since gold, silver, platinum and palladium** are very popular investment instruments and we need just two values of price for each of them. So the easiest way to find it will be to google it in internet, just taking the numbers from the results list of search engine. I\u2019ve made it and here are the results:\n","be9672dd":"![image.png](attachment:image.png)","d6a77386":"We clearly see that gold and silver and platinum are far behind behind ML&CCS as investment instruments with much lower ROI for 2015-2020 period. And only palladium shows the greater results than ML&CCS and beats it with 215% of profitability.\nTo be more convincing in proving of ML&CCS investment attractiveness, let\u2019s compare it's profitability with **some other assets on high constant demand**. We can choose them from different fields, for example, sugar and coffee from food commodities, cotton from textile and copper as industrial resource. 2015 and 2020 prices for this set of assets were once again sourced online via a quick Google search:\n","11101960":"Which is the odd one out of this set of stable and profitable investments: gold, silver, crude oil, banks deposits or machine learning and cloud computing services (ML&CCS)? \u201cFor sure machine learning!\u201d- I guess many people would suggest immediately, especially those who are not involved in Data Science. And they will be very likely to be mistaken because, depending on the bank, you would hardly find annual rate of deposit return higher than 10%...\n\nLet\u2019s take a look how it\u2019s going\u2026\n\n**What is the investment here?** The 2020 Survey Q25 (\u201cApproximately how much money have you (or your team) spent on machine learning and\/or cloud computing services at home (or at work) in the past 5 years ( approximate $USD )?\u201d) can be interpret as \u201chow much money have you invested in ML&CCS within last 5 years?\u201d. The amount of investment will be the sum of spending for ML&CCS. Since it\u2019s asking about 5 years we can compare these ML&CCS investments with other 5 years\u2019 investment projects. \n\n**What will be the income from such an investment project?** 2020 Survey Q24 (\u201cWhat is your current yearly compensation (approximate $USD)?\u201d) gives information about money people earn by doing different kinds of Data Science, Data Engineering and other Big Data related work. Since ML frameworks, tools, algorithms and methods, roughly speaking, form the basis for Data Science activities and in 2020 Survey Q25 it\u2019s not specified what types of ML&CCS spending were counted in it (so we guess it may be any relative type of spending), we can say that declared compensations are income from ML&CCS investments. For respondents with roles \u201cDatabase engineer\u201d, \u201cSoftware engineer\u201d and \u201cStatistician\u201d ML may not be so often the main part of work but they took part in this Survey and named for Q25 some amounts of ML&CCS investment. Also Survey respondents with all roles definitely may have demand in CCS. So Q24 and Q25 answers of respondents with roles \u201cDatabase engineer\u201d, \u201cSoftware engineer\u201d and \u201cStatistician\u201d were as well included in this research.  \n\n**What is the data population?** We'll take into consideration only those Survey respondents, who answered both questions: Q24 and Q25, including those cases when people gave answer \u201c0\u201d in Q24. But we exclude from this analysis answers of respondents identifying themselves as \u201cstudents\u201d and \u201cOther\u201d because students for objective reasons usually don\u2019t have access to competitive full time jobs before graduating and the \u201cOther\u201d category is something completely uncertain. The \u201cCurrently not employed\u201d answer category is not excluded from the analysis because somebody might has invested in ML&CCS within the last 5 years but be out of work at the moment for some reasons and such situation also reflects sustainability of ML&CCS investments.  \n\n**How profitability is measured?** One of the most common measures of investment efficiency is Return On Investment (ROI), which in general is calculated as net income divided by investment [1]. In our case to estimate profitability of ML&CCS investment in average we can sum all the spendings and all the compensations of the chosen respondents and calculate ROI as following:\n"}}
