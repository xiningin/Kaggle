We can look at the training vs validation accuracy:","81d12333":"### Training","ed5faa0a":"Some basic operations can convert the text to tokens and tokens to unique integers (ids):","70aa9222":"There are a lot of helpers that make using BERT easy with the Transformers library. Depending on the task you might want to use [BertForSequenceClassification](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/transformers\/model_doc\/bert.html#bertforsequenceclassification), [BertForQuestionAnswering](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/transformers\/model_doc\/bert.html#bertforquestionanswering) or something else. \n\nBut who cares, right? We're *hardcore*! We'll use the basic [BertModel](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/transformers\/model_doc\/bert.html#bertmodel) and build our sentiment classifier on top of it. Let's load the model:","922a5dfe":"How do we come up with all hyperparameters?

Note that increasing the batch size reduces the training time significantly, but gives you lower accuracy.\n\nLet's continue with writing a helper function for training our model for one epoch:","fd0ecff1":"We'll use this text to understand the tokenization process:","16504a75":"The tokenizer is doing most of the heavy lifting for us. We also return the review texts, so it'll be easier to evaluate the predictions from our model. Let's split the data:","92d742e2":"Looks like it is really hard to classify neutral (3 stars) reviews. And I can tell you from experience, looking at many reviews, those are hard to classify.\n\nWe'll continue with the confusion matrix:","5fa2b898":"### Special Tokens\n\n`[SEP]` - marker for ending of a sentence\n","ce30b754":"Let's load a pre-trained [BertTokenizer](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/transformers\/model_doc\/bert.html#berttokenizer):","07082eee":"\n\nYou can think of the `pooled_output` as a summary of the content, according to BERT.

Let's check for missing values:","a6858c78":"## What is BERT?\n\nBERT (introduced in [this paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1810.04805)) stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. If you don't know what most of that means - you've come to the right place! Let's unpack the main ideas:\n\n- Bidirectional - to understand the text  you're looking you'll have to look back (at the previous words) and forward (at the next words)\n- Transformers - The [Attention Is All You Need](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1706.03762) paper presented the Transformer model. The Transformer reads entire sequences of tokens at once. In a sense, the model is non-directional, while LSTMs read sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left). The attention mechanism allows for learning contextual relations between words (e.g. `his` in a sentence refers to Jim).\n- (Pre-trained) contextualized word embeddings - [The ELMO paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1802.05365v2) introduced a way to encode words based on their meaning\/context. Nails has multiple meanings - fingernails and metal nails.\n\nBERT was trained by masking 15% of the tokens with the goal to guess them. An additional objective was to predict the next sentence. Let's look at examples of these tasks:\n\n### Masked Language Modeling (Masked LM)\n\nThe objective of this task is to guess the masked tokens. Let's look at an example, and try to not make it harder than it has to be:\n\nThat's `[mask]` she `[mask]` -> That's what she said\n\n### Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\n\nGiven a pair of two sentences, the task is to say whether or not the second follows the first (binary classification). Let's continue with the example:\n\n*Input* = `[CLS]` That's `[mask]` she `[mask]`. [SEP] Hahaha, nice! [SEP]\n\n*Label* = *IsNext*\n\n*Input* = `[CLS]` That's `[mask]` she `[mask]`. [SEP] Dwight, you ignorant `[mask]`! [SEP]\n\n*Label* = *NotNext*\n\nThe training corpus was comprised of two entries: [Toronto Book Corpus](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1506.06724) (800M words) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words). While the original Transformer has an encoder (for reading the input) and a decoder (that makes the prediction), BERT uses only the decoder.\n\nBERT is simply a pre-trained stack of Transformer Encoders. How many Encoders? We have two versions - with 12 (BERT base) and 24 (BERT Large).\n\n### Is This Thing Useful in Practice?\n\nThe BERT paper was released along with [the source code](https:\/\/github.com\/google-research\/bert) and pre-trained models.\n\nThe best part is that you can do Transfer Learning (thanks to the ideas from OpenAI Transformer) with BERT for many NLP tasks - Classification, Question Answering, Entity Recognition, etc. You can train with small amounts of data and achieve great performance!","946699e2":"The accuracy is about 1% lower on the test set.
