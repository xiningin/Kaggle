Lets write the Fibonacci sequence recursively. This will be slightly different that it will only calculate the nth Fibonacci number","54cc301c":"The other application of the functions might be to do something many times (not necessarily in an iteration). One specific and natural way to understand this is to have a list elements and apply a function of the `list`. Lets take a list of first 20 numbers and find which one are prime. We will do this and save the result in a `list`. Lists have an `append` method which allows us to add an element to the end of the list.","b00ddf5e":"We define function using the `def`. Then comes the name of the function, hich in this case is `cube`. we then enclose the function input in paranthesis, in this case `number`. We use `:` to indicate the Python the starting of the body of the function\n\nIn this case th body of the function is vary simple, we return the cube of `number` (we use `**` for exponents in Python). The keyword `return` signals that the function will generate some output. Not every function will have a `return` statement. A `return` statement ends a function","42dc9189":"These default arguments can allow us to create complex function with many inputs while also maintaining ease of use by setting sane defaults.\n\nAnother thing we might want to do is take a variable list of arguments, lets write a similar `todo` function as before, but this time we will allow it to pass in any number of argumnts. Hre we will make use of the `*args` syntax. This `*` tells python to gather th rest of the arguments into the tuple `args`.","da021423":"We can also use a `for` loop to repeat a task a certain number of times, like printing out the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Compare these two Fibonacci functions","5c76d90d":"Now we can just call the function on every element. If  want to change the output, we just need to change the function","bbf6e636":"Python provides a nice construct to apply a function to every element of a list, called a `list comprehension`, here is an example of one:","26b108c2":"Now that we understand how normal arguments work, lets look at a few conveniences Python provides for making functions easier to create. The first is default arguments. Let's suppose we have a function which had a bunch of arguments, but most of them had sane defaults, for example:","6bcd5b9e":"# <a id='MAF'>More about Functions<\/a>\n[Go back to the main page](#main)\n\nNotice that the `ex_1` and `ex_2` has no input, but other functions like `test_high_score` had multiple variables as input. Remember that a function argument is just a placeholder for a name and will b bound to hatever is passed into the function. For Example","5ddd03a0":"We can pass different input to the `cube` function, including variables. When we passed a float to `cube`, float is returned. When we passed an integer, `cube` returned integer. In both cases the input was interpretd by the function as the  argument `number`\n\nNot all possible inputs are valid.","a888a182":"\nHere is a mathematical function defined by \n$$ f(x) = 3x - 5 $$\nwe give function an input and gets an output\n$$ f(6)-> 13 $$\nif we have a variable \n$$ y = 3 $$\nand we evaluate function on y we get same result \n$$ f(y)-> 4 $$","4075490c":"# <a id='last'>Some topics we haven't discussed, but have used<\/a>\n[Go back to the main page](#main)\n- [String formatting](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/reference\/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings)\n- Exceptions (e.g. `TypeError`)","f66961dc":"Since variables are used to store information, it's good idea to give them discriptive names. This increase code readibility, which helps in fixing mistakes, or colloboration ith others","db0d8c1d":"we can also includes **comments** in our lines of code which computer will not execute.These lines can be used to add notes and explanations for the code. We use `#` to start a comment in our code. ","80752a9a":"# <a id='PIAT'>Puting it all together<\/a>\n[Go back to the main page](#main)\n\nWe've learned two of the major components of programs: **variable** and **functions**. We've also learned two of the major components of program control: **conditionals** (`if` statements) and **itrations** (`for` and `while` loops). We can use thse ideas and tools to write code to prform complex tasks. Let's look at an example, involving all of these ideas put together.\n\nBelow we write a function that points out all the prime numbers up to some number `n`. We will use iteration to check if each number is prime. We will use a conditional to print out numbers only if they are prime. We will also break up the task ito small pieces so our code is easy to read and understandable. This means we will use (or call) helper functions inside of our solution.","eae00cde":"# <a id='F'>Functions<\/a>\n[Go back to the main page](#main)","65034a33":"We'll often want the computer only to take an action under certain situations. For Example, we might want a game to print the message 'High Score!', but only if the player's high score is higher than the previous high score. We can write this as a formal logical statement: if the player's score is higher than the previous high scor thn print 'High Score!'\n\nThe syntax for exprssing this logic in python is vry similar. Let's define a function that accepts the player's score and the previous high score as arguments. If the player's score is higher, then it will print 'High score!'. Finally, it will return the new high score (whichever one that is).","1975b70d":"With if statements we use a similar syntax as we used for organizing functions. With functions we had a `def` statement ending with `:`, and an indented body. Similarly for a conditional, we have an if statement ending with `:`, and an indented body.\n\nConditional statements are used to control program flow. We can visualize our example, `test_high_score`, in a decision tree\n\n![programflow_highscore.png](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/VishwasSaini32\/Data-Science\/master\/Python\/images\/programflow_highscore.png)\n\nWe can nest `if` statements to make more complicatd trees"}}
