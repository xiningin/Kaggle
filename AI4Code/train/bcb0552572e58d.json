Add more data points,\"data to tell for itself\". This will decrease the biased outcomes and increase the accuracy of model.\n2.   By effectively treating missing and outlier values\n3.   By calculating RMSE and MSE for the predicted and actual values, Lower the RMSE and MSE Higher the accuracy\n4.   Algorithm tuning can be used by altering algorithm parameters which can give higher accuracy for certain parameters.\n\n","f8592088":"**Q4) Explain multivariant linear regression using a real-life example.**  \n**Answer -** Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.  \nFor example, we can estimate prices of grains in agricultural markets for every day.It's daily price(Y) fluctuations depend on last day's temperature(T), last day's humidity(H), last day's sold out stock(S), last day's market arrivals(A), last day's price of substitute commodity(C) etc. We can form following multiple regression equation.  \n$Y = w0 + w1*T + w2*H + w3*S + w4*A + w5*C + error$  \nThus, from above example we can see that Y(daily price) is a response variable and other mentioned factors are independent\/explanatory variables which are responsible for Y value.","b16af77d":"## THEORY QUESTIONS","e4d25633":"Above Dataframe has only one independent variable and one dependent variable having 30 rows","588651d9":"**Q1) What is overfitting and how to avoid it?**  \n**Answer -** Overfitting in data science means when model learns or fit the details and noise of training data to the extent that it negatively effect the performance, as model will fail to predict future observations reliabily.  \nWays to avoid Overfitting:- \n\n\n1.   Remove extra features\n2.   To ensure number of data points are greater than independent variables\n3.   Cross-Validation, this can be done by dividing Test cases in every proportion for decreasing biased outcomes.\n","793b8ac0":"From above graph we observed at *test_size=0.2* model gives least RMSE value, Thus we split the train and test data according to it.\nWe formed Simple Linear Regression model using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression().fit()` to form the model.","21d46c9a":"**Q2) What is RMSE and MSE? How can you calculate them?**  \n**Answer -** RMSE stands for Root Mean Square Error, it is the standard deviation of the predicted values.  \nTo calculate RMSE:-  \n\n\n1.   calculate the mean of values  \n$U = \\frac{X1 + X2 + ...... + Xn}{n}$\n2.   Sum the squared diffrence of mean value and actual value  \n$\\sum_{i=1}^n (Xi - U)^2$ \n3.   Calculate the mean of above Summation  \n$\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (Xi - U)^2}{n}$ \n4.
