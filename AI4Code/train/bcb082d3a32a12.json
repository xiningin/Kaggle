For example, looking to age. we can see a correlation about who has a great spending score and a young age. Looking to annual income, we can see that people who earns around 50k, has a similar spending score.\n\nand once again, gender doesn't seems to have a huge impact. \n\nAnd now is time to try some clusters, from the two graphs above (forgeting about the age. We are going to compare:\n\n* k means\n* Hierarchical Cluster (Ward)\n* Hierarchical Cluster (Complete)\n* DBS\n\nAll the parameters will be available for practicing. Remember that:\n\n* **K means** : Number of clusters\n* **Hierarchical Clusters**: Number of clusters\n* **DBS** : Epsilon and distance.","67ec2919":"As detailed above, we can see that, there aren't some strong differences about Gender and their anual income. When look at age, we can see that the people who receives more money, are the ones between 27 and 50 (by the graphic we conclude that young or retired people at this case does not have more than 100k annual income).\n\nthe next step then, it's to analyse each isolated variable (Age and anual income, with the Spending Score","b7b9931c":"As you can see above, there is some outliers in the income plot, however it won't be necessary a issue. In order to improve visualization, in the income and score plots, it can be used ranges of values to reduce the number of features in the x axis.\n\nThe next step is to get a deeper understand of the data. Let's now plot how the data is distributed using different colors from male and female, the axis Y as the income plot and the axis X as the age.","ca42e6f7":"Hello everyone. At this notebook, we will examine the data and then apply some clustering technique. I am using to practice and I will be really glad if I receive tips fom you guys. If in someway, I am helping anyone to improve his knowledge, please let me know :).\n\nSo, firstly, we're gonna download the data and have a look at its columns","950c4ea9":"As you guys can see above, the data has 5 columns, where:\n\nthere is a customer ID to have a reference about a customer\nHis gender, divided in Male and Female.\nHis age\nHis annual income\nAnd his spending score.\nNext step is to see the range for all the variables and see if there is outliers"}}
