Naive bayes are good at text classification task like spam filtering, sentimental analysis, RS etc. \n2. As we know when a model performs good on training data but poor performence on unseen data(test data)i.e. its dependent on training data only, tends to overfits and when a model perform poor performence on training data and good performence on test data i.e. it fails to learn relationship in training data tends to underfit. We need to balance between both i.e. reduce training error and balance error between both training and testing which is balanced in this case.\n3. Another concept bias vs variance is also related with underfitting and overfitting. when a model has high bias and low variance tend to underfitting and its reverse- high variance and low bias called overfitting and we balanced using cross-validataion. As it is shown in below table where both models have low trainig error and test error.\n4. overall, both of the models are performing well on unseen data.\n5. As we are not applying naive bayes on word2vec representation because it sometimes gives -ve value(i.e. if two word have 0 cosine similarity the word is completly orthogonal i.e. they are not related with each other. and 1 represents perfect relationship between word vector. whereas -ve similarity means they are perfect opposite relationship between word) and we know naive bayes assume that presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to presence of any other feature, which is most unlikely in real word. Although, it works well.\n6. And from point # 5, features are dependent or there are relationship between features. So applying naive bayes on dependent feature does not make any sense.","b2f01e1e":"**Terminology**<br>\n\n**true positives (TP):** We predicted +ve review, and review is also +ve.<br>\n**true negatives (TN):** We predicted -ve, and review is also -ve.<br>\n**false positives (FP):** We predicted +ve, but the review is not actually +ve.(Also known as a \"Type I error.\")<br>\n**false negatives (FN):** We predicted -ve, but the review is actually +ve.(Also known as a \"Type II error.\")<br>\n","a8c0cfc1":"<b>Observation:-<\/b> It was also seen that in two rows given below the value of HelpfulnessNumerator is greater than HelpfulnessDenominator which is not practically possible hence these two rows too are removed from calcualtions","0f46e38f":"As can be seen above the same user has multiple reviews of the with the same values for HelpfulnessNumerator, HelpfulnessDenominator, Score, Time, Summary and Text  and on doing analysis it was found that <br>\n<br> \nProductId=B000HDOPZG was Loacker Quadratini Vanilla Wafer Cookies, 8.82-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8)<br>\n<br> \nProductId=B000HDL1RQ was Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookies, 8.82-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8) and so on<br>\n\nIt was inferred after analysis that reviews with same parameters other than ProductId belonged to the same product just having different flavour or quantity.
