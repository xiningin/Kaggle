Data","d752af6a":"According to the our analysis, the price of the proper on Airbnb in Amsterdam mostly varies based on the number of accommodates\/the number of bedrooms, the location and the extra fee (cleaning fee\/fee for extra people). Bigger house and house close to city center or public transportation can be more expensive than the other. And the price can be higher if the extra fee is included in the price. Also, properties that locate near nightlife spots can be more expensive.\n\nHere are my recommendations:\n\nIf you want to rent your house in Amsterdam on Airbnb:\n* If you have a house in the popular neighbourhoods, then congratulations, you can rent your house in a good price.\n* Ask for reviews from your guests. People trust on the previous review than your description and pictures. Showing on time when checking-in, being honest and providing good service (such as allowing extra guest) can really helpful on gaining higher review scores.\n\nIf you are going to visit Amsterdam and want to live in a local house:\n* The more bedrooms and bathrooms in the house, the price can be more expensive. If you can find more travelling partners who don't mind sharing bedrooms or bathrooms with you, the average price per person can be very fair.\n* It is always expensice to live in the center. If you really care about living close to center, I recommend to live in the neighbourhood of Oud-West which has the most number of houses but the median price ranks the 5th expensive neighbourhood. If you have an empty wallet, considering the mature public transportation network of Amsterdam, I recommend to live in the neighourhood far away from the center. Even if you live the suburb, a less than 30-minutes train can take you to the center.\n* Places having many restaurants and shopping places nearby can be expensive. You can choose other places if you don't necessarily eat or shop near the place you live.\n* If you are a night owl and a lover to night clubs of Amsterdam, unfortunately, you might need to prepare more budgets on accommodation.\n\nThere are might be other factors can effect the price such as the decoration of the property and the service the host can provide. Unfortunately, we can't go through the influence of all of possible factors due to the unavailability of the data. However, I believe my analysis is extremely valuable for the hosts from Amsterdam who wants to define the price of their proprieties or tourists who want to have a estimate of the accommodation cost based on their requirements and budgets. This analysis can also be applied to any other city in the world.","a98b8fd6":"Given the information of the property, we would like to predict its price.

Tourists might don't want to spend a lot of time on finding restaurants or shopping places. What really surprises me is that Travel & Transport is ranked as the least important feature by three models. If we compare the area of Amsterdam and other famous tourism cities in the world, for instance, new york, the area of New york is three times larger that Amsterdam.
