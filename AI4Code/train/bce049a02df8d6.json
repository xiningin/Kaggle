The base case is when all predictions are equal and can be normalized. In this case it doesn't matter which prediction is selected, as they are all equal. If they are not all equal, the normalizable prediction from the best scoring submission is selected. If no prediction could be normalized the prediction from the best scoring submission is used.","d9e19d3e":"This next column decleration is important and will be used later on.

The concept behind assembling is simple, training a model will improve the overall score, however there will be mistakes introduced which weren't made earlier. I.e. there will exists prediction in the 2.12 LB submission which are predicted correctly in the 2.21 LB submission. Those are the prediction we are interested in and want to find.","3f3f7690":"These next percentages indicate how many InChI's were not valid and could therefore not be normalized.
