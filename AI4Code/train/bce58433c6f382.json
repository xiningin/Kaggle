Ion channels are pore-forming proteins present in animals and plants. They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. \n\nWhen ion channels open, they pass electric currents. Existing methods of detecting these state changes are slow and laborious. In this competition, we will use ion channel data to better model automatic identification methods.\n\n![Pic](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/kaggle-media\/competitions\/Liverpool\/ion%20image.jpg)\n\n### Notebook Objective\n\nObjective of the notebook is to explore the given data and find any useful insghts along the way.\n\n### Dataset Summary\n\nFirst let us look at the files that are given to us.","88d5851a":"** Work in progress. Please stay tuned!**","8e560539":"   To explore more, let us take the first five seconds and look at the distribution of `signal` and `open_channels`","c5d4c7ee":"Column descriptions are\n\n* time - time of observation\n* signal - the input signal to use\n* open_channels - target variable\n\nIt is also mentioned in the dataset page that, while the time series appears continuous, the data is from discrete batches of 50 seconds long 10 kHz samples (500,000 rows per batch). In other words, the data from 0.0001 - 50.0000 is a different batch than 50.0001 - 100.0000, and thus discontinuous between 50.0000 and 50.0001.\n\n**So this means, we have 10 batches in our training data and 4 batches in our test data**\n\n### Target Distribution\n\nFirst let us start exploring the target variable - `open_channels`. We can get the count of each of the classes in the target.","409f3d9d":"We have been given three files - train, test and sample submission.
