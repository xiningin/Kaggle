This can be credited and explained by their opulent investments in athletes and the sports infrastructure surrounding them. \n\n\n- **Plot-2**: The \"Pair-Plot\" is used to examine the trends between the key variables in our dataset.One of the conclusions is that the parameters \"Height\" and \"Weight\" have been rising in the positive direction through time, whilst the parameter \"Age\" has been nearly constant.\n\n\n- **Plot-3**: The \"Box-Plot\" shows that the median age of athletes has remained relatively constant during a 120-year period, hovering around \"25\" - \"26\" years. This trend is scientifically supported by the fact that most humans\u00a0are at their athletic peak between the ages of 20 and 30, after which they begin to experience irreversible changes in their bodies.\n\n\n- **Plot-4**: Over the years, the overall trends in the number of competitors in the Olympics have progressively drifted upwards. However, there is a substantial drop in the number of participants in three instances (1932, 1956, and 1980). This can be assessed in two parts:\n   - Because the 1932 Olympics took place during the Great Depression, very few countries sent teams\u00a0to compete.\n   - Due to total boycotts by various groups of nations over geo-political reasons, participation in the 1956 and 1980 Olympics was highly restricted.\n\n\n- **Plot-5**: Since the 1908s, women's participation in the Olympics has been on a positive trajectory. Another interesting fact to note is that the number of female athletes virtually doubled in 1952 compared to the previous Olympics.\n\n\n- **Plot-6**: Despite the fact that the number of male and female players has increased since the inaugural edition of the event in 1896, the numbers skew towards male athletes. Without dismissing the element of gender-bias, it can be explained in part by the fact that; most sports historically have centered and evolved around men.\n\n\n- **Plot-7**: The Height & Weight of athletes follows a distinct trend with respect to their sport. Sports like Weightlifting and Basketball have higher ratios while other sports such as Gymnastics and Rhythmic Gymnastics have lower ratios. This trend can be explained by the fact that; both the latter described sports are majorly female dominated with almost negligible participation from male athletes. Another interesting observation is that gymnasts are substantially younger than athletes competing in sports such as basketball and volleyball.\n\n\n- **Plot-8.0**: The top 3 nations to win the most number of Gold medals are: \n    - 1. USA\n    - 2. Soviet Union\n    - 3. Russia\n- **Plot-8.1**: The top 3 nations to win the most number of Silver medals are: \n    - 1. USA\n    - 2. Soviet Union\n    - 3. The Great Britain\n- **Plot-8.2**: The top 3 nations to win the most number of Bronze medals are:\n    - 1. USA\n    - 2. Germany\n    - 3. Soviet Union\n\n\n- **Plot-9**: American athletes brought home the most number of medals per person. From the visualization, it evident that the Americans love Gold medals more in comparison to Silver and Bronze.  \n  - Increased sports investment contributed to a progressive improvement in their medal count under President Theodore Roosevelt's leadership beginning in the 1900s, with the exception of the 1906 edition (The 1906 Olympics was intercalated due to which the medal tally from this edition was not officially recognised). \n\n\n- **Plot-10**: It is evident from this plot that female American athletes have consistently won medals and brought more glory to their country in recent years than their male colleagues.\n\n\n- **Plot-11**: The majority of India's medals have come from sports like as hockey, wrestling, and shooting, to mention a few. Because hockey is a national sport, it has always had a great deal of significance. Wrestling and archery, on the other hand, have long been important parts of diverse regional cultures. \n\n\n- **Plot-12**:  The Top 3 male athletes by the number of medals they've won are:\n    - 1. Michael Fred Phelps \n    - 2. Nikolay Andrianov\n    - 3. Borys Shakhlin\n\n\n- **Plot-13**:  The Top 3 female athletes by the number of medals they've won are:\n    - 1. Larysa Latynina\n    - 2. Jennifer Thompson\n    - 3. Dara Torres    \n\n\n- **Plot-14**: This visualization has plotted all the cities that have hosted the Olympic games. Here, it is evident that almost edition has been hosted by a first world country except for three instances i.e (Moscow:1980, Beijing:2008, Rio De Janeiro:2016) \n\n\n- **Plot-15**: The sports of athletics, gymnastics, and swimming have the greatest number of associated events, as seen in the tree-map. One probable explanation is that these sports have been around for millennia and did not require any specialised equipment. As a result, as a subset of the original sport, it has evolved to include a broad variety of events.","3b8b8a93":"## \u2753 Ask Questions Related To The Dataset","369b73d9":"- Now let us use `.info()` method to summarise the datatypes of all the 15 columns in our dataset.","035cadfd":"# \ud83d\udcca A Brief Outline Of The Dataset\nThis is a [comprehensive dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/heesoo37\/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) of the modern-day Olympic Games, spanning and having records of games all the way from 1896, Athens Olympics to 2016, Rio Olympics.\nThe dataset contains **271116 instances and 15 attributes**. \n\nEach **instance** corresponds to an **individual athlete** competing in an **individual Olympic event (athlete-events)**. \nWhile the **attribute** consists of various inputs as follows (to name a few):\n- ID - Unique number for each athlete\n- Name - Athlete's name\n- Sex - M or F\n- Age - Integer\n- Height - In centimeters\n- Weight - In kilograms\n- Team - Team name\n- Medal- Gold, Silver, Bronze","dac5e553":"- Cool, now let us also verify the number of rows the the dataset holds:","17e36258":"131 gold medals!
