Since here we have very less coloums so its easy but in the case of more coloums what we can do is by using **df.corr()** which help to find the correlation between each coloum and then **annot = True** helps us to find how much they are co-related. So lets have a look guys","8e36b329":"So here we are going to see the intercept and the coff of each of the attribute so its like\n**Y = x1+ m1*x2+m2*x3+....+e****  and son for the multiple regression where **e**** is the random noise and **x1+ m1*x2+m2*x3**** is linear predictors","fc57357a":"So here we can see the actual value and predicited value returned by our datset.... :)","a98a1e3a":"So when we looked our dataset we have found that the there is only one coloumn that is categorical and need to change to numeric and so i have used the pandas to get the  dummies its really a very powerful tool... Believe me guys!!!!","a0c694c8":"****So here we are going to predict the profit of the startsup based on the given factors and we will also see that which factors make most to help us.\nIt is a very small dataset so me being a beginner suggest others also to start with this..\nSmall always makes Big :)","6d376498":"So above you can see in order to predict the price the major role is played by the R&D speed > Marketing Speed > Administration > state.\nSO here thats it but in future if you have more coloums you can try out which makes so much things easy."}}
