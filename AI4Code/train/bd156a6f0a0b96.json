Design:**\n\nWe are going to make use of two models; ElasticNet and XGBregressor. Our final predictions are going to an average of the two models. One could add more models and most likely improve on the accuracy of the final prediction.","02f7ae47":"So clearly, there are a few features where there a large number of samples are missing values. Rather than just removing them outright, I took a slightly different approach. I am first going measure the mutual information of each feature for our target variable and then select the features that pass a cutoff. To do this, we are first going to normalize and transform the values before computing the mutual information.","e35bfb51":"I think the first thing that I noticed was that there are lot of NaNs in some of the features. This can be quite a problem, since NaNs can imply a lack of knowledge for that sample. However given that we have so many features, it is possible that we can remove a few features due to missing values.","d2e89c22":"Now lets scale our target variable. I tried several methods, but the log method won in the end and produced the best results.","a6d18fb6":"Hello everyone, this is my attempt at the housing prices. I will explain my thought process on how I designed my model, and areas that I think can still be improved. Feel free to fork this notebook for your own attempt and try to improve the model yourself! If this notebook has helped you, please upvote and leave a comment if you notice any mistakes!\n\nCheers,\nEugene","f20166cb":"Now let's take a look at the mutual information of each variable. We see that there are quite a few standouts and quite a few variables that show some promise. Some might argue that the 0.1 cutoff was too lenient or too harsh. That might be true, but the variables are already quite correlated, and so the addition of lesser informative variable most likely won't help too much."}}
