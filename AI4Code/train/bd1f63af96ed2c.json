IR through tf-idf is deterministic, requires no training time, and is very fast.\n> 2. Providing summaries helps user identify at a glance whether or not they're interested in a specific document.\n> 3. Built system is not task specific: works on all 10 tasks\/subtasks and for any query. \n \n- **Cons:**\n> 1. System returns top n documents related to query, where n is a fixed user specified value that is not related to the query at hand. i.e: some queries might have more highly relevant documents than n, and some might have less than n and therefore return some documents which aren't very relevant.\n> 2. Summarization is done to each document disregarding the context of the query.
