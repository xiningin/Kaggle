The reason for this maybe that with this approach, no matter how big the dataset is, we will remember to explore each and every feature in the data to learn as much as we can about the data.","8b8a24c2":"# Loading and printing the first few rows ","68c93b9a":"We can see the distribution of listing between the top 10 hosts. The top host has 300+ listings.","48c96c59":"We can see how the host  are simply describing their listing in a short form with very specific terms for easier search by a potential traveller. Such words are 'room', 'bedroom', 'private', 'apartment', 'beautiful' etc. This shows that there are no catchphrases or 'popular\/trending' terms that are used for names; hosts use very simple terms for describing the space and the area where the listing is. This technique was somewhat expected as dealing with multilingual customers can be tricky and you definitely want ot describe your space in a concise and understood form as much as possible.","3d0bc643":"The scatterplot worked just fine to output our latitude and longitude points. However, it would be nice to have a map below for fully immersive heatmap in our case - let's see what we can do!","1b1d54e1":"Lets breakdown what we can see from this plot. First, we can see that our plot consists of 3 subplots - that is the power of using catplot.\nWith such output we can easily proceed with comparing distributions among interesting attributes. Y and X axes stay exactly the same for each subplot, Y-axis represents a count of observations and X-axis observations we want to count. However, there are 2 more important elements; column and hue; those 2 differentiate subplots. After we specify the column and determined hue we are able to observe and compare our Y and X axes among specified column as well as color-coded. <br>\nThe observation that is definitely contrasted the most is that `Shared room` tyype Airbnb listing is barely available among 10 most listing populated neighbourhooods. Then, we can see that for these 10 neighbourhood only 2 boroughs are represented: Manhattan and Brooklyn; that was somewhat expected as Manhattan and Brooklyn are one of the most travelled destinations, therefore would have the most listing availability. We can also observe that Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg are the most popular for Manharran borough, and Harlem for Brooklyn","fbd11a72":"From this output we can understand that top reviewed listing have an average price of \\$65 with most of the listing under \\$50 and 9\/10 of them are 'Private room' type; top reviewed listing has 629  reviews","065aaac9":"Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today Airbnb has become a kind of a service that is used and preferred all over the world. Data analysis on huge number of listing provided through Airbnb is crucial for the company. This huge amount of listings generate a lot of data that can be used to understand the customers, hosts, behaviour and performance etc on the platform.","ff72fd26":"We can just drop the columns like `last_review`,`id` and `host_name` as the dont necessarily add any significant information to our analysis. Also we can fill the nulls in `reviews_per_month` with 0.","d1a8d359":"# Prices by neighbourhood_groups","af5981d2":"# Conclusion\n\nThis Airbnb dataset for 2019 appeared to be a very rich dataset with a variety of columns that allowed us to do deep data exploration on each significant column presented. First we have found hosts that take good advantage of the Airbnb platform and provide the most listings; we found that out top host has 327 listings. After that, we proceeded with analyzing the boroughs and neighbourhood listing densities and what areas were more popular than another. Next we put good use of our latitude and longitude columns and used to create a geographical heatmap color-coded by price of listings. Further, we came back to the first column with name strings and had to do a bit more coding to parse each title and analyze existinh trends on how listings are named as well as what was the count for the most used words by hosts. Lastly we found the most reviewed listings and analyzed some additional attributed. For our data exploration purposes, it also would be nice to have a couple additional features, such as positive and negative numeric reviews or 0-5 star average review for each listing; addition of these features would help to determine the best-reviewed hosts for NYC along with 'number_of_review' column that is provided. Overall, we discovered a very good number of interesting relationships between features and explained each step of the process.","c3eff6c3":"# Data Wrangling","a4f9d100":"The missing values in the above output doesn't seem like the need special consideration. The `name`,`host_name` are not required for our analysis. The null values counts in `last_review` and `reviews_per_month` are equal. This makes sense as the `last_review` is a date and if there are no reviews for a particular entry, then it will be empty. Same is the case with `reviews_per_month`.","a5d5378d":"# Exploring and Visualizing the data","c74bb4c2":"The above table shows the summary statistics for prices of each of the `neighbourhood_group`. It can be observed that there are a lot of outliers on the higher side of the price.<br>\nWe can cut the outliers from the data for better visualization.","41488619":"With the statistical table and the violinplot we can definitely observe a couple of things about the distribution of prices for Airbnb in NYC. First, we can see that Manhattan has the highest median price of \\$150  per night, followed by Brooklyn at \\$90 per night. Queens and Staten Island have similar distribution and Bronx is the cheapers of all.\nThis distribution and densities comes as no surprise as it is a known fact that manhattan is one of the most expensive places on earth, where as Bronx appears to have lower standards of living","2eda7317":"Understanding the unique values and the categorical data that we had in out dataset was the last step we had to do. It looks like for those column values we will be doing some mapping to prepare the dataset for predictive analysis.","0ba02ed8":"By checking the dtypes of the dataframe we can see that the data provides rich amount of features to explore the data. \nNext We need to check for the null values in the data and make sense out of them i.e. whether the null values are due to data collection error or the null values signify something.","ba137cef":"## About the dataset\nThe dataset contains about 49000 rows of NYC Airbnb Data."}}
