And, some document has kana pronouncing(#1, #2, #4, ...).  \nIn this competition, the kana pronouncing letters shall be ignored. Normally, the kana pronouncing letters are write smaller size than main letters (Some people write in large letters ...). #10 document have kuzusiji letter, so this image should no label in submission data. \nAnd, I think, there are beautiful letters and dirty letters. For example, #12 document is easy to read because the letters are written carefully (or Woodblock printing document), but #1 is a litter difficult beacuse the letters are durty ( perhaps, this document is handwritten document).  \n  \nWe shall try to recognise these variety of documents."}}
