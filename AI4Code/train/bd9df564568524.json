It can be seen as a preprocessing step to an estimator. Scikit-learn exposes feature selection routines as objects that implement the transform method.\n\n- The methods based on F-test estimate the degree of linear dependency between two random variables. They assume a linear relationship between the feature and the target. These methods also assume that the variables follow a Gaussian distribution.\n\n- There are 4 methods that fall under this category :-\n\n  1. SelectKBest\n  2. SelectPercentile\n  3. SelectFpr, SelectFdr, or family wise error SelectFwe\n  4. GenericUnivariateSelection\n  \nSource : https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/feature_selection.html\n\n\n- Here, I will limit the discussion to SelectKBest and SelectPercentile, because these two are most commonly used in practice.","9f69a9d8":"- We can see that we have dropped the third column from the original dataset.","865a5efb":"- Using Pearson correlation our returned coefficient values will vary between -1 and 1.\n\n- If the correlation between two features is 0 this means that changing any of these two features will not affect the other.\n\n- If the correlation between two features is greater than 0 this means that increasing the values in one feature will make increase also the values in the other feature (the closer the correlation coefficient is to 1 and the stronger is going to be this bond between the two different features).\n\n- If the correlation between two features is less than 0 this means that increasing the values in one feature will make decrease the values in the other feature (the closer the correlation coefficient is to -1 and the stronger is going to be this relationship between the two different features).\n\n- In this analysis we will check if the selected variables are highly correlated with each other. If they are, we would then need to keep just one of the correlated ones and drop the others.","21ced8c6":"## **3.3 Exhaustive Feature Selection** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3.3\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1) \n\n\n- In an exhaustive feature selection the best subset of features is selected, over all possible feature subsets, by optimizing a specified performance metric for a certain machine learning algorithm. For example, if the classifier is a logistic regression and the dataset consists of 4 features, the algorithm will evaluate all 15 feature combinations as follows:\n\n  - all possible combinations of 1 feature\n  - all possible combinations of 2 features\n  - all possible combinations of 3 features\n  - all the 4 features\n  \n  \nand select the one that results in the best performance (e.g., classification accuracy) of the logistic regression classifier.\n\n- This is another greedy algorithm as it evaluates all possible feature combinations. It is quite computationally expensive, and sometimes, if feature space is big, even unfeasible.\n\n- There is a special package for python that implements this type of feature selection: mlxtend.\n\n- In the mlxtend implementation of the exhaustive feature selection, the stopping criteria is an arbitrarily set number of features. So the search will finish when we reach the desired number of selected features.\n\n- This is somewhat arbitrary because we may be selecting a subopimal number of features, or likewise, a high number of features.","a8d975c7":"- We then use the transform function to reduce the training and testing sets.","d77fe6b0":"## **4.2 Random Forest Importance**<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4.2\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n- Random forests are one the most popular machine learning algorithms. They are so successful because they provide in general a good predictive performance, low overfitting and easy interpretability. This interpretability is given by the fact that it is straightforward to derive the importance of each variable on the tree decision. In other words, it is easy to compute how much each variable is contributing to the decision.\n\n- Random forests consist of 4-12 hundred decision trees, each of them built over a random extraction of the observations from the dataset and a random extraction of the features. Not every tree sees all the features or all the observations, and this guarantees that the trees are de-correlated and therefore less prone to over-fitting. Each tree is also a sequence of yes-no questions based on a single or combination of features. At each node (this is at each question), the three divides the dataset into 2 buckets, each of them hosting observations that are more similar among themselves and different from the ones in the other bucket. Therefore, the importance of each feature is derived by how \"pure\" each of the buckets is.\n\n- For classification, the measure of impurity is either the Gini impurity or the information gain\/entropy. For regression the measure of impurity is variance. Therefore, when training a tree, it is possible to compute how much each feature decreases the impurity. The more a feature decreases the impurity, the more important the feature is. In random forests, the impurity decrease from each feature can be averaged across trees to determine the final importance of the variable.\n\n- To give a better intuition, features that are selected at the top of the trees are in general more important than features that are selected at the end nodes of the trees, as generally the top splits lead to bigger information gains.\n\n- Please see my kernel, [Random Forest Classifier + Feature Importance - Section 13. Find important features with Random Forest model](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/prashant111\/random-forest-classifier-feature-importance) to know how to find important features using the random forest model.\n\n- I will demonstrate this process using the mushroom classification dataset as follows:-","d65409b5":"## **3.4 Recursive Feature elimination** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3.4\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1) \n\n\n- It is a greedy optimization algorithm which aims to find the best performing feature subset. It repeatedly creates models and keeps aside the best or the worst performing feature at each iteration. It constructs the next model with the left features until all the features are exhausted. It then ranks the features based on the order of their elimination.\n\n- Recursive feature elimination performs a greedy search to find the best performing feature subset. It iteratively creates models and determines the best or the worst performing feature at each iteration. It constructs the subsequent models with the left features until all the features are explored. It then ranks the features based on the order of their elimination. In the worst case, if a dataset contains N number of features RFE will do a greedy search for 2N combinations of features.\n\n- Source : https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/auto_examples\/feature_selection\/plot_rfe_digits.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-feature-selection-plot-rfe-digits-py","1e920f54":"## **2.6 Correlation-Matrix with Heatmap** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.6\"><\/a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- **Correlation** is a measure of the linear relationship of 2 or more variables.

We can find features that are correlated with each other.

For example, we can transform a categorical variable to ordinal, even if it is not, and see if any interesting results come out.\n\n- We can also make a numerical variable discrete (e.g. bins); try categorical-based measures.\n\n- Some statistical measures assume properties of the variables, such as Pearson\u2019s that assumes a Gaussian probability distribution to the observations and a linear relationship. You can transform the data to meet the expectations of the test and try the test regardless of the expectations and compare results.\n\n\n## **What Is the Best Method?**\n\n- There is no best feature selection method. Just like there is no best set of input variables or best machine learning algorithm. \n\n- Instead, we must discover what works best for your specific problem using careful systematic experimentation.\n\n- We should try a range of different models fit on different subsets of features chosen via different statistical measures and discover what works best for your specific problem.\n\n\n## **4 best ways of Feature Selection**\n\n- The 4 practical ways of feature selection which yield best results are as follows:-\n\n    1.

So we should be careful when removing these type of features.

In each iteration, we keep adding the feature which best improves our model till an addition of a new variable does not improve the performance of the model.\n\n- The procedure starts with an empty set of features [reduced set]. The best of the original features is determined and added to the reduced set. At each subsequent iteration, the best of the remaining original attributes is added to the set.\n\n- Step forward feature selection starts by evaluating all features individually and selects the one that generates the best performing algorithm, according to a pre-set evaluation criteria. In the second step, it evaluates all possible combinations of the selected feature and a second feature, and selects the pair that produce the best performing algorithm based on the same pre-set criteria.\n\n- The pre-set criteria can be the roc_auc for classification and the r squared for regression for example.\n\n- This selection procedure is called greedy, because it evaluates all possible single, double, triple and so on feature combinations. Therefore, it is quite computationally expensive, and sometimes, if feature space is big, even unfeasible.\n\n- There is a special package for python that implements this type of feature selection: mlxtend.\n\n- In the mlxtend implementation of the step forward feature selection, the stopping criteria is an arbitrarily set number of features. So the search will finish when we reach the desired number of selected features.\n\n- I will demonstrate the Step Forward feature selection algorithm from mlxtend using the House Price dataset.\n","b65eb5b1":"- We can see that 107 columns \/ variables are almost constant.

Therefore, that feature can be removed from the model.\n\n- I will demonstrate how to select features using the Lasso regularisation on the House Price dataset from Kaggle.","6b59698b":"### **Removing quasi-constant features**\n\n#### **Using variance threshold from sklearn**\n\n- Variance threshold from sklearn is a simple baseline approach to feature selection. It removes all features which variance doesn\u2019t meet some threshold. By default, it removes all zero-variance features, i.e., features that have the same value in all samples.\n\n- Here, I will change the default threshold to remove almost \/ quasi-constant features.","59725bb4":"- Now we know which features are most important in the Random Forest model, we can train our model just using these features. \n\n- I have implemented this in the kernel - [Random Forest Classifier + Feature Importance : Section 15 - Build the Random Forest model on selected features](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/prashant111\/random-forest-classifier-feature-importance). It resulted in improved accuracy."}}
