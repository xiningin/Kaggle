We can start to isolate some interesting trends. if we highlight just the world columns we can see as a whole we are becoming much better fed even with the rising population our overall access to meat has grown tremendously. Yet this doesn't paint the entire picture. Just because the overall production is increasing doesn't mean that the resource is being equitably distributed.

It shows to a degree the prosperity of a nation. This consumable luxury good has a rather high resource demand in comparison to substitute goods. In this kernel, I will be exploring this relation of meat consumption over time and try and explain the visualizations with further research to have a better understanding of the country's history through the meat it produces.

Say you isolate a variable. You will notice two dotted lines are shown the bottom is in KG per capita this is how much of that eat source people get per year. and the total output in thousands of tons or 'THND_TONNE'.","ec148a0d":"When looking on a global scale we see the largest rise in poultry, which nearly tripled, this could be due to the efficiency of the animal. Poultry production has a few things that could explain this boom. When looking at animal production feed conversion ratio is an important metric. This is the amount of food needed to increase the animal's weight by one. so the lower the ratio the better the animal is at growing. Chickens have a [feed conversion ratio of 1.6](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feed_conversion_ratio#:~:text=In%20animal%20husbandry%2C%20feed%20conversion,feed%20into%20the%20desired%20output.&text=FCR%20is%20the%20mass%20of,mass%20of%20milk%20or%20meat). This paired with the resource requirements of the small animal make it perfect for large scale and local production. we also see a large growth in pigs which are considered to have a fair to good [conversion ratio of 3.8-4](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feed_conversion_ratio#:~:text=In%20animal%20husbandry%2C%20feed%20conversion,feed%20into%20the%20desired%20output.&text=FCR%20is%20the%20mass%20of,mass%20of%20milk%20or%20meat). Pigs also can eat from an extremely wide variety of sources making them easier to raise. They have been called a living [garbage disposal](https:\/\/www.washingtonian.com\/2018\/08\/27\/dc-used-to-feed-its-trash-to-pigs-whyd-we-stop\/).\n\nBut this data is hard to read with the aggregate groups like BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) so let's separate these graphs.
