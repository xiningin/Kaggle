Instead, they explained that male relatives could take their place, according to three of the women involved and the bank's manager.\"\n\n\"I taught myself English and even learned how to operate a computer, but now I will have to look for a place where I can just work with more women around.\"\n\n\"The incident is an early sign that some of the rights won by Afghan women over the 20 years since the hardline Islamist militant movement was toppled could be reversed if it returns to power.\"\n\n\"The Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, have overrun many of Afghanistan's biggest cities in recent days and are closing in on the capital Kabul.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.voanews.com\/us-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal\/afghan-women-forced-banking-jobs-taliban-take-control"}}
