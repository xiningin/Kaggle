This peaked my interest so after research, it appears that the main contributing factors were: Lack of Staff, Rising Costs, and Overtourism. Simply put, supply and demand.","74866a2f":"## Hypothesis\nIf parents were to choose the most optimal time to have kids, then they'd likeley choose ages 30-40, because of many factors listed in the above conclusion.","91346cd0":"# Conclusion 1\/2\n\nBased on the data below, health care charges increase the older you get. As most of us get older, we are prone to more health issue due to the basic effects of aging. There are some unexplainable drops in charges in certain age groups however from a linear regression standpoint, there is a consistent upward increase in charges as we get older.","8c7f54bc":"# Conclusion 1\/2:\n\nIf you're like, you probably prefer not to have flight delays when on vacation, business trips, etc. If your time is more important than comftorability, then you're probably going to have a better experience if you avoid flying with Frontier Airlines, Express Jet, Mesa Airlines, and AirTran Airways based off of our data above.\n","974f9832":"## Hypothesis\nIf airlines experience can't keep up with supply and demand, then it is likely that flights are more prone to delays, because many contributing factors such as lack of staff, rising cost\/inflation, and overtourism.","16aa43c1":"# Data Set 1\/2:","d5a73f54":"- UA = United Airlines\n- AA = American Airlines\n- B6 = JetBlue AIrways Corporation\n- DL = Delta Air Lines\n- EV = ExpressJet\n- MQ = Envoy Air\n- US = US Airways\n- WN = Southwest Airlines\n- VX = Virgin America\n- FL = AirTran Airways\n- AS = Alaska Airlines\n- 9E = Endeavor Air\n- F9 = Frontier Airlines\n- HA = Hawaiian Airlines\n- YV = Mesa Airlines\n- OO = SkyWest Airlines\n","b759b634":"# Conclusion 2\/2\nPer the data below, couples tend to have the most amount of kids while in their 30's. In today's society, the age 30-40 age group tends to be the most common age to have kids due to many factors for ex: job security, maturity, marriage, medical reasoings, etc. They also may of had kids already in their 20's and decided to have a few more in their 30's. The average amount of children seem to decrease as people get older likely due to unfortunate circumstances."}}
