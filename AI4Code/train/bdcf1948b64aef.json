unintentionally lend more weight to some features over others. We will fit a standardizer to the training data, and transform the training, validation, and test data based on this scaler.","11d4b109":"Now we can focus on developing a model to accurately detect fraudulent activity. Due to the huge class imbalance in our dataset, a model that simply identifies all transactions as not being fraudulent would score high accuracy. There also would not be many fraudulent samples for the model to learn from to be able to accurately identify what a fraulent transaction is. Therefore, we should find a way to balance out the number of positive and negatives instances in our training set. This can be done by either oversampling the positive instances, or undersampling the negative instances. Undersampling the negative instances would involve reducing the number of non-fraudulent transactions until the ratio between positive and negative instances was approximately 1-to-1. Since we don't have that many data samples, I fear doing so would severely limit our model's performance, since it would have much less data to train on. We shall therefore oversample the positive instances in our training data.\n\nTo oversample the positive instances in our training set, we will add copies of them to it, but with their feature values slightly tweaked. This slight manipulation of the data is done so as to have the copies being different from their original counterparts, but not too different as to end up teaching our model false information. This tweaking will be done by multiplying each positive sample copy's feature values by a number between the uniform distribution of 0.9 and 1.1.","2cbfdbb0":"# Detecting Credit Card Fraud with Neural Networks","e201c93f":"## Training a Model","dacf8f17":"Viewing the loss and accuracy graphs, we can see that after some initial improvements, we seemed to reach convergence after only a few epochs.

Spending more time fine-tuning the neural network architecture, as well as manipulating the features in the dataset, could perhaps further improve upon these results. Regardless, I hope this kernel serves as a satisfactory example for others on how to approach training a neural network for a binary classification problem with a very imbalanced dataset.","ab885ee5":"As we can see, the model didn't perform quite as well as we initially thought. Let's view a confusion matrix of the predictions made by the model on the test set, to gain a better idea of what type of errors it is making.","4820f38b":"## Final Remarks","b892b1e5":"Let's now separate our train, validation, and test data into their predictors and labels.","3b9bc573":"As we can see from the above plot, fraudulent activities make up a very small fraction of this dataset.

The neural network will contain several layers of hidden units with ReLU activation functions, and a sigmoid output unit to output the probability of a given transaction being fraudulent. The Adam optimizer will be used with an initial learning rate of 1e-4 and a binary cross-entropy loss function. The model will be trained for a maximum of 50 epochs, though the learning rate of the Adam optimizer will be reduced by a factor of 0.1 if the validation loss does not improve after 3 epochs of training. This will continue until a minimum learning rate of 1e-6 is reached. If the validation loss does not improve after 5 epochs of training, we will halt training of the neural network.","945f8e36":"Let's see if we can predict whether or not a given credit card transacation is fraudulent using a neural network.","5cbf226a":"Achieving almost 100% accuracy on the test set is of course thrilling, but one must not forget about the huge class imbalance still present in the test set. A model that simply outputted that there were no fraudulent transactions would achieve high accuracy as well. The dataset info recommends using the AUPRC as an evaluation metric instead, to gather a better understanding of how well the model truly performed. We will use the average precision score instead, which is an evaluation metric available in scikit-learn that is sometimes used as an alternative to AUPRC. The average precision score will have a value between 0 and 1, with a better model having a greater score. Let's view the test average precision score for our model."}}
