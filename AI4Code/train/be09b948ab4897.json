I am just getting started, so I will add more description here in future.\n\n#### Credits\n\nThese are the Kernel's I have learned from and used in this Notebook:\n\n* [neural networks + feature engineering for the win](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/bgmello\/neural-networks-feature-engineering-for-the-win) by [bgmello](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/bgmello) ","22124229":"![](https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1512144253214-d94e86cd9189?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2689&q=80)","c8455ade":"## Turf\n\nWhen it comes to the type of fields NFL teams prefers for their team, there is no clear consensus. The first generation of Artifical Turf gave it a bad reputation, as players really didn't feel they could perform well in those carpet-like fields. However, according to this [article](https:\/\/www.lawnstarter.com\/blog\/sports-turf\/nfl-mlb-teams-artificial-turf-2019\/) Artificial Turfs are making a big comeback. This is largely due to the new generation of Aritifical Turfs can help reduce injury and give players a consistent platform to perform despite of the weather condition. If you take a look at the following list of field types, there are too many and specific types. This may overwhelm or overfit our model, so like this [discussion](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020\/discussion\/112681#latest-649087) mentions, I am interested to know if the field is a grass field or not. ","dcb8adec":"## Offense Formation\n\nOffenseFormation field indicates the formation of the offensive team, and how each player is lined up in the field. For each type of formation presented in our dataset, I wrote down a short description below:\n\n* [Singleback](https:\/\/www.xsosfootball.com\/singleback-formation-sets\/) - A classic running formation, where the running back lines up behind the quater back, and the wide receivers are spread out accross the field to create room for the running back.\n* [Shotgun](https:\/\/www.xsosfootball.com\/shotgun-formation-sets\/) - A classic passing formation, where the team is typically expected to throw the ball to the wide receivers. The running back usually lines up next to the quater back.\n* [I Formation](https:\/\/www.xsosfootball.com\/i-formation-and-sets\/) - A very common running formation, where the running back lines up behind the quater back, like the singleback formation. However, there is a full-back in between the quater back and the running back. The role of the full-back is to provide block (push other defenders away) and make room for the running back. Sometimes full-back also runs with the ball instead to throw in the element of surprise.\n* [Pistol](https:\/\/www.liveabout.com\/the-shotgun-and-the-pistol-1335526) - Kind of a variation of Shotgun formation, with more hybrid formation to also give a good support for running back.\n* [Jumbo](https:\/\/www.xsosfootball.com\/shotgun-empty-base-breakdown\/) - This is the formation without a running back, or empty backfield. Very similar to Shotgun, except no running back at all.\n* [Wildcat](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wildcat_formation) - A player from another position (running back, full back) takes the snap of the ball instead of quaterback. \n* [Ace](https:\/\/www.xsosfootball.com\/formation-breakdown-singleback-ace\/) - Very similar to I-Formation, except there is two tight-ends in the line of scrimmage. Tight Ends are big units, which means additional blocking option for the running back.\n* Empty - I am going to treat this as formation that are not well known, or documented.","6b5d93f6":"Except for: rtr roof, nan, dome, heinz field, cloudy, bowl, domed, and null, we can clearly understand if the roof is open or closed. So for each of them I looked into the actual stadium the games are hosted in, and came to the following conclusions:\n* Heinz Field: is used when the game is hosted at \"Heinz Field\" Stadium. It is an open air stadium.\n* cloudy: Only used for \"TIAA Bank Field\" stadium, which is also an open air stadium.\n* bowl: Also only used for \"TIAA Bank Field\" stadium, so roof will be open.\n* domed: Used for \"Mercedes-Benz Superdome\", which is a domed stadium.  \n* null values: For null values, we have three stadiums: MetLife Stadium, StubHub Center, and TIAA Bank Field. All of them are open air stadiums. Check the cell below for the query.\n* rtr roof: Used only for \"NRG Stadium\", which can be open or closed based on different weather situation. For this stadium type, we have the following game weather: 'Sunny', 'Partly Cloudy', 'Mostly Cloudy', 'Cloudy', 'Clear', and 'Rainy'. The stadium and NFL policy (https:\/\/stadiumroofstatus.com\/stadiuminfo.php?stadium=3) says that unless the weather is very bad, the roof should be open.","7d4f18d0":"Interesting enough, for the passing formation Shotgun, the yard gain is very good! I agree with the idea of just simply doing one-hot encoding on this and not make things more complex.","b4f386e2":"Apparently having the roof open is a big advantage for your run game!","90021851":"And we do see a slightly better performance on artifical turf as expected! Yes, the factor is not that much, but in a competitive league like NFL where every inch counts, this is a significant amount.","92300563":"However, before we come to this conclusion (roof open or closed) we should gather more information and analyze the value in this field. I am using (an upgraded version of) the function from the kernel [neural networks + feature engineering for the win](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/bgmello\/neural-networks-feature-engineering-for-the-win) for this part."}}
