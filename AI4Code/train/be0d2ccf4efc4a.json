Although 'Alcohol' has a stron relationship with the quality of wine, it cannot be concluded that the relationship between them is linear. This model is clearly a classification model. Classifiers like K-Means and Random Forest would do well with this data.\n\nNote:\nAs the model is already scaled no scaling was needed for regularization.
