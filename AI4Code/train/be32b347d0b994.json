We can print out both the training and test scores. ","20f746fe":"\n## Intro\n\nThe fruits 360 dataset on Kaggle contains many images of fruit. I wanted to see if I could use Python to read in these images and build an algorithm to correctly label the fruit in each image. I have previously created a similar kernel on the MNIST fashion dataset, but this had already processed the images into dataframes for modelling. I wanted to see if instead I could use the actual images and run this processing myself.\n\nWhilst researching this task, I struggled to find a kernal\/tutorial which outlined this whole process. Hence I hope the below will act as a tutorial for anyone else wanting to learn how to do this. \n\n## Outline of process\n\n#### 1. Image processing\n\n- Like any machine learning model, I need features (X variables) and a label to predict (Y variable). With image classification, the same concept applies. However, here, the features are each pixel in the image. The images I am going to read in are 100x100 pixels. Hence, there are 10,000 pixels in every image; each of these pixels will be a feature in my model. Our first step therefore is to read in each image, capturing the value of every pixel as our 10,000 X variables, and recording the image's label for our Y variable. If we do this for each image, we have created our dataset. \n\n- However, colour images like the fruit data aren't stored as a single 100X100 array. They are actually stored as three arrays; one for the value of Red, Blue and Green in the image. Hence, another stage in our processing of these images involves transforming the images from colour to grayscale. By doing this, we can get a single value for each pixel, which indicates how black\/white this pixel is. We can store this as a value between 0 and 1. \n\n#### 2. Machine learning\n- Once we have transformed our images into grayscale and created our dataframe of 10,000 X variables with Y labels, we can begin our machine learning element. I will split my dataframe into a training and test set, building my algorithm on the training set, before seeing how well it performs on the test set. This enables me to understand how well my model will perform on images of fruit it has not seen before.\n\n\n### 1. Image processing - reading in images\n\nFirstly, I load in the libraries I will need, and take a look at the folder structure. The fruit 360 dataset contains pre defined training and test splits, divided into two folders. Instead of using these, I am going to read in fruit images from the training folders, and create my own train\/test splits later.","2c627ffd":"Random forest appears to perform better. \n\n\nIf we wanted to extend this further, we could now perform gridsearch to see if we could tune the parameters to improve our fit further. We could also use more complex models like Neural Networks. I could also look at the confusion matrices for each model. ","974f7073":"At first to me, it seemed strange this fruit was blue as it is supposed to be a clementine! I then realised that cv2 reads images as Blue Green Red, when they actually need to be in the form Red Green Blue to plot them. Hence, we can rearrange this order and plot again.","4322e0aa":"The classes are not that well balanced, which could affect my model's performance. However, as this is a tutorial on image processing I am going to leave them as they are for now, but I could do some work to improve this balance if I wanted to build on this kernel later. \n\nAt the moment, my dataset is ordered by fruit type (due to how I created the dataset in the loop). Before moving onto the learning algorithm, we should shuffle our dataset. In the modelling part of the kernel, I am going to be dividing my data up into a training and test set, and hence want to shuffle the data before doing this in case this ordering impacts the divide. ","8d3cd33f":"I now have a dataframe with each row representing a single fruit image, and the 10K columns holding the values of each pixel in the image. We have also added on a column of labels, indicating what fruit is shown in the image. "}}
