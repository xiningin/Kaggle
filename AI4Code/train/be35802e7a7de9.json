Five-number summary\nThis shows the five-number summaries of all the lists.","71249b60":"# Analysis of Inaugural Addresses\nThis notebook aims to analyze the inaugural addresses of all presidents to date and discover how they have changed over time.\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/4.0\/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https:\/\/i.creativecommons.org\/l\/by-nc\/4.0\/88x31.png\" \/><\/a><br \/>This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/4.0\/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License<\/a>.\n\nAuthor: Aditya Ranjan","90dcd97d":"#### B. Store the data in a data frame\nI can now read the original csv file and store its contents in a pandas data frame.","185f3135":"## 1. Data preparation\nThe first step is to prepare the data I will be working with.","fc1bad76":"As evidenced by the weak negative correlation, the number of characters in a president's inaugural address decreased on average between 1789 (George Washington's 1st term) and 2017 (Donald Trump's first term). This is most likely due to the expansion of democratic freedoms to everyone in the country, which meant that presidents had to appeal to a larger audience as time went on and keep their inaugural address succinct.","4515fa09":"As evidenced by the moderately strong negative correlation, the Dale-Chall readability score of a president's inaugural address decreased on average (college junior level to highschool freshman level). This is again due to the fact that as time went on, an inaugural address reached a much more diverse and larger group of people from all backgrounds, requiring the speech to be easier to understand for everyone.","37565b60":"#### C. Number of space-separated words\nThis visualization shows the relationship between the number of space-separated words in a speech and the year it was given.","a16e3c7b":"#### G. 10 longest inaugural addresses\nThis shows which presidents gave the ten longest inaugural addresses to date, how many words the addresses were, and what years they were given.","172019a3":"As evidenced by the weak negative correlation, the number of difficult words in a president's inaugural address decreased on average. This is most likely due to the fact that the variety of citizens and groups of people involved in political processes became much more diverse as the nation made social progress such as the civil rights and women's rights movments. Along with the addresses being delivered to a wider span of audiences due to television and radio, this translated to presidents making their addresses more approachable and easier to understand as time went on.","cefa3a02":"#### E. Dale-Chall readability score\nThis visualization shows the relationship between the Dale-Chall readability score of a speech and the year it was given.","fe29c34b":"#### A. Import essential libraries\nBefore starting, I have to import the libraries which I will be using throughout the notebook.\n\n","156f8656":"#### D. Number of difficult words\nThis visualization shows the relationship between the number of difficult words in a speech and the year it was given.","4066ec34":"#### A. Inaugural addresses have become shorter.\nAs evidenced by the visualizations for both the number of characters and number of space-separated words, inaugural addresses have become significantly shorter as time has progressed. This is most likely due to the fact that the audience which presidents are appealing to have become more diverse in nature including people from all backgrounds, not just wealthy white males.","80439eb7":"## 3. Conclusion\nWith the analysis complete, I can now sum up my observations in a few sentences.","4e8444fa":"#### D. What next?\nThere are a couple of things that could improve this analysis, which I plan to work on in the future. Firstly, data for political parties and information such as age and social background could potentially be very useful in analyzing how the characteristics of a president or political party affect the tone, difficulty, and length of an inaugural address. Secondly, some insight into historical events could also explain why some presidents gave much longer and difficult speeches whereas others gave much shorter and approachable ones.","23df6005":"#### C. Creating lists to store the data\nNow I can store the information from the data frame in lists which will all have different features of the speeches.","924c6e13":"#### B. Inaugural addresses have become easier and less complicated.\nAs evidenced by the visualizations for both the number of difficult words and Dale-Chall scores, inaugural addresses have become significantly easier and more understandable as time has progressed. This is again due to the fact that presidents are appealing to a broader audience from different educational backgrounds. In addition to this, inaugural addresses are now broadcasted on tv, radio, youtube, etc. This means that along with adults, several kids and younger people are watching the speeches now, requiring the address to be approachable and understandable for everyone.","83094991":"#### C. Overall themes haven't changed much.\nAs can be seen from the word cloud, presidents have been using the same buzzwords and rhetorical choices for the last 200 years or so. The strategy of developing a mood of patriotism and overcoming challenges is consistent throughout the years and is often used by politicans to distract the audience from other issues and portray themselves in a positive light.","65233af2":"As can be seen above, there are certain buzzwords which a lot of presidents use in their inaugural addresses. Most of these words, such as \"will\" and \"power\", serve a rhetorical purpose and create a patriotic atmosphere, which plays to the presidents' advantages and portray them as dutiful and sincere.","460956bf":"#### E. Sources\nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/adhok93\/presidentialaddress","3147c6cf":"#### H. Ten shortest inaugural addresses\nThis shows which presidents gave the ten shortest inaugural addresses to date, how many words the addresses were, and what years they were given.","61378fa4":"#### A. Functions\nFirstly, I have to create two functions - one that plots any given variable of the speeches against the years the speeches were given and another that generates a five-number summary for any given list.","4619ca5c":"#### F. Word cloud\nThis visualization shows the important words that are common throughout all inaugural addresses.","183371ff":"As evidenced by the weak negative correlation, the number of space-separated words in a president's inaugural address also decreased on average. This is again due to the same reason that presidents had to keep their addresses shorter in order to appeal to a larger and more diverse audience."}}
