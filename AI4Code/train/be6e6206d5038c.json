On the other hand, there are lot of voids in these images.\n\nSo the question is, can we get rid of the voids and reduce the image size. Seam Carving might be the answer.\n\n## Seam Carving\n\nSeam carving (or liquid rescaling) is an algorithm for content-aware image resizing ([Avidan & Shamir, 2007](https:\/\/perso.crans.org\/frenoy\/matlab2012\/seamcarving.pdf)).\n\nHere, I show it with a working example from the training set.","9efab277":"A fast `seam_carve` function available in `skimage.transforms` only works for seams along one direction. So, we need to call it twice.\n\nI have used here a `sobel` of the gaussian smoothed image as the energy map.\n","e721d8e9":"It seems to work on certain images in the training set like the one above. \nAlthough, if you look carefully, the features seems to be slightly cropped in certain parts.  \n\nBut, with a better idea, I hope it can be used for all the images.  I think this would be far better way of reducing the image size than resampling due to the fine structure of the features."}}
