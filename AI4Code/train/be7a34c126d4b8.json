But that bug could not have been seen on the train dataset or on the first test dataset (the one with only 400 videos). But the bug comes only on the big test dataset (the one with 4000 videos).<br>\n**In this notebook, I will explain a way to find where is your bug, without put exceptions handling every where.**<br>\nFirst, **let's suppose you have a very long notebook like the next cell**, which is doing a lot of things until your submission file to competition :","94a7f9a2":"Let's suppose you have worked the best as it is possible to do, let's suppose you don't have any bug with this notebook, neither on the train dataset nor the first test dataset. **Let's suppose you're ready to click on \"Submit to competition\"**.<br>\nAnd a few hours after submitting, you read the score of your submission : **\"Submission CSV not found\"**.<br>\nARRRRRGR !!! What could have happen ?\n\nThis message told us that the fifth part of the code in the previous cell had not been executed. Why it did not ? Because the notebook had stopped before of course !<br>\nBut where ?  In part 1, part 2 part 3 ? Let's use public score to find the place in your code where the bug is.\n\nWe know that there is 4000 videos in the big data set and that there 2000 are fake. So :"}}
