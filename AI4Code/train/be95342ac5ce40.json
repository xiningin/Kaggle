If the majority of the world's young population are in Africa, why not then this age range being the leading one? It seems that this is so because of __the lack of technological infrastructure__ in the continent. That age range in Africa consists of those who are just leaving scondary schools and deciding to either enter the universities or learn a trade. But once they enter the institutions, (and by then they are a bit matured) it is easier for them to find their ground in the pursuit of the career in Data Science\/Machine Learning.\n\nPlaforms like __Data Science Nigeria__ through their University outreach, are helping students to be engaged early to a career in Data Science, and also bridging this gap of technological infrastructure.","531d7dbf":"The greater part of the current companies in Africa do not use Machine Learning methods.

Because some of the data are structured in databases and must be querried and accessed through SQL. The third most used language is __Javascript__.

That is why there is the rapid adoption of these technologies here in Africa.\n\nSo, working with the subset of the dataset - the Africa dataset - we will see the countries leading in these adoptions, and comparing the dataset with that of the rest of the world, we will see how Africa fits in to the this renaissance.","e493f748":"Here we see __Nigeria__ leading in the list of the African countries with over 34 percent of the total submissions, followed by Egypt and Kenya.\n\nThanks to the work of the __Data Science Nigeria__ led by __Dr. Olubayo Adekanmbi__ whose vision is to build an ['AI-first society where Artificial Intelligence is effectively deployed to solve local problems, particularly the sustainable millennial goals'](https:\/\/www.datasciencenigeria.org\/adekanmbi-olubayo-2\/) [1].
