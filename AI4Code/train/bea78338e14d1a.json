There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in the disaster.","71046260":"### Fill Missing Values in Age Column (train & test dataset)\n\n**When dealing with large missing values in a particular column, simply removing the feature does not make sense when the feature is relevant in prediction.**\n\nAge seems to be a promising feature.\nSo it doesn't make sense to simply fill null values out with a median\/mean\/mode.\n\nWe will use ***Random Forest*** algorithm to predict ages.
