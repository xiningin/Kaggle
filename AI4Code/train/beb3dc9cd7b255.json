Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. \n\nCommon signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. \n\nStandard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.","d51233a3":"# Corona Virus","d61ff90a":"Most of the districts have cases less than 400 but a few districts have upward of 1200 cases.<br>\nThere was no recovery in starting of the observation but once as more cases are observed recovery increased.<br>\nDeath rates are still increasing in some districts and there are no death observed but overall death ratio is quite high","cf51bc13":"<h6> Hubei District <\/h6>","e4ea7d7c":"No recovery is pre-dominant in dataset which needs critical attention of medical professionals as well as researchers to find a cure and speedy recovery guides.<br>\nAlthough Medium and High recovery are there but in dataset maximum recovery is 7862 which is way lower than maximum cases confimed 59989","70eb3079":"<h3> Data Familiarization <\/h3>","53753669":"<h6> Other Districts <\/h6>","76bae748":"# Importing Dataset","6bee088d":"Max confirmed cases are : 59989<br>\nMax Deaths are : 1789<br>\nMax recovered : 7862<br>\n<br>\n","ac6655bb":"![](http:\/\/..\/input\/images\/img1.jpg)","d90f3ae2":"Here 1351 cases shows no deaths but in 368 days there are deaths this maybe due to accumlation of data and releasing it in one go.","2c1793b0":"This zoomed in plot shows recovery is increasing as observation is increasing but number of death is also way to high daya by day.
