Clicking a point will give a list of sentences that may mention that place and each sentence provides full metadata on the containing article and a link to it. It is our hope that this interactive map will provide a useful exploratory tool for data scientists and COVID-19 researchers who are seeking out specific geographic datasets.\n\nIn its current form, the map and underlying data have not been cleaned. We have released it, as is, in order to disseminate it as quickly as possible. Over the coming days, we intend to clean the data and refine the map.\n\nThe full spatial and textual data used to generate the map is available for research and use in the [Spatial Data for CORD-19 (COVID-19 ORDC)]( https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/charlieharper\/spatial-data-for-cord19-covid19-ordc) dataset on Kaggle.\n\nThis map is publicly available on the web at https:\/\/arcg.is\/yb1uu"}}
