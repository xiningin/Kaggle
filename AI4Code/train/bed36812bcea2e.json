This is because we designed our model considering the meaning of each blocks (,although we're not sure whether it is working as we imaged originally).  \nWe found [@omalleyt](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/omalleyt)'s 2nd place solution for Tensorflow Speech Recognition Competition very helpful.  \nhttps:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/c\/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge\/forums\/t\/47715\/2nd-place-solution?forumMessageId=270205#post270205\n\nThe *design philosophy* behind the placement of convolution blocks are as follows.\n\n  - First Convolution Block: channel 1 -> 32, no pooling.  \n    We put this block to collect primitive patterns of the log-melspectrogram.\n  - Second Convolution Block: channel 32 -> 64, (4, 1) pooling.  \n    Clearly, **spectrogram has different axis, and we need to treat them separately**. We took careful **not to aggregate the feature map along to the time axis and to the frequency axis simultaneously**. In this block, we'll get the primitive patterns connected to the patterns nearby in the time axis.\n  - Third Convolution Block: channel 64 -> 128, (1, 3) pooling.  \n    In this block, we'll get the primitive pattens connected in the frequency axis.\n  - Fourth Convolution Block: channel 128 -> 256, (4, 1) pooling.  \n    This block allows patterns to move in the time axis.\n  - Fifth Convolution Block: channel 256 -> 512, (1, 3) pooling.  \n    As explained in this [blog post](https:\/\/t.co\/IgUKfFOYaa), moving the pattern in the frequency can be problematic. But that isn't the case when the degree of the translation is not so big. This block allows patterns to move in the frequency axis a little.\n    \n#### Cutting output feature map to arbitrary size\n\nWe found that the position in the feature map is important when treating spectrogram.  \nThe same pattern at the bottom of the image and at the top of the image are totally different. We should not allow patterns translate along the frequency axis. That is a little bit different from treating natural images.\n\nTo treat the position in the feature map, we used **[spatial pyramid pooling](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1406.4729.pdf)** to catch the local features.  \nWith this trick, CV lwlrap score improved **0.015 - 0.03**.","2581f0e8":"This augmentation changes the pitch of the sound.  \nWe applied both pitch-up and pitch-down.  \nThe degree of pitch shift was fixed to 500 cent.","a5bde7e9":"Now check the result of audio transformation.","67e8a97b":"### blend image augmentation\n\nWe used below augmentation strategy in batch\n\nhttps:\/\/pillow.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/reference\/Image.html","107df88a":"So, We got mixed Image data","ebc7df3c":"### Reverb\n\nThis augmentation add reverberation to the original sound.","86719a9f":"This sample has important information earlier, but there is a little information from the end of sound.","72797fc6":"We used noisy data to 'pre-train' our model.  \nWe had two policy to train and validate with noisy data.  \nYou can see how we did this in [this kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/hidehisaarai1213\/convnet-noisy-all-pitch-pretraining).\n\n1.
