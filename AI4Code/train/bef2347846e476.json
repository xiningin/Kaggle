dimensions Rating and Reviews.Reviews were initially in the type of object(str) but we converted it float with the to_numeric() method.We can say that Mature 17+ class gives better reviews but less values at the ratings than others( with green spots at the graph ).And the best ratings and best reviews are coming from the teenagers.","0af7d458":"The term \"**correlation**\" refers to a mutual relationship or association between quantities. In almost any business, it is useful to express one quantity in terms of its relationship with others. For example, sales might increase when the marketing department spends more on TV advertisements, or a customer's average purchase amount on an e-commerce website might depend on a number of factors related to that customer.In the first dataset we just have one numerical data colum so let's investigate it in the second data set.","d145ef57":"An in the following graph again we've used line plot, but this time we have two column type of float.They are called Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.We observe that Sentiment Subjectivity values are intense at the above of the zero and we observe that the Sentiment Polarity values are under the zero.","bc0dcbfc":"To see the content of the files we use head() function with parameter 10.It gives us the first 10 rows of the file from the starting of the file.","36ca8a69":"In the following graph we see the rating values of the applications with the plot line.We see they have at most 5.0 as a value.","db575c9e":"Here is an example image of the data from the Google play store applications.Whenever you want to download an application you visit this part to get feedbacks from other peoples and see ratings.","100a442f":"Let us first import the needed csv files from the dataset bwith the belowing code.","5214b556":"To see which types are exist in the Type column we use the command data.Type.unique().It returns the unique column indexes.","56cfe390":"As we can see also in the dataset we have three types of Sentiments.In the grapgh below we can see the polarity and subjectivity of the positive,neutral and nan Sentiment's classification.In the positive Sentiments we observe the less sentiment polarity and much sentiment subjectivity.And in the neutral sentiments the polarity is 0.0 and they are taking the different values at the subjectivity.

The strength of a sentiment or opinion is typically linked to the intensity of certain emotions, e.g., joy and anger.Polarity, also known as orientation is he emotion expressed in the sentence.
