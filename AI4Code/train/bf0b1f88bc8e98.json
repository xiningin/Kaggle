The train dataset has no \nnull fares.","1a56ea43":"Next up, we will encode all the categorical features. One of things to lookout for is the Dummy Trap. We have the option for using \"drop_first = True\" with get_dummies but here we will manually select the features and intentionally leave one out based on their correlations.","888f577d":"**Step 1:  Poking the Data**\n\nFirst we need to get an initial picture of the data available to us.","eec3e999":"**Age**\n\nOne quick way to impute the missing ages would be to take median of the Age data from the and apply it to all using [fillna](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html). An alternative approach that I have used with better results is to impute ages based on passeneger titles. This is because of the inherent age related meaning assigned to titles like Master, Mr, Miss, Mrs etc. This lets us assign age more accurately for individual passengers.","7c28e4a9":"We have nulls in Age, Cabin and Fare in the validation dataset.\n\nNext we will check the correlation coefficients for the provided data using the [corr](https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/pandas-docs\/stable\/generated\/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) method.

We use this knowledge to direct our exploration and analysis of the data.","b3899570":"People with 0-2 SibSp(Sibling\/Spouse) have a higher chance of survival.","d3ce5b38":"**Embarked:** Did the embarkation location play any part?","136a53c6":"**Ticket**\n\nWIP.

Use Ticket.\n2. Try other models and model tuning.\n3. Try using the entire train data for training. This should theoretically improve the accuracy further as more data will be used to train the final model.\n    Using a smaller split for train_test_split seems to confirm this. Changing split size from 0.2 to 0.1 increases the accuracy slightly.\n    \nFailed approaches - Ideas that I thought were good but actually either didn't affect or reduced the accuracy.\n1. Use Titles to assign missing Age by using medians. For e.g. calculate Age.median() of all passengers that have the title 'Mr' and then use this median to fill null values for Age with Mr in Title.\nThis reduced accuracy to little over 77% from 78.47%. Using mean instead of median on the other hand increased accuracy to 79.42%.\nAlthough median is more \"robust\"(https:\/\/creativemaths.net\/blog\/median\/), mean here was better probably because Age occurs here as a Gaussian distribution(https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-is-more-accurate-the-median-or-mean).\nEasy explanation - https:\/\/statistics.laerd.com\/statistical-guides\/measures-central-tendency-mean-mode-median.php","16004b6c":"**Age:** Age had a low inverse correlation with Survived(-0.07).
