You dont have to upvote because Im going to upvote you all, since you deserved it')","eee77ec2":"Since I'm surrounded by so many gifted and helpful people I couldn't present any conventional, generic Kaggle Notebook because everybody knows that I can't code. Besides, all works that I've already seen are great.Then I decided to answer the questions in a way that I couldn't do in the Survey.\n* Age, gender, country, level education, title, company's size doesn't matter, only coding.\n* How much money spent on ML: I'm retired, just enjoying life while I can. I spent time but I gained Knowledge.\n* Programming language: Python since I can't pretend to code with R.\n* TPU: I barely used GPU in DL micro-course.\n* Years using ML: Are you kidding? In fact, I do Machine Unlearning.\n* NLP: The 1st time I read this I thought that it was about Neuro-linguist Programming and Bert was a character from Sesame street. \n* Cloud computing: only in my user name (wolke=cloud).\n* Big data, I'd rather stay with just data.\n* In fact, that are a lot of questions that I could answer:\"does not apply to me\".\n* I'm not a bot, but my inseparable team mate is. I'd like to ask: Who is the father of the Bot? He rules my world.\n\n"}}
