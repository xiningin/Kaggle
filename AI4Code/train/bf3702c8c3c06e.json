Introduction. Explore first, train later.\n\nHi everyone! As *Aravind Eye Hospital* is one of my favorite organization in the world; they take care of poor people's eyes for free with an impressive sustainable business model.  I will try my best to contribute something to our community. One intuitive way to improve the performance of our model is to simply improve the quality of input images. In this kernel, I will share two ideas which I hope may be useful to some of you : \n\n- **Reducing lighting-condition effects** : as we will see, images come with many different lighting conditions, some images are very dark and difficult to visualize. We can try to convert the image to gray scale, and visualize better. Alternatively, there is a better approach. We can try the method of [Ben Graham (last competition's winner)](https:\/\/github.com\/btgraham\/SparseConvNet\/tree\/kaggle_Diabetic_Retinopathy_competition)\n- **Cropping uninformative area** : everyone know this :) Here, I just find the codes from internet and choose the best one for you :)\n\nWe are going to apply both techniques to both the official data, and the past competition data (shout out @tanlikesmath for creating this dataset! https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tanlikesmath\/diabetic-retinopathy-resized . In the updated version, I also try @donkeys' dataset https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/donkeys\/retinopathy-train-2015 , which is .png which may be have higer image quality than .jpeg format)\n\nIf I found more useful tricks, I will update the notebook, or if you have more useful tricks and would love to share, please let me know!\n\nI use some parts of codes from @mathormad and @artgor kernels. Thanks both of you!","aebb683f":"## 3.A2 Try the new idea of circle crop\n\n@taindow proposes an interesting idea of making a circle crop to the image, so I update the kernel to let you compare the results.

For more information see https:\/\/youtu.be\/oOeZ7IgEN4o?t=156 .\n\n![inconsistent  estimation in diabetic retinophaty](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/6rQ2sFG\/inconsistent-estimation.png)\n\nActually, from this summit, Google stated that they already worked with Aravind and have like 800,000 training data. I am a bit confused about the objective of this competition :) .","d97c7f3b":"Ok preprocessing methods seem to works fine; however, the doctors to estimate the severity levels in the past competitions may have different criteria in mind than the doctors of Aravind, so it is possible to have some estimation inconsistency (at least to my eyes the previous data seems more noisy). The following level-4 [pic(4,1) in the plot we just made above] looks not so severe. (Or this is the example case of too many blood vessels ??, refer to Section 1.1)","8c93e167":"# 4. Try the same method to Past competition data\nThanks @tanlikesmath, https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/tanlikesmath\/diabetic-retinopathy-resized who provides us a complete previous-competition dataset in the .jpeg format; this is much smaller than the original version with the risk of losing image details. Let apply both normal gray scale, and Ben Graham's method to this dataset.","567a579b":"## 1.1 Simple picture to explain Diabetic Retinopathy\n\nHow do we know that a patient have diabetic retinopahy? **[There are at least 5 things to spot on](https:\/\/www.eyeops.com\/contents\/our-services\/eye-diseases\/diabetic-retinopathy)**.

Each row depicts each severity level. We can see two problems which make the severity difficult to spot on. First, some images are very dark [pic(0,2) and pic(4,4) ] and sometimes different color illumination is confusing [pic (3,3)]. Second, we can get the uninformative dark areas for some pictures [pic(0,1), pic(0,3)]. This is important when we reduce the picture size, as informative areas become too small. So it is intuitive to crop the uninformative areas out in the second case.","7b64a843":"From quick investigations of the data (see various pictures below), I found that *Hemorrphages, Hard Exudates and Cotton Wool spots* are quite easily observed. However, I still could not find examples of *Aneurysm* or *Abnormal Growth of Blood Vessels* from our data yet. Perhaps the latter two cases are important if we want to catch up human benchmnark using our model.","825fcf1a":"Now let us start by loading the train\/test dataframes. The `train_test_split` here is in fact not necessary. But when I first fork the kernel from @mathormad, I found some interesting examples using this split and the current `SEED`, so I continue to use them here.","76210db3":"We can try gray scale and feel understand better for some pictures, as color distraction is gone. For example, we can see more blood clearer in the upper part of pic(4,4), which has severity of level 4.","b3ee2c8c":"## Try the method on Public Test Set\nWe can also try auto cropping on 50 test data to see that it work fine. Below, we see immediately from this random samples that severed cases, with level >2, are relatively many more compared to the training set.","ee9be38a":"## 4.1 Let us compare to the .png image.\n\nSome pictures (e.g. pics (4,5-8)) seem to lost details perhaps this is due to .jpeg compression ? I don't think so, but at least we should try to compare with .png. Fortunately, @donkeys also provides us .png version of the previous competition [see ref. in Introduction].","d20c7935":"# 3. Further improve by auto-cropping\n\nTo crop out the uninformative black areas which are evident on pic(0,1), pic(0,3) and pic(4,1), we can try auto cropping. I found 4 alternative codes from https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/13538748\/crop-black-edges-with-opencv and https:\/\/codereview.stackexchange.com\/questions\/132914\/crop-black-border-of-image-using-numpy\/132934 ... Fortunately one method works perfectly for a gray scale image, but none works on a color image. In this kernel, I modify the method working on gray-scale a bit to make it suitable for a color image.\n","5b553606":"# UPDATE on V9:\nThis kernel have two important updates.\n\n* Before Version 8, I couldn't make Ben's and Cropping method work together nicely, so I emphasized on gray scale. Now, I adjust both functions and beleive that color version is better than gray scale.\n\n* Before Version 9, I found a bug that will cause an old crop function to fail in a private test set (it works fine on training and public test sets). Here, I fix that bug. However, I still cannot guarantee whether there will be any more cases on private test set that will fail the crop function. **Update on V11** Now I was able to have a valid LB score with the new crop function, so if anybody still have some submission errors, that is the reason of other bugs.\n\n## update on V14.\n* Compare to circle crop in Section 3.A2 according to @taindow : please visit his kernel : https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/taindow\/pre-processing-train-and-test-images\n\nOther minor updates. Note on estimation inconsistency and Aravind's history.","fd64f7e8":"### Try Cropping the images\n\nI have tested on around 200 images, and the method works great. However, if anybody find the outlier cases which cause the auto crop to fail, please let me know. I think now the eye pictures are very like the moon by the way :)\n\n**IMPORTANT UPDATE on Kernel V.9** I found that there is indeed a case in private test set making the old version of crop function fail. (I spent my 13 submissions until I found this bug) E.g. if there is an adversarial image (super dark) in the private test set, the crop function will crop everything and result in 0 dimension image. I have fixed this bug in this kernel version, but I still could not guarantee whether there are other cases in a private test that will make the crop function fail or not. **Update on V11** Now I was able to have a valid LB score with the new crop function, so if anybody still have some submission errors, that is the reason of other bugs.\n","0a10664d":"# Appendix C.

","4b9a7a14":"For severity level 4, I feel that two examples here are difficult to spot on, pic(4,1) and pic(4,4). As we try zooming to see the details (use real size image), we can see some abnormalities (*cotton wool spots* or *hard exudates* ?) in those eyes clearer (observe the lower-right part of the eye). Therefore, `IMG_SIZE` is definitely important for this problem. In the next section, we shall see better method than gray-scale conversion.","1129a940":"# Appendix A.

Now I believe that color version is better, so from this point on I will use color cropping\n\nBelow is the cropped of the color version. For color version, note that I use argument `sigmaX = 30` of `cv2.GaussianBlur`, where Ben actually used `sigmaX = 10` which may have better performance. I just feel that this `sigmaX = 30` or `sigmaX = 50` make beautiful [sometimes bloody] yellow moon pictures.
