In addition to this, Statmodels and Math module is implemented.  \n\nThe simple linear regression model is going to be implemented through Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method hence statmodels and Math module are imported.\n\nThe dataset is available in CSV format.  The header of the dataset confirms that all the feature variables are numeric.","3bbac030":"**Intepreting the results of first model:**\n\n(1) The values of t-statistics for y-intercept and slope are very high. Also, the p-values for these parameters are < 0.05. These observations validate the accuracy of y-intercept and slope. Hence, the results are statistically significant.\n\n(2) The value R2 is **0.56**. Though it is not as high as required to indicate a strong linear relationship, it shows the existence of linearity between MSE marks and ESE marks.\n\n(3) The value of calculated RSE is **4.3.** on training data set. An error of +\/- 4 is an acceptable error in predicting the performance of ESE.

The unit on Simple Linear Regression covers following points.\n\n1.  [Simple Linear Regression (SLR): 7 Key points to remember.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/--awGDpi9pk)\n2.

[SLR: Evaluating Model Parameters](https:\/\/youtu.be\/AvZ-4yFGwG4)\n\n\nThe notebook uses the data set of student's performance, and attendance recorded that I collected while teaching a course on Software Architecture in the year 2014. \n\nHere, I am  building two different models. First is to explore relationship between MSE and ESE. Second is to explore the relationship between classroom attendance and ESE.","47091dd7":"**Interpreting the results of the Second model:**\n\nThe R2 value is **0.012**, which indicates a very weak or non-existence of a linear relationship between classroom attendance and end semester performance.  This implies that students might be physically attending classes without any mindful academic engagement.   Also, the absolute value of t-statistic for slope is below one which is tiny to indicate a linear relationship. Further, the p-value for slope is > 0.05, showing no statistically significant relationship between attendance and ESE marks. \n\nHence, in the context of this dataset, attendance is a bad predictor for end semester performance.
