NES and GB were most popular consoles overall but PC gaming was suprsingly more popular than NES in EU. In contrast, PC gaming instances were most rare in JP. It's also intersting that JP sales were larger in scale than EU sales.","967ac114":"Note: data unavailable for year 2017 (NA, EU), 2020 (EU, JP)","d73b21ea":"As expected, the last-to-last generation fades into oblivion. Sony and microsoft consoles dominate the EU and NA market. 3DS is most popular in JP, followed by WiiU and PSP, the latter of which is mostly forgotten in other markets.  \nIn NA, last-gen xbox360 is more popular than current-gen xbox one. PS4 is the most popular console in EU followed by last gen consoles. Xbox one ranks at number 4 here.  \n","d4ea0c4d":"Now, we will look at the sales in different regions.","d82b8f19":"Looking at regional sales graph (notice the y-axis scale for NA_Sales), NA clearly took to gaming faster than the rest of the world.","d0b18d62":"Revenue generation aside, popularity also depends on the number of games released for a platform.  \n  \n  In gen1, PS1 is by far the most popular. In gen2, PS2 and DS are the most popular. In gen3, in stark contrast to revenue, the older generation is more popular i.e PS3 and Xbox360.  \n    \n  The max number of games for the most popular console is very high for gen2. total number of games overall is also very high for gen2","42456100":"# EDA - Part 2","dad5ebf1":"The variety factor has turned around and now NA and EU have more platform variety than JP. Wii is second most popular in EU and NA. the 1st and 3rd positions are alternatively occupied by Sony's and Microsoft's consoles. It is interesting that PS2 still gets many sales.  \nIn terms of scale, NA dominates. Except GB and WS all JP sales are very small in comparison to EU sales. PC sales are no longer as popular in EU as they were in previous generation.","6c0dd0c5":"For the First gen, \"Platformers\" were most popular, then after a significant gap, RPG and Puzzle games were popular.  \nFor the Second gen, \"platformers\" were still the most popular but Shooter and RPG have come very close in popularity.  \nFor the Third gen, Shooter displaces platformers by a large margin, where the latter occupies the second place now.

","84d0cb4a":"Even in Gen2, NA sales dwarfed the others in scale. however, both NA and EU sales peaked in 2001 whereas sales peaked in 2000 for JP.

With the exception of DS, all underperforming platforms are wiped out in next gen.  \n  \nIn gen2, GB is the most revenue-generating console overall but diminishes in the latter half of this gen, sony and microsoft's consoles are almost tied for second place. PS2 is way more money-making than Xbox but both are less popular than Wii.  \n  \n  \nIn gen3, PS4 is the best in sales whereas its counterpart Xbox one's sales are lesser than microsoft's previous xbox i.e xbox360. GB is wiped out. Wii gives strong competition to Sony and Microsoft.
