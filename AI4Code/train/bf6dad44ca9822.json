[The derivation](https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0002185) is beyond the scope of this notebook, but here it is:\n\n$$ \\lambda = k_{t-1}e^{\\gamma(R_t-1)}$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the reciprocal of the serial interval ([about 4 days for COVID19](https:\/\/wwwnc.cdc.gov\/eid\/article\/26\/6\/20-0357_article)). Since we know every new case count on the previous day, we can now reformulate the likelihood function as a Poisson parameterized by fixing $k$ and varying $R_t$.\n\n$$ \\lambda = k_{t-1}e^{\\gamma(R_t-1)}$$\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\left(R_t|k\\right) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$\n\n### Evaluating the Likelihood Function\n\nTo continue our example, let's imagine a sample of new case counts $k$.

For epidemics that have $R_t>1$ for a long time and then become under control ($R_t<1$), the posterior gets stuck. It cannot forget about the many days where $R_t>1$ so eventually $P(R_t|k)$ asymptotically approaches 1 when we know it's well under 1. The authors note this in the paper as a footnote. Unfortunately this won't work for us. __The most critical thing to know is when we've dipped below the 1.0 threshold!__\n\nSo, I propose to only incorporate the last $m$ days of the likelihood function. By doing this, the algorithm's prior is built based on the recent past which is a much more useful prior than the entire history of the epidemic. So this simple, but important change leads to the following:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k_t) \\propto {\\displaystyle \\prod^{T}_{t=T-m}}\\mathcal{L}\\left(R_t|k_t\\right) $$\n\nWhile this takes the last $m$ priors into account equally, you can decide to apply a windowing function (such as an exponential) to favor recent priors over more distant.","625a5c2f":"### Standings","2800a902":"> __Note__: this was a terse expression which makes it tricky.

However, $R_0$ is a single measure that does not adapt with changes in behavior and restrictions.\n\nAs a pandemic evolves, increasing restrictions (or potential releasing of restrictions) change $R_t$. Knowing the current $R_t$ is essential. When $R>1$, the pandemic will spread through the entire population. If $R_t<1$, the pandemic will grow to some fixed number less than the population. The lower $R_t$, the more manageable the situation. The value of $R_t$ helps us (1) understand how effective our measures have been controlling an outbreak and (2) gives us vital information about whether we should increase or reduce restrictions based on our competing goals of economic prosperity and human safety. [Well-respected epidemiologists argue](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/06\/opinion\/coronavirus-end-social-distancing.html) that tracking $R_t$ is the only way to manage through this crisis.\n\nYet, today, to my knowledge there is no real-time tracking of $R_t$ in United States. In fact, the only real-time measure I've seen has been for [Hong Kong](https:\/\/covid19.sph.hku.hk\/dashboard). More importantly, it is not useful to understand $R_t$ at a national level. Instead, to manage this crisis effectively, we need a local (state, county and\/or city) level granularity of $R_t$.\n\nWhat follows is a solution to this problem at the US State level. It's a modified version of a solution created by [Bettencourt & Ribeiro 2008](https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0002185) to estimate real-time $R_t$ using a Bayesian approach. While I have stayed true to most of their process, my solution differs in an important way that I will call out clearly.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or improvments feel free to get in touch: [hello@systrom.com](mailto:hello@systrom.com). And if it's not entirely clear, I'm not an epidemiologist. At the same time, data is data, and statistics are statistics and this is based on work by well-known epidemiologists so calibrate accordingly. In the meantime, I hope you can learn something new as I did by reading through this example. Feel free to take this work and apply it elsewhere \u2013 internationally or to counties in the United States.","f1943a55":"This notebook is a fork of Kevin Systrom's analysis, adapted to run with Brazilian states. <br>\nKevin's original analysis can be read at http:\/\/systrom.com\/blog\/the-metric-we-need-to-manage-covid-19\/ ","04f2c9ff":"Finally, we can plot both the most likely values for $R_t$ and the HDIs over time. This is the most useful representation as it shows how our beliefs change with every day.","92b583a1":"### Choosing a Likelihood Function $\\mathcal{L}\\left(R_t|k_t\\right)$\n\nA likelihood function function says how likely a value of $R_t$ is given an observed number of new cases $k$.\n\nAny time you need to model 'arrivals' over some time period of time, statisticians like to use the [Poisson Distribution](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poisson_distribution). Given an average arrival rate of $\\lambda$ new cases per day, the probability of seeing $k$ new cases is distributed according to the Poisson distribution:\n\n$$P(k|\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$","7cc5a1da":"The Poisson distribution says that if you think you're going to have $\\lambda$ cases per day, you'll probably get that many, plus or minus some variation based on chance.\n\nBut in our case, we know there have been $k$ cases and we need to know what value of $\\lambda$ is most likely. In order to do this, we fix $k$ in place while varying $\\lambda$. __This is called the likelihood function.__\n\nFor example, imagine we observe $k=20$ new cases, and we want to know how likely each $\\lambda$ is:","a42c5ea9":"Notice how on Day 1, our posterior matches Day 1's likelihood from above? That's because we have no information other than that day. However, when we update the prior using Day 2's information, you can see the curve has moved left, but not nearly as left as the likelihood for Day 2 from above. This is because Bayesian updating uses information from both days and effectively averages the two. Since Day 3's likelihood is in between the other two, you see a small shift to the right, but more importantly: a narrower distribution. We're becoming __more__ confident in our believes of the true value of $R_t$.\n\nFrom these posteriors, we can answer important questions such as \"What is the most likely value of $R_t$ each day?\"","deaba881":"### Plotting in the Time Domain with Credible Intervals","8bc364a3":"We can see that the most likely value of $R_t$ changes with time and the highest-density interval narrows as we become more sure of the true value of $R_t$ over time. Note that since we only had four days of history, I did not apply my windowing modification to this sample. Next, however, we'll turn to a real-world application where this modification is necessary.","176f402a":"### Export Data to CSV","d8f67fe3":"We can also obtain the [highest density intervals](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/mathematics\/highest-density-interval) for $R_t$:\n\n> Note: I apologize in advance for the clunky brute force HDI algorithm. Please let me know if there are better ones out there.","30c19515":"Taking a look at the state, we need to start the analysis when there are a consistent number of cases each day. Find the last zero new case day and start on the day after that.\n\nAlso, case reporting is very erratic based on testing backlogs, etc. To get the best view of the 'true' data we can, I've applied a gaussian filter to the time series. This is obviously an arbitrary choice, but you'd imagine the real world process is not nearly as stochastic as the actual reporting.","fd0ed015":"This says that if we see 20 cases, the most likely value of $\\lambda$ is (not surprisingly) 20. But we're not certain: it's possible lambda was 21 or 17 and saw 20 new cases by chance alone. It also says that it's unlikely $\\lambda$ was 40 and we saw 20.\n\nGreat. We have $\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\lambda_t|k_t\\right)$ which is parameterized by $\\lambda$ but we were looking for $\\mathcal{L}\\left(R_t|k_t\\right)$ which is parameterized by $R_t$. We need to know the relationship between $\\lambda$ and $R_t$","88d47297":"## Bettencourt & Ribeiro's Approach\n\nEvery day, we learn how many more people have COVID-19. This new case count gives us a clue about the current value of $R_t$. We also, figure that the value of $R_t$ today is related to the value of $R_{t-1}$ (yesterday's value) and every previous value of $R_{t-m}$ for that matter.\n\nWith these insights, the authors use [Bayes' rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bayes%27_theorem) to update their beliefs about the true value of $R_t$ based on how many new cases have been reported each day.\n\nThis is Bayes' Theorem as we'll use it:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k)=\\frac{P(R_t)\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(R_t|k)}{P(k)} $$\n\nThis says that, having seen $k$ new cases, we believe the distribution of $R_t$ is equal to:\n\n- The __prior__ beliefs of the value of $P(R_t)$ without the data ...\n- times the __likelihood__ of $R_t$ given that we've seen $k$ new cases ...\n- divided by the probability of seeing this many cases in general.\n\nImportantly, $P(k)$ is a constant, so the numerator is proportional to the posterior. Since all probability distributions sum to 1.0, we can ignore $P(k)$ and normalize our posterior to sum to 1.0:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k) \\propto P(R_t) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(R_t|k) $$\n\nThis is for a single day. To make it iterative: every day that passes, we use yesterday's conclusion (ie. posterior) $P(R_{t-1}|k_{t-1})$ to be today's prior $P(R_t)$ so on day two:\n\n$$ P(R_2|k) \\propto P(R_0)\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(R_2|k_2)\\cdot\\mathcal{L}(R_1|k_1) $$\n\nAnd more generally:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k_t) \\propto P(R_0) \\cdot {\\displaystyle \\prod^{T}_{t=0}}\\mathcal{L}(R_t|k_t) $$\n\nWith a uniform prior $P(R_0)$, this reduces to:\n\n$$ P(R_t|k_t) \\propto {\\displaystyle \\prod^{T}_{t=0}}\\mathcal{L}\\left(R_t|k_t\\right) $$"}}
