In this paper, we use a method for training non-Bayesian NNs to estimate a continuous target as well as its associated evidence in order to learn both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over the original Gaussian likelihood function and training the NN to infer the hyperparameters of the evidential distribution.","8e8b9c3c":"There is no clear relationship between the target variable and epistemic uncertainty. Again, this is good news for indicating room to improve the model. The bad news is that the uncertainty is extremely high.","dc4b88f1":"Nothing particularly noteworthy changes for the predicted target here.","fe74ff42":"The scale of aleatoric uncertainty is ~10 times smaller than the epistemic uncertainty, meaning that significant improvements can likely be made to the model without overfitting to the specific data. However, the scale of aleatoric uncertainty is still much larger than the scale of the target variable which is very worrying. This could indicate data quality issues of which there have been several examples posted.","1d062024":"# CommonLit Readability\nCurrently, most educational texts are matched to readers using traditional readability methods or commercially available formulas. However, each has its issues. Tools like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level are based on weak proxies of text decoding (i.e., characters or syllables per word) and syntactic complexity (i.e., number or words per sentence). As a result, they lack construct and theoretical validity. At the same time, commercially available formulas, such as Lexile, can be cost-prohibitive, lack suitable validation studies, and suffer from transparency issues when the formula's features aren't publicly available.\n\nCommonLit, Inc., is a nonprofit education technology organization serving over 20 million teachers and students with free digital reading and writing lessons for grades 3-12. Together with Georgia State University, an R1 public research university in Atlanta, they are challenging Kagglers to improve readability rating methods.\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll build algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, you'll pair your machine learning skills with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains. Winning models will be sure to incorporate text cohesion and semantics.","65604333":"From the trained model, we can compute the predicted target as well as measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.\n\n> [**Aleatoric uncertainty** is also known as statistical uncertainty, and is representative of unknowns that differ each time we run the same experiment. ... **Epistemic uncertainty** is also known as systematic uncertainty, and is due to things one could in principle know but do not in practice.](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uncertainty_quantification)","68f4503f":"There does not seem to be any dependence between RMSE and either type of uncertainty.","a3e1c81d":"This trend is more pronounced when looking at the predicted target variable.","158b422b":"Next we convert the text snippets to feature vectors using the pre-trained spaCy model.
