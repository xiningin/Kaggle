For each Pokemon type, we need to count up the number of times we caught that Pokemon (also called the <b>cumulative sum<\/b>). That way, we can tell you for any given moment in time how many Jigglypuffs we have, for example.","fa35251e":"Let's see a couple more types of Seaborn plot!\n\nOne type of plot is the violin plot, which shows you the distribution of some data points, split by category. In this example, the data points are the X coordinates of the Pokemon, and the categories are the type of Pokemon. You can see from this that a couple of them have different distributions than the others.","1fa9fbce":"Import libraries and load data","a38ea0e9":"We can easily plot the array we just made as a heatmap.","25c840eb":"That gives us \"True\" for all the Jigglypuff entries, and \"False\" for everything else.

Let's plot them to see if there are any patterns to where the different types show up.\n\nFor this, maybe we want to merge together a few dataframes from different games we've played. To do that, we'll first load all our files into a list, and then use the function \"concat\" to mush them together.","08b856c6":"Now, we can make an array the same size as the screen we were playing on earlier, and fill in each position according to how many times its position shows up in our dataframe.","129dc21c":"# Pokemon counts over time","bf95d82d":"And we can make a plot!"}}
