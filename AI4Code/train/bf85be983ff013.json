Mostly, users are lightly active in comparison to moderately and very active.\n* Moving (represented by distance and time active) is positive correlated to the amount of burned calories per users.\n* Sedenary time and the amount of burned calories have no significant relation. \n* Daily active and sleep have no clear relation either.\n* People fill the data of daily active and sleep the most, and rarely use the feature measuring heart rate and weight. It is also the reason, I can analyse the relation between daily activity and these feature.","6b134e55":"## Metadata\n* FitBit Fitness Tracker Data is downloaded from Kaggle data set. \n* These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.\n* It contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users.
