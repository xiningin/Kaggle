Select a bar or row in almost any visual to cross-filter the other visuals on the page. \n\n**Input data:**\n\nThis report helps to explore the data from the CORD-19 and CoronaWhy datasets. The primary data source is the [CoronaWhy NER CORD-19 dataset](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mikehoney\/coronawhy-plus), created by the [Coronawhy](http:\/\/www.coronawhy.org\/) data team. This is the result of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) analysis, run across all the papers in the CORD-19 v9 datatset that offer full text data. \n\nIt also uses the metadata file and associated json files from the [CORD-19 Research Challenge](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/). This is joined to the metadata file using the column: \"cord\\_uid\". This adds paper attributes such as \"Journal\" and Publication Date\". To keep the dataset size manageable while we iterate, the papers are filtered on Publication Date being 2018 or later.  \n\nStudy Design is sourced from David Mezzetti's Study Design categorisations from [this notebook]( https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/davidmezzetti\/cord-19-study-metadata-export).\n\nThe map is based on the location of author affiliations, provided by CoronaWhy (MongoDB).\n\nThe \"Included in Literature Review\" visual highlights papers that have been included in the \"AI Powered-Literature Review\", which is explored in detail in other reports above. The dataset used here is all the \"Kaggle Community\" and submissions by ML Authors, as included in the EDA report above.  [This notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/mikehoney\/ai-powered-literature-review-with-submissions) is used to collate that dataset.\n\n\n**Suggested method of use:**\n\nFirst use the Search box, slicers and other tiles (at the top and left of the page) to narrow the table of papers (right) down to your topic of interest. Click the link button on each row to open the paper via doi.org. Hover over a row in the table to see a pop-up table of the most frequent Named Entity Values in that paper (dynamically filtered).\n\nTo review the details table in full screen, use the **Focus mode** button in the top-right corner of the visual frame. You can click the column headers in the detailed table to sort the rows - shift-click to sort by multiple columns. \n\nEach tile has a tooltip that appears when you hover over it - look for the ? icons. These explain the source and give hints on how to use each tile.","7ee2de33":"Here's the link to view it in Full Screen:\n\nhttps:\/\/app.powerbi.com\/view?r=eyJrIjoiMWE1MjUyYTAtNzBkMy00NjRiLTg5MTEtNDM3Mzk2OTJjMzgyIiwidCI6ImRjMWYwNGY1LWMxZTUtNDQyOS1hODEyLTU3OTNiZTQ1YmY5ZCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D\n\nLike all Power BI reports, the visuals are highly interactive.

These are presented in the Power BI slicers and visuals on the middle and right side of the page, and also in the last 2 columns in the bottom table.  \n\nThe **Tag Count** attribute counts cells from the notebook output in columns named \"tag...\", that contain \"True\".\n\nThe other primary data source is the metadata.csv file and associated json files from the [CORD-19 Research Challenge](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/allen-institute-for-ai\/CORD-19-research-challenge\/).  The connection to the notebook output (described above) uses columns: \"cord_uid\", \"sha\". \n\nNote there are multple pages included. Use the page navigation control at bottom centre, e.g. **< 1 of 2 >**\n\nThe 2nd page uses a Q&A visual at (top right). This is an preview (beta) automated AI feature that understands the attributes of the metadata including the contents of the rows. At present it is \"untrained\" but it can be refined and improved.
