Any other score is 1 star.\n\nAlso, the Canadian Vintners Association bought a lot of ads on the site, so any wines from Canada should automatically get 3 stars, regardless of points.\n\nCreate a series `star_ratings` with the number of stars corresponding to each review in the dataset.","8658da81":"## Intro\n\nIn the last lesson you learned how to select just the data you want. Plucking the right data out of our data representation is critical to getting work done.\n\nHowever, the data does not always come in the format we want it. So you'll usually have to reformat it for the task at hand. Fortunately you can build the skills you need for this in the following exercises.\n\nLoad the data and our feedback system by running the following cell.","0cd04bec":"## 6.\nThere are only so many words you can use when describing a bottle of wine.
