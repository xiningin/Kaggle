Due to their interdependent nature, these three core issues are grouped together to represent a growing sector. While each a separate field of work, each is dependent on the presence of the other.

The indicator is calculated by taking the number of people living in slums of a city divided by the total population of this city, expressed as a percentage. At the country level, this percentage is calculated by taking the total number of people living in slums of all the cities of a country divided by the total population living in all the cities of the given country.\n\nUN-Habitat has developed a household level definition of a slum household in order to be able to use existing household-level survey and census data to identify slum dwellers among the urban population. \nhttps:\/\/indicators.report\/indicators\/i-66\/","fd990a90":"#Covid-19 Hazard & Exposure\n\nThe Hierarchy of Controls is a system used to deploy effective controls within an organization, workplace, or community to identify the most effective ways to control a hazard.

Eight out of ten people without access to safe drinking water live in rural areas and nearly half of them live in sub-Saharan Africa. The most deprived are still using untreated surface waters like lakes and rivers. Many of those deprived communities are located in remote hard to reach areas. Therefore, rural water supply will remain a challenge for many national governments and their development partners in the coming decade.\n\nSafety of drinking water is a growing concern in many parts of the world. Drinking water sources are increasingly under threat from contamination, which impacts on not only on the health of children, but also on the economic, environmental and social development of communities and nations.\n\nThreats to drinking water quality include unsafe handling and storage at the household: water drawn from safe sources may be contaminated by the time it reaches and is ultimately consumed in households.\nhttps:\/\/www.unicef.org\/wash\/3942_4456.html","80d71d17":"The numbers above are a little bit lower than the Main File (Covid-19 INFORM Risk Index).","de47996f":"#Water\n\nUNICEF\u2019s work in water focuses on the ability for children to access safe water, the quality of the water they can access and the journey they must take to collect it. UNICEF is at the forefront of exploring innovative ways to access water, and building climate resistant infrastructure.\n\n#Sanitation\n\nFor sanitation, UNICEF works to ensure access and use of basic toilets and ways to separate human waste from contact with people. One important area of work for sanitation is to end the practice of \u201copen defecation,\u201d and facilitate community-led initiatives to build, maintain and use basic toilets. \n\n#Hygiene\n\nUNICEF\u2019s work in hygiene is aimed at nurturing good hygiene practices, especially handwashing with soap.
