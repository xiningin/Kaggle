","d9aa3ce3":"# Extra packages I used:","5773b5a0":"We can see throuout the years that suicides increase in the year 1989 and increase each untill 1996.

In the recent years (2010 - 2015) the United States show the hightest number of suicides with ~20k in 2015 (11k+9k).\n\nNote: you can see the different countries when you hove over a scpecific block.","8c0dd0b5":"# Using Machine Learning to predict the suicide rate for 2016 and beyond\n\nNaturally, we would like to ask a propper ","8ba14937":"If you look at the ratio of suicides per 100k people filtered by age group you see the peole +75 years old have the highest numbers of suicides. Here is to note that this depends strongly as well on the population during this time as we can se in the lower panel. Because a relatively low number of suicides shows more because the general there is only a low number of people with an age of 75+ in the overall population. Therefore suicide at an ,,old\" age might be a serious problem in Germany.","993c4b0b":"In the plot above the gender distribution (only for female & male available) is shown. \nInterestingly in **ALL** of the countries suicides amongst males is more commen than females.

In 2009 and 2010 the GDP was lower than in 2008 (following the financial crisis) and during the same time a slight increase in suicide numbers is visible as well.
