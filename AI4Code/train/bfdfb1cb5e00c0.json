Here's your coding interview problem for today.\n\nThis problem was asked by Google.\n\nThe power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.\n\nFor example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, it should return {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.\n\nYou may also use a list or array to represent a set."}}
