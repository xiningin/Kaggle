Below lists the variables evaluated and the conclusions based on the statistical analysis run for each:\n\n1. On average, does playing a character in one type of role earn more than playing a character in the other type of role: damage versus healing?\n    * Tests conducted: T-Test\n    * Conclusion drawn: On average, there is no difference between the honor points earned as a damage role character versus a healing role character.\n2. On average, can a single class of character earn more honor points over the others? There are 12 different classes of characters to explore.\n    * Test conducted: ANOVA\n    * Conclusion drawn: On average, there is no statistically significant difference in playing one class over another to gain more honor points.\n3. On average, can characters earn more honor points in a specific battleground over the others? There are 10 different battlegrounds to be explored.\n    * Test conducted: ANOVA, Tukey HSD\n    * Conclusion drawn: The two battlegrounds where a player has a statistically significant chance of gaining more honor points, all other things being equal, are in Seathing Shore (SS) and Eye of the Storm (ES) over the other battlegrounds.\n\n## Other Considerations\n\nFirstly, this analysis is based on data that was collected between 2017 and 2018 and there have been two major content releases since this data was collected that provide other focuses for players outside of Honor points. Having said that, at the time that the data was collected, it is known in the WoW community of players that there are certain in-battle strategies that can help maximize how much honor is awarded to you and your team.\n\nOne of the major ways to make sure to boost the amount of honor you recieve is to be sure to win the battleground. I have not considered this variable in the analysis, but it could be a confounding factor to some of this analysis and warrants further exploration on a much larger dataset of the same type.\n\nAdditionally, spending more time in a battlground will afford more opportunities for honorable kills, which will also boost the amount of honor a player receives during a battleground. \n\nAnother factor is to focus on kills that are honorable as opposed to dishonorable. While Blizzard, the parent company of WoW, hasn't released an official statement of exactly what that means, an honorable kill has to do with making sure that you're killing opponents that are close to you in power and experience level.\n\nAnd the last I will mention is one I took into consideration when doing the analysis, which is to look for battlegrounds that have Bonus Event weeks attached to them. Those will inherently grant more honor points per playthrough than the same dungeon would without having a Bonus Week boost.","cb0200df":"Let's take a look at a box plot of Honor by each dungeon and see if any visually pop out, then we will run an ANOVA to see if there is any evidence of statistical difference.","d4a21268":"**The column headers decoded from the source of the data:**\n\n* Battleground: Two letter code to indicate the kind of battleground (see decode below).\n* Code: code for the battleground team instance (not needed for analysis).\n* Faction: faction of the player (Horde or Alliance).\n* Class: class of the player (warrior, paladin, hunter, rogue, priest, death knight, shaman, mage, warlock, monk, druid, demon hunter).\n* KB: number of mortal kills given by the player.\n* D: number of times that the player died.\n* HK: number of killings where the player or his\/her group contributed.\n* DD: damage done by the player.\n* HD: healing done by the player.\n* Honor: honor awarded to the player.\n* Win: 1 if the player won.\n* Lose: 1 if the player lost.\n* Rol: dps if the player is a damage dealer; heal if the player is focused on healing allies.
