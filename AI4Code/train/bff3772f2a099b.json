This is a boring math exercise, except in the case when some middle layer of the feed forward network has much fewer dimensions than the input. \n\n[many dimensions n] --> [much fewer dimensions m] --> [many dimensions n]\n\nThis has the effect of compressing the original data from n dimensions down to m dimensions. The auto-associative network is therefore a CODEC, with the encoder being the front half, and the decoder being the back half. \n\nIt also provides the researcher a qualitative way of picking a lower bound on the number of dimensions for internal layers of their feed-forward networks. \n\nHow? Just try different values for m, and then look at the output. If you can no longer recognize (classify) the output, then probably neither can a deep learning algorithm, and so m is probably too small. \n\nMake sure that the smallest layer in your network (through which all data must pass) is larger than that value of m you found to be \"too small.\"\n\n* References - originally forked from AshishPatel and collaborator: Have you check this approach... \ud83c\udfb5 \ud83c\udfb5 \ud83c\udfb5? - forked from seasalt or not??? by AshishPatel (+0\/\u20130)\n\n* P.S. The code also shows a method of taking the seismic 2d image data and turning it into a series of 1d columns. I was working on this as part of my contest entry. I was experimenting with doing some first-pass signal analysis transformations on the seismic data as the one-dimensional time varying data that it is (the time varying signal of the bounced back sound) like an ultrasound. I wanted to sanity check not only internal network dimensions, but also any extractable features that would make the classification run smoother.\n\nStart with some included components:","060f3cf1":"Let's see how we did!
