Indian developers are working on significantly lower salaries than the other groups.\n\nSo, what is the reason behind this huge difference? 2 possible reasons come to mind :-\n    \n1. __Indian developers are less qualified__: \n    * One way to measure the qualification is by college degree (*I agree that it isn't a good way but a lot of the companies do use college education as a yardstick to measure a candidate's qualification*).\n    * Another way is to use a candidate's interest in programming as a proxy for his\/her qualification (*Again, I know that it might not be the best possible way to measure it*). There were questions in the survey asking the responder whether he\/she codes as a hobby and his\/her participation in open-source culture. These might be able to indicate a candidate's interest in programming.\n    \n1. __Indian developers are working on younger developer positions__:\n\n    The younger or entry-level positions are probably paid lesser than the more experienced roles at any company.\n    \n    We have a few questions on the survey that can be used to investigate this - age of responder, years of experience with coding and years of experience with coding professionally.\n    \n*So, now I am going to use this survey's data to find out how true the above 2 statements are..*","9eea0fdb":"> - **~93% of the Indian responders are aged between 18-34 years whereas this number is 73% for the world taken as a whole and even lesser for the other 3 top responding countries.**","3ee9f115":"## An area for Q&A related to career growth:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"careerGrowth\"><\/a>","2d640dee":"# Education:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"education\"><\/a>\n**_Now, let's discuss the education of these developers.._**\n\n## Formal Education:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"formal\"><\/a>","4fe77d8d":"Both of them had the same set of options, viz.","d09151ce":"> - **India has a higher percentage of responders who want to work in a more specialised technical role than they are in right now (_lowest band in the above figure_).**\n> - **Unsurprisingly, it also has a lower percentage of responders who want to keep doing the same work (_orange band in the above figure_).**\n> - **There is also a larger percentage of Indians who wish to be product\/project managers in the next 5 years.**","f215d082":"## Students:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"student\"><\/a>","c7641873":"### Responsibility of unethical code:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"responsibilityEthics\"><\/a>","25b64639":"Clearly, there is a strong correlation between the number of years one has been coding and his\/her interest in the hypothetical tools.\n\n- **Younger developers tend to be much more interested in new hypothetical tools than the older developers.**\n- **This contrast is most striking for the tool - `\"A private area for people new to programming\"` (_1st row, 2nd figure_).

In this analysis we saw the same insights. We also saw that it is __not__ because the Indian developers don't have the necessary formal education. In fact, developers who have a traditional undergrad degree in a CS-related field are more common in India. It is also __not__ because the Indian developers are less interested in programming. \n- India had a late start in the world of computing but as we have seen in this analysis, its developers realised the potential of the last major revolution in tech - mobile apps. This makes me hopeful that we are catching up fast. Maybe, we will even play a pivotal role in defining the next major tech-revolution (*probably Artificial Intelligence*).\n- Talking about Artificial Intelligence, Indian developers are afraid of losing their jobs to it. Is that just paranoia or do they believe that they are doing a job which can be automated using some software in the future?\n   They are also more comfortable with allowing a software in the decision-making process. Is that a reflection of what they think about the current decision-makers in their company?\n- Job losses or not, in this fast-evolving tech scene, everyone needs to have a spirit self-learning. We saw in this analysis that self-education without taking any course isn't popular in India. That must change.\n- The developer community needs to make a conscious effort in on-boarding people from other disciplines. Software is getting more and more embedded in our lives each day and it is important that people from many different backgrounds are involved in building these softwares. This will especially become important as we move towards more capable AI systems so that they aren't biased.\n- Finally, it seems like India might be an important market for Stack Overflow. Indian developers use the website very frequently, they are the largest group of users of their enterprise level communication tool and are extremely interested in whatever new hypothetical tool they wish to make.\n\n*We saw in this analysis that there are very few experienced developers in India. This reflects how India missed the opportunity to play a defining role in the computing revolution that happened in the last century. But with the overwhelmingly large proportions of young developer talent, the current developer scene in the country looks very promising.*","95fc2cdd":"### Consider ethical implications of your code?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"ethicalImplications\"><\/a>","6beada20":"## Evolving definitions of \"fairness\" in algorithmic vs. human decisions:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"fairness\"><\/a>","e1ba81ae":"- **Salaries of Indian developers are much lower as compared to the world taken as a whole.**\n- **Salaries of developers in other 3 top responding countries - US, UK and Germany - are much higher than the world average.**\n\n*I want to understand why the salaries of Indian developers are so low as compared to the rest of the world.
