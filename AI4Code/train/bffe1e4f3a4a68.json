In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but in cases like when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words. Thus RNN came into existence, which solved this issue with the help of a Hidden Layer.\n\nWhy RNN's?\n\nhttps:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-do-we-use-an-RNN-instead-of-a-simple-neural-network\n\n## In-Depth Understanding\n\n* https:\/\/medium.com\/mindorks\/understanding-the-recurrent-neural-network-44d593f112a2\n* https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2E65LDnM2cA&list=PL1F3ABbhcqa3BBWo170U4Ev2wfsF7FN8l\n* https:\/\/www.d2l.ai\/chapter_recurrent-neural-networks\/rnn.html\n\n## Code Implementation\n\nSo first I will implement the and then I will explain the code step by step","bca40d12":"# About this Notebook\n\nNLP is a very hot topic right now and as belived by many experts '2020 is going to be NLP's Year' ,with its ever changing dynamics it is experiencing a boom , same as computer vision once did.

Here is a nice video explanining different types of model architectures : https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/nlp-sequence-models\/lecture\/BO8PS\/different-types-of-rnns.\nSeq2Seq is a many to many RNN architecture where the input is a sequence and the output is also a sequence (where input and output sequences can be or cannot be of different lengths).

Then we first add the Embedding layer.\nEmbedding layer is also a layer of neurons which takes in as input the nth dimensional one hot vector of every word and converts it into 300 dimensional vector , it gives us word embeddings similar to word2vec. We could have used word2vec but the embeddings layer learns during training to enhance the embeddings.\nNext we add an 100 LSTM units without any dropout or regularization\nAt last we add a single neuron with sigmoid function which takes output from 100 LSTM cells (Please note we have 100 LSTM cells not layers) to predict the results and then we compile the model using adam optimizer \n\n* Comments on the model<br><br>\nWe can see our model achieves an accuracy of 1 which is just insane , we are clearly overfitting I know , but this was the simplest model of all ,we can tune a lot of hyperparameters like RNN units, we can do batch normalization , dropouts etc to get better result.
