To get more insights out of the data","d419b173":"### DESCRIPTION\n\nOne of the leading retail stores in the US, Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock some times, due to the inappropriate machine learning algorithm. An ideal ML algorithm will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index, etc.\n\nWalmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of all, which are the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete\/ideal historical data. Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available.\n\n### Dataset Description\n\nThis is the historical data that covers sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01, in the file Walmart_Store_sales. Within this file you will find the following fields:\n\n    Store - the store number\n\n    Date - the week of sales\n\n    Weekly_Sales -  sales for the given store\n\n    Holiday_Flag - whether the week is a special holiday week 1 \u2013 Holiday week 0 \u2013 Non-holiday week\n\n    Temperature - Temperature on the day of sale\n\n    Fuel_Price - Cost of fuel in the region\n\n    CPI \u2013 Prevailing consumer price index\n\n    Unemployment - Prevailing unemployment rate\n\n#### Holiday Events\n\nSuper Bowl: 12-Feb-10, 11-Feb-11, 10-Feb-12, 8-Feb-13\nLabour Day: 10-Sep-10, 9-Sep-11, 7-Sep-12, 6-Sep-13\nThanksgiving: 26-Nov-10, 25-Nov-11, 23-Nov-12, 29-Nov-13\nChristmas: 31-Dec-10, 30-Dec-11, 28-Dec-12, 27-Dec-13\n\n##### Analysis Tasks\n\n##### Basic Statistics tasks\n\n- Which store has maximum sales\n- Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot. Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation\n- Which store\/s has good quarterly growth rate in Q3\u20192012\n- Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together\n- Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights\n\n##### Statistical Model\n- Linear Regression \u2013 Utilize variables like date and restructure dates as 1 for 5 Feb 2010 (starting from the       earliest date in order). Hypothesize if CPI, unemployment, and fuel price have any impact on sales.\n\n    Change dates into days by creating new variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","308ea2d5":"# Quatrely Growth Rate","75441af0":"### Plotting Weekly_sales day wise for store 1, by keeping holidays as a parameter to get more insights.","845c0449":"#### Task 2 - Maximum Std is for store 14 and coefficient of variation is max for store 35, to draw more insights refer the plot","8df2e373":"### Month and Sem Wise Sales in 2010\n\n* Let's See Monthwise Weekly_Sales and Semwise for all the Years.","45db7e0f":"### Analysis \n\n* Plot 1, shows the monthwise histogram of Weekly_Sales in year 2010 acorss all the 45 Stores. After Analysing we got to know that the month has done fairly better than other months in 2010. So we thought of plotting month 12, to analyse which Because of which date acrosss all 45 stores we are seeing this sudden increase in Weekly_Sales.\n\n* Plot 2, is a barplot of sem wise weekly_Sales where Fall Sem is doing fairly better than Spring sem. You may ask why is it so ? Reason being Events Like SuperBowl which is being organised in the monthf Feb, is most likely to domninate over the other Holidays like that of Christmas.\n\n* Last Two Plots Talks about the how sales are varying in month of december. On plotting we found out that Because of Christmas we have more sales during the month of december. Provided that these sales beating the sales of the month feb when superbowl was organised. Which is putting fall sem ahead of Spring sem Collectively\n\n* Moreover, due to high increase in Sales during fall sem Walmart may wanna channelise their supply chain across all the 45 stores during fall sem in order to  perform in consecutive quater of the next Year. Mainly Between september and December , very important Months.","41fa583e":"#### Grouping The Data Quater Wise to do further Analysis","c355bb1e":"### Analysis \n\n* Again, in this Plot you can see for the month Decembde Sales are Pretty high than other months and hence Fall sem is doing better than Spring Sem. So we analysed Month 12 again and found out that During christmas Period Sales in the month of December are fairly more than the other Dates. Also Christmas week is a Holiday_Week, by this our previous analysis on which holiday season dates have their mean sales more than the other dates gets justified, why ? these Holiday seasons are doing better than non holiday seasons.","955bf36f":"### Month and Sem Wise Sales in 2011","ac7770ca":"#### ANALYSIS : \n- In the above plot you can see that on the days of holiday there is comparatively more sales for store1, infact more than the whole week. Clearly Customers Prefer going to Stores during a holiday week. More Importantly During christmas days the sales have gone really high.","b45f7908":"* Weekly_Sales During non holiday season overall, which farely does not include sales during holiday weeks and you can see weekly_sales in feb 2010 of non holiday season across all 45 stores is less than that of date 12 feb 2010, on the day when we had superbowl, clearly stating that superbowl has made the impact on sales in a positive manner. which tells us to be ready with certain products which we have sold last year more in number. Like softdrinks and snacks to complete the orders placed. ","e536bc7c":"#### Analysis \n\n* From the above plots, you can see how Weekly_Sales and CPI are correlated to each other. Also we rejected the null hypothesis saying that ther is no relationship between Weekly_sales and CPI. But we found there is a positive corrlation between CPI and Weekly_sales, which we have found out by our statistical Modelling.\n\n* Also The CPI is not normally distributed and line regression plot is showing how CPI is varying with Weekly_Sales on days of Holidays and non holiday weeks.","48e5f801":"\n\n\n### Basic Statistical Tasks\n - Data Understanding \n - Exploratory Data Analysis \n ","20c54552":"* These are the mean of Weekly_Sales during holiday season for all the given years and their months. Starting from year 2010, in the month of Feb we had super bowl because of which we have seen increase in Weekly_Sales. Which is More than the whole month Weekly_sales mean across all 45 store for year 2010 in month of Feb. So super bowl did have an impact in terms of Weekly_Sales of Walmart Stores.","d244f053":"#### Gerneral Discussions And Results (Insights)\n\n* CPI, Fuel_Price are positively correlated with Weekly_Sales whereas, rate of Unemployment is fairly negatively correlated and we have seen drop in weekly_sales of Products due to increase of rate of unemployment.\n\n* There are quaters in which stores major loss, due to high rate of unemployment, mostly during the spring sem altogether we can expect less weekly_sales as compared to spring semester.\n\n* Mostly people try to buy expensive products during the holiday seasons likely to be christmas and Super bowl days where we have seen rise in weekly_sales of Product.\n\n* Store 20 is overall doing fine in terms of Weekly_sales, as analysed it is the only store with max weekly_sales, whereas Store 35 has no particular pattern of Weekly_Sales due to high variance observed.\n\n* Walmart should invest in marketing of expensive products during the spring sem, to get more customer base for such products, also should only open the supply chain for the prodcuts which are in demand during that season.\n\n","88707484":"### Sales During a Holiday Week \n\n* Grouping data holiday and non holiday week wise to analyse how weekly_sales varied in both the cases.","0eba8d1a":"### Basic Insights Of Data","ad22fa0a":"#### Analysis \n\n* As you can see from the above plot there are few stores which have significantlly made enormous growth in quater3 in numbers, so store 7 has made the highest growth, but store 14 has been seeing a tough with it's sales during quater 3 and has significantlly facing a huge loss. Further Analysis can be by considering other variables like cpi and unemployment which made sotre 14 to see such a huge loss in quater 3 of year 2012. Also store 28 has also shown in terms of minimizing their loss in comparison to quater2, refer to the plot below for quater2.\n","12fb5027":"#### Analysis \n- Also now if you look at this lineplot of Weekly_Sales for store 35 it is clear that how sales are varying with during a week of a year, which is highly variable. So you can say that there is very irregular sale pattern for store 35. During the holidays only it is seeing high amount of sales. So you can infer that the store35 will be seeing high demands in products due sudden rise in sales during holiday seasons.","301fd2aa":"#### Analysis\n\n* Plot 1 and Plot 2 gives monthly and semester view of Weekly_Sales in Year 2012\n* We are analysisng this year on the basis of Sotres and Weekly_Sales in month 7 at the Start of Quater3, so we can see that the store 7 is making enough ptofit to cover up the losses made in the last quater and to make a profit in turnover by the end of year 2012\n* Also We have data till october 2012, so we cannot provide sales done at the of year, because of which you can see now almost both semesters have fairly equal amount of sales. By which we can conclude that Walmart is making a huge profit at the end of year during Christmas acrosss all the 45 stores.","7543b557":"### Analysis\n- This boxplot shows the weekly_sales for store 35 which has few outliers, clearly saying that it has highest coefficient of variation due to outliers as you can see in the above boxplot and distribution curve.","5e2ce11e":"* ##### So, we will be dividing the whole dataset into 4 quaters for year 2012, to analyse how weekly_sales varying for different stores in different quaters.\n\n* ##### Grouping Data by Year","496534be":"### Hypothesis Testing - Fuel_Price","506c905b":"### Hypothesis Testing - Uneployment","74bdcdb3":"#### Analysis\n\n* Any way, you can form the picture from the above lineplot that most of the holiday dates are performing better than Non holiday dates in terms of Sales, so basically walmart has to keep their supply chain smooth to keep their store vendors ready to handle such sudden increase demands of product during the holiday season. Moreover, people usually buy products on weekends too. So mostly for all the hoidays the mean sales are more than that of non hoiday weeks. Below is the dataframe which has mean of Weekly_Sales in Holiday week months and non holiday months, so you can refer it to get more insights.","8dba16e4":"## Displaying 4 Quaters of Year 2012","e8bbb6ac":"#### Analysis \n\n* Now, as you can see from the above plot that in this quater, i.e. 2 of year 2012 store 7 really had a bad time in terms of weekly_sales, but now when we look at the plot of quater 3 store 7 has covered up from the losses, by making the highest growth in the quater in comparision to other stores. Store 28 is also not doing well in terms of growth in this quater. So walmart shoud invest money in marketing in the areas\/city where store 7 and 28 are located so as to recover from overall loss by making a huge turnover in the consecutive quater.","ee88a695":"#### Plotting The data of growth rate in quater 3 of Year 2012.","999560e6":"#### Analysis \n\n* We can slight growth in Weekly_Sales with increase in Fuel_Price as suggested by alternate Hypothesis and the correlation plot from above.\n\n* It is unclear to comment on how mean is varying for Fuel_price as the distribution has two peaks and is varying alot. We can also see More numner of Sales when the Fuel_Price are higher speaking of which we can conclude that most of the people were able to afford the products sold. Whereas, we can see many Orange points i.e. Sales only during Holiday_Weeks when fuel_prices were fairly low."}}
