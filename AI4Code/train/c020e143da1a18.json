It was discussed in Yorko's tutorial, so I will not pay too much attention to this method, I will remind it's basic steps, and later K-means will be used as a baseline model. It is easy to undersatnd and easy to implement K-means. K-means tries to choose centroids ('means') in order to minimize within-cluster inertia.\n\nBasic iterations of K-means look like this:\n\n1. We randomly initialize K cluster centers. Centers of clusters are simply some of the observation from given dataset;\n2. For each observation from dataset is computed the distance between one and all clusters' centers. Observations relate to a cluster, which centers is the closest to them;\n3. Centers of clusters are recomputed based on values of all data points within a given cluster;\n4. Steps 2-3 are repeated until convergence is not reached.","d246ca58":"## Unsupervised Learning: Clustering","df78f0c9":"1. https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/kashnitsky\/topic-7-unsupervised-learning-pca-and-clustering\n2. https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/modules\/clustering","142743c0":"**Advantages:**\n\n1.

Enjoy!","4d8651ba":"Mean-shift is a clustering algorithm, which aims to locate centers of clusters in the most dense area of data points. Mean-shift starts from a ramdom point, where it locates a circular sliding window of radius r (which is a parameter we are able to specify). Mean-shift is shifting step-by-step center point to a region with higher density. The algorithm will shift the sliding window untill he can not find a direction with higher density of data points. When multiple sliding windows iverlap each other, then the window, which contains the biggest number of data points, is choosed as a final cluster.","26dce36c":"### Birch","f99ab2e0":"**Advantages:**\n\n1.

So it is quite similar to Mean-shift, still there is a difference between them. DBSCAN works this way:\n\n1. DBSCAN starts with an arbitrary data point, which is not labeled as visited. Using parameter epsilon, which has to be set by user, an algorithm extracts the neighborhood of this data point. Neighborhood are all points within distance epsilon.\n2. There is one more parameter, which has to be set - min_samples. If there are min_samples within neighborhood, than starts clustering process, and this data point becomes the first data point in cluster. If there are less data pioint in neighborhood than min_samples, than this data point is labeled as outlier, but it is also labeled as visited.\n3. For the first data point belonging to a cluster all data points in it's neighborhood also become part of this cluster.\n4. The process from 2-3 is repetated for all data points in cluster, untill there are no unvisited data points.\n5. When the algorithm managed to visit all data points in the first cluster, it starts with another arbitrary data point, which has not been visited. Then process from 2-4 is repeated for all new clusters. In the end there are no unvisited data points, all of them belong to some clusters or labeled as outliers.","702118ee":"## Conclusion","ec915a3a":"### K-Means","fe0eb9b1":"### DBSCAN","93f3169b":"### K-Means","74605e4a":"Birch is a clustering algorithm, which can handle a large amount of data.

Inside CFN there are some Characteristic Feature Subclusters (CFS), which hold sufficient information about data.

Number of samples in a subcluster;\n2. Linear Sum - A n-dimensional vector holding the sum of all samples;\n3. Squared Sum - Sum of the squared L2 norm of all samples;\n4.
