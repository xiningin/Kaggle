However, I would be curious if their actual diving scores in the competition are correlated. \n\nOne of the reasons to check the scores is because each set of divers does 5 dives. There are certain required techniques that have to be completed at certain difficulty levels. So, I would be interested to see if the height\/weight has an effect on the individual dives that comprise the final scores.\n\nSo, I scraped the 2016 diving scores off of wikipedia, couldn't find a direct source for the scores (the referenced website wasn't working for me).  The score chart for 5 dives is shown below.","cb102dbe":"For Women's Springboard, the data only goes through the five most recent olympics. The Gold medalists for the last 4 olympics have been the Chinese team, Wu Minxia being a part of it for every year since 2004. Impressive. I would like to see if the height\/weight relationship between the two divers does, but the fact that the gold medalists are mostly the same team 4 years running would skew toward suggesting that if you want Gold, be Wu Minxia. \n\nLooking further into this, the wikipedia page for Olympic Diving shows the scores of the each of the diving teams. The Chinese team consistently hit 80 points on the last dive. The margin of their wins is always quite large. \n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diving_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_synchronized_3_metre_springboard","edcfb3f6":"Looks like there is a small correlation between height difference and dive 2. The 3 teams with a higher than 1cm height difference scored in the top 3 for that particular dive. From what I've researched on the particular dives, there are certain diving approaches that are to be completed. \n\n*A hypothesis might be that there could be an effect on how it looks from the judging stand. A perspective effect of 8cm(a little more than 3inches) could make the divers look like are the same height and feel more synced up from the judges point of view*\n\nTo really be sure that there isn't any sort of effect of the divers height on the scoring, I would have to check all the scores from multiple competitions to see if there is an actual correlation for the similarity in height of the divers. \n\nReference for how diving is scored in the Olympics: https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/story\/how-is-diving-scored"}}
