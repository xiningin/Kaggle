non-typical objects present in the dataset. These objects represent minor share of the training set, however they can significantly distort and skew the regression model.\n\nTo improve the model quality and robustness to extreme outliers we can eliminate them from the training set altogether. In this case the model will predict prices for typical houses more accurately but errors in regards to extreme outliers will not be eliminated. For practical business purposes this approach would be more useful than overfitting the model on nontypical data samples.","27c6f19f":"### Defining target value and input features","27a16b53":"### Making prediction on the test set","c5bc6c83":"### Reading data","97574e07":"Some of the input features have high share of missing values, which makes them less useful for the model.

Outliers in the real estate market usually belong to one of the following groups:\n- unique properties with rare features that are not captured in the stardard description;\n- properties sold on special conditions (seller looking for a quick deal, etc.);\n- errors in property description.\n\nTaking that into account, the optimal metrics to evaluate the house price model would be R2 (determination coefficient) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). MSE (Mean Squared Error) in this case should not be considered as it amplifies the importance of outliers.","cf661b8d":"Missing values in the remaining columns will be imputed using 'median' strategy for numeric columns and 'most_frequent' strategy for categorical columns. Some of the columns that do not contain NaNs in the train set have missing values in the test set.

Shuffling the train samples in this case is not necessary because original data is not sorted in any way.\n\nAll input features that are available in the dataset are relevant to the purpose of pricing the house, though they vary in their significance. The best approach would be to use as much original features as possible and fit the data to some kind of decision tree algorithm, which automatically detects the most important features.","fdffb074":"### Dealing with missing values and categorical features","072c741a":"Train set is comparable in size to the test set. Target column ('SalePrice') is present only in the train set.","0387aea9":"This competition requires to predict total price of the house based on the given numeric and categorical features. In appraisal industry it is generally considered the best approach to estimate the price of real estate per sq.m or sq.ft. Total price is then calculated by multiplying the price per sq.m or sq.ft by the floor area. The reason for that being that size of the house in itself is a parameter, which affects the price per sq.m (the larger the house - the smaller the price per sq.m).\n\nPrice per sq.m also depends on the number of floors in the house. As a rule, the larger area is being concentrated on the first floor - the higher the price. Multi-storey houses with large basements are priced lower per sq.m than one-storey houses of similar total floor area.","bd0620f4":"### Making a pipeline for regression model"}}
