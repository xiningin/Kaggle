Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\n### features we are interested in :\nsurvived, sex, age, fare, class, embark_town, alone.\n","e2e43700":"> Observation(4): Most of the Titanic passengers were in the third class.","79754750":"> observation(8): A very large percentage of the non-surviving passengers were from the third class\nAnd the largest percentage of surviving passengers were from the first class,\nThis means that the first class is equipped with more safety measures than the second and third classes","d3cd8437":"<a id='wrangling'><\/a>\n## Data Wrangling\n> In this step we will import libraries wich will help us in our analysis and explore our data to know what operation we need to do to make our data clean and tidy .","50dc745f":"> observation(9): Passengers who were alone were more likely to not survive"}}
