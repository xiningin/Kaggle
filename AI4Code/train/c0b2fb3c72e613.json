","15129145":"### Outliers\n---- \nOutliers are observations that are significantly distant from other observations. These do not follow the general trend of the data. Outliers can indicate variation or error in the data. Outliers in a single variable\/column are called **univariate** while outliers in multiple variables\/columns are called **multivariate**.","f3329642":"> why we chose 3 when filtering data ? in normally distributed data, approximately 97% of the data lies inside 3 standard deviations. So, if a data value has a z-score greater than 3, it is an outlier.","88d9aa37":"### Z-Score\n----\n\nA Z-score is a numerical measurement used in statistics of a value's relationship to the mean (average) of a group of values. Z scores are used in statistics to study variance of data. We can use z-scores to filter outliers easily.\n>  It used to get an idea about the spread of the data","694a2567":"### Filtering outlier\n----\nWe can also use quartile ranges to filter for outliers. Let\u2019s see an example of that below. We will be filtering rows that are outliers in all three variables.","d2826a86":"As we can see here `MSRP` has only one outlier, `SALES` have many outlier, and `QUANTITYORDERD` has also some outlier. ","40cfd555":"import dataset ","e75106c1":"we can see that, now we have very few outlier in the box plot.","e88d960f":"### Scatter Plot\n----\nScatter plots are a handy way of looking at point and collective outliers. In this below code we choose only 3 columns that only make sense. ","e2860d7f":"### Outlier detection\n----\nOutlier detection is very important step in data cleaning and exploring. \nOutliers can be detected both visually and mathematically. Some plots are very helpful in visualizing outliers, such as **box plots** and **scatter plots**. However, it is sometimes tricky to decide whether or not to remove the outliers. We should remove outliers when we are certain that these outliers were results of some errors.\n\n#### Box plot\n----\n\nBox plots, by definition, plot outliers as points and group the rest of the observations. The criteria of a box plot for classifying a point as an outlier is if the point is greater than $Q3 +(1.5\u2217IQR)$ or lower than $Q1-(1.5*IQR)$\nwhere, \nwhere $Q1 = First Quartile$\n$Q3 = Third Quartile$\n\n$IQR = Inter Quartile Range = Q3-Q1$\n\n![bloxplot](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/11475\/1*2c21SkzJMf3frPXPAR_gZA.png)"}}
