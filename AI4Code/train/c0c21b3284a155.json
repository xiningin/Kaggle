This is a tricky process which is going to require entirely different methods for different pieces of information.  Without a large training set to use data-driven methods (like training a machine learning model for classification), we're limited to heuristics developed using subject matter expertise.  We fully acknowledge they're imperfect, but we can tweak them as we identify gaps, and being able to automatically extract at least some of the required information can save human reviewers a lot of time.\n\nThis is the other part of the workflow which requires a lot of iteration.  The performance of each heursitic can only be improved through back-and-forth with a subject matter expert after reviewing the performance and identifying potential areas of improvement.  The goal of the heuristics should be to err on the side of capturing too much information -- then it's easy for human reviewers to quickly look through and identify the correct info, whereas if info is missing, they have to go back and read the abstract and potentially full text.\n\nWe use the title and abstract for information extraction due to memory limitations generating annotations for the full text of all papers.","7735f4f2":"## Filter papers\n\nThe first step of our workflow is to use the annotated terms to filter the papers.  We're interested in all papers that discuss both COVID-19 and hypercoagulability.\n\nWe identify hypercoagulability using a set of related concepts from the UMLS vocabulary identified by the Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) in the code below.  Unfortunately, the UMLS release available in scispacy's EntityLinker is from 2017, so it doesn't have any of the newer concepts that were added for COVID-19 and related terms.  Instead, we do a text search based on a list of synonyms.\n\nNote this is the first place in the workflow where iteration is necessary.  New relevant terms may be discovered, and terms which were previously thought to be relevant may turn out to be irrelevant.  The filter criteria here should be easy to edit going forward, so iteration can be rapid.  The final state of this notebook submission represents multiple rounds of iterating on filter terms.","f3361c68":"### Outcome\/Conclusion Excerpt\n\nHere, we'll search for various words that might indicate a sentence describes an outcome or conclusion and report all such sentences.","8b2484da":"Now we have the final set of papers we're interested in.","97d1ae26":"# CORD-19 Semi-Automated Rapid Review Workflow\n## Task: What is the best method to combat the hypercoagulable state seen in COVID-19?\n\nThis notebook implements an **iterative, semi-automated workflow** for key components of a **rapid systematic review**.\n\n**[Systematic reviews](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Systematic_review)** are a comprehensive and transparent method for synthesizing evidence from the published literature. What primarily distinguishes systematic reviews from other types of literature reviews is the level of detail and thoroughness; researchers involved in systematic reviews take painstaking care into developing a precise review question, inclusion and exclusion criteria, search strategy, assessments of study quality, and synthesis of results (often in the form of a formal meta-analysis).   \n\n**[Rapid reviews](https:\/\/guides.temple.edu\/c.php?g=78618&p=4156608)** are a timely alternative when a full systematic review is too resource or time intensive to conduct (systematic reviews often take [12-24 months](https:\/\/www.heardproject.org\/news\/rapid-review-vs-systematic-review-what-are-the-differences\/) to complete). Rapid reviews attempt to balance the need for systematic and transparent methods with expediency by simplifying the review components.  This may include reducing the number of databases for search, assigning a single reviewer in each step while another reviewer verifies the results, excluding grey literature, or narrowing the scope of the review.\n\nThis submission deals with two fundamental components of a rapid review: (1) [searching the literature for relevant studies](#Filter-papers), and (2) [extracting key information](#Extract-information) from studies relevant to the research question. While the specific task here is to extract various information related to hypercoagulability and COVID-19, this approach could be applied to any rapid systematic review process.\n\n![Process Diagram](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vc2AVsQ.png)\n\n### Table of Contents\n* [Filter Papers](#Filter-papers)\n* [Extract Information](#Extract-information)\n   * [Sample Size](#Sample-Size)\n   * [Study Type](#Study-Type)\n   * [Severity](#Severity)\n   * [Therapeutic Methods](#Therapeutic-Methods)\n   * [Outcome\/Conclusion Excerpt](#Outcome\/Conclusion-Excerpt)\n   * [Primary Endpoint](#Primary-Endpoint)\n   * [Clinical Improvement](#Clinical-Improvement)\n* [Generate Final Output](#Generate-Final-Output)","3a979c15":"### Study Type\n\nThere's a fairly complex set of definitions for study types -- we'll try to pull out some concepts and tokens that might indicate one study type over the other.  If we can't make a reasonable guess, we'll leave it blank.\n\nNote we introduce an additional study type: \"Observational\".  In many cases, distinguishing between retrospective and prospective observational studies is very difficult, so we include a fallback umbrella term which encapsulates both.\n\nWe also didn't find enough instances of the following study types to develop rules for them:\n\n- Cross-sectional study\n- Case series\n- Ecological regression","f6d86799":"### Severity\n\nThe severity is tougher to identify, since there are several general words which may be used to describe it.  We'll make a list of terms related to severity, pull them out, report all the unique ones, and report any context that could help a human reviewer make a quick decision.","ea209e22":"Here, we define a function that provides an iterator over all the JSON metadata documents in the competition input dataset and some other functions that return the title\/abstract\/other data from the JSON format.  We'll use these to cleanly access the data in each paper.","90e70cf8":"### Sample Size\n\nTo identify the sample size heuristically, we'll use spaCy's dependency parsing to find nouns representing a study participant (\"subject\", \"patient\", etc) and record any numbers that were associated with them.  For each extracted sample size, we return the containing sentence, so a human reviewer can quickly determine whether they agree without reading the full text.\n\nThis produces a lot of false positives which are difficult to disambiguate from the language features alone -- ex.  a study may mention various subsets of its cohort, or a review paper may be describing the sample size of the papers it's reviewing.  We'll do a best-effort disambiguation by taking the maximum number if there are multiple numbers, to attempt to avoid picking up subsets of the sample.\n\nWe note this approach fails in some cases on this dataset because line numbers are embedded in many PDFs which confuse spaCy's dependency parser.  For example:\n\n> This 95 model is first trained on patients from a single hospital and then externally validated on 96 patients from four other hospitals. We achieve strong performance, notably predicting 97 mortality\n\nOur somewhat naive approach doesn't recognize that \"96\" in the above excerpt is a line number and reports it incorrectly.  Implementing a method to clean the line numbers (or parsing the PDFs in a way which doesn't include them in the first place) should improve the performance.\n\nWe noticed other failure cases which aren't easily addressable using this approach:\n\n - Case studies with a single patient\n - Sentences where the spaCy model's part-of-speech tagger fails (ex. in \"83 confirmed patients\", \"confirmed\" could be parsed as a verb rather than an adjective)\n - Papers which don't explicitly list the full sample size (ex. \"100 COVID-19 patients and 200 non-COVID-19 patients\")\n \nHowever, we find that in general, the heuristic performs fairly well, and returning the context of the sentence along with the extracted sample size allows a human reviewer to very quickly confirm whether the extracted value is correct.","834388af":"First, fix versions of all our dependencies for reproducibility:","e2916517":"### Clinical Improvement\n\nThis is a tricky one to identify with heuristics, since it's very general.  We're going to simplify it down to the problem of identifying a set of biological mechanisms\/functions and tagging them as \"good\" or \"bad\" (from a clinical health perspective).  We can then identify all instances of these mechanisms in the text and use the spaCy model's dependency parser to identify whether those functions went \"up\" or \"down\".  We make the extremely naive assumption that a \"good\" mechanism going \"up\" or a \"bad\" mechanism going \"down\" leads to clinical improvement and vice versa.\n\nWe'll use CUIs when possible to ensure maximal coverage of synonyms and incorporating the biological knowledge in UMLS, but we'll use exact token searches in some cases where CUIs aren't tagged or otherwise don't exist for certain concepts.","de59072f":"### Generate Final Output\n\nWe can apply all of the above heuristics to each document in turn to automatically generate a spreadsheet for human review.  Human reviewers can manually correct items which need correcting and provide feedback to improve the heuristics.","33cfb4a1":"### Therapeutic Methods\n\nHere, we'll use the annotated UMLS concepts to identify therapeutic methods and return their contexts.","c17d9f4a":"### Primary Endpoint\n\nWe'll search for words that describe the primary endpoint(s) of the study and report all such sentences.","f4f0f20c":"For filtering papers and most of the information extraction tasks, we'll need to identify specific biological concepts in the text and potentially relate them to each other or other words.  Doing this via manual text matching (regexes, string searching) is difficult and error-prone because of the wide variety of synonyms and related terms for any given biological concept.  Entirely data-driven approaches that might address the synonym problem (similarity calculations\/searches using word\/sentence embeddings) are also not ideal due to the inability to tweak\/tune the results using valuable subject matter expertise.\n\nTherefore, our chosen approach for concept annotation is to use scispacy's [EntityLinker](https:\/\/github.com\/allenai\/scispacy#entitylinker) to annotate [UMLS](https:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/research\/umls\/index.html) concepts in the text via string matching.  The UMLS vocabulary encodes a wealth of biological knowledge about concepts and how they relate, saving us a lot of time coming up with synonym lists and identifying related terms.  The annotations are imperfect, since there are many cases where string matching can fail to disambiguate between concepts that are named the same but mean different things (e.g., someone named Parkinson vs Parkinson's disease).  However, the results are fairly good overall and provide a decent baseline.  Improved results could potentially be obtained by training and applying a model which uses machine learning to disambiguate entity mentions, such as [MedCAT](https:\/\/github.com\/CogStack\/MedCAT).\n\nIn the [generate-umls-annotations kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jasonnance\/generate-umls-annotations), we applied the EntityLinker to all the articles in the CORD-19 dataset and saved the annotations.  The result is a directory full of JSON objects containing lists of annotated term data.  We'll load some data in below and display an example annotation:","5b54f2fe":"## Conclusion\n\nWhile we provide a semi-automated workflow to help with components of a rapid review (specifically, \"the best method to combat the hypercoagulable state seen in COVID-19\"), there are several areas for future work.  First, we restricted our submission to the CORD-19 literature set, which only contains articles from PMC, the WHO, bioRxiv, and medRxiv.  Though examining fewer databases and grey literature is a common strategy in rapid reviews, it may bias the findings towards articles that are more convenient to access. Additionally, we do not tackle other important aspects of rapid reviews such as a risk of bias assessment, reliablity checks by multiple reviewers, or a meta-analysis. Given we did not have a targeted [PICO](https:\/\/canberra.libguides.com\/c.php?g=599346&p=4149722) statement defining our intended population, comparison groups, etc., as part of the challenge, we felt these steps would be better addressed in future work supported by domain experts and systematic review methodologists. \n\nMethodologically, our approaches relies heavily on heuristics, ontologies, and domain input. While data engineering folk wisdom [champions the use of heuristics](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/machine-learning\/guides\/rules-of-ml#rule_1_don%E2%80%99t_be_afraid_to_launch_a_product_without_machine_learning) as a strong baseline, ideally, machine learning algorithms could improve upon these heuristics in a more systematic way. Supervised machine learning was not strongly considered for information extract due to the limited number of articles and labeled data. Future work could explore the use of methods such as [data programming](https:\/\/dawn.cs.stanford.edu\/pubs\/snorkel-nips2016.pdf) to integrate heuristics as noisy labels for supervised learning.
