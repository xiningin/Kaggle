So , bank wants to convert the liability based customers to personal loan customers. (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success.\nThe department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.","6db339f5":"#### Information on the features or attributes\n\nThe attributes can be divided accordingly :\n* The variable **ID** does not add any interesting information. There is no association between a person's customer ID  and loan, also it does not provide any general conclusion for future potential loan customers. We can neglect this information for our model prediction.\n\nThe binary category have five variables as below:\n\n* Personal Loan - Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last campaign? ** This is our target variable**\n* Securities Account - Does the customer have a securities account with the bank?\n* CD Account - Does the customer have a certificate of deposit (CD) account with the bank?\n* Online - Does the customer use internet banking facilities?\n* Credit Card - Does the customer use a credit card issued by UniversalBank?\n\nInterval variables are as below:\n\n* Age - Age of the customer\n* Experience - Years of experience\n* Income - Annual income in dollars\n* CCAvg - Average credit card spending\n* Mortage - Value of House Mortgage\n\nOrdinal Categorical Variables are:\n* Family - Family size of the customer\n* Education - education level of the customer\n\nThe nominal variable is :\n\n* ID\n* Zip Code","b1e1234d":"### Random Forest classifier","358f6895":"* **Age** feature is normally distributed with majority of customers falling between 30 years and 60 years of age. We can confirm this by looking at the `describe` statement above, which shows **mean** is almost equal to **median**\n* **Experience** is normally distributed with more customer having experience starting from 8 years. Here the **mean** is equal to **median**. There are negative values in the **Experience**. This could be a data input error as in general it is not possible to measure negative years of experience. We can delete these values, because we have 3 or 4 records from the sample.\n* **Income** is positively skewed. Majority of the customers have income between 45K and 55K. We can confirm this by saying the **mean** is greater than the **median**\n* **CCAvg** is also a positively skewed variable and average spending is between 0K to 10K and majority spends less than 2.5K\n* **Mortgage**  70% of the individuals have a mortgage of less than 40K. However the max value is 635K\n* The variables family and education are ordinal variables. The distribution of families is evenly distributes"}}
