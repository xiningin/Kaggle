We'll create a model that predicts crop yields for apples and oranges (*target variables*) by looking at the average temperature, rainfall and humidity (*input variables or features*) in a region. Here's the training data:\n\n![linear-regression-training-data](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6Ujttb4.png)\n\nIn a linear regression model, each target variable is estimated to be a weighted sum of the input variables, offset by some constant, known as a bias\u00c2\u00a0:\n\n```\nyield_apple  = w11 * temp + w12 * rainfall + w13 * humidity + b1\nyield_orange = w21 * temp + w22 * rainfall + w23 * humidity + b2\n```\n\nVisually, it means that the yield of apples is a linear or planar function of temperature, rainfall and humidity:\n\n![linear-regression-graph](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4DJ9f8X.png)\n\nThe *learning* part of linear regression is to figure out a set of weights `w11, w12,... w23, b1 & b2` by looking at the training data, to make accurate predictions for new data (i.e. to predict the yields for apples and oranges in a new region using the average temperature, rainfall and humidity). This is done by adjusting the weights slightly many times to make better predictions, using an optimization technique called *gradient descent*.","1847558b":"## Commit and update the notebook\n\nAs a final step, we can record a new version of the notebook using the `jovian` library.","192ad69d":"`@` represents matrix multiplication in PyTorch, and the\u00c2\u00a0`.t` method returns the transpose of a tensor.\n\nThe matrix obtained by passing the input data into the model is a set of predictions for the target variables.","7081cd40":"## Linear regression model from\u00c2\u00a0scratch\n\nThe weights and biases (`w11, w12,... w23, b1 & b2`) can also be represented as matrices, initialized as random values.

If we plot a graph of the loss w.r.t any individual weight or bias element, it will look like the figure shown below. A key insight from calculus is that the gradient indicates the rate of change of the loss, or the [slope](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slope) of the loss function w.r.t. the weights and biases.\n\nIf a gradient element is **positive**:\n* **increasing** the element's value slightly will **increase** the loss.\n* **decreasing** the element's value slightly will **decrease** the loss\n\n![postive-gradient](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hFYoVgU.png)\n\nIf a gradient element is **negative**:\n* **increasing** the element's value slightly will **decrease** the loss.\n* **decreasing** the element's value slightly will **increase** the loss.\n\n![negative=gradient](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/w3Wii7C.png)\n\nThe increase or decrease in loss by changing a weight element is proportional to the value of the gradient of the loss w.r.t. that element.

Also, we've created numpy arrays, because this is typically how you would work with training data: read some CSV files as numpy arrays, do some processing, and then convert them to PyTorch tensors as follows:","2fc94da7":"As you can see, the loss is now much lower than what we started out with. Let's look at the model's predictions and compare them with the targets.","9a2911d1":"Let's compute the loss for the current predictions of our model.","6221679f":"## Linear regression using PyTorch built-ins\n\nThe model and training process above were implemented using basic matrix operations. But since this such a common pattern\u00c2\u00a0, PyTorch has several built-in functions and classes to make it easy to create and train models.\n\nLet's begin by importing the `torch.nn` package from PyTorch, which contains utility classes for building neural networks.","48baf912":"## Loss Function\n\nInstead of defining a loss function manually, we can use the built-in loss function `mse_loss`.","0624cc2c":"## Optimizer\n\nInstead of manually manipulating the model's weights & biases using gradients, we can use the optimizer `optim.SGD`. SGD stands for `stochastic gradient descent`. It is called `stochastic` because samples are selected in batches (often with random shuffling) instead of as a single group.","64772b83":"With this, we complete our discussion of linear regression in PyTorch, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to move on to the next topic: *Logistic regression*.","2dc9a283":"The `nn.functional` package contains many useful loss functions and several other utilities. ","38a7fc5e":"Some things to note above:\n\n* We use the data loader defined earlier to get batches of data for every iteration.\n\n* Instead of updating parameters (weights and biases) manually, we use `opt.step` to perform the update, and `opt.zero_grad` to reset the gradients to zero.\n\n* We've also added a log statement which prints the loss from the last batch of data for every 10th epoch, to track the progress of training. `loss.item` returns the actual value stored in the loss tensor.\n\nLet's train the model for 100 epochs.","022c86bc":"`jovian.commit` uploads the notebook to [Jovian.ml](https:\/\/www.jovian.ml), captures the Python environment and creates a sharable link for the notebook. You can use this link to share your work and let anyone reproduce it easily with the `jovian clone` command.  Jovian also includes a powerful commenting interface, so you (and others) can discuss & comment on specific parts of your notebook:\n\n![commenting on jovian](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1600\/1*b4snnr_5Ve5Nyq60iDtuuw.png)","d3e3ffe7":"## nn.Linear\n\nInstead of initializing the weights & biases manually, we can define the model using the `nn.Linear` class from PyTorch, which does it automatically."}}
