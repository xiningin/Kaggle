The paper aims to provide reference for hospital pharmacists in providing patient care services, to improve patient's outcome and reduce the overall mortality, and finally to support hospital pharmacists' in making contributions to the control of COVID-19 pandemic. Hospital pharmacists providing targeted pharmaceutical care is of great significance for improving the level of drug therapy. For hospitalized patients with COVID-19, pharmaceutical care services are indispensable supplements for clinical treatment and management.\n\n**Definitive Care for the Critically Ill During a Disaster: A Framework for Optimizing Critical Care Surge Capacity From a Task Force for Mass Critical Care Summit Meeting, January 26-27, 2007, Chicago, IL (5\/31\/2008):**\n> This article suggests a target for critical care surge capacity, the duration of sustainment, what specific care EMCC should encompass, triggers, and a framework for implementation. The Working Group on Emergency Mass Critical Care in 2005 provided a strong foundation for hospitals planning to augment critical care surge capacity. 4 In response to increasing concerns regarding a serious influenza pandemic and other mass critical care events, the Task Force was assembled to provide additional detailed suggestions for many crucial EMCC issues. Also, it suggests a general approach to maximizing the availability and impact of resources during a disaster, to reduce the need for EMCC and improve the impact of EMCC if it remains necessary for the response.\n\n**Nurses' experiences of care for patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus in South Korea (7\/31\/2018):**\n> It is necessary to specifically understand the problems and demands of the healthcare providers for establishing a safe healthcare system that can respond effectively in case of future national disasters. This study identified the experiences of nurses who cared for MERS-CoV patients. Systemic improvement with a practical complement for patients and healthcare providers is expected in the future. The results could be used as fundamental data for establishing a safer healthcare system that can protect healthcare providers and patients. This study is meaningful as a probe study defining the experiences of nurses who cared for MERS-CoV patients.\n\n**Intensive care management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): challenges and recommendations (4\/6\/2020):**\n> The ICU community must brace itself for this potentially overwhelming surge of patients and optimise workflows, in advance, for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention. Hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must work with ICU practitioners to prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity.\n\n**An updated roadmap for MERS-CoV research and product development: focus on diagnostics (2\/1\/2019):**\n> Expansion of test menu options for existing POC or near-POC NAAT platforms will strengthen incountry response capacity to endemic diseases and simultaneously ensure countries are prepared for future pandemics. RDTs offer the potential for rapid POC screening for MERS-CoV; however, there are practical limits to implementing lower respiratory sample acquisition outside of a hospital setting, limiting feasibility.\n\n**Clinician perceptions of respiratory infection risk; a rationale for research into mask use in routine practice (8\/31\/2019):**\n> Minimising the transmission of respiratory disease through protective mask use leads to better outcomes for healthcare, workforce capability and economic stability. This paper has presented the background and justification for research into the attitudes and behaviour of HCWs towards protective mask use for respiratory infectious diseases during non-outbreak situations so as to optimise the use of masks when indicated in every day practice. The research can provide insight into perceptions of risk and risk-taking behaviour in respect of mask use for respiratory infectious diseases and help to bridge the gap between theory and practice (see Table 3 ). The sub-optimal use by HCWs of protective masks for respiratory diseases has a significant impact at individual, organisational, societal and global levels. Furthermore, the consequences of poor mask use will be exacerbated during a widespread outbreak or pandemic of a novel infectious respiratory disease, when pharmacological agents or vaccination are unavailable.\n\n# Resources to support skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities.\n\n**Caring for the carers: Ensuring the provision of quality maternity care during a global pandemic (4\/8\/2020):**\n> Now and over coming months, the maternity care system will face unchartered territory as doctors, midwives, nurses and allied health staff attempt to provide usual quality maternity care whilst juggling competing demands related to the COVID-19 pandemic response. Cooperation, planning ahead and thinking about the needs of maternity providers to prevent stress and burnout is essential, so that they in turn can continue to care for women and newborns whilst managing the demands of the COVID-19 response.\n\n**Hospital pharmacists' pharmaceutical care for hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Recommendations and guidance from clinical experience (4\/3\/2020):**\n> The paper aims to provide reference for hospital pharmacists in providing patient care services, to improve patient's outcome and reduce the overall mortality, and finally to support hospital pharmacists' in making contributions to the control of COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the Chinese perspective of \"centralizing COVID-19 patients and centralized inpatient treatment\", the paper established a pharmaceutical care framework of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, including participating in making evidence-based decisions for medication, monitoring and evaluation of medication safety and efficacy, strengthened care for special population and patients with combined underlying diseases, monitoring and management of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), providing emotional counselling and psychological support and providing scientific information about COVID-19 vaccines.

Hospital pharmacists providing targeted pharmaceutical care is of great significance for improving the level of drug therapy.\n\n**Telemedicine in the Time of Coronavirus (3\/31\/2020):**\n> Care of people with serious illness and their families now requires impeccable social distancing for their protection and for all healthcare professionals so critically needed in response to COVID-19. Telemedicine is a proven modality for delivering palliative care value to the most vulnerable people. Third, we must capitalize on this unprecedented time in which telemedicine will become a critical part of healthcare delivery to study processes and outcomes through programmatic evaluation and research to guide best practices in the future.\n\n# Mobilization of surge medical staff to address shortages in overwhelmed communities\n\n**Factors Influencing Emergency Nurses' Burnout During an Outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Korea (12\/31\/2016):**\n> During the outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as MERS-CoV, nursing managers need to pay attention to burnout in ED nurses, who are the first to treat patients. The outcome of this study is expected to provide basic information related to ED nurses' burnout in connection to an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as MERS-CoV and to contribute to programs and strategies for reducing burnout.\n\n**Definitive Care for the Critically Ill During a Disaster: A Framework for Optimizing Critical Care Surge Capacity From a Task Force for Mass Critical Care Summit Meeting, January 26\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27, 2007, Chicago, IL (5\/31\/2008):**\n> The Working Group on Emergency Mass Critical Care in 2005 provided a strong foundation for hospitals planning to augment critical care surge capacity. 4 In response to increasing concerns regarding a serious influenza pandemic and other mass critical care events, the Task Force was assembled to provide additional detailed suggestions for many crucial EMCC issues. This article suggests a target for critical care surge capacity, the duration of sustainment, what specific care EMCC should encompass, triggers, and a framework for implementation. Also, it suggests a general approach to maximizing the availability and impact of resources during a disaster, to reduce the need for EMCC and improve the impact of EMCC if it remains necessary for the response.\n\n**Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Community Testing Team in Scotland: A 14-day review, 6 to 20 February 2020 (3\/26\/2020):**\n> Most importantly, it was successful in avoiding a large number of resource intensive hospital admissions for testing for SARS-CoV-2 that could have put the healthcare system at risk of exposure to COVID-19. Healthcare staff should have ongoing training in these areas, including PPE use, fit testing and community experience, in order to ensure staffing resilience in response to a HCID. Our model for community testing was adopted across other health boards in Scotland, and informed national guidance on community testing. However, after further widening of the suspected cases definition, which accounted for an increase of geographical areas presenting risk for potential exposure abroad by HPS and PHE, the Lothian team witnessed a surge of referrals. One possible reason may have been the mild course of COVID-19 in a relatively large proportion of those infected, so that such people unknowingly contributed to ongoing transmission.\n\n# Age-adjusted mortality data for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with\/without other organ failure \u2013 particularly for viral etiologies\n\n**Virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, management and outcome (12\/31\/2011):**\n> ARDS is rarely a complication of lung infection due to respiratory viruses, except for the most recent pandemic H1N1-2009 and H5N1 influenza A viruses that induced severe ARDS. Specific management includes acyclovir for patients with ARDS and HSV bronchopneumonitis. HSV or CMV recovery from the lower respiratory tract does not necessarily mean viral disease, but their identification should lead to the search for true parenchymal involvement, either by cytology or virus-load determination.\n\n**Virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, management and outcome (12\/31\/2011):**\n> Apart from these pandemic viruses, respiratory viruses are rarely responsible for viral pneumonia and ARDS. Other than antiviral drug (mainly oseltamivir) administration and avoidance of corticosteroids, management of ARDS due to these viruses does not differ from that for ARDS caused by other diseases. The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be induced by viral diseases, with two virus types being responsible: respiratory viruses that cause community-acquired viral pneumonia and Herpesviridae that cause nosocomial viral pneumonia.\n\n**Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (6\/9\/2015):**\n> Two active, prospective, population-based surveillance systems were established for monitoring influenza and other respiratory pathogens among those hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness and those enrolled patients seeking consultations at sentinel general practices. The results during the first 2 years (2012-2013) provided scientific evidence to (a) support a change to NZ's vaccination policy for young children due to high influenza hospitalizations in these children; (b) contribute to the revision of the World Health Organization's case definition for severe acute respiratory illness for global influenza surveillance; and (c) contribute in part to vaccine strain selection using vaccine effectiveness assessment in the prevention of influenza-related consultations and hospitalizations.\n\n**Association of Higher MERS-CoV Virus Load with Severe Disease and Death, Saudi Arabia, 2014 (11\/10\/2015):**\n> Results were similar for a composite severe outcome (death and\/or intensive care unit admission). We evaluated whether cycle threshold (C t ) values (which are inversely related to virus load) were associated with clinical severity in patients from Saudi Arabia whose nasopharyngeal specimens tested positive for this virus by real-time reverse transcription PCR.\n\n# Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) outcomes data of COVID-19 patients\n\n**Comparison of Hospitalized Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Caused by COVID-19 and H1N1 (3\/26\/2020):**\n> The EOLIA trial provided information about the posterior probability of a mortality benefit for patients with acute respiratory failure , especially in terms of reporting the success of the application of ECMO in ARDS patients with influenza. We found that PaO 2 \/FiO 2 levels in COVID-19 patients were higher than those in H1N1 patients, such that respiratory support in COVID-19 patients was initially via non-invasive methods and ultimately yielded higher failure rates.\n\n**Influenza-associated pneumonia as reference to assess seriousness of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (3\/19\/2020):**\n> The rate of ARDS and of patients requiring ventilation was markedly higher among COVID-19 patients with much longer duration of ventilation, based in the data from one study. But severity in younger adults below 60 years and in patients without chronic preconditions appears to be higher in COVID-19 patients than in pneumonia patients usually seen during the influenza season. During the influenza pandemic 2009 however, specialised German hospitals reported similarly long ventilation duration times [17] . illnesses [16] .\n\n**A Multicentre Study of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outcomes of Cancer Patients in Wuhan, China (3\/26\/2020):**\n> This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. In this study, we reported the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Both patients within the follow-up phase and ongoing anticancer treatment phase were at the risk of COVID-19. We should pay more intensive attention to cancer patients, especially those with common risk factors of COVID-19. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase.\n\n**Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study (2\/24\/2020):**\n> In conclusion, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is high. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain to hospital critical care resources, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced. The survival term of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n# Outcomes data for COVID-19 after mechanical ventilation adjusted for age.\n\n**Systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 infection (3\/27\/2020):**\n> Three models predicted the risk of hospital admission for COVID-19 pneumonia for individuals in the general population, but used admission due to non-tuberculosis pneumonia, influenza, acute bronchitis, or upper respiratory infections as outcomes in a dataset without any COVID-19 cases (see Table 1 ). The study estimated Cindices of 0.73, 0.81 and 0.81 for the three models. 8 Among the predictors were age, sex, previous hospital admissions, comorbidity data, and social determinants of health.\n\n**Association of Higher MERS-CoV Virus Load with Severe Disease and Death, Saudi Arabia, 2014 (11\/10\/2015):**\n> Results were similar for a composite severe outcome (death and\/or intensive care unit admission). Among 102 patients, median C t of 31.0 for the upstream of the E gene target for (40%) patients who died was significantly lower than the median of 33.0 for survivors (p = 0.0087).\n\n# Application of regulatory standards (e.g., EUA, CLIA) and ability to adapt care to crisis standards of care level.\n\n**Intensive Care Unit Preparedness During Pandemics and Other Biological Threats (10\/31\/2019):**\n> Engagement of community partners is necessary to permit adequate data collection, to develop ethical standards for resource allocation, and to manage anxiety and expectations among the public. The risks of pandemic disease to clinical staff requires that institutions have mechanisms to protect their personnel while also providing adequate care to affected patients. Pandemics and epidemics are unique challenges for ICU preparedness. In a highly mobile, globalized world, infectious disease is no longer confined to fixed geographic regions.\n\n# Best telemedicine practices, barriers and faciitators, and specific actions to remove\/expand them within and across state boundaries.\n\n**Web-based electronic patient records for collaborative medical applications (4\/30\/2005):**\n> This paper also gives a new approach to create and manage image-based EPR from actual patient records, and also presents a novel method to use web technology and DICOM standard to build an open architecture for collaborative medical applications. The New web-based EPR system provides new method to enhance the value of interactive and collaborative studying of EPR for difficult cases, especially for SARS diagnosis. The system can be used for both intranet and Internet medical applications such as tele-diagnosis, teleconsultation, and distant learning. The on-time interactive communication features of the system can manipulate EPR objects which, in turn, can improve the efficiency and the quality of collaborative healthcare.\n\n# Guidance on the simple things people can do at home to take care of sick people and manage disease.\n\n**Recommendations and guidance for providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic: A China perspective (3\/26\/2020):**\n> Psychological support- The outbreak of COVID-19 and the sudden change of routine daily life, together with the fear or concern of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 from anyone at anytime may lead to emotional problems in some community patients. Additionally, to promote patient's mental health during the pandemic, pharmacists shall aid the community patient population to understand the COVID-19 pandemic situation properly, and adjust their psychological state and recognition to view things from positive perspectives.\n\n# Oral medications that might potentially work.\n\n**Potential inhibitors for 2019-nCoV coronavirus M protease from clinically approved medicines (1\/29\/2020):**\n> With the hope to identify candidate drugs for 2019-nCoV, we adopted a computational approach to screen for available commercial medicines which may function as inhibitors for the M pro of 2019-nCoV. To present, these are still no clinically approved antibodies or drugs specific for coronaviruses, which makes it more difficult for curing 2019-nCoV caused diseases and controlling the associated pandemic.\n\n# Use of AI in real-time health care delivery to evaluate interventions, risk factors, and outcomes in a way that could not be done manually.\n\n**An emergency medical services transfer authorization center in response to the Toronto severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak (6\/30\/2004):**\n> This report describes the innovative EMS command, control, and tracking system established to mitigate the risk of iatrogenic spread of SARS among health care facilities, health care workers, and patients in Ontario as a result of interfacility patient transfers. In addition to risk mitigation, this type of center could also be capable of providing syndromic surveillance in real-time and provide the earliest indication of a potential threat to public health. Rapid establishment of an EMS-based command, control, and tracking center is possible in the setting of a public health emergency.\n\n\n# Efforts to define the natural history of disease to inform clinical care, public health interventions, infection prevention control, transmission, and clinical trials\n\n**An evidence-based framework for priority clinical research questions for COVID-19 (3\/31\/2020):**\n> If health care facilities around the world collect standardised patient data and quickly share it, it is likely that these core clinical research questions can be answered in real-time to inform clinical practices for COVID-19. Based on a 2018 systematic review of SARS and MERS common clinical research questions, we provide a summary of the state of current clinical knowledge for the COVID-19, demonstrate what clinical research gaps still need to be filled, and provide recommendations on study designs. Thanks to lessons learned from SARS and MERS, the international public health and research community has been able to rapidly respond to the emergence of this novel coronavirus. Many of the identified gaps, such as viral pathogenesis, clinical characterisation, infection prevention, and candidate therapeutics overlap with gaps identified the WHO' s R&D Blueprint research roadmap.\n\n**The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak (2\/26\/2020):**\n> Future directions to control the spread of the disease Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 are required to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. China and other countries including the US have implemented major prevention and control measures including travel screenings to control further spread of the virus. Epidemiological changes in COVID-19 infection should be monitored taking into account potential routes of transmission and subclinical infections, in addition to the adaptation, evolution, and virus spread among humans and possible intermediate animals and reservoirs.\n\n# Efforts to develop a core clinical outcome set to maximize usability of data across a range of trials\n\n**Collecting Data To Assess SARS Interventions (7\/10\/2004):**\n> The emergence of a novel disease like SARS, which requires a global public health response to contain its spread, has illustrated the need for collecting effectiveness data in a uniform manner. The minimum dataset proposed here provides a basis for standardizing the collection of data from various geographic locations, thereby facilitating the analysis of SARS interventions. Given the potential for a large variation in location-specific circumstances, producing a single questionnaire that would be entirely suitable for all locales would be difficult. The tables present a standardized protocol and approach for ensuring that all the proposed data have been collected.\n","11bdeeb5":"# Load the Input JSON & metadata.csv from kaggle input directory"}}
