Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, however, use neural networks for a very different purpose: Generative modeling\n\n> Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. - [Source](https:\/\/machinelearningmastery.com\/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans\/)\n\nTo get a sense of the power of generative models, just visit [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https:\/\/thispersondoesnotexist.com).

The generator generates a \"fake\" sample given a random vector\/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is \"real\" (picked from the training data) or \"fake\" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs. \n\nGANs however, can be notoriously difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization.
