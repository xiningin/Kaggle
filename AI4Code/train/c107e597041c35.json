Moreover, ALS PBMCs showed a significant decrease in critical metabolic genes and a diminishment in mitochondrial biogenesis and content. These findings seem to occur in parallel to an increase in mitochondrial fission and autophagy-related gene expression, despite a reduction in mitochondrial degradation signaling. Accordingly, ALS cells present a decrease in energy-producing metabolic compounds, such as ATP production and pyruvate, corroborating the fact that mitochondrial deregulation can lead to an energetic deficiency in peripheral cells as an ultimate consequence of the disorder. Thus, mitochondrial function evaluation in PBMCs could be a valuable strategy to detect ALS, as well as to assess its progression and therapy efficacy.\"\n\n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Depolarized Mitochondria and Disturbances in Calcium Handling in ALS PBMCs<\/span>**\n\n\"Considering the importance of mitochondria function in keeping calcium handling, and because modifications in the transport of electron and the proton motive force can interfere with ATP production, we evaluated the cytosolic Ca2+ level in PBMCs from ALS and control subjects. As the authors can notice, there is a significant reduction in the Fluo-4 fluorescence in the ALS group, suggesting a decrease in cytosolic calcium in the patient\u2019s cells.

They used a two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis approach to identify in easily accessible clinical samples, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), a panel of protein biomarkers that are closely associated with ALS. Validations and a longitudinal study were performed by immunoassays on a selected number of proteins. The same proteins were also measured in PBMC and spinal cord of a G93A SOD1 transgenic rat model.\" \n\n\"The authors identified combinations of protein biomarkers that can distinguish, with high discriminatory power, ALS patients from healthy controls (98%), and from patients with neurological disorders that may resemble ALS (91%), between two levels of disease severity (90%), and a number of translational biomarkers, that link responses between human and animal model. They demonstrated that TDP-43, cyclophilin A and ERp57 associate with disease progression in a longitudinal study. Moreover, the protein profile changes detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ALS patients are suggestive of possible intracellular pathogenic mechanisms such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, nitrative stress, disturbances in redox regulation and RNA processing. Their results indicate that PBMC multiprotein biomarkers could contribute to determine amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis, differential diagnosis, disease severity and progression, and may help to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/51716609_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis_Multiprotein_Biomarkers_in_Peripheral_Blood_Mononuclear_Cells","a8fd3f02":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">RNA-Seq profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and controls<\/h1>\n\nCitation: Zucca, S., Gagliardi, S., Pandini, C. et al.

In that work, the authors present a dataset obtained via Illumina RNA-seq analysis on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from sporadic and mutated ALS patients (mutations in FUS, TARDBP, SOD1 and VCP genes) and healthy controls. That dataset allows the whole-transcriptome characterization of PBMCs content, both in terms of coding and non-coding RNAs, in order to compare the disease state to the healthy controls, both for sporadic patients and for mutated patients. Their dataset is a starting point for the omni-comprehensive analysis of coding and lncRNAs, from an easy to withdraw, manage and store tissue that shows to be a suitable model for RNA profiling in ALS.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/sdata20196","54a50f24":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% \/ 10% 40%\">Human Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) PBMCs<\/h1>\n\nPeripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) are a subset of leukocytes (or White Blood Cell, WBC), which are integral components of the body\u2019s immune system that fight disease.

As observed, there is a significant decrease in ATP levels in PBMCs from ALS patients compared with control individuals; no modification is observed regarding ADP levels. As they can notice, the pyruvate level significantly dropped in ALS PBMCs, while the level of lactate is significantly elevated. This outcome suggests that pyruvate may be converted into lactate to produce energy since ATP synthesis, once oxidative phosphorylation might be jeopardized because of mitochondrial deregulation.\"\n\n\"Due to the increased ROS (Reactive oxygen species) level in ALS PBMCs, they decided to investigate NFE2L2 expression, which is implicated in cellular detoxifying systems. They observed a large diminishment in NFE2L2 expression (more than 50%) in ALS cells. The increased levels of ROS (Reactive oxygen species) could have been related to a failure of NFE2L2 in translocating to the nucleus, reducing the transcription of secondary factors of the antioxidant cascade. Interestingly, in previous work with PBMCs, the expression of NFE2L2 had no changes in relation to controls, but ALS patients were 10 years older than in their study, which could indicate a time-dependent NFE2L2 expression. In agreement with their outcome, the expression of NFE2L2 was declined in humans with ALS and in the SOD1-G93A model. Of importance, NFE2L2 overexpression was associated with more prolonged survival and neuroprotection in the SOD1-G93A mouse model.\"\n\n\"Their results indicate that PBMCs from ALS patients present a significant mitochondrial dysfunction that could be used as a powerful tool in investigating ALS disclosure and improvement. Importantly, the usage of PBMCs in biomarker research was already validated, and our findings can further contribute to future findings concerning new pharmacological strategies against ALS.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12035-020-02059-1"}}
