It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas.\n\n_Functionalities of Seaborn_ :\n\n- Dataset oriented API\n- Analysing univariate and bivariate distributions\n- Automatic estimation and plotting of  linear regression models\n- Convenient views for complex datasets\n- Concise control over style\n- Colour palettes\n","6846503f":"For analysing how a numeric variable changes across several categories of a categorical variable you utilise either a pie chart or a box plot","3324af95":"- They're pretty useful in regression problems to check whether a linear trend exists in the data or not. For example, in the image below, creating a linear model in the first case makes far more sense since a clear straight line trend is visible.","721f30da":"![Bins change](images\\Granular.png)","aa13d65f":"![Distplot](images\\Distplot.png)","784d6bf2":"![Scatter-Clusters](images\\Clusters.png)","be2747c3":"**Bar Charts Revisited**","1331b8d0":"### Histograms\n\nHistograms can also be used in conjuction with boxplots for data cleaning and data handling purposes. You can use it to check the spread of a numeric variable. Histograms generally work by bucketing the entire range of values that a particular variable takes to specific __bins__. After that, it uses vertical bars to denote the total number of records in a specific bin, which is also known as its __frequency__.\n","2699b5e7":"- A line plot tries to observe trends using time dependent data.\n-  For this part, you'll be using **pd.to_datetime()** function.

They are pretty crucial in revealing relationships between the data points and you can generally deduce some sort of trends in the data with the help of a scatter plot. ","730d71ba":"A distribution plot is pretty similar to the histogram functionality in matplotlib. Instead of a frequency plot, it plots an approximate probability density for that rating bucket. And the curve (or the __KDE__) that gets drawn over the distribution is the approximate probability density curve. \n\nThe following is an example of a distribution plot. Notice that now instead of frequency on the left axis, it has the density for each bin or bucket.","243cf46a":"**Pair Plots**","ecc05730":"Handling missing values for rating\n - Ratings is the target variable\n - drop the records","6b29dc6d":"### Data Handling and Cleaning","15270a65":" - When you have several numeric variables, making multiple scatter plots becomes rather tedious.
