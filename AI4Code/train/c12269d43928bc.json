INTRODUCTION**\n\nIn this competition, the objective was to forecast which clients would make a specific transfer in the future. The data given was composed of 200.000 rows and 200 anonymized features.\n\nThe evaluation metric was ROC-AUC. In case you are not familliar with it, check it [here](https:\/\/medium.com\/greyatom\/lets-learn-about-auc-roc-curve-4a94b4d88152).\n\n**Context**:\nThis competition broke Kaggle's previous competitors record (around 6000), and became the most disputed competition ever in this platform, with over 9000 competitors. For many weeks, almost no team could surpass the 0.901 score barrier. So everyone started to look for the \"magic\".\n\n### **2. WHAT DIDN'T WORK**\n\nMany teams tried to explore the data in every possible way: Features operations (+,-,*,\/,log,tanh,etc), distribution, probability, time series, target encoding, data rotation, genetic programming, oversampling, undersampling, different models....you get it. Absolutely nothing worked\n\nAfter 2 weeks trying everything, I got tired of working hard and decided to work smart, so this happened: I broke the 0.901 barrier.\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/fmellomascarenhas\/Kaggle\/master\/Santander%20-%202019%20-%2074th%20place\/pictures\/0.902_score.png)\n\n### **3. WHAT WORKED**\n\n**WARNING:** Before you proceed, you should know that **the scores you will see won't match the ones described**. That's because I used a simple train_test_split to speed up this kernel, instead of kfolds.\n\n### **3.1. CV 0.902 - MAGIC IN 4 LINES**\n\nWhen I decided to work smart, I re-read relevant topics and kernels in this competition and made a list about the dos and donts expressed by other competitors (as you can see below). [Making a kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/felipemello\/why-your-model-is-overfitting-not-making-progress) about my own failed experiments helped me realize why they were not working.\n\n**At this point, what did I know?**\n\n1) Regular transformations wouldn't work (many topics shared failed experiments). \n\n2) [The test dataset had fake data](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/yag320\/list-of-fake-samples-and-public-private-lb-split), and that was relevant.\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/fmellomascarenhas\/Kaggle\/master\/Santander%20-%202019%20-%2074th%20place\/pictures\/kernel_comment_1.png)\n\n3) That [unique values](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/triplex\/more-unique-values-in-train-set-than-test-set) were, somehow, important.\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/fmellomascarenhas\/Kaggle\/master\/Santander%20-%202019%20-%2074th%20place\/pictures\/kernel_comment_2.png)\n\nSo I decided to experiment with both of these ideas: I merged the train and test datataset without fake values, created new columns for each variable with the number of unique values in it, and trained my model. That was enough to break the 0.901. You can see this simples procedure below.\n","69a997ce":"For 2 weeks I worked hard and didn't improve my score. For 4 days I worked smart, and got LB 0.920 (74th out of 9000+). \n\nThe main purpose of this kernel is to share the thinking process that led me to this LB score, at the same time that you can have fun visualizing the data.\n","047a96f6":"#### **3.4. OPTIMIZING PARAMETERS - CV 0.920**\n\nSince my model now only took a couple of minutes to train, it became really easy to test hundreds of parameters. You can check a great kernel about Bayesian Optimization [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/fayzur\/lgb-bayesian-parameters-finding-rank-average).\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/fmfn\/BayesianOptimization\/master\/examples\/func.png)\n\nJust leaving the algorithm working there for 3 hours was enough to score 0.920LB on the last day of competition. If I had more hours to work with it, probably my score would have improved substantially.\n\n**Tips:** The number of iterations on the LGB was found to be really important. You can't just leave a high number of iterations and set your model to do an early stop if the score doesn't improve.\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/fmellomascarenhas\/Kaggle\/master\/Santander%20-%202019%20-%2074th%20place\/pictures\/920_score.png)\n\nThose were my final parameters (click on the **code** button ->):","c9930778":"How cool is that? Couldn't figure out why this happens. If you have any hypothesis, let me know.","b4ae972e":"### **5. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DONE, IF I HAD MORE TIME**\n\n#### **5.1. EXPLORE THE BIMODAL DISTRIBUTIONS**\n\nProbabily trying to show to LGB that there is a bimodal distribution would be useless, because it already sees it. Take a look at the plot below of the variable 81.","6da2b371":"### **4. LOOKING AT THE DATA: WHAT IS ODD ABOUT THE UNIQUE VALUES?**\n\n**EDIT: I didn't know that  bimodal distribution is a natural phenomena of normal distributions. Thanks @cdeotte and @triplex for pointing that out. I will still leave the plots there, because even though it is a natural phenomena, it is a cool one.**\n\nWhen I looked at the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of our variables, I discovered a clear bimodal distribution that exists among values that do not repeat. As those values start repeating more, the distribution changes, and it is really interesting to see.\n\nTo show that to you, first I will need to group some values.\n\n### **4.1. GROUPING VALUES**\n\nSome variables, like var_12 and var_68, have many frequency groups. Some of these groups are really small, and can have less than 100 samples. Take a look and compare the PDFs of frequency groups in var_12 and var_81:","6e6dd85d":"### **3.2. CV 0.909 - SETTING FEATURE FRACTION TO 1**\n\nFeature fraction is a [parameter of the LGB model](https:\/\/lightgbm.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/Parameters.html). It goes from 0 to 1 and represents the percentage of the data that you will use on each iteration of the traning. My feature fraction was 0.3. When I set it to 1, the model was able to look at all the variables at once, and voil\u00e1: CV 0.909! \n\n**TIP**: Setting feature fraction to 1 is a great way to understand the impact of a new feature in your model.\n\n![](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/fmellomascarenhas\/Kaggle\/master\/Santander%20-%202019%20-%2074th%20place\/pictures\/909_score.png)\n\n\n### **3.3. CV 0.913 - MAKING MY JOB EASIER**\n\nAt this point, I had a problem to solve: Each new feature about values frequency only mattered for one other specific feature. My model, however, was checking all possible interactions between my 400 features and taking a **long time to run**. \n\nThis [kernel](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/ymatioun\/santander-model-one-feature-at-a-time) was the perfect solution, when it proved that it was possible to train the model on each one of the variables separately and still achieve the same LB score. \n\nSo I decided train my model with 2 features at a time: The original one and an extra column with the unique values count.\n\n**RESULT: Less than 2 minutes to train my whole model (as opposed to over an hour) and CV of 0.913. Working smart was the way to go.**","c25e9f7b":"You could try to optimize those weights in some other way. A good option, for example, would be to use the bayesian optimizer.\n\nIf you want to use the weights, make sure that they are not overfitting your results. The best way is to use stratified k folds, and then apply the weights. Below is an example on how to test them before submiting.","957509a5":"Not all features are like that though. Take a look at the feature 117 and 120.","c6531ecd":"For each one of the frequencys, the LGB is already going to make splits, figure out that there is a bimodal distribution and check the probabilities of being target = 1 or target = 0. If you are confused about it or if your don't believe me, check my kernel [Why your model is overfitting\/not making progress](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/felipemello\/why-your-model-is-overfitting-not-making-progress)\n\n**Besides that**, with a simple linear transformation, we could supperpose two distributions, making them more readable to our human eyes. Take a look at var_81 and var_126 before and after we transform var_126.","d7878ec1":"#### **3.5. GIVING WEIGHTS TO EACH FEATURE'S RESULT - CV 0.922**\n\nSince we were training the model on each feature, maybe one matered more than other, but how could our model find it? To solve that, before we calculated the AUC score, we decided to give to each column a weight, based on their individual AUC score. That raised my score in 0.002.","8e06fbda":"To avoid working with such small groups and risk overfitting, we will say that each group has to have at least 2000 samples in the test + train datasets in total.","57888832":"### **4.2. BIMODAL DISTRIBUTIONS**.\n\nNow that we are done with grouping, check the bimodals distributions below. They show the PDFs of the 6 first frequency groups of each variable. Example: Graph 1: All values that are unique \/ Graph 2: All values that repeat only twitce \/ Graph 3: .... \/ etc.","d5c78f51":"Isn't this so interesting? But, again, scalling values won't affect the way that LGB sees the model. This transformation just makes it more pleasent to our eyes. \n\n**Note:** If you wanna do it yourself, just get the ratio of the distances between the peaks of the distributions, multiply one of the distributions by this ratio and subtract the differente between peaks of distribution 1 and 2.\n\n#### **5.2. OPTIMIZE THE LGB PARAMETERS FOR EACH VARIABLE**\n\nSince we have 200 different models, instead of having one set of parameters for all variables, we could pick  a specific set of parameters that works best for them.\n\nI tried doing it, and saw my AUC falling back to 0.900. I am not sure why. Maybe its overfitting? I don't know if it is possible to do that, but if it is, I bet it could substantially increase the score.\n\n#### **5.3. OTHER STUFF**\n\n- Create NN to do ensembling;\n- Try to use pure probability, instead of the LGB, as it was done in [this](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/cdeotte\/modified-naive-bayes-santander-0-899) kernel. Another competitor reported a 0.922 LB score using this technic and a gold medal;\n- Applied augumentation, as described [here](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/jiweiliu\/lgb-2-leaves-augment).\n\nHowever, there is only so much you can do in 4 days.\n\n\n### 6. SUMMARY\n\nThank you for your attention. I hope you had fun. In this kernel we saw that:\n- Smart work is better than hard work. It is faster and produces better results;\n- If you think rationally about things, understand your model and your data, you can quickly improve your results;\n- There is a lot more to explore in the data;\n\n**If you liked the kernel, please, consider upvoting. It is the way to best reward the hours I put making this kernel. Thanks :)**\n\n### MY FINAL RUN WITH 4 FOLDS"}}
