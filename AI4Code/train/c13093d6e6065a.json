Maybe our solar system is targeted for some reason, or perhaps we just happen to get in the way. If such a signal was ever received, maybe at the time it was sent, the Pyramids of Giza were being built, or maybe Velociraptors were roaming the Earth. Who knows the distances such a message would have transversed.\n\nRecall that electromagnetic radiation is caused by the acceleration of charged particles. Once the alien signal reached the earth, this electromagnetic radiation would repay the favour by in turn causing the oscillation of the charged particles wandering through the metallic structure of the Earth's radio telescopes. This incredibley subtle voltage oscillation is measured, decomposed via **Fourier analysis** (whereby a complex signal that is made up of several sinusoidal signals can be broken down into its constituent signals), and recorded.\n\nSETI use the [Allen Telescope Array (ATA)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Allen_Telescope_Array) in San Francisco to scan the sky for signals. Specifically, [narrow-band](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Narrowband) [carrier waves](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carrier_wave). These 42 dishes, each 6 meters in diameter, are all pointed together at various candidate objects.

The message, made up of 1,679 binary digits (1,679 being the product of 23 and 73, each a prime number) conveyed information about DNA, the solar system, the human form and the Arecibo telescope itself. Aimed at star cluster M13, it will take 50,000 years for us to get a reply (if there is anyone listening and they fancy a chat).\n\nTaking the binary signal from Wikipedia, let's take a look at the message,","aa67ebad":"The SETI folk over on the GitHub pages take the log of the spectrogram, which gives a better spread,","e33165f4":"There are in total 7 different classes of signals simulated by SETI.

For the participants in that challenge, they had a basic dataset (4 signal categories and well-defined signals), plus small, medium and full 'primary' datasets (7 signal categories, less-well-defined signals). This kernel uses the small primary dataset.\n\nThis kernel takes a look at the SETI data, focussing on the raw data stored in the **primary_small_v3\/** folder. Note that the **primary_small\/** folder contains the data converted into PNG files and broken down into training, validation and testing folders.","e5fd2555":"There's the curved line!","e9a95d7e":"Once you have your PNGs, get them into train, valididation and test folders (already done in this kaggle dataset) to then apply some deep learning.
