The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields \u2013 economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more \u2013 describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. <\/p>\n\n### Content\n\nThe happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors \u2013 economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity \u2013 contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world\u2019s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.\n","f62e752a":"> **Luxembourg has the highes GDP per capita at 11.647.**","4ccd3faf":"> **Sub-Saharan Africa seems to have very low healty life expectancy.**","1b1cd62a":"### Generosity and Perceptions of corruption","9d3bb926":"**Importing the Libraries**","460eb697":"- **There are a lot of corrupt countries compared with less corrupt ones.**\n- **Central and Eastern Europe seems to be mostly corrupt.**\n- **Most countries seem to fall on the negative side in terms of Generosity.**","d35b3337":"### Social Support","d95a2a48":"### **Ladder Score :** \nThe rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey.

They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.","8ed789c0":"> **Iceland again at top and Afghanistan again at bottom**.","6f027b63":"> **Findand has the highest and Afghanistan has the lowest score.**","76d3dad9":"### Showing the correlation between columns"}}
