The added elements provide the steel with ductility and strength. During the smelting process, other elements, such as aluminum is added to the steel making it an alloy steel. Alloy steels have enhanced properties due to the larger proportion of elements such as manganese and silicon present in carbon steels. Non-alloy steel has no elements added to the steel as it is smelted.\n\n**SEMI-FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS (SEMIS):**\n\nIntermediate solid steel products obtained by Hot rolling\/Forging of ingots (in conventional process) or by Continuous casting of liquid steel are known as Semis. These are called so since they are intended for further rolling\/forging to produce finished steel products. Semi-finished casting products are intermediate castings produced in a steel mill that need further processing before being a finished good. There are four types: ingots, blooms, billets, and slabs. \n\n![SEMIS](https:\/\/media.springernature.com\/original\/springer-static\/image\/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-1-4614-1945-7_24\/MediaObjects\/271092_1_En_24_Fig3_HTML.gif)\n\n\n\nSource: https:\/\/media.springernature.com\/original\/springer-static\/image\/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-1-4614-1945-7_24\/MediaObjects\/271092_1_En_24_Fig3_HTML.gif\n\n\n*FINISHED STEEL:*\n\nThese are products obtained upon hot rolling\/forging of semi-finished steel (blooms\/billets\/slabs).

The group makes heavy long products, light long products and wire-drawn products.\n\n***Flat products***\nA type that is produced by rolls with smooth surfaces and ranges of dimension, varying in thickness.

Between FY2013-FY2017, alloy steel production has seen a growth of 9.6 per cent driven by the automobile, defence, power industry, and heavy engineering sectors.\n> \n> Non-alloyed steel accounts for 92.7 per cent of finished steel manufactured in India at 107.4 MT.

It is fundamental to the growth of any nation as it forms the backbone of industrialization. The demand for steel comes primarily from the infrastructure, automobile, and consumer durables industry and the fortunes of steel is highly correlated with these user industries. Steel production in India began with the setting up of Tata Iron & Steel Company (TISCO - now Tata Steel) in1907. In 1947, India had a fledgling private steel industry with only 3 significant steel companies with a total capacity of 1.0 MT.\n> \n> The Indian Steel Industry currently accounts for 2.0 per cent of India\u2019s GDP and employs around 2.5 million people. The low cost of labour and availability of coal and iron ore make India a competitive producer of the metal.India is the 3rd largest producer of steel at 104.8 MT in 2017 and is poised to overtake Japan to become the 2 nd largest manufacturer in 2018 backed by the robust economic activity in the country.\n> \n> India also ranks 4th in steel production capacity in the world and is the 3rd largest consumer of the metal after China and the United States.\n\n> **Industry Structure**\n\n> The industry in India is classified based on the nature of the manufacturing companies into Integrated Steel Producers (ISP) and Secondary Producers. \n> Integrated Steel Producers are companies that are present throughout the steel value chain - starting from the extraction of Iron Ore to the manufacturing and marketing of finished steel. The Integrated Steel Producers account for 43.0 per cent of steel production in India. The largest integrated steel players in India include Steel Authority of India, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (Vizag Steel), Tata Steel, JSW Steel & Power, JSW Steel, Electrosteel and Essar Steel. Other major\n> players include Jindal Stainless Steel and Jindal Stainless Steel (Hisar) Secondary Producers are generally smaller manufacturers who manufacture steel from sponge iron and scrap. The secondary manufacturers manufacture steel using Mini Blast Furnace, Electric Arc Furnace and Induction Furnace units. The share of secondary producers has been steadily rising in\n> India and in 2011-2012 secondary producers accounted for ~68.0 per cent of steel production in India. \n> \n> In the aftermath of the coal scam in 2012-2013, the ISPs could better cope with the economic uncertainty and saw a growth of 41.0 per cent in production as against secondary producers\u2019 who saw production decline by 11.4 per cent in the corresponding period.\n\n\nSource: https:\/\/rbsa.in\/archives_of_research_reports\/RBSA_Indian_Steel_Industry_Analysis.pdf\n\nI will be using the above report as a reference to explore the data that is available to see to see if there is a change in trend of Steel Industry post the coam scal in 2012-2013. Other claims will also be validated depending on the granularity of the data.\n\nThe kernel will only have data exploration.
