However, We do have the flexibility of not removing the outliers if it suits the business needs or a lot of countries are getting removed. Hence, all we need to do is find the outliers in the dataset, and then choose whether to keep them or remove them depending on the results We get.\n\n\n- Hierarchical clustering(both single and complete linkage) on this dataset to create the clusters. \n\n\n- Analyse the clusters and identify the ones which are in dire need of aid. We can analyse the clusters by comparing how these three variables - [**gdpp, child_mort and income**] vary for each cluster of countries to recognise and differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of under-developed countries.\n\n\n- Also, We need to perform visualisations on the clusters that have been formed.  We can do this by choosing any two of the three variables mentioned above on the X-Y axes and plotting a scatter plot of all the countries and differentiating the clusters. Make sure We create visualisations for all the three pairs. We can also choose other types of plots like boxplots, etc. \n\n\n- Hierarchical may give different results because of previous analysis (whether We chose to keep or remove the outliers, how many clusters We chose,  etc.) Hence, there might be some subjectivity in the final number of countries that We think should be reported back to the CEO since they depend upon the preceding analysis as well.
