How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?\nTrip Duration is very dependendable on the age of the member, I havent expected the=at much dependency. On the other hand Start station and end station does not much determine the trip duration. It only suggests that some starting stations are having higher trip durations as starting point and some end stations are having higher trip durations as ending point.\n\n### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?\nI have expected that categorial variable's like user type and gender values having higher value to be having higher trip duration but it is the other way round like for gender, value of male members is very high but the percentage of female members to take longer trips is higher.","a34ee143":"Here we are seeing a jump in duration for others at an older age (around 60 years).

But there is slight tilt to higher age for subscribers having better trip duration.\n\n### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?\nA second peak for other gender at an older is a surprise.","a85e0013":"\n### What is the structure of your dataset?\nThere are 183412 fordgobike trips in the dataset with 16 specifications (duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip). Out of 16 specifications 9 are numerical, 2 are datetime, 4 are object type and 1 is boolean type.\n\n### What is\/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?\nI'm most interested in figuring out how trip duration is dependent on other specifications from the dataset. \n\n### What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?\nI expect that trip duration is highly dependent on the start stations and end stations, more crowded places should receive more rides so some stations should be logging more duration sec. I also think user_type, birthyear and gender should also effect trip duration. \n","f09a2080":"## Bivariate Exploration","bbf3368a":"We can see that same stations are more frequent as start stations and end stations.","cbef6d5f":"Trip duration is mostly concentrated on the lower spectrum.

Were there any unusual points? Did you need to perform any transformations?\nThe trip duration takes a large amount of values and is concentrated to a tail so I looked at it in log transform and found that peak occurs at 600 seconds starting from 0 and then distribution starts to dip and does not regain any more peak value.\n\n### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?\nBirth year is converted by substracting the year from current year so this gives us a distibution for age, this action is performed as age gives a better better perception regarding trip duration dependency. Also start station and end station is plotted in a larger plot because it gives a better insight regarding traffic of bikes at certain stations.\n","6e4bdc8d":"## Univariate Exploration\nI'll start by looking at the distribution of the main variable of interest: duration_sec."}}
