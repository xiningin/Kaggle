Scratch, Punch)\n- Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks\n- SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)\n- SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks\n- Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round","9c289f2e":"## Giving Credit Where Credit is Due","8045f6a6":"It looks like our winner here is Slaking with 650 total stats."}}
